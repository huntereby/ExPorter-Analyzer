10906864,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Community Engagement, Recruitment, and Retention Core D
The Community Engagement, Recruitment and Retention (CERR) Core will design, implement and
evaluate innovative and effective strategies for community engagement, recruitment, and retention of
participants in the Precision Aging Network (PAN). Using social media and evidence-based community
engagement strategies, the CERR Core will launch a campaign that will enable the recruitment of a large and
diverse cohort (Project 1, MC-Catchment, 350,000 individuals) for internet-based assessments. 100,000 of
these participants will be recruited into an expanded study that includes additional cognitive testing and survey
questions (Project 1, MC-Expanded). The CERR Core will facilitate the efforts required for the recruitment
and retention into this aspect as well. Additionally, the CERR Core will work with Project 2 to recruit and retain
participants in four geographic locations – Tucson, Baltimore, Atlanta, and Miami – for extensive in-person
assessments (Project 2, 1,620 individuals). The CERR Core will use virtual and in-person approaches to
retain a multiethnic longitudinal cohort (n = 50,000 for Project 1, MC-Longitudinal) and a diverse cohort (n =
1000 for Project 2-Longitudinal). The CERR Core will monitor and evaluate outcomes from different
approaches to optimize methods for recruiting underrepresented groups in human health studies.
The CERR Core will use culturally-optimized methods to develop a national campaign, partnering with
community advisory boards and stakeholders, to support the long-term goals of the PAN and the specific aims
of the Projects in this application. We will also increase community awareness regarding the science of
cognitive aging, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and AD-related dementias (ADRD) by engaging the community,
our partners, and the next generation of researchers including student ambassadors. In this way, the
CERR Core will contribute to the advancement of cognitive aging and dementia research by increasing
participation of under-represented populations in one of the largest U.S. cohort studies ever created."
10906867,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Cognitive Assessment and Neuroimaging Core E
The goal of Cognitive Assessment and Neuroimaging (CAN) Core E, is to provide neurological data with
cognitive assessment, MRI, and carotid ultrasound that will directly support Projects 1, 2 and 4, leading to the
identification of key neurological signatures of individual differences in cognitive aging. Cognitive assessment
protocols will include performance measures of memory, executive functions, processing speed, premorbid
function, and overall cognitive function. Cognitive tests derive from the experimental cognitive aging literature
that have been demonstrated to be sensitive to individual differences across and within age groups, as well as
standardized clinical neuropsychological tests typically used to identify age-related cognitive impairment and
potential early dementia. We will standardize and coordinate online cognitive assessments in both English and
Spanish, directly supporting Projects 1 and 2, and in-person assessments at four clinical for Project 2
(Tucson, Baltimore, Atlanta, Miami) to ensure quality and consistency throughout the project duration.
In addition, we plan to acquire brain MRI and ultrasound carotid images from 1620 participants. Our MRI
protocols will be built upon the advanced MRI protocols of ADNI 3, which have been optimized and tested for
our MRI platforms. From the acquired data we will produce quantitative measures of brain morphology, white
matter hyperintensities, structural and functional connectivity, perfusion, microbleeds, carotid intima-media
thickness, plaque presence, size and morphology, and blood flow velocities. The acquired imaging data will be
annotated with meta-data that support near real-time quality control, robust mining, query and analyses of
imaging data, meeting the meta-data requirements for various MRI software packages, machine learning
procedures, and large scale analyses proposed in Project 4. The meta-data management and annotation
system will also support incorporation of decentralized data (from the public domain), with which the training of
our machine learning modules can be further enhanced. Furthermore, we plan to implement a series of data
harmonization and pre-processing pipelines in our XNAT server (integrated with the COINS platform; HPC
nodes; and CyVerse), to streamline imaging data QC and quantitative analysis. Our proposed pipelines
address limitations of existing software packages (e.g., existing challenge in robustly segmenting hippocampus
and other critical brain structures across age groups) through machine learning, and can inherently harmonize
multi-modal MRI data (e.g., fast spin-echo MRI in minimally distorted coordinates; and echo-planar imaging in
distorted coordinates), enabling streamlined analysis (e.g., from hippocampal segmentation to memory
network connectivity analysis) without manual intervention."
10906874,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Molecular Profiling Core G
The goals of the Molecular Profiling Core (MP) Core G are to (a) perform the duties of the study-wide
biobank including tracking and distribution of samples to Project 3 and other Cores and Projects as needed,
(b) facilitate the rapid public sharing of biospecimens through NCRAD (National Centralized Repository for
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias) by providing them with twice yearly sample shipments for
deposition and administration to the general scientific community, (c) generate molecular data for
biospecimens collected from Projects 1 and 2, (d) provide iterative re-analysis of genomic data (RNA and
DNA) as necessitated by the activities of Project 4 to ensure that all study data is up-to-date with regards to
their respective analytical and annotation pipelines, and (e) provide expert consultation on all aspects of
biomarker discovery and development to the Precision Aging Network (PAN) investigators.
Project 1 biospecimens will consist of 10,000 dried blood spot cards (DBS). These DBS samples are self-
collected from the nationally distributed cohort of individuals who participate in the MindCrowd-Expanded
(MC-Expanded) cohort. The MP Core will perform APOE and array-based genotyping on these specimens and
deposit the raw and processed data into the study data repository via the Data Science (DS) Core. These
data will be utilized by Project 1 investigators to identify genetic risk factors that are associated with, or that
modify, cognitive performance on the MC-Expanded test battery. Additionally, through the use of the genome-
wide array data, each participant will be assigned individualized polygenic risk score (PRS) pertaining to the
various risk factors detailed in Project 2 (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, hypertension, diabetes, sleep, etc.).
Project 2 biospecimens will consist of 1,620 plasma, serum, and CSF samples collected from the face-to-face
characterized cohort. Several molecular profiling datasets will be generated from these samples including;
whole genome sequencing, CSF biomarkers, immune and inflammatory measurements, pan-viral exposures,
T- and B-cell receptor repertoires, whole blood and cell-free exosome RNA sequencing, and Horvath
epigenetic clock determinations among others (detailed further in the MP Core). These data will be quality
controlled and uploaded to the study data repository in both raw and processed formats for use by
investigators in the Projects and Cores.
The acquired high-quality and wide-ranging molecular data will play significant roles in answering major
research questions in our proposed projects, and can also be used by the national research community
studying cognitive aging, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and related dementias (ADRD)."
10872331,"Project Abstract
Genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related-diseases (ADRD) have identified over 72 loci associated
with susceptibility. Although some of the most penetrant variants have been studied independently, the majority
of sequence variants and features are unlikely to act in isolation. In addition, the range of susceptibility loci cover
coding, epigenetic, and regulatory regions of the genome, suggesting complex relationships that cannot be
captured by large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic profiling alone. With this in mind, we systematically
interrogate combinations of variants across validated AD loci in a cell autonomous and non-autonomous manner
using a combination of molecular, epigenetic, and functional assays. This allows to create a functional network
across AD loci, and identify nodal points where the effects of individual loci interact to trigger the hallmarks of
AD pathology and clinical phenotypes. As part of this effort, we propose to establish a novel AD Locus Annotator
interface that synthesizes information about AD-associated sequence features from reference databases
encompassing existing multi-omic and clinical data, as well as new data sets that capture quantitative proteoform
and cellular functional data; these latter two data modalities have been under-characterized in AD research to
date, but are crucial to identifying cross-loci interactions. From this synthesized data analysis and portal effort,
we then establish a set of gene editing efforts to validate and extend our mechanistic understanding of multi-
locus functional networks from these AD-associated sequence features. Taken together, these analyses and
experiments allow us to link the heterogeneity of AD-associated genetic variation and clinical manifestations into
a coherent framework that link AD loci with the temporal sequence of events in AD onset and progression."
10915470,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use causes at least 12 types of cancer and is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths in the United
States. Quitting smoking is the single most effective approach to protect cancer patients from smoking
complications, extend survival, and ensure best health outcomes. Despite the adverse health effects, 10-64%
of cancer patients, depending on cancer type, continue to smoke. Cancer diagnosis is emotionally shocking
experience and patients often use tobacco to regulate negative emotions. Smoking rates are the highest
among patients with tobacco-related cancers who have a long smoking history, high nicotine addiction and
difficulty with quitting smoking. Even after quitting they relapse as discontinuation of tobacco leads to negative
emotions, which in turn impacts smoking behavior. Smoking behavior is embedded within individual's affective
niche and social networks and is influenced by the behaviors of individuals in the network. Yet, to date, no
attention has been paid to how social networks and affective states influence smoking behavior of patients with
tobacco-related cancer who have high rates of smoking, nicotine dependency, negative emotions and struggle
with quitting smoking, nor how patients' cancer diagnosis affects smoking behavior of their network members.
Our mixed methods study will fill this gap in the evidence. We will achieve these four specific aims: Aim 1.
Determine tobacco-related cancer patients' affective states, social network structures (e.g., connected to other
smokers) and functions (e.g., interaction type—emotional support) and identify clusters of current-, former- and
non-smokers within those networks. Aim 2. Quantify the influence of tobacco-related cancer patients' affective
states, social network structures and functions, and network members' attributes (e.g., sex, smoking behavior,
etc.) on patients' smoking behavior. Aim 3. Assess the impact of a patient's tobacco-related cancer diagnosis
on the smoking behavior of the patient's network members (i.e., five to ten individuals the patient identifies as
close social contacts). Aim 4. Explore the facilitators and barriers (e.g., affective states, encouragement to quit
smoking) to smoking cessation in patients with tobacco-related cancer and their significant network member
dyads. Using a prospective longitudinal design with an egocentric social network, we will collect data from
newly diagnosed patients with tobacco-related cancer from a world-renowned cancer center, Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute. Data from 429 patients will be collected at baseline (within 3 months of diagnosis) and then 3-
, 6-, and 12-months later. We will also conduct semi-structured dyadic relationship-based qualitative interviews
with a cancer patient and a self-identified significant network member to explore the depth and complexity of
smoking behaviors. Our study is crucial as it will address the critical importance of affective states and social
networks in smoking behavior and findings will lay the groundwork for developing and testing novel, tailored,
social network-based smoking cessation interventions to better promote smoking cessation among tobacco-
related cancer patients and their social network members—families, friends, and others."
10899507,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) is curable with surgery, there is a critical need to stratify high-risk
early stage patients that would benefit from adjuvant treatment. In contrast to early stage CRC, late-stage
metastatic CRC (mCRC) is usually lethal presenting a critical need to match treatment modalities to patients
based on molecular phenotyping. To address these unmet clinical needs the proposed study aims to
understand the molecular mechanisms enabling primary CRCs to metastasize with the longer-term goal of
rationally guiding treatment decisions. While transcriptome sequencing has provided an unbiased method for
discovering lncRNAs, existing large-scale sequencing projects are comprised of predominantly primary tumors
without matched metastatic samples. This represents a critical barrier to studying lncRNAs involved in the
progression of primary to metastatic disease. To address this gap, we conducted the first meta-analysis of
normal, primary, and distant metastatic tissues across CRC patients to identify differentially expressed RNAs
Associated with Metastasis (RAMS). We prioritized a previously uncharacterized nuclear localized lncRNA,
RAMS11, since: (1) its expression correlated with metastatic progression, (2) its expression associated with
poor disease-free survival across multiple independent patient cohorts, and (3) it promoted oncogenic
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Further, subsequent mechanistic experiments demonstrated RAMS11-
dependent recruitment of Chromobox protein 4 (CBX4) to transcriptionally activate Topoisomerase II alpha
(TOP2α). This provides a strong rationale for our hypothesis that RAMS11 interacts with CBX4 to
epigenetically regulate genes to promote oncogenic phenotypes and treatment resistance. This study will focus
on dissecting how RAMS11 dependent CBX4 target gene regulation confers oncogenic phenotypes in vitro
and in vivo. We will also assess whether RAMS11 can help identify high-risk CRC patients and its role in
chemotherapy resistance. Overall, our proposal will significantly advance the lncRNA tumor biology field by
providing mechanistic insight into RAMS11 epigenetic regulation to promote mCRC. Our research has
translational impact by evaluating the potential role of RAMS11 to stratify CRC patients at high-risk of develop
recurrent/metastatic disease that would benefit from specific adjuvant therapies."
10911091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Lung is one of the largest internal sensory organs.  Chronic exposure of the lung to allergens or other irritants has been shown to influence stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia.  On the other hand, practices that modulate respiration including deep breathing in meditation or Qi Gong are linked to improved central nervous system (CNS) health.  However, the functional neuroanatomical connections between brain and lung at the molecular and cellular level remain largely unknown.  This R01 application proposes to test the hypothesis, using mouse models, that allergen-induced signals detected by interoceptors in the lung are transmitted via vagal afferent neurons to nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) (aim 1), and then from NTS to other central integrators in the brain, potentially including paraventricular nucleus (PVH) in the hypothalamus (aim 2), and lastly from dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) to descending spinal cord efferents that project back to the lung (aim 3) to sense and regulate airway hyperresponsiveness.  The aims will incorporate cutting-edge cell-type specific circuit and viral tracing techniques, lightsheet 3-D imaging, and candidate multiplex RNA in situ and unbiased snRNAseq approaches to map the neural circuits and identify the signature of signal-activated neurons in peripheral ganglia, NTS and other brain regions.  In addition, they will combine chemogenetic, optogenetic and toxin-based approaches with neural activity readouts including cFOS, in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and lung physiology to assess gain and loss of functional effects of key lung, vagal, spinal and brain connections."
10902017,"Project Summary: Improving Applied Biostatistics Skills for AI/AN Researchers
The NIH Strategic Plan for Tribal Health Research 2019-2023 outlines priority health research needs for AI/AN
communities, and emphasizes the importance of developing a pipeline of well-trained AI/AN researchers to
address these needs. Individuals skilled in biostatistics and/or data science are essential members of health
research teams, especially given the proliferation of health-related data in recent times. However, there are
few AI/AN with this type of training who are currently contributing to health sciences research. The goal of this
capacity-building grant is to increase the number of tribal researchers and tribal health professionals who can
apply sound biostatistical reasoning, efficiently work with data, and conduct appropriately rigorous analyses, so
that they can further the research efforts in tribal health. To meet this goal, we have designed and will
implement a modern quantitative training curriculum that fosters career development in AI/AN trainees who
aspire to analytically-oriented roles in health sciences research. We will accomplish this via in-person intensive
institutes (1 per year for 2 years), monthly distance learning sessions (monthly for 2 years), and a mentored
capstone project. Throughout the curriculum, we will emphasize practical applications of biostatistics methods,
as well as data handling, data visualization and contemporary data science methods. We will stress strategies
for designing ethical, yet rigorous studies, developing appropriate analysis plans, and clearly communicating
findings to diverse audiences. Graduates of this program will be poised to further their research-related
careers which will contribute towards building a strong, coordinated community of AI/AN health researchers
and expanding scientific knowledge to improve the health of AI/AN communities."

Human health is negatively impacted by the lack of gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in biomedical and health
sciences research in the United States. This lack of diversity adversely impacts discovery, innovation, and the
advancement of scientific knowledge. Moreover, this point is particularly salient, as the COVID-19 pandemic
has differentially affected the mortality and morbidity of communities of color in the US. Lower numbers of
historically underrepresented minorities in biomedical and health sciences research fields are evident in both
the undergraduate and graduate levels of training as compared to the general US population, but are even
more amplified among the faculty ranks in American research universities and medical schools. San Diego
State University (SDSU) is proposing a new and innovative program, SDSU FUERTE (Faculty Unified
towards Excellence in Research and Transformational Engagement). This program aims to ameliorate this
disparity by recruiting a diverse cohort of health sciences researchers focused on Latinx health disparities and
implementing a comprehensive Faculty Development Plan, comprised of a multi-perspective mentoring team
approach as well as a new centralized Core Curriculum that applies evidence-based strategies to accelerate
the research and professional academic advancement success of its faculty. One of three cores supporting
SDSU FUERTE, the Administrative Core is first and foremost responsible for overseeing a new institutional
process for successfully recruiting this diverse, nine-person, interdisciplinary faculty cohort who will begin at
SDSU in the Fall of 2022. The Administrative Core will be critical to these efforts and will be led by a highly

10927282,"FACULTY DEVELOPMENT CORE – Project Summary
The goal of the Faculty Development Core (FDC) of SDSU FUERTE or Faculty Unified towards Excellence in
Research and Transformational Engagement is to employ a comprehensive Faculty Development Model with
centralized and coordinated resources to support a newly hired FUERTE Faculty Cohort to establish their
research independence and thrive and advance at SDSU. The Faculty Cohort will benefit from multi-perspective,
team-based mentoring (Senior Faculty Mentor, Sponsor and Peer Mentor). Faculty Cohort members will
specialize in Latinx health disparities in the areas of Addiction Science, Environmental Health, and
Obesity/Physical Activity/Nutrition research. SDSU offers many important faculty development resources to
improve faculty research productivity and the climate of DEI excellence. However, these resources are delivered
by siloed units across the university, and SDSU does not currently have a comprehensive and centralized faculty
research training and Faculty Development Plan (FDP). To close this gap, the SDSU FUERTE FDC will develop
new activities as well as unify existing campus faculty development activities and resources in such a way as to
provide faculty with a structured approach to faculty development that will help them maximize efficiencies and
advance at an accelerated pace towards their research independence and professional advancement. The
SDSU FUERTE Faculty Development Model (FDM) will serve as the roadmap to guide all activities under the
FDP. The FDM integrates evidence-based and best practices for the comprehensive and unified promotion of
research and academic advancement, mentorship, wellbeing, and retention of diverse faculty. Through a
dedicated team of mentors who will support the Faculty Cohort starting from their transition and entry to SDSU
until they reach research independence and promotion to tenure status SDSU FUERTE will build in research
trajectory planning and an individual development plan developed by the Faculty Cohort with input from their
Mentoring Team that will guide them to reach milestones that should ensure their ability to be successfully
promoted and obtain tenure. The Faculty Cohort will have protected time coupled with research and faculty
development training in FUERTE’s structured Core Curriculum that will enhance and accelerate their
achievement of research independence and ability to become thriving faculty at SDSU. The SDSU FUERTE
FDP has strategically built-in efforts that will support the Faculty Cohort in fostering meaningful relationships with
peers and the campus community, specifically through the Core I seminars that include a new ‘Peers and
Pláticas’ (pláticas means ‘chats’ in Spanish) monthly peer gathering after the Core I “Community through
Diversity” session for the Faculty Cohort to meet and network with other peer faculty. SDSU FUERTE uses
evidence-based retention strategies including a mentoring team; providing requisite research and faculty
advancement knowledge, skills and supports; and building community to reduce isolation through peer
networking and team-building events to promote high satisfaction with academic life and retention at SDSU."
10927290,"EVALUATION CORE – Project Summary
The evaluation of the San Diego State University Faculty Unified towards Excellence in Research and
Transformational Engagement (SDSU FUERTE) program will test the primary hypothesis that a cohort and
cluster design model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentoring, and professional development,
embedded within an institution implementing evidence-based practices will create an academic culture of
inclusive excellence. In order to deliver on its promises, SDSU FUERTE requires a robust and rigorous
evaluation plan. To this end, the overall goals of the SDSU FUERTE Evaluation Core (EC) are twofold. First,
the EC will conduct a rigorous, comprehensive evaluation of the impact of SDSU FUERTE on producing
changes over time in SDSU faculty success (e.g., faculty advancement, peer-reviewed publications, and
grants) and the campus DEI climate. This will include baseline and follow-up assessments of the campus
climate before and after the SDSU FUERTE Faculty Cohort are brought to SDSU. Second, the EC will be
primarily responsible for communicating with the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC), and with
providing ongoing, evidence-based recommendations to the AC, FDC, Internal Advisory Board (IAB), and
External Advisory Board (EAB) for continuous improvement and refinement of SDSU FUERTE activities. In
order to achieve robust and rigorous evaluation of SDSU FUERTE, the overall design of the evaluation plan
includes multiple data sources that will be triangulated using mixed methods analysis and repeated
measurements over time. The evaluation plan will also include process- and outcome-oriented analysis of data
collected from multiple levels – SDSU FUERTE Faculty Cohort, other SDSU faculty, departments/schools, and
the overall institution. By focusing on multiple levels and on changes over time, the evaluation plan is
comprehensive and will provide valuable data to inform the broad-reaching and sustainable impact of SDSU
FUERTE on faculty success outcomes and the DEI climate. The specific aims of the EC are to: 1) Evaluate the
impact of SDSU FUERTE at the individual (i.e., faculty), department/school, and institution (SDSU) levels on
faculty success (e.g., advancement, research productivity) and the DEI climate within departments/schools and
across SDSU using multiple data sources and mixed methods; 2) Test hypothesized mechanisms of change
(e.g., less perceived isolation, increased collaboration/team science) over time that explain how SDSU
FUERTE leads to improvements in faculty success outcomes and an institutionalized academic culture of DEI
excellence at SDSU; and 3) Implement ongoing feedback loops with FUERTE stakeholders (AC, FDC, IAB,
EAB) and the FIRST CEC to facilitate data-driven solutions for continued improvement of the program. To
meet these aims, specific data sources will include longitudinal quantitative survey data (every 12-months from
baseline to 48 months) with faculty members at SDSU; qualitative interview data with a subset of faculty who
complete quantitative surveys (at baseline and four years later); and institutional indicator data."

The University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Imaging Core, led by Noam Harel, Ph.D. and based at the University
of Minnesota’s internationally renowned Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), will acquire state-
of-the-art, high-resolution MRI for all subjects in the Projects and Catalyst. The overall theme of the UMN Udall
Center is to develop novel, circuit based deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD).
As a foundation for all three proposed projects, the Catalyst project and in collaboration with the other cores in
support of this theme, the overall goal of the Imaging Core is to use advanced imaging capabilities for direct
visualization of anatomical targets for DBS surgery as well as provide the precise location and orientation of
individual stimulating electrode contacts within the target post-implantation.
The Imaging Core will combine several cutting-edge MRI techniques, including high resolution T1/T2s and
susceptibility weighted images (SWI). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) will also be acquired for white-matter
tractography to create patient-specific anatomical models of the target region and associated networks. To
complement the static anatomical connectivity information, we will create functional connectivity maps using
resting-state and task based functional MRI (fMRI) data of circuit-based cognitive function/non-motor regions.
For Projects 1, 2 and the Catalyst, PD patients will be scanned on a 7 T MRI system using tools developed by
our team at the CMRR. In addition, in a subset of PD patients that will be implanted with the Medtronic Percept
system, functional maps of DBS-fMRI stimulation will be collected on a 3T MRI system. For Project 3, non-human
primates (NHPs) will be scanned on the newly installed, first of its kind, 10.5 T MRI scanner, also at the CMRR.
For each PD patient and each NHP, the Imaging Core will acquire high-resolution MRI data prior to DBS
implantation and a head CT scan after surgery. Images will be fused to provide a comprehensive anatomical
model of the DBS target and the precise location of individual DBS contacts within each target.
The Imaging Core will provide patient-specific anatomical models, precise post-surgery DBS lead localization,
and parcellation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) to their
functional sub-regions. These images will provide unparalleled anatomical characterization specific to each
individual. Subject specific models of anatomical and functional connectivity developed by the Imaging Core will
provide data that is vital for the completion of each project in the UMN Udall Center."

effective and efficient operation and maintenance of the WU-PE-CGS center in compliance with NIH and
University guidelines, while leveraging innovative opportunities to advance the field of participant engagement
and cancer genomics. The Core will support the overall mission of the WU-PE-CGS through the following
aims: (1) Organize the operational structure and scientific leadership for all WU-PE-CGS components and
provide oversight to maximize efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability; (2) Build participant engagement for
underserved/understudied populations to engage in network-driven collaborative studies via outreach among
other Centers in the network and collaboration with patient advocacy groups; (3) Provide scientific leadership
in minority and underserved participant engagement and in genome sequencing among other scientists in the
network; (4) Evaluate all WU-PE-CGS activities and provide feedback to refine ongoing activities; (5) Establish
a timeline and milestones to monitor progress and coordinate efforts. The administrative core will position the
WU-PE-CGS to optimize the innovation, pace, and impact of participant engagement research and
genomic characterization of rare, understudied cancers. The WU-PE-CGS investigators have substantial
expertise and proven track records in conducting collaborative, transdisciplinary science, including research
and programs in cancer control, genome sequencing, dissemination of findings to other stakeholders, and
translating results for practitioners working in multiple settings. We are uniquely situated to provide scientific
leadership to connect and expand a network of cancer-focused participant engagement researchers; support
innovation; and enhance capacity for genome sequencing of rare and understudied cancers and directly
interact with patient advocacy groups and patients for return of results and ongoing participant engagement.
The Administrative Core is a critical element of the overall scientific program and infrastructure for the Center
and provides a strong foundation for scholarly excellence, research synergy and efficiency, and clinical and
community impact of the Center during and beyond the five-year initial funding period"
10924005,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT UNIT (PEU)
The PEU will be responsible for direct participant engagement to enroll patients into the Washington University
(WU) PE-CGS program. Under the direction of PIs Fields and Drake, we will leverage investigator and
institutional expertise to directly address the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel recommendation to “establish
a network for direct patient engagement”. We will prioritize 8 areas that are directly tied to the PEU Specific
Aims: (1) identify; (2) contact; and (3) consent participants; (4) obtain tumor/normal samples and clinical/meta
data; (5) create and prospectively maintain patient, specimen, and ongoing treatment data; (6) report research
findings directly to study participants using cutting-edge, innovative, informatics-driven methodologies that
leverage unique partnerships; (7) guide patients through the “flow” of the WU-PE-CGS program, providing
oversight of program-wide integration; and (8) bi-directionally interact with the other WU-PE-CGS “Units” for
ongoing, iterative refinement of program-wide protocols based on prospective study of participants.
To achieve success in these seven areas that is in-line with the Cancer Moonshot mission, we need novel
paradigms for engagement. The WU-PE-CGS has developed several innovative approaches following our
overall mission to “develop, implement, evaluate, and modify”. First, we have partnered with three world-class
patient advocacy groups (PAGs) that have significant experience in working directly with patient-partners (PPs)
in advancing cancer care: The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation (CCF), Fight Colorectal Cancer (FCRC), and

directly address this RFA's stated knowledge gaps of genomically characterizing and engaging patients with
understudied tumor types (cholangiocarcinoma [CHOL]) and cancers that are understudied in minority

ongoing methodological refinement will result in impactful research across a broad group of cancer types."
10914100,"Integral membrane proteins reside in the biological membrane where they function and intimately interact with
lipid molecules. The environment of the biological membrane is dynamic and composed of a rich chemical
diversity of lipid molecules. Alongside the complexity of the biological membrane is the growing realization of the
important roles of lipid molecules in the folding, structure, and function of membrane proteins. In fact, there is
often density in maps of structures determined by X-crystallography and cryoEM that are ascribed to lipids but
their identity remains largely unknown. Although a handful of examples exist which provide insight into
membrane protein-lipid interactions, how individual lipid molecules influence the structure and function of
membrane proteins on the molecular level largely remains poorly understood. What determines the selectivity of
membrane proteins towards lipids? How important is the lipid chemistry, such as lipid tail length, stereochemistry
and position of unsaturated double bonds, in protein-lipid interactions? Do membrane proteins recruit, through
allostery, their own microenvironment? Here, this proposal seeks to address these fundamental questions by
developing new tools and reagents to probe membrane protein-lipid interactions using the ammonia channel
(AmtB) from E. coli in complex with its regulatory protein GlnK as a model membrane protein system. More
specifically, native Mass Spectrometry (MS) technology, whereby non-covalent interactions are preserved in the
mass spectrometer, will be employed in combination with new MS approaches pioneered in the Laganowsky
group that, unlike other biophysical methods, allow individual lipid binding events to membrane protein
complexes to be resolved and interrogated. The proposed studies build off the foundation of previous work where
native MS technology is integrated with other biophysical techniques, such as Surface Plasmon Resonance
(SPR) and X-ray crystallography, to address fundamental questions regarding membrane protein-lipid
interactions. More specifically, proposed studies are aimed at unravelling cooperativity for a considerable number
(up to 20) of individual lipid binding events to AmtB by the (i) use of charge-reducing molecules and (ii) synthesis
of new detergents engineered for native MS applications. Next, proposed studies pushing the technological limits
of MS technology aimed at deducing allostery within heterogeneous lipid binding events to AmtB. Here, these
studies move beyond previous work on mixtures of two different lipid headgroups to more complex lipid mixtures,
composed of three to four different lipid species, binding to AmtB. Novel approach is proposed to deduce the
position-dependent effects of bound lipids on AmtB by using a combination of protein engineering and covalent
labeling strategies. Taken together, the results and outcomes from our proposed studies are anticipated to have
a significant impact in our understanding of membrane protein-lipid interactions and, more generally, to our
understanding of membrane protein biology, especially how changes in the biological membrane may regulate
membrane protein physiological function."
11049506,"Project Summary
Our goal is to develop a novel, immunological-directed synthetic biology-based therapeutic for the treatment of
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a devastating characterized by an exacerbated immune response that destroy
myelin. This disease affects many important aspects of a patient's life, including emotional well-being, quality
of life, working ability, and social interactions. In addition, MS patients present increased risk of severe
secondary complications, including blindness, kidney failure, stroke, and additional autoimmune disorders.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new cutting-edge strategies to treat MS.
The gut–brain axis has been recognized as a bi-directional communication system connecting the CNS to the
gut13 that is now implicated in the disease etiopathogenesis. MS patients present a dysbiotic gut microbiome
with a deficiency in regulatory T cells (Tregs)15, 16, 18, 19. Probiotic consumption showed an improvement in the
disease severity by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and Tregs17, corroborating the important role of the
gut-brain axis. A promising approach for the treatment of MS is to leverage the body’s own natural microbiome-
associated immune regulatory mechanisms with oral, gut localized and targeted therapy to control host
immune cells lining the gut epithelial layer to direct reestablishment of systemic immune homeostasis.
R-2487 is an immunologically-directed recombinant probiotic consisting of the food-grade, Lactococcus (L.)
lactis strain expressing Colonization Factor Antigen I (CFA/I). R-2487 is a live biotherapeutic product that
represents a novel breakthrough approach for the treatment of MS by combining the safety of a probiotic with
the targeted functionality of the CFA/I ligand. R-2487 has been showed to diminish MS-like symptoms in
animals21, 22. R-2487 works via targeted delivery of CFA/I to the intestinal tract where it engages mucosal
dendritic cells to drive systemic upregulation of Tregs. The induction of Tregs resets the balance with
proinflammatory T effector cells to reduce inflammatory processes that contribute to autoimmune disease,
leading to bystander tolerance. Since heterogeneous pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, including MS,
poses many challenges for therapies that target specific antigens for tolerization or a single cell type or
cytokine, R-2487-mediated bystander tolerance induction offers a broader and more impactful mechanism of
disease correction.
This application is designed to complete R-2487 IND enabling studies to support initiation of a first-in-human
MS trial for this important new therapy. The key aims of this proposal are: 1) finalize in vivo characterization of
R-2487, identifying starting clinical dose and important biomarkers to be used in the clinical trial; 2)
manufacture of clinical GMP drug substance and drug product; and 3) complete the IND-enabling GLP
toxicology study. Successful commercialization of R-2487 will provide a profound medical advancement for
treating MS."
10932120,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Defects in DNA repair are prevalent in human cancer and present an opportunity for targeted tumor treatment
with agents that induce DNA damage only in cells with specific DNA repair defects. O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT), a direct reversal repair enzyme that removes O6-alkylguanine lesions deposited by
alkylating agents such as temozolomide (TMZ), is the most frequently silenced DNA repair gene in cancer, with
promoter hypermethylation observed in ~10% of all tumors. Loss of MGMT occurs in the majority of lower grade
gliomas, ~50% of glioblastomas (GBM), and in a broad array of other cancer types, including ~20-40% of colon
cancer and melanoma. MGMT is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissue, and reduced MGMT expression in
tumors predicts for clinical benefit from TMZ, owing to the accumulation of DNA damage specifically in tumor
cells. Importantly, the efficacy of TMZ in MGMT-deficient tumor cells is dependent upon intact mismatch repair
(MMR) proteins, and resistance to TMZ arises due to MMR loss in ~50% of recurrent gliomas and ~20% of
recurrent GBM. Strategies are needed to avoid or overcome this major resistance mechanism in order to
therapeutically exploit MGMT silencing in cancer. In recent work, we identified a novel 2-fluoroethylating agent,
KL-50, which overcomes TMZ resistance through the induction of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) specifically
in tumor cells lacking MGMT, leading to MMR-independent activity in glioma models. We aim here to evaluate
more broadly the therapeutic potential of this targeted DNA modifying agent. We hypothesize that the MGMT-
dependent crosslinking activity of KL-50 can be harnessed to exploit unique combinations of DNA repair defects,
combined with DDR inhibitors (DDRi’s) to enhance therapeutic potential, and utilized to overcome certain
mechanisms of resistance to TMZ, independent of cancer histology. In Aim 1, we will determine the prevalence
of cancers with combined MGMT and ICL repair defects and establish the therapeutic potential of KL-50 in this
subset of cancer. We will characterize the overlap of MGMT and ICL repair defects in a large pan-cancer
database and evaluate the activity of KL-50 in experimental in vitro and in vivo models representing this subset
of tumors, alone and in combination with DDRi’s. In Aim 2, we will analyze resistance mechanisms to TMZ and
KL-50 in MGMT-silenced tumors and determine the ability of KL-50 to avoid or overcome TMZ-induced
resistance in non-glioma tumors. Using colon cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cell
models, we will perform focused CRISPR-Cas9 screening and develop drug-resistant cell lines to identify key
resistance factors. Emergence of drug resistance and the ability of KL-50 to target TMZ-resistant tumors will
further be analyzed in patient-derived primary cells and xenograft models. These studies will advance our
understanding of targeted DNA modifying agents and may support the initiation of clinical trials evaluating KL-
50 or related compounds in the treatment of DNA repair deficient tumors."
10821469,"Abstract
 Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), caused by the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), is
among the most prevalent HIV/AIDS-associated opportunistic infections and causes 15% of AIDS-
related mortality globally. In healthy individuals, exposure to Cn in early childhood results in a
pulmonary latent infection that is asymptomatic, but leads to the formation of lung granulomas.
Following HIV-associated compromise of the immune system, control of latent Cn infection within
pulmonary granulomas is lost and the fungus disseminates to cause meningitis.
 Most studies examining host-pathogen interactions in Cn are observational studies in human
cohorts or analyze reference Cn strains in acute disease models of cryptococcosis. We recently
showed that the mouse model accurately recapitulates differences in human survival that are
observed across Cn clinical isolates and used these data to develop a mouse model of latent Cn
infection. Our preliminary data using these mouse models to analyze the immune response to over 50
Cn clinical isolates from individuals with advanced HIV revealed a continuum of disease outcomes
that we classified into 3 groups: 1) latent infection resulting in granuloma formation and control; 2)
lethal disease similar to that observed with Cn reference strains; and 3) hypervirulence resulting in
rapid mortality. Previous studies with reference strains revealed lethal disease is associated with
various Cn virulence factors and a detrimental host Th2-mediated type-2 immune response. In
contrast, disease prevention is associated with the type-1 cytokine IFNγ. How these Cn-host
interactions differ to cause the continuum of disease observed in immunocompromised individuals
with HIV is not well defined.
 We will use analysis of clinical isolates in mouse models of disease to test our central
hypothesis that antigenic differences between Cn clinical isolates lead to either protective or
detrimental immune responses in the host. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific
aims. Our first and second aims will determine the host cellular and effector functions that result in
either latency (Aim 1), lethal disease (control infections), or hypervirulence (Aim 2). Our third aim will
identify Cn gene alleles for antigens that influence the immune response and ultimately disease
outcome. Taken together, these translational studies will define the molecular processes underlying
the continuum of Cryptococcus disease with the goal of developing novel immune-modulatory
treatment strategies for at-risk patient populations."
10883595,"Tarn Biosciences, Inc. is a start-up pharmaceutical company headquartered in East Lansing, Michigan. The
company is developing new therapies for tuberculosis (TB). The goal of this STTR is to develop the MmpL3
inhibitor, HC2099, as a new treatment for drug susceptible and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). In 2019, 10
million people worldwide fell ill to TB with ~ 1.4 million lives lost. Standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for TB calls
for a protracted 6-month course of combination therapy to in which 14-24% of patients are nonadherent to
therapy. This long duration of treatment, high pill burden, and associated adverse drug effects, dramatically
impacts patient compliance and the evolution and spread of MDR-TB, with ~500,000 new MDR-TB infections
in 2019. Given that resistance to SOC treatment is as high as 10% in many countries, new drug regimens, with
new agents are required for slowing the spread of drug resistance.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a remarkably successful, in part, due to the complex cell envelope that
surrounds the bacterium. MmpL3 is a mycolate flippase that moves the glycolipid trehalose monomycolate
(TMM) to the pseudoperiplasmic space, from where TMM is modified to trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and
incorporated into the mycomembrane. Mtb and M. smegmatis mmpL3 knockdown strains show that mmpL3 is
essential for survival both in vitro and in mice. Multiple MmpL3 inhibitors also exhibit synergistic interactions with
TB antibiotics, further supporting interest in this target.
 Using an innovative combination of untargeted and targeted mutant screens, we have identified ten new and
distinct scaffolds that inhibit MmpL3 function. One of these compounds, HC2099, was chosen for optimization
and characterization studies given observed properties usually regarded useful for drugs, including high aqueous
solubility and stability in microsomes. Structure-activity-relationship studies including the synthesis of >60
analogs resulted in >70-fold improvement of potency. Pilot studies show one of the optimized analogs, MSU-
43085, accumulates in mouse plasma and lungs and reduces Mtb growth in vivo when orally delivered.
 The product of this STTR is HC2099 analogs, a new series of MmpL3 inhibitors. HC2099 analogs are potent
(~100 nM EC50), soluble, orally bioavailable inhibitors targeting a pathway essential for Mtb survival. The goal of
this Phase I project is to prioritize three HC2099 analogs with favorable in vitro and in vivo drug-like properties
and demonstrate efficacy in chronically infected mice. Medicinal chemistry optimizations of HC2099 series will
be conducted to develop improved analogs (Aim 1.1) and in vitro drug-like properties will be characterized to
bias development towards a drug-like molecules (Aim 1.2). To drive towards proof-of-concept efficacy in vivo,
formulation studies (Aim 2.1), PK studies (Aim 2.2) and in vivo efficacy studies will be conducted in two models
of murine TB infection (Aim 2.3). The expected outcome of this work is a prioritized, orally bioavailable HC2099
analog with in vivo activity comparable to standard of care antibiotics."
10906651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Electrical synapses are complex cellular and biochemical structures with important roles in health and disease.
They are composed of neuronal gap junctions that link the cytoplasm of synapsing neurons through channels
composed of transmembrane Connexin proteins (Cx). However, there are striking gaps in knowledge
surrounding the identification of non-Connexin electrical synapse proteins and the characterization of
molecular mechanisms driving electrical synapse formation. Electron micrograph images first revealed the now
well-characterized molecular assemblies of the chemical synapse, showing large electron dense regions
beneath pre- and postsynaptic membranes now known as the Active Zone (AZ) and the Postsynaptic Density
(PSD). Similar cytoplasmic electron dense regions have been observed at neuronal gap junctions, suggesting
the presence of additional machinery regulating electrical synapses. The Miller lab recently identified ZO1b as
being necessary and sufficient for Cx localization and electrical synapse function in the zebrafish Mauthner
neural circuit. ZO1b is a multidomain molecular scaffold known for organizing cytosolic and transmembrane
proteins at epithelial tight junctions. Interestingly, ZO proteins at tight junctions display the fascinating
biochemical property known as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) allowing them to create a non-
membrane-bound compartments within the cell and concentrate binding partners to build fluid molecular
assemblies. Indeed, ZO1b’s chemical synapse analog PSD95, as well as other synaptic scaffolds of the AZ
and PSD, have also been suggested to organize chemical synapse architecture through LLPS. However,
functional characterization for LLPS in vivo has been difficult due to the absence of an assessable model
system. This proposal uses a combination of protein dynamics, binding assays, and structure/function mutants
in cell culture to first determine the functional domains involved in Cx-scaffolding and LLPS of ZO1b and then
translates those findings in vivo to the optically transparent, genetically tractable Mauthner cell circuit. Together
the results will provide a foundational model for the molecules required for electrical synapse development and
the biochemical interactions that drive it, as well as accelerated training for the applicant in neurodevelopment,
protein biochemistry, and zebrafish genetics."
10863824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the animal kingdom, sexual dimorphism, or phenotypic differences between the sexes, is seen in most
species. In Drosophila, the key factor controlling sexual dimorphism is Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member
of the conserved Doublesex/Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family. DMRTs have central roles in
sex determination across many species including flies, humans, and mice. Although few Dsx targets have
been characterized, our lab has shown that Dsx regulates sex-specific steroid hormone Ecdysone (E) signaling
through female-specific Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) expression, and that this functions to promote ovary
development and repress testis development at a key developmental timepoint. Bioinformatic analyses has
been used to predict Dsx targets, and many of these are transcription factors that contain a Broad-complex,
tramtrack, and bric-a-brac (BTB) domain, a protein-protein interaction motif. To identify Dsx targets that play a
role in sexual dimorphism of the gonad, I performed a reverse screen of BTB domain proteins containing
putative Dsx binding motifs using RNA interference. As a result, I found that loss of mamo in somatic cells of
the gonad led to severely disorganized ovaries and, in some cases, the formation of rudimentary testes in XX
animals. Given these findings, I hypothesize that mamo is critical for proper development in the
Drosophila ovary, and that it functions downstream of Dsx and E signaling to help establish a female
sexual fate. This hypothesis will be addressed by first examining the cell-type-specific expression of Mamo
throughout development and performing genetic interaction assays with dsx. I will characterize what cell types
are affected in the absence of mamo using cell-specific markers and ascertain whether loss of mamo results in
sex transformation properties of the ovary. A second BTB domain protein, Chinmo, has been shown to be
important in the testis, and the relationship between mamo and chinmo, and how E signaling regulates these
factors, will be determined. This work will expand current knowledge on how DMRTs control sexual
dimorphism and could uncover genes critical for sexual identity in both flies and mammals. Due to the
universal nature of DMRTs in controlling sex-specific development, understanding their targets and how they
function is of great importance for reproductive health and has the potential to broaden our knowledge of
human infertility."
10696367,"Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation causes skin inflammation, photodamage, and photoaging, all major
medical problems for Armed Forces personnel and veterans. Because UVB is absorbed mostly by
the epidermis, with just 10% reaching the dermis, we seek to investigate likely signals from
epidermis to mediate inflammation and damage in the dermis in response to UVB. Extracellular
vesicles (EVs), which are small lipid bilayer membrane structures released by many cells, carry
lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids to mediate cell-cell communication. Data from us and others
indicate that UVB irradiation of keratinocytes (KCs) triggers the release of biologically active EVs.
Our preliminary data suggest that these UVB-induced KC-derived EVs (KC-EVs) activate several
key pro-inflammatory pathways in dermal cells, including the stimulator of interferon genes
(STING), the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-KB. Our central hypothesis is that UVB provokes
KCs in the epidermis to release biologically active EVs that then leave the epidermis to act on
dermal fibroblasts, immune cells in the dermis, and even systemically, to mediate photoaging and
other harms. There are three Aims. Aim 1. To characterize KC-EVs induced by UVB irradiation
and the immune cells they act upon in vivo in the dermis and in vitro. Experimental approaches
include UVB-irradiation of mice followed by isolation and characterization of KC-EVs from dermis
(1a); use in vivo of GW4869, an agent that blocks EV generation, to determine which immune cell
types are no longer recruited by UVB to dermis, or are recruited but not activated (1b); and
identification of target immune cell types that respond to KC-EVs in vitro (1c) and in vivo (1d),
including after intradermal injection of UVB- induced KC-EVs into mice. Aim 2. To characterize
molecular mechanisms by which KC-EVs mediate UVB-induced dermal inflammation. We will test
the roles of STING, the inflammasome, and NF-KB (2a) using experimental systems in vivo and in
vitro from Aim 1. We will also test the roles of specific biologically active molecules carried by KC-
EVs, such as dsDNA, peroxidized lipids known to function as danger signals, and specific
proteins, such as integrins (2b). Aim 3. To assess potential therapeutic strategies that ameliorate
KC-EV-mediated dermal inflammation under UVB irradiation. We will test whether melatonin, an
endogenous inhibitor of STING and inflammasomes, suppresses UVB -induced KC-EV production
and dermal inflammation in vivo (3a). We will also assess the mechanism by which melatonin
blocks the ability of KC-EVs to mediate dermal inflammation, i.e., by interfering with STING, the
inflammasome, and/or NF-KB (3b), using experimental systems in vivo and in vitro from Aim 1.
Overall, these aims will reveal a better understanding of the role of epidermis, especially KC-EVs,
in UVB-induced photoaging and skin inflammation, and provide potential novel therapeutic
strategies to prevent and treat these conditions through targeting specific molecular mechanisms."
10813862,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Pulvinar Neuro LLC, TOWNSEND
The causal role of circuit activity dynamics in depression remains poorly understood due to the lack of tools for
non-invasive, targeted circuit modulation. Today’s non-invasive brain stimulation approaches apply generic
stimulation waveforms without targeting individual activity signatures and without dynamically adapting
stimulation to ongoing fluctuations in brain activity. To address this gap, the long-term goal of Pulvinar Neuro is
to develop, evaluate, and commercialize targeted closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
technology, which measures brain activity with EEG and dynamically applies weak rhythmic electric fields to
modulate network oscillations. In the previous Phase 1 SBIR, Pulvinar Neuro developed XCSITE 100Pro, a
closed-loop tACS device that was successfully tested for feasibility in healthy human participants, and XCSITE
200, a cloud-based platform for remote stimulation. The overall goal of this application is to develop and evaluate
the XCSITE 300 platform that will integrate closed-loop capabilities with cloud-based stimulation and study
management. The rationale for this project is that such a solution will drive the next generation of circuit-based
research in psychiatry and that closed-loop tACS has the potential to become a safe and effective treatment for
depression given the initial positive findings of open-loop tACS for the treatment of depression and the substantial
unmet market need. Three specific aims will be pursued to accomplish this goal. (1) Integrate and bench test
closed-loop tACS technology with cloud-based infrastructure, (2) Test XCSITE 300 for in-lab use in a pilot
double-blind single-site study for the treatment of depression (XCSITE 300 Clinic), and (3) Adapt device form
factor and user interface for at-home use (XCSITE 300 Home) and establish feasibility in a pilot study in people
with depression. At completion of the proposed work, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of closed-loop tACS will
be established and closed-loop tACS for use in a clinic and for at-home use by patients will be ready for pivotal
studies for the treatment of depression. The work in this application is innovative given the lack of available
cloud-enabled (“smart”) closed-loop tACS devices for probing circuit dynamics and for evaluation of clinical
efficacy in rigorous double-blind trials. The proposed work is significant since closed-loop tACS will enable the
investigation of the causal role of specific circuit dynamics in humans and the development of novel treatments
for depression which are urgently needed."

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven efficacy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
However, ADT is associated with physiological and cognitive side effects, and the risks and benefits of ADT for
men without metastases remain unclear. Identification and evaluation of these side effects of ADT is critical to
the management and care of these patients, many of whom are expected to be cured from cancer.
 The literature is mixed in terms of the domain, extent, and severity of cognitive impairment. Individuals
vary in the impact of ADT likely because some patients but not others are able to functionally compensate for
the effects of ADT, much like the effects of aging on cognitive functions. Investigators have characterized the
overall deleterious effects of ADT on physical and mental health in terms of accelerated aging.
 Aging is associated with altered motivation and emotion. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementia (ADRD) may exhibit apathy, which, along with anxiety and depression, manifests early,
influences cognition, and severely restricts quality-of-life in the course of illness. The etiological processes of
ADRD are multifactorial and research has provided evidence in support of the roles of diminishing levels of
androgen. Thus, with the side effects conceptualized as accelerated aging, ADT may lead to motivation deficit
as well as anxiety and depression in prostate cancer patients. We propose to combine clinical evaluation,
neurocognitive testing, and brain imaging in a longitudinal setting to systematically investigate emotional
processing and motivation dysfunction in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.
 We hypothesize that prostate cancer patients who undergo ADT relative to those who do not will
demonstrate apathy and greater anxiety and depression in clinical and laboratory assessments. Further, ADT
will alter hypothalamic and medial prefrontal cortical circuit activity each in relation to apathy and emotion
dysfunction. With the longitudinal design, we will investigate how hypothalamus and medial prefrontal cortical
circuit function at baseline predict these clinical manifestations and quality-of-life during follow-ups. Further, we
will explore whether apathy, anxiety and depression may account for individual variation in cognitive
dysfunction as a result of ADT.
 Our over-arching goal is to investigate motivation and emotion dysfunction and their neural markers in
prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. The findings will advance our understanding of the risks associated
with ADT and facilitate clinical decision-making and rehabilitative interventions to preserve cognitive and
affective functions and quality-of-life in the care of prostate cancer patients."

There is an unmet need for a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vaccine. We propose to
develop a live-attenuated HSV-2 vaccine based on our R2 technology platform. R2
vaccines show unprecedented safety and efficacy in animal models, and offer

2 self-excising infectious clone of a low-passage clinical isolate, (ii) use the clone to
produce a HSV-2 R2 recombinant, and (iii) characterize the R2 vaccine in culture side by

 Congenital heart defects/diseases (CHDs) are the most common developmental anomalies and are the
leading non-infectious causes of mortality in newborns, underscoring the importance of studying the underlying
causes. The main genetic contributors are known for only 10-15% of CHD patients, thus hundreds more have
yet to be discovered. It is our goal to systematically elucidate the genetic basis of CHDs. This is particularly
challenging in mammalian models due to their genetic complexity and the often oligogenic nature of CHDs. We
and others have originally defined a first set of ‘cardiogenic’ genes in Drosophila that specify the heart (e.g.
tinman/Nkx2-5). These insights served as a prototype for elucidating fundamentally conserved mechanisms of
cardiac development throughout the animal kingdom (~80% of human disease genes have fly orthologs). Over
the past grant cycle, our lab made considerable progress in elucidating the molecular-genetic basis of heart
development, establishment of heart function and importantly of CHD gene discovery and combinatorial
assessment of candidate gene functions. With our new high-throughput multidisciplinary platforms, we have the
unprecedented, but much needed ability to functionally and in-depth evaluate a multitude of candidate genes
from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, also patient-specifically, to begin to create comprehensive
cardiogenic gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in health and disease.
 In this application, we propose to create and functionally test in high-throughput comprehensive GRNs
of cardiogenesis, initially based on single cell gene expression profiles (by scRNAseq) of cardioblasts (CBs)
sorted from wildtype Drosophila embryos, as well as from mutant hearts for core cardiogenic transcription factors
(cTFs), such as tinman. In a complementary approach, we will evaluate patient-specific sets of human CHD
gene candidates, identified and bioinformatically prioritized from WGS by our collaborators, by testing them in
our in vivo Drosophila heart model, in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), with validation in
zebrafish, followed by integration in the emerging GRNs. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct genetic interaction
studies of cTFs with prioritized gene sets based on scRNAseq profiles of FACS-sorted CBs from wildtype vs.
mutant Drosophila embryos, with the goal to construct and refine cardiogenic GRNs. In Aim 2, we propose to
identify, test and network new, potentially causal CHD genes and their mechanisms, focusing on ribosomal
protein gene RpL13 and mitochondrial MICOS complex genes. It is our goal to harness the power of the
(evolutionarily conserved) Drosophila heart (with validation in hiPSC-CM and zebrafish) for new gene/pathway
discovery to generate integrated GRNs for CHD, as a basis for the development of diagnostic tools and
therapeutic interventions."

The unique strength of the proposed GLNARCH Capacity Building Core is the adoption of the
model developed by the Native Environmental Health Research (NEHR) network previously
funded under NARCH VIII. The NEHR model nurtures collaborations between Tribes, Tribal
Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Native-serving mainstream institutions. Through this
network, participants can work collaboratively by sharing, and directing the necessary resources
to address pressing tribal health concerns. In this way, the GLNARCH Capacity activities (both
proposed here and ongoing) augment and leverage valuable, scarce resources in the most
underfunded Indian Health Service (Bemidji) region, while also offering additional opportunities,
such as professional development and consultation, to all participants. The activities in this
Capacity Component will be executed by an experienced, established team with institutional
support from the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), University of Wisconsin System (UW),
and Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council (GLITC), with additional support from the Inter-Tribal
Council of Michigan (ITCMI). This proposal supports and complements our other GLNARCH
efforts via independently achievable aims with their own distinct valuable impacts. This
proposed Capacity Project will develop research capacity at each center (TCU and/or tribal
community) as well as coordinate these into a regional network (NEHR). Doing so builds on
established relationships under the previous funding cycle."
10836568,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Thrive Neuromedical LLC proposes to develop, test, and gain FDA clearance to market a therapeutic device
to improve speech sound differentiation in preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU). During this project we will complete development of the smallTalk NICU Active system and conduct a
clinical trial to prove its efficacy in improving speech sound differentiation among hospitalized preterm infants.
The device is designed to be used at an age equivalent to 32 weeks of gestation or older and to integrate
readily into clinical practice for use by nurses and therapists staffing Level II to Level IV NICUs. Prototype
research and development met or exceeded the stated technical milestones. In 2020, preterm birth affected 1
of every 10 infants born in the United States. Large numbers of infants are born daily requiring NICU stays.
This NICU stay, while medically necessary, can result in impairments in the developing infant brain. In
particular, there is a lack of exposure to infant directed parental or caretaker voice. It is known that exposure
to infant directed speech, which is different from adult directed speech, is developmentally important for
optimal, early brain development. The ability to differentiate speech sounds is a prerequisite for developing
more complex receptive language. Infant directed speech, ideally when sought by an attentive infant,
stimulates brain wiring and attunes the infant’s brain to speech sounds. For the developing infant brain,
“plasticity” for language learning peaks during infancy, as the baby develops neural connections that enable
differentiating their native language’s speech sounds. These connections are the foundation for more complex
brain functions. Due in part to their time in NICU care, preterm infants have poorer receptive language scores
at age two. A majority require speech and language intervention prior to school age. There is currently no
intervention that addresses the problem of poor speech sound differentiation arising from NICU
hospitalization, a period when the greatest potential for improving outcomes exists. This proposal seeks
funding for the final product development and rigorous testing of the smallTalk NICU Active system. We will
manufacture a small batch of the devices to support a proposed randomized clinical study at Emory
University, the results of which will be submitted to FDA for clearance to market the innovative device."
10810633,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
WHO needs new, highly sensitive and ultra-specific lateral flow assays (LFA) to support its endeavors to eliminate
onchocerciasis, a disease also known as river blindness affecting 18 million people, with another 218 million living
at risk of contracting the disease. Onchocerciasis is fought by mass drug administration (MDA). WHO critically
needs new diagnostic tests to support decisions to start and stop MDA programs and released in 2021 the
corresponding desired target product profiles (TPPs). The most stringent TPP criterion is that the test must be
extraordinarily specific (≥ 99.8%).
Our non-profit sister company Drugs & Diagnostics for Tropical Diseases (DDTD) was hired in 2020 and 2021 by
the Task Force for Global Health (TFGH) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a
new rapid diagnostic test for onchocerciasis. We succeeded in developing an assay composed of two novel O.
volvulus antigens that are arranged as two distinct test lines on the assay strip. In an independent evaluation,
the CDC found the test to be 89.6% sensitive (95% CI: 79.2-95.2%, N=58) and 100% specific (95% CI: 99.95-100%,
N=194). This means that our biplex test meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements of both TPPs and,
remarkably, its specificity is >99.8% even at the lower bound 95% CI. In view of these data, USAID has already
committed funding to evaluate the assay in the field on approximately 10,000 individuals, which will be
conducted by the TFGH in early 2023.
Given these exciting results, the massive relevance for public health, and the big momentum already garnered
with key players (USAID, CDC, TFGH), we are now requesting Direct-to-Phase II funding from the NIH to swiftly
progress the assay to manufacturing and commercialization. Phase II funding will be used to (1) optimize the
biplex test in a reel-to-reel manufacturing-friendly mode, and to secure access to critical reagents, (2) establish
a robust manufacturing process, with a focus on minimizing costs and maximizing speed, with SOPs and QC
protocols validated for a manufacturing context, and data on lot-to-lot reproducibility data recorded in our QMS,
and (3) produce 100’000 devices (in 5 lots of 20’000) that will be donated to the stakeholders (TFGH/USAID) to
support further field testing and jump-start test adoption. It is noteworthy that said stakeholders have already
sponsored our initial (“Phase I”) research, hence will have a vested interest in ensuring maximum return on their
investment by facilitating all downstream activities necessary to provide a clear path to commercializing our test.
We respectfully submit that a first-in-class tool, such as our new test, that will support the elimination of river
blindness, a disease with 21 million active cases and 218 million at-risk individuals, will address an unmet need
of paramount significance for global public health."

prevention compared with Whites. This is notable given that Blacks have a 3-fold greater risk of NVAF-related
ischemic stroke compared to Whites. My long-term goal is to reduce racial disparities in arrhythmia (defined as
an abnormal heart rhythm) care. My goal in applying for a Mentored Career Development Award to Promote
Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research is to acquire the research skills and hands-on experience necessary
to become a productive, independent, clinician-scientist. My research focuses on addressing racial disparities in
the use of OAC in patients with NVAF. Candidate and Mentors: I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at
Duke University’s School of Medicine where I practice as an cardiac electrophysiologist. My primary mentor, Dr.
Kevin Thomas, has expertise in healthcare disparities, specifically the contributors to lower quality of health care
delivery and outcomes among racial and ethnic minority populations. Research and Training: The goal of this
research proposal is to develop a patient decision support tool aimed at facilitating shared decision making,
improving decision quality, and increasing the uptake of OAC in Blacks with NVAF. Shared decision making,
aided through the use of patient decision support tools, has been associated with improved outcomes including
increased knowledge, less decisional conflict, and increased uptake of therapeutic interventions. Unfortunately,
Blacks are more likely to experience non-participatory decision making than non-racial and ethnic minority
populations. In this proposal, I will: 1) conduct interviews among Black and White patients with NVAF and
clinicians to understand the barriers and facilitators toward participating in shared decision making regarding use
of OACs; 2) develop and iteratively evaluate a patient decision support tool; and 3) conduct a pilot study to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of a patient decision support tool to facilitate shared decision making. The
training plan will prepare me for a career aimed at addressing racial disparities in arrhythmia care and will include
education in 1) implementation science to promote the adoption of our patient decision support tool in clinical
practice; 2) accruing skills in the design and testing of patient decision support tools; and 3) design of clinical
trials to assess the efficacy of our intervention. This research will provide data to support a R01 proposal to test
the efficacy of a patient decision support tool to improve shared decision making, decision quality, and potentially
increase the use an adherence of OAC in Blacks in a multisite randomized clinical trial. Summary: The proposed
research will lead to the development of a patient decision support tool intervention used to facilitate shared
decision making in Blacks with NVAF, improve decision quality, and potentially increase the uptake of OAC in
Blacks with NVAF. The K01 Diversity award will support my development into a leader in healthcare disparities
research with the goal of promoting patient-centered care by empowering patients to make informed, values-
based decisions needed to improve decision quality and potentially reduce racial disparities in arrhythmia care."
10695636,"Obese adipose tissue (AT) is insulin resistant and inflamed due to changes in the number and activation
state of innate and adaptive immune cells. Our single cell RNAseq studies of AT immune cells from lean and
obese mice confirm these immunophenotypes. A greater proportion of Veteran than Civilian populations are
obese, and while it is well-established that obesity increases risk of many diseases, recent evidence suggests
that the cycling of body weight further increases risk of cardiometabolic diseases. We developed a mouse model
of weight cycling (WC) and demonstrate that WC mice are more glucose intolerant than equally obese mice that
have not cycled. Furthermore, we show that WC amplifies the accumulation of many inflammatory immune
populations in AT beyond that of obese controls. Clues as to how WC increases AT inflammation can be gleaned
from animals that have lost weight. As expected, weight loss (WL) improves systemic insulin action; however,
the immune landscape of AT becomes even more inflammatory. We postulate that residual inflammatory cells
in AT after WL become hyperactivated upon subsequent weight regain, and lead to exaggerated inflammation
and metabolic dysfunction evident with WC. We and others have reported that the accumulation of AT T cells
(ATTs) in obesity is characterized by clonal expansion of CD8+ cells. Strikingly, our preliminary studies show that
WL and WC further amplify the number of clonally expanded CD8+ ATTs. Interestingly, the clonally expanded
cells have an exhausted phenotype, are not cytotoxic, and display high expression of granzyme K (Gzmk).
Although much less in known about Gzmk than other members of the granzyme family, our AT TGzmk cells are
remarkably similar to a subset of Gzmk-expressing CD8+ T cells that accumulate in multiple tissues in aged mice.
Additionally, a novel function of Gzmk – the ability to induce senescence in fibroblasts – suggests a potential
mechanistic link between Gzmk action and dysfunctional tissue aging. Cell senescence is often studied in aging
and cancer; however, emerging research suggests a role for adipocyte senescence in obesity and diabetes in
mice and humans. Our preliminary data confirm a senescent phenotype of adipocytes in obesity and WC, as
well as with Gzmk treatment. However, we do not know the importance of Gzmk or TGzmk cells in driving adipocyte
senescence or to the metabolic dysfunction of AT in obesity, WL, and WC. Taken together, these published and
preliminary studies lead us to hypothesize that TGzmk cells induce adipocyte senescence in obesity, which is
amplified upon weight loss and regain, promoting AT dysfunction and glucose intolerance with WC. Specific Aim
1. To determine the role of Gzmk in adipocyte senescence and AT dysfunction. Specific Aim 2. To determine
whether absence of Gzmk-expressing T cells reduces adipocyte senescence. Specific Aim 3. To determine
whether TGzmk cells are sufficient to induce adipocyte senescence and AT dysfunction. IMPACT: The similarity
of AT TGzmk cells to age-associated T cells suggests that they are part of a premature aging immune phenotype
in AT of obese, WL, and WC mice, and may be causative of adipocyte senescence and AT dysfunction."
10914069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We recently reported that SCCA incidence (particularly advanced-stage disease) and mortality rates are
increasing rapidly (>3% per year) in the US with notable (>5%/year) increases in women 50 years and older
showing that SCCA is one of the fastest accelerating causes of cancer incidence and mortality among all
cancer sites. Women with lower genital tract (cervical/vaginal/vulvar) dysplasia or cancer (WLGTN) represent a
large population (>200,000 new cases per year) at elevated risk of developing SCCA. We and others have
shown that the incidence of SCCA among WLGTN aged 50 years and older is over 20 per 100,000 persons,
which is both comparable to the incidence rate among women with HIV (who are the focus of current screening
efforts) and is similar to the cervical cancer incidence prior to widespread screening. Furthermore, HPV
vaccination is unlikely to decrease SCCA incidence in this population both because WLGTN have already
been exposed to oncogenic HPV, and vaccine rates remain low among US women. This highlights an urgent
need for studies evaluating possible targeted prevention in the form of anal cancer screening. Our goal is to
evaluate the benefits and harms of SCCA screening among WLGTN. Screening for SCCA involves the
identification of precancerous anal lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or ""aHSILs"") using
cytologic testing or HPV testing (potentially performed by patients themselves). These lesions (if histologically
confirmed) can then be treated, thereby preventing carcinoma development, similar to practices widely
endorsed for cervical cancer. To inform guidelines, data regarding screening characteristics, natural history,
patient acceptability, the benefits and harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for SCCA among WLGTN,
are urgently needed. We therefore propose a two-site, two-year longitudinal study of 350 HIV uninfected
WGLTN aged ≥45 years. The results of this longitudinal study will be used to synthesize a mathematical
(simulation) model that will estimate clinical and population-level benefits versus harms and cost-effectiveness
associated with different screening approaches. The Specific Aims are: (1A) To evaluate the respective
screening test characteristics of anal cytology, clinician-collected and self-collected high-risk HPV (hrHPV)
testing, and cytology/hrHPV cotesting compared to the gold standard of high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) exam
with biopsy; (1B): To determine baseline anal hrHPV and histologic aHSIL (haHSIL) prevalence and
longitudinal risk among WLGTN; (2): To compare patient acceptability and experiences for anal cancer
screening strategies among WLGTN; and (3): To develop a mathematical model determining the potential
mortality and morbidity benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening and/or hrHPV
testing in WLGTN. In summary, the proposed multidisciplinary study will generate much-needed data regarding
the optimal SCCA screening approach for WLGTN, necessary to inform national screening recommendations
for WLGTN. This study will have direct implications for clinical cancer prevention practices."
10792471,"Abstract
 Mosquito bites are not simply an itchy annoyance- diseases spread through mosquito bites are a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality each year and impose a heavy economic burden on healthcare systems
around the world. When an insect disease vector lands on a host, it uses contact chemosensation, or taste, to
inform its decision to bite and thereby spread disease. Insect repellants that function to disrupt sensation of
taste cues, including DEET, have proven effective as antifeedants but are not without significant limitations.
Many biting insects, including the dengue vector Aedes (Ae.)aegypti, show a greater reduction in biting and
blood feeding when presented with fatty acids (FAs), the palatable component of dietary fats, than with DEET.
In spite of findings like this, the receptor mechanisms employed in mosquito taste, including FA taste, are
largely unknown and remain unexplored. Many taste modalities have been studied extensively in Drosophila
melanogaster, which is a dipteran relative of Ae. aegypti, yet the molecular requirements for FA taste are
unresolved. To this effect, we propose to employ our recent findings in the powerful model organism
Drosophila to identify the currently unknown cellular and receptor mechanisms underlying FA taste in Ae.
aegypti. In Drosophila, low concentrations of FAs are attractive, while high concentrations are aversive. In
addition to recent evidence that gustatory attraction to low concentrations of FAs is conferred by a specific
subset of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) and requires phospholipase C, data from our lab suggest
requirements for a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and a TRP channel. In addition to its role in attraction,
the TRP channel is also required for aversion. Our preliminary results show for the first time that Ae. aegypti
displays bimodal attraction and aversion to FAs. In addition, Ae. aegypti encodes homologs for the candidate
FA receptors identified in Drosophila. The aims of this proposal will build on preliminary findings in Ae. aegypti.
The goal of Aim #1 is to identify the range of relevant FA concentrations that impact biting and blood feeding in
Ae. aegypti and define the role of taste in controlling the bimodal FA responses. In Aim #2 we will test the taste
requirement for an Ae. aegypti TRP channel homolog and candidate GPCRs in attraction and aversion towards
FAs. By identifying the receptor mechanisms for FA detection, this proposal offers to not only improve our
understanding of a poorly defined insect taste modality but also to identify specific targets for improved insect
repellants."
10806981,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular energy reservoirs in the form of triglycerides and steryl esters and are central
to the maintenance of membrane structure and energy homeostasis. They serve as the primary organelle for
energy storage both in cells and in organisms (as adipose tissue). To regulate cellular and organismal
energetics, lipids must be trafficked to other organelles where they are consumed by fatty acid oxidation or
enzymatically altered to maintain membrane structure. Dysregulation of cellular lipid metabolism is a common
feature of metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The VPS13 or repeating beta groove (RBG) family of proteins- containing
ATG2A/B- comprises proteins thought to partake in pipe-like, bulk lipid transport between two membranes.
Deletion of ATG2 and two of its known binding partners lead to massive accumulation of LDs, defects in
lipoprotein biogenesis, and full-blown NASH. ATG2 localizes primarily to LDs, and our group has recently
demonstrated that the protein can facilitate bulk lipid transfer in vitro. Loss of ATG2 blocks fluorescent fatty
acid movement from the LD to mitochondria through yet undefined mechanisms. However, whether ATG2
directly participates in lipid transport at the LD and how other organelles and protein machinery partake in this
process is not known. In this proposal, I outline a strategy to directly test ATG2 mediated lipid transport at the
LD, identify the membranes that participate in lipid transport at the LD, and mechanistically define the proteins
that cooperate in lipid transport.
This project is structured to maximize progress toward my training goals in in vitro biochemistry, assay design,
and quantitative image analysis, thereby equipping me with a full set of technical and intellectual skills to
generate mechanistic explanations to complex biological questions. Accordingly, I place a strong focus on in
vitro biochemistry, cell-based assays, and automated image analysis. In aim 1, I draw heavily on the expertise
of the Melia and Reinisch labs to directly test for lipid transport activity of ATG2 at the LD using a combination
of newly published and newly engineered in vitro lipid transport assays and cell-based assays of LD
accumulation. In aim 2, I build on an APEX proximity labeling approach validated in the Melia lab to identify
proteins and membranes that ATG2 links to the LD. In aim 3, I employ a wide range of cell-based assays,
binding assays, and automated image analysis to determine which proteins mechanistically cooperate with
ATG2 to move lipids at the LD. This project will pioneer new approaches to test lipid transport in VPS13/RBG
family proteins and it will elucidate novel mechanisms of lipid transfer at the LD."
10890722,"Active surveillance (AS) is the preferred management option for low risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients who
would benefit from conservative treatment. However, due to the lack of reliable methods in the initial clinical
evaluation to identify true low-risk PCa patients for AS enrollment and during AS monitoring to detect a rising
risk of progression, patients who could benefit from conservative management through AS are often over-treated,
yet at the same time patients initially chosen for AS with a missed high-risk disease are under-treated. The goal
of the proposed EDRN Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) is to develop and validate in vitro diagnostic
multivariate index assays (IVDMIA) that combine a panel of biomarkers into a single-valued numerical index with
the intended use for the clinical unmet needs for 1) assisting in the preoperative assessment of PCa
aggressiveness and decision for enrollment into AS; and 2) detecting a rising risk of progression during AS to
triage patients for additional and possibly more invasive procedures for needed disease reclassification. The
objective for the IVDMIA development is to improve specificity while maintaining a high negative predictive value
in order to safely enroll more patients with true low-risk PCa into AS and reduce the number of unnecessary
biopsies and or costly workup procedures for patients in AS. To achieve this goal, we propose an integrated
BCC at the JHU consisting of a multi-disciplinary team including PIs from current EDRN BDL (Dr. Hui Zhang)
and BRL (Dr. Daniel W. Chan), and a previous CVC (Dr. Alan Partin). The targeted population is JHU AS patients
with >20 years of enrollment and clinical follow-up. Our team has many years of experience in biomarker
discovery, verification, validation, and translation into clinical diagnostics and the development of IVDMIA, e.g.
OVA1, the 1st proteomics IVDMIA cleared by the FDA (2009). We plan to take advantage of the serum
biomarkers already discovered for aggressive PCa from our current BDL and BRL and begin the verification and
validation in the targeted AS population by our BRL. In parallel, our BDL will focus on the discovery of new
candidate serum, urine and tissue biomarkers by applying cutting edge technologies to the AS population, such
as mass spectrometry based high throughput proteomics, protein modifications, and single cell analysis of laser-
capture-microdissected tissues. We plan to combine these biomarkers into IVDMIAs. Finally, we will work with
our industry partners to translate these IVDMIAs into CLIA certified and/or FDA cleared/approved clinical
diagnostics. We believe with these innovative, yet, practical approaches, our BCC offers the best opportunity to
make significant contributions to the EDRN network and address the critical clinical unmet needs for PCa
patients. If the over-treatment, under-treatment, decrease in unnecessary biopsies, and increase in biopsy
accuracy can be successfully addressed, the morbidities associated with PCa diagnosis and treatment can be
significantly decreased, while enhancing the detection and treatment of clinically significant PCa. In addition, our
BRL, a CLIA and CAP certified clinical laboratory at JHU, will serve as a resource center for the EDRN network."

The primary goal of the Administrative Core is to provide logistical, organizational, and managerial support for
this Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) and foster the interaction of the BCC with the other EDRN team

that works effectively with all EDRN Centers and aligned with NCI goals and priorities. We will have a strong
base of support from the experienced investigators and an internal framework to ensure integrated operations
of the BDL and BRL components, adherence to project and network milestones and timelines, and overall project
success. We will work to ensure the success of the entire EDRN program and will participate in the EDRN

EDRN, and ensure participation in collaborative projects with other laboratories and centers. In summary, we
will leverage the robust leadership structure and collaborative-team work experience of the proposed BCC to
facilitate realization of the overall goals of the EDRN and ensure the success of the BDL and BRL."
10911975,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed effort addresses the need for novel therapeutic tools that improve chronic wound healing outcome. Recent
studies show that patients with diabetic foot ulcers have a 40% recurrence rate within 1 year after treatment and healing,
nearly 60% within 3 years, and 65% within 5 years, while the 5-year mortality rate is exceeded only by lung cancer. Lower
limb wounds in the diabetic population are generally caused by endothelial dysfunction, the leading cause of blood
circulation issues such as peripheral artery disease (PAD) and microvascular disorder. Endothelial dysfunction is often
missed until the symptoms become advanced enough to cause critical limb threatening ischemia (CLTI), ischemic and
neuro-ischemic foot ulcers, wounds, and amputations. In addition, therapeutic strategies for diabetic wound healing are
stymied by their lack of effectiveness in addressing the challenges associated with disruption of pathways involved in the
healing response. The changes in the wound environment include hyperglycemia-related perfusion deficiency, dysfunction
of leukocyte function and accumulation of advanced glycation-end products and disrupted ECM. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a
recently discovered gasotransmitter, has been shown to promote angiogenesis-related behavior in endothelial cells
through activation of pathways that include nitric oxide signaling and the canonical HIF-1 and VEGF-A-mediated
angiogenesis cascade. There is significant evidence linking deficiency in endogenous H2S to endothelial dysfunction and
consequently microvascular disorder and poor perfusion. Systemic administration of (exogenous) H2S donors have been
shown to markedly improve healing rate in ischemic wounds. However, systemic and widespread therapeutic delivery of
H2S can lead to unintended consequences including hypotension, hepatotoxicity, and malignant angiogenesis. This leaves
a significant opportunity for individualizing patient care through targeted, precision delivery of H2S. HEALS™ is a unique
therapeutic system for safe and controlled delivery of H2S within a therapeutic window and only to the wound site where
it matters most. In the SBIR Phase I feasibility study, Exhalix and the University of New Mexico team developed and used
a laboratory version of HEALS™ to perform preliminary animal studies on healing of ischemic flap wounds in Sprague-
Dawley rats. It was shown that sustained, local infusion of H2S dramatically improved angiogenesis, vascularization,
perfusion, and healing effectiveness over normal healing. In contrast, H2S deficient wounds created by infusion of an H2S
inhibitor, PAG, resulted in the development of markedly higher tissue necrosis over baseline healing conditions. During
the proposed SBIR Phase II renewal studies, we intend to continue the development of advanced prototypes of HEALS™.
These prototypes will be tested for safety and efficacy with healthy and diabetic rats of both sexes at the University of
New Mexico, as well as miniature swine at Texas A&M University. We anticipate that successful development and
validation of HEALS™ during Phase II will lead to Phase IIB clinical studies and commercialization of the technology."

 The FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE provides an exciting opportunity to test a system-level approach for
promoting the next generation of NIH-funded health scientists through engagement at the macro, meso, and
micro levels. As described in our Overall Core, our strategy involves developing and implementing this model
at Florida State University or FSU (macro) within our Equity Research Corner (meso) to foster research and
professional development of our new URM faculty (micro) to produce an evidence-based approach that can be
replicated in other FSU departments and hiring units. With evidence, this strategy will contribute to significant
systemic and sustainable institutional culture change over baseline toward inclusive excellence at the faculty,
cohort/center, and institution level. The Macro level includes changes to the institution and the broader culture
at FSU. The Meso level focuses on the Equity Research Corner and the cohort itself and building a cohesive
and supportive environment to support productivity and retention. The micro level builds skills and resilience in
the individual faculty member. To that end, we propose three specific aims: (1) Re-align institutional practices
to support The FIRST Cohort’s promotion and tenure to ensure credit for collaborative work completed as a
cluster, consideration of unique aspects of fields of study, and protection from undue administrative burden
(Macro); (2) Engage The FIRST Cohort as a group in activities to foster an environment of social acceptance,
belonging, and inclusion (Meso); and (3) Develop and implement integrated individual research and career
development plans and mentoring plans for The FIRST Cohort. Our approach includes strategies at each of
these levels for greatest public health impact that will be sustainable beyond the project period. Through
targeting positive change in the institution, the cohort, and the individual, The FIRST Cohort will gain a wealth
of knowledge and experience and concrete skills sets to cultivate and enhance their own personal scientific
career and trajectory and contribute to self-sustaining improvements in diversity and inclusive excellence at
FSU."

 We will apply a systems-theory approach that leverages participatory techniques, archival data, and
sustainable infrastructure to establish, monitor, and report on The FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE. Traditional
system-theory approaches with cutting-edge participatory approaches and common element themes in concert
with the Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) to collect data that benefits the participants in The
FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE, informs the FSU community, and leads to a more diverse and productive scientific
community.
 The purpose of the evaluation will be to carry out an innovative formative (process) and summative
(outcome) approaches to monitoring and reporting on the FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE. Recent research on the
evaluation of collaborative health-science centers finds that for (1) an evaluation to be successful, all
stakeholders must have significant engagement, participation, and commitment to the evaluation; (2) include a
comprehensive logic model; and (3) include participation of the evaluator in leadership and core meetings to
facilitate continuous feedback. The Evaluation Core will meet these recommendations and be responsible for

10925298,"Project Summary/Abstract Potentiometric Probes
The overall goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to commercialize tools, invented by the
founders of Potentiometric Probe, LLC, for high-fidelity optical recording of electrical activity in
cardiac cells, tissues, and whole hearts. Potentiometric Probes develops organic
voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) that convert the changes in voltage across cell membranes to
visible changes in fluorescence. Instead of individual electrodes, this technology enables the
use of sensitive high-speed cameras, where each pixel can be considered an electrode, for
massively parallel high throughput screening, or for high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of
electrical signal propagation. Importantly, our VSDs are unique in enabling dual-wavelength
ratiometric recording of electrical activity; this is particularly important for cardiac studies
because it eliminates contraction-induced motion artifacts, permitting high-fidelity records of the
action potential waveform. Human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and tissues
derived from them are increasingly being used for research and development purposes,
including screening new drugs for cardiotoxicity, and in the future may be used for “personalized
medicine” and the analysis of patient-derived cells. We believe high throughput recording of
accurate action potential waveforms from hiPSC-CMs and tissues will be a major market for the
proposed technology. Ultimately, the technology may also be applied clinically for
high-resolution imaging of action potential propagation in the heart. In this proposal,
Potentiometric Probes will synthesize a set of stable, non-toxic ratiometric VSDs with a broad
selection of spectral windows, allowing accurate recordings even from beating hearts. The
performance of these VSDs will also be fully characterized and validated for their compatibility
with sensitive cell lines for both long-term and high-throughput recordings."
10929326,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Each year, ~200,000 newborns worldwide, 80-85% of whom require surgical intervention, are afflicted with
congenital conditions that cause impaired growth of the skull or mandible, leading to abnormalities that affect
breathing, hearing, speech, visual function, neurologic development, and mastication. Unfortunately, current
surgical treatments, including endoscopic surgery, open reconstruction, and distraction osteogenesis (DO),
suffer inherent drawbacks, impacting outcomes. A better solution is needed for this vulnerable patient population.
DO is a widely recognized treatment modality that harnesses the body’s natural ability to regenerate bone in
order to correct skeletal deficiencies and defects. While still emerging for craniomaxillofacial (CMF) applications,
surgeons have shown the utility of DO for restoring functional discrepancies in patients with craniofacial
differences. The technique of DO involves surgical placement of one or more distractors, which are devices
used to slowly separate two opposing bony fragments at an osteotomy site, to gradually lengthen and reshape
the affected bone and stimulate new bone growth. However, DO is not without shortcomings. First, all current
distractors have an external component for manual expansion. The external component significantly increases
patient risk for complications such as infection (35%), device dislodgement (3.0%), increased analgesic use, and
scarring (15.6%). Second, since the burdensome responsibility for manual expansion lies with the caregiver,
treatment noncompliance (4.7%) is a serious issue, introducing vulnerabilities ranging from inconsistent device
expansion to complete treatment failure. Therefore, DO necessitates extensive physician clinic time and patient
radiation exposure to monitor therapeutic progress and thus has not been widely adopted in the CMF skeleton
despite recognition of potential advantages over endoscopic surgery (narrower indication for use) and open
reconstruction (more invasive, longer anesthesia time, higher blood transfusion rate, longer hospital stay).
The Ostiio distraction system addresses many of the issues associated with DO treatment as the first fully
subcutaneous, programmable DO system for the CMF skeleton. At a high level, the Ostiio distraction system
leverages magnetic coupling to transfer torque from the hand-held driver (HHD) to the implant, thereby
expanding the implant in a contactless fashion. This novel approach will markedly reduce infection, scarring, and
manipulation noncompliance. In addition, because the design uniquely permits wireless communication between
the implant and HHD, it will enable physicians to better control and monitor treatment progress.
This Phase II proposal aims to a) achieve design freeze of the integrated Ostiio distraction system, incorporating
design improvements to ensure device biocompatibility and functionality throughout active distraction, and b)
demonstrate the system can be used safely and effectively to perform a complete distraction protocol in vivo in
standard animal model. Successful demonstration of this outcome will satisfy key validation performance testing
requirements for FDA submission and 510(k) clearance and open a path to widespread clinical adoption."

10906877,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 1
MindCrowd: Precision Aging Cognitive Assessment Through a Web-based Network
The overarching goal of the Precision Aging Network (PAN) is to close the gap between cognitive
healthspan and human lifespan. We propose that this goal will be best achieved through the use of precision
medicine-based approaches to help address individualized susceptibilities to age-related cognitive decline
(ARCI) as well as to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRDs). A critical waypoint on the
path to this precision approach is the study of a large, diverse cohort of normally aging adults to help us better
characterize the multitude of factors – demographic, health, medical, lifestyle, and molecular – that may be
predictive of altered risk for ARCI, AD, and ADRD. To achieve this, the PAN has established four Projects that
will recruit and study such a cohort, thereby initiating these next steps toward an eventual “Precision Aging”
approach. Project 1 plays a critical role in this venture via the continued recruitment and expansion of a large,
diverse internet-based cohort. Additionally, Project 1 will empower the selective recruitment of specific
participants for in-depth face-to-face characterization by Project 2 as well as contribute to the novel biomarker
discoveries in Project 3, and the predictive model development approaches in Project 4.
Project 1 will expand our existing internet-based MindCrowd study as follows; (a) increase the enrollment of
understudied demographics including Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic Black participants, (b) enlarge the
web-based test battery to cover additional domains of cognitive functions, and (c) conduct on-going two-year
longitudinal assessments using the expanded test battery. The study site (located at www.mindcrowd.org), in
operation since January 2013, has already recruited over 213,000 individuals from across the country. The
cognitive tasks are available through the study site in both Spanish and English, and all future tasks –
developed in collaboration with the Cognitive Assessment and Neuroimaging (CAN) Core E – will be
developed as bi-lingual versions as well. We have successfully demonstrated an ability to collect additional
self-report survey data as well as blood biospecimens and molecular genetic data from these individuals, even
though few participants from this web-based cohort have been seen in-person. Together this demonstrates the
importance and feasibility of using the internet to achieve the goal of studying large and diverse samples to
power the development of a precision medicine clinical approach.
Acquiring the proposed large, diverse cross-sectional and longitudinal data sets will enable us to answer the
central research questions proposed by the PAN. Additionally, the data obtained by the PAN will be openly
available via regular releases during the granting period in order to be fully available to the national research
community studying cognitive aging, AD, and ADRD."
10906882,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 2 Aging Healthy Together: Profiles of Resilience and Risk
Project 2 will obtain biomarkers related to four areas of risk for age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) and
cognitive decline, including Cardiovascular Insufficiency, Glucose Dysregulation, Inflammatory Profile, and
Immune Dysfunction. We will determine whether profiles of risk and resilience in these four areas predict
cognitive functioning among older adults and identify optimal predictive models for three race-ethnic groups –
Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White. We will also determine whether the influence of
these predictors on age-related cognition is mediated by functional and structural MRI measures, including
diffusion MRI, resting state connectivity, perfusion, and hippocampal volume. In-depth assessments will be
obtained from 1,620 participants, ages 50 to 79, at four clinical sites – Tucson (University of Arizona), Atlanta
(Emory University), Miami (University of Miami), and Baltimore (Johns Hopkins University) – including
demographics and lifestyle factors, psychosocial measures, biometric measures, blood biomarkers, MRI,
carotid ultrasound, and genomics. Biomarkers and genetic risks will be used to predict individual differences in
cognitive functioning (cross-sectionally) in three domains – memory, executive functions, and processing
speed. Preliminary evidence for the impact of risk factors on longitudinal cognitive change will also be
obtained.
The proposed project is a critical step in achieving the ultimate goal of the Precision Aging Network (PAN) to
develop a novel precision medicine diagnostic and prognostic system that will match an individual’s risk profile
with a customized therapeutic and healthy lifestyle plan to maintain cognitive health across the lifespan. This
goal requires understanding how categories of risk and their specific risk factors relate to cognitive functioning
in order to identify novel targets for intervention and create therapeutic approaches for ARCI and cognitive
decline. Matching cognitive healthspan with human lifespan will improve productivity and quality of life, extend
independent living, and decrease the risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).

10906888,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 3 Precision Biomarkers of Brain Health
Project 3 entitled “Precision biomarkers of brain health, age-related cognitive impairment and AD” will
evaluate novel CSF biomarkers of brain pathways that impact human cognitive health across lifespan. We
have selected three biochemical and cellular pathways that have strong rationale from fundamental
neuroscience research and recent deep-proteomic analyses to play a role in resilience, organismal longevity,
and redox homeostasis. These pathways also have a strong link to fundamental mechanisms of cognition and
are disrupted in aging and AD brain. Pathways are designated based on key molecules that center each of
three Aims. Aim 1 focuses on NPTX2 (Neuronal Pentraxin 2), which plays an essential role in adaptive
inhibitory circuit function in neocortex and hippocampus to maintain homeostasis of excitation/inhibition.
NPTX2 is down regulated with age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) and disrupted in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Aim 2 focuses on mTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target
of rapamycin complex 1), which mediates metabolic homeostasis in neurons, is implicated in aging and
longevity, and is upregulated in AD brain where it is thought to inhibit autophagy and contribute to aberrant
accumulation of proteins. Aim 3 focuses on GDE2 (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2), which
regulates extracellular proteases that control -secretase (ADAM10) processing of APP as well as a host of
proteins that are tethered to the plasma membrane by GPI linkage. GDE2 enzymatic function requires dynamic
control of redox. Cleaved substrates accumulate in CSF and provide an indication of GDE2 function and redox
homeostasis. We have developed parallel reaction monitoring mass spectroscopy (PRM-MS) to quantitate
proteins linked to each of these pathways. These proteins constitute mechanism-based biomarkers that will be
assayed in CSF from the cohort of subject samples from Project 2. We estimate this will include ~800 samples
from approximately equal numbers of Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic Black individuals
in the age range of 50-79. Clinical data from Project 2 examining cognitive function and brain
structure/functional connectivity, together with determinants of risk factors including cardiovascular
insufficiency, glucose dysregulation, inflammation and immune dysfunction will be evaluated in Project 4
together with blood and sweat biomarkers. Studies will identify cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations
that will provide insight into the aging process and provide a rational basis for precision medicine of aging."
10849808,"ABSTRACT
Large scale genome annotation consortia such as ENCODE, Epigenomics Roadmap, and
others have identified millions of putative regulatory elements. We now need to focus efforts on
comprehensively characterizing and quantifying the function of those elements, and noncoding
variants that map within these regions, on gene expression and cell phenotypes. Our long-term
goal is to assign function to every regulatory element and noncoding variant in the human
genome, understand how that function changes in different contexts, and use that information to
better understand cell fitness, disease mechanisms, cell lineage specification, and tissue
homeostasis. To accomplish this goal, we have developed multiple novel high-throughput
CRISPR-based technologies for characterizing the function of putative gene regulatory
elements by perturbing their activity in their endogenous, native context. We have coupled these
methods with single-cell RNA-seq to identify the target gene(s) for each regulatory element. We
have also developed dCas9 effector mice to characterize elements in their natural in vivo
context. In addition, we have developed population-based high-throughput reporter assays
(POP-STARR) to characterize the impact of noncoding genetic variation across the entire
genome. The objective of this proposal is to apply and share our compendium of
complementary, robust, scaleable, and well-characterized methods by working collaboratively to
support the IGVF Consortium goals of understanding how genomes and genomic variation
function and orchestrate complex phenotypes. Our track record in developing, applying, and
sharing these high-throughput characterization methods, as well as providing access to all data,
supports that we will be successful in accomplishing our objective via the following specific
aims: Aim 1. Characterize all gene regulatory elements essential for cell survival. Aim 2.
Characterize all gene regulatory elements essential to cell lineage specification. Aim 3.
Characterize all gene regulatory elements in select eQTL regions. Aim 4. Characterize all non-
coding elements essential to tissue homeostasis in a mouse model. We will make all data
immediately available, as well as share comprehensive protocols, reagents, and analysis tools
to the scientific community. Together, the diverse approaches of this Characterization Center will
lead to transformative progress in understanding the role of regulatory elements and noncoding
variants across many diverse phenotypes."
10900589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our proposal investigates a mechanism underlying innate immune dysfunction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
the leading cause of leukemia-related deaths in the U.S. The innate immune system naturally defends against
malignancy, however AML evades immunosurveillance to drive disease progression. Natural killer (NK) cells are
the primarily innate lymphoid cell (ILC) responsible for anti-tumor immune surveillance, and reduced NK cell
function both in de novo AML and in the post-transplant setting is correlated with poor outcomes. We have
recently discovered that AML patients carry a fundamental defect in NK cell development leading to specific
depletion of a sub-population of NK cells with critical roles in coordinating innate and adaptive immune
responses, as well as mature NK cell development and function.
We have shown that NK cells develop from a common innate lymphoid cell precursor (ILCP), which generates
a series of NK developmental intermediates (NKDIs) leading to mature, cytotoxic NK cells. ILCPs also give rise
to the other members of the ILC family, a diverse group of non-cytotoxic, cytokine-producing “helper” ILCs that
are known to be pro-tumorigenic. Our preliminary studies show that AML disrupts the NK lineage, shifting
production towards helper ILCs. As these populations all stem from the ILCP, this suggests AML is acting on
ILCPs to alter lineage fate specification. Lineage specification occurs through carefully controlled activities of
transcription factors that modify the epigenomic landscape generating stable cell type-specific gene expression
patterns. Our preliminary studies have uncovered an aberrant, helper ILC-like DNA methylation signature in
NKDIs isolated from AML patients and following leukemic cell co-culture. One key transcription factor is the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which we have found shifts the helper ILC/NK ratio in the presence of AHR ligands
ectopic produced by AML cells. We propose a strategy where the combination of AHR inhibition and
hypomethylating agents (HMAs) guides development to restore NK cell differentiation from the ILCP.
In this proposal, we will determine how AML drives this fate decision and promotes the generation of helper ILCs
by performing detailed epigenetic and functional analyses of ILCPs isolated from normal donors and AML
patients, including investigation in an immunocompetent murine AML model. We will investigate functional and
epigenetic poising of lineage fate including the role of AHR. Secondly, we will determine the relationship of the
NK cell defect in AML patients to epigenetic programming and disease progression, and directly test the impact
of HMAs on ILCP and NKDI development. We will also determine the preclinical efficacy of combining both HMA
and a novel AHR inhibitor to restore normal NK cell epigenetic programming and enhance NK cell generation to
improve outcomes in preclinical models of AML. Maintaining functionally mature NK cells and supporting
immunosurveillance is critical to long-term disease control, these studies aim to gain a novel understanding of
how AML evades innate immunity and investigate strategies to restore anti-tumor immune surveillance patients."
10909165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-sensitive (HCN) channels are critical determinants of
membrane potential and excitability in many types of cells throughout the body, including cardiac pacemaker
cells, central and peripheral neurons, many types of sensory cells, and interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon and
bladder. Consistent with this widespread distribution, HCN channels have been identified as potential drug
targets for treatment of a long list of conditions including angina, heart failure, epilepsy, neuropathic pain,
depression, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neurogenic bladder. However, the single FDA-approved HCN
channel drug (ivabradine) is limited, owing in part to its non-selective block of all four mammalian HCN
channels isoforms and its off-target block of Kv11.1 (hERG), Nav1.5, and Cav1.2 channels. The need for new,
isoform-specific HCN channel activators and inhibitors has been widely recognized but the lack of information
about allosteric and isoform-specific regulation of HCN channels is a roadblock to the development of novel
therapeutics.
 The long-term goals of this project are to identify naturally-occurring, allosteric regulators of HCN channels
and to understand their mechanisms of action. Achieving these goals will advance understanding of the
physiological and molecular functions of HCN channels and aid in the development of new HCN channel
drugs. The current proposal focuses on our exciting discovery of LRMP and IRAG as two novel, isoform-
specific protein interaction partners of HCN4 channels. LRMP and IRAG are homologous ER transmembrane
proteins that have large cytoplasmic domains. Importantly, LRMP and IRAG only modulate the HCN4 isoform.
Moreover, the two proteins have opposing effects on HCN4: LRMP causes a loss-of-function (LOF) by
decreasing the canonical depolarizing shift in voltage-dependence induced by cAMP while IRAG causes gain-
of-function (GOF) by shifting the basal voltage dependence of HCN4 to more positive potentials. Preliminary
data establish that IRAG is co-expressed with HCN4 in cardiac pacemaker cells. Proposed aims will identify
interaction sites on the three proteins, determine the molecular mechanisms for the distinct and isoform-
specific effects, and evaluate their role in pacemaker cells."
10925173,"Project Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable childhood brainstem tumor with an intimate
connection between developmental context and tumor etiology. We and others identified histone H3
K27M mutations in 80% of DIPG and midline high-grade glioma. Multiple lines of evidence from our
group and others show oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) as the predominant cell-type expression
signature in DIPG. It remains unclear why the K27M selective advantage is so strongly associated with
midline and hindbrain development, and spatiotemporal differences in the impact of K27M on
oligodendrocyte lineage cell state has not been investigated. We will employ genetically engineered mice
(GEM) in which H3.3 K27M is regulated by the endogenous promoter to study regional and age-
dependent effects of epigenetic dysregulation and tumorigenesis in the physiological context of a full
developing brain. We hypothesize that the cell state in which K27M confers a selective advantage
remains essential for tumor maintenance. Therefore, regulators of cell state may be dependencies for
DIPG, even if their expression is not directly dysregulated by K27M. We will evaluate candidate K27M
targets and regulators of OPC cell state to determine if these can override the effects of K27M in
developing oligodendrocyte lineage and inhibit DIPG growth and/or survival. We will also leverage
multiple GEM models combining relevant DIPG mutations to investigate spatiotemporal selection in early
stages of gliomagenesis and later patterns of glioma invasion in the context of 3-dimensional brain
structure. Other recurrent DIPG mutations are potential therapeutic targets including ACVR1 mutations,
found exclusively in DIPG, and PI3K pathway mutations, found in pediatric high-grade gliomas from all
locations and arising as later events in tumorigenesis. We will use patient-derived DIPG cell lines and
orthotopic xenografts and brain-penetrant selective pathway inhibitors to determine the independent and
cooperative effects of dysregulated ACVR1 and PI3K/mTOR signaling on DIPG tumor growth and to
investigate heterogeneity in therapeutic response. The proposed studies are well-integrated with the
overall programmatic goal to improve understanding and treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and
medulloblastoma, which cause devastating mortality and morbidity in children. Integrating themes
pursued in this Project and other Projects in the P01 include investigations of epigenetic dysregulation
(with Project 2), connections between disrupted development and tumorigenesis (with Projects 3 and 4),
and therapeutic vulnerabilities of pediatric brain tumors (with Projects 2 and 4). The Research Cores will
provide expert support in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (Core B), and Neuropathology (Core C)."

10909855,"PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity
worldwide. Defects in the aortic arch artery (AAA) and its major branches are among the most severe
malformations that cause CHD. The AAA and its branches arise through the asymmetrical remodeling of the
three bilaterally symmetrical pairs of the pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs), 3, 4, and 6. Defects in the left 4th PAA
are particularly devastating, leading to the interruption of the aortic arch type B (IAA-B). IAA-B disrupts the
systemic circulation and is lethal after birth. The genetic causes of IAA-B are mostly unknown, underscoring a
critical need to understand genes and mechanisms regulating the formation of the left 4th PAA. PAA formation is
a multi-step process: PAA endothelial cell (EC) progenitors arise in the second heart field (SHF) by E7.5 and
populate pharyngeal arches within the next two days, culminating in the formation of a plexus of small SHF-
derived blood vessels between by E10.0 in the 4th arch. Following its formation, the EC plexus gradually remodels
by merging in the middle of the 4th arch into one large vessel, the 4th PAA. The deletion of Fn1 or integrin a5b1
in the Isl1 lineages results in the defective formation of the right and left 4th PAA and leads to IAA-B. My lab has
demonstrated that cell-ECM interactions regulated by Fn1 and integrin a5b1 function reiteratively, at multiple
stages to regulate the 4th PAAs’ formation and remodeling in a cell-type-specific manner. In this grant, we present
data implicating Fn1 and integrin a5b1 in maintaining the ipsilateral patterning of the SHF-derived vasculature
in the pharynx at E9.5. Our data show that the deletion of Fn1 or integrin a5b1 in the Isl1 lineage disrupts
symmetrical allocation of SHF-derived cells to the left and right pharyngeal arches, causing an imbalance in the
number of SHF-derived cells on the left vs. the right. At a later stage, between E10 and E10.75, Fn1 and integrin
a5b1 regulate vascular patterning by mediating the remodeling of the pharyngeal EC plexus into the 4th PAA.
Our published data show that Fn1 and integrin a5b1 mediate the plexus-to-PAA remodeling in an EC-non-cell-
autonomous manner by regulating the expression of negative vascular guidance cues and the activation of
VEGFR2 and Erk1/2 in the 4th arch. To determine the mechanisms by which Fn1 and integrin a5b1 regulate the
patterning of SHF-derived vasculature, we will use live imaging, quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy,
genetic epistasis analysis, and single-cell RNAseq to test two hypotheses 1) that Fn1 and integrin a5b1
expressed in the Isl1 lineage maintain the balanced allocation of SHF-derived cells in the pharynx by regulating
ECM assembly and ipsilateral SHF cell migration and 2) that Fn1 and integrin a5b1 regulate plexus-to-PAA
remodeling by modulating the expression of EC guidance cues and the activation of Erk1/2. Completing the
proposed studies will provide essential insights into the functions of cell-ECM interactions in the development of
SHF-derived vasculature and CHD pathogenesis."

research findings, address all priorities (required and secondary research elements) detailed in the program
announcement, and will produce deliverables for the clinicians in the field.
The four infrastructure Cores (Biomarkers, Neuroimaging, Data and Biostatistics, Clinical Studies) will work in
concert to accomplish three overarching, interrelated aims:
Aim 1. Transition and expand CENC to LIMBIC -- Enroll and expand sizes of relevant cohorts of Veterans and
Servicemembers; expand data points collected; collect data in accordance with established guidelines; and
identify and describe key characteristics of populations to guide rigorous studies on the nature and degree of
mTBI late effects in combat Vs/SMs over time.
Aim 2. Comorbidities & Neurologic sequela -- Determine prevalence and associations of mTBI with important
comorbidities and neurologic sequela, such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, pain, psychological
health including PTSD, and neurosensory deficits. Determine nature and degree of mTBI late effects over time.
Aim 3. Phenotypes -- Identify characteristics (e.g., repetitive mTBI, deployment-only mTBI, frequent low level
blast or other subconconcussive head/brain impact exposure, baseline neurocognitive deficits, presence of
neurologic signs, presence of symptoms), pathophysiology, biomarkers, and subpopulations (e.g., women) that

10799696,"Despite many available evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to prevent HIV, new infections and mortality in
Georgia have increased by 30% and 335%, respectively. Georgia is a LMIC with HIV prevalence of 0.4% and
concentrated in key at-risk populations (KAPs) like MSM and PWID, where the epidemic is growing fastest.
Though all the elements of the HIV prevention toolkit are present in Georgia (voluntary counseling/testing [VCT],
pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], opioid agonist therapies [OAT], syringe services programs [SSPs] and
treatment as prevention [TasP]), they are markedly under-scaled in terms of coverage and, importantly, are not
adequately implemented in KAPs. In addition to suboptimal implementation of HIV prevention, Georgia’s ability
to control its epidemic has been hampered by its lack of expertise in biostatistics. This expertise is need not only
to analyze a rich array of databases that could guide more effective implementation in real-time, but in its ability
to rigorously design, implement and analyze data from implementation trials, which are urgently needed in the
Georgian context where the epidemic is concentrated in KAPs and where stigma and discrimination abounds.
To meet this need, we propose to develop and institutionalize the Georgian Implementation Science Fogarty
Training (GIFT) program at Ilia State University (ISU), the leading research institution in Georgia, in collaboration
with Yale University. GIFT will leverage the combined resources of Yale University (Medicine and Public Health)
with ISU, through provision of long-, mid-, and short-term training. GIFT will focus on HIV prevention through
advanced training in biostatistics and implementation research methods. Specifically, GIFT adheres to three core
aims, including to: 1) train 4 GIFT faculty in Year 1, followed by 6 doctoral students recruited in Years 2 and 3,
who will focus their training on HIV prevention and who will receive advanced training in biostatistics and
implementation research methods through a hybrid learning program; 2) transfer knowledge and build capacity
within ISU, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe and Central Asia through short-term training at a Summer
Bootcamp; and 3) develop the HIV Implementation Science and Biostatistical Methods Resource Hub to
consolidate resources and build partnerships for better population outcomes. All doctoral students will be paired
with ISU and Yale mentors and gain real-world experience analyzing data from HIV implementation trials now
underway or completed at Yale. Training resources will be contextualized for the HIV epidemic in Georgia.
Building on prior experience with Fogarty training programs and existing successful collaborations and
partnerships between Yale and ISU, we are poised to train the next generation of public health researchers more
effectively, recognizing the need for better implementation with HIV prevention in KAPs. GIFT will provide
advanced training to produce a phased transfer of knowledge, skills and expertise from Yale to ISU over the
course of five years, resulting in a model curriculum for training at Georgia’s top research university, with strong
support by regional and local faculty and commitment by community, government and international partnerships."
10930833,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deep proteomic and metabolomic profiling of biological tissues is an overarching goal of modern biological and
biomedical research. It remains a key – and conspicuous – missing component from the full spectrum of -omics
that mainly capitalize on next-generation sequencing of DNA and RNA. Today's existing methodologies for
proteomic and metabolomic analysis currently lag far behind the capabilities of tools for genomics and
transcriptomics, both in terms of depth-of-coverage and throughput. The proposed effort will meet this challenge
by advancing revolutionary new methods for label-free single-molecule proteomic and metabolomic profiling and
combining them with novel methods for sub-cellular spatial analysis. Protein concentrations within a mammalian
cell span ~8 orders of magnitude; in human blood serum this increases to ~11 orders. Yet, within these
immensely complex milieus, even the most sparsely expressed proteins are important. Cellular signaling, gene
regulation, early responses to exogenous biological stimuli, and disease onset all generally result in the
expression of small copy numbers of proteins. It is thus essential both to discover rare cellular proteins and to
attain holistic proteomic maps – but these goals remain far beyond present technological capabilities. Further,
deciphering the instantaneous state of an organism's proteome – and, especially, observing its post-translational
modifications (PTMs) as they dynamically evolve in response to cellular function, stress, and disease – will
provide transformational knowledge for many fields.
Deep proteome discovery will tackle the cellular proteome's complexity, allowing identification of proteins over
its entire dynamic range of concentration – from the most prolifically expressed cellular proteins to those only
sparsely expressed with a few copies per cell. This project's success will enable deep spatial profiling of the
cellular proteome and metabolome with high throughput and, thereby, discovery of rare cellular proteins and
metabolites. It will fundamentally change the resolution of protein analysis down to the level of individual
molecules in subcellular compartments. Its achievement will complete the constellation of single-cell -omics,
thereby broadly advancing research worldwide in fields that span from fundamental biology to the frontiers of
clinical medicine.
In the proposed effort, existing and well-validated techniques for spatially-resolved tissue sampling will be
pushed downward into the sub-cellular realm. Scaling these methods downward is feasible now solely because
of the single-molecule resolution of the proposed approach. This project builds upon a significant body of recent
efforts focused upon creating instrumentation for deep profiling of the single-cell proteome. The effort proposed
here will further advance these achievements – and will incorporate high-resolution tissue-sampling methods to
deliver, with minimal loss, biological analytes to instrumentation enabling single-molecule analysis. Pursued
together, these efforts will enable the first realization of spatial proteomics with sub-cellular resolution."

Coapt, LLC and Liberating Technologies, Inc, along with clinical collaborators at the Shirley Ryan
AbilityLab, will systematically develop and evaluate a connected health system for data collected from
upper limb prosthesis wearers using myoelectric control. The system will record wearer data relating
to their daily prosthesis use and functional performance outside the clinic directly from the prosthesis
hardware and through a mobile app which includes virtual game evaluation tasks. These data will be
uploaded to our existing cloud storage platform, where cloud computing algorithms will analyze and
highlight unique trends to provide the patient’s clinician with actionable insights that enable them to
much more easily identify where to focus their therapeutic efforts in a user-friendly, web-based digital
health portal, called the Clinician Dashboard.
The objective of this effort is to improve the standard of care in upper limb prostheses by developing
a commercially viable web portal which interfaces with Coapt’s existing state-of-the-art prosthesis
controller, which is compatible with 400+ combinations of powered hand, wrist and elbow devices.
This project builds on our preliminary development of a connected health system to (Aim 1) refine a
web-based Clinician Dashboard prototype by adding cloud-based analysis of prosthesis use and
performance data using an implementation science-informed design process, and (Aim 2) evaluate
efficacy of the Clinician Dashboard in improving rehabilitation outcomes for new upper limb
myoelectric prosthesis wearers. A formal participatory design process with key stakeholder (clinicians,
patients, and technological experts) input, surveys, and usability assessments will be used to
systematically inform the design and desired content of the Clinician Dashboard. We expect the
Clinician Dashboard will assist clinicians in their clinical decision making for delivering more effective
therapy which will, in turn, improve patient outcomes and accelerate their rehabilitation progress.
The outcomes of this project will be results from a pilot clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the
Clinician Dashboard demonstrating improved rehabilitation outcomes which will support commercial
deployment and marketing of our connected health system. This product will directly address an
important clinician need that will be integrated into clinical practice to benefit the end-user - individuals
with limb loss/absence who opt to use a myoelectric-controlled prosthesis. Our connected health
system aims to improve functional outcomes and ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs),
increased prosthetic use and device satisfaction, and overall improved quality of life.
Access to the Clinician Dashboard as part of a connected health system will be a distinctive feature
of Coapt’s Complete Control system which we expect to also drive sales over our competitors."

Maryland Title: Maryland Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance Project
 CFDA: 93.262
1. SPECIFIC AIMS
 In this proposal, the Maryland Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance project of the
Maryland Department of Health (OHSSP) builds on the success of the prior projects, which have
demonstrated the feasibility and utility of incorporating industry and occupation in various existing state
surveillance systems, provided data on injury and illness through existing occupational health indicators,
and identified important gaps in occupational safety and health data in specific worker populations
(notably, migrant workers). The new proposal focuses on this underserved population with an
innovative approach that looks at an important health condition (asthma) in its totality, seeking
opportunities to pair existing health department activities on home visiting and asthma trigger reduction
with a new complementary approach to employers to identify and reduce triggers in the workers’
occupational and home environments as a continuum. Finally, the new proposal includes and expanded
project that builds on work from the previous project period, to address the state’s opioid crisis as it
occurs in Maryland workplaces, with an innovative project that is developing toolkits for employers and
other stakeholders to improve management of opioids in Maryland workplaces. The current proposal
advances that work, completing the toolkits, conducting outreach and technical assistance to implement
the toolkits throughout the State, and an evaluation of the impacts of the toolkits on workplace policies
and management practices. The specific aims of the project are:
 1. Advance occupational epidemiology public health research in occupational health through
 continued production of existing OHIs from existing sources of data and expansion of data
sources;
 2. Broaden the utility of other state surveillance systems by the inclusion of industry and
 occupation in the Maryland Violent Death Reporting System (MVDRS), the State Unintentional
 Drug Overdose Reporting System, the Maryland Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
 (BRFSS), and the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) and/or electronic
 health records;
 3. Enhance the use of data to inform prevention activities in MDH and external stakeholders
 through increased outreach and prevention activities; and
 4. Provide focus on improvement of respiratory disease in migrant workers through an innovative
 collaboration with local health departments, employers, and health care providers, focused on
 the worker’s total environment.
 5. Improve surveillance of opioids in the workplace through the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance
 System (BRFSS), State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS), and the
 Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics
(“ESSENCE”);
 6. Based on stakeholder input, develop toolkits on improving opioids management in Maryland
workplaces;
 7. Recruit employers and workplaces in which to implement and disseminate toolkits to improve
 opioids management in Maryland workplaces; and
 8. Evaluate the effectiveness of the toolkits in altering policies and practices, shifting resources,
 and improving outcomes for individuals with substance use disorders who are in or entering the
workplace."
10894101,"Abstract
Bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by bacteria translocating across injured mucosa are a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality in the 25,000 patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT) in the United States
each year. BSI secondary to translocation of oral organisms through damaged oral mucosaoccurs in nearly 16%
of SCT recipients in the first three weeks after SCT despite current routine oral care. There are currently no
known strategies to prevent post-SCT BSI from the translocation of bacteria through an injured mucosa. There
is a critical need to identify preventive strategies to reduce BSI, and the oral mucosa as a specific route of entry
has not been evaluated. In the absence of such information, SCT patients will continue to develop BSI from
translocation of bacteria from mucosal barrier injury. Our long-term goal is to develop and disseminate clinically
relevant and easily adoptable strategies to prevent BSI and improve outcomes after SCT. The overall objective
of this proposal is to identify a clinically effective strategy to prevent or reduce BSI secondary to bacterial
translocation through injured mucosa in the mouth. The rationale for the study is based on our baseline and pilot
intervention data. The central hypothesis is that dental xylitol use, in addition to current oral care practice, are
effective at reducing BSI from oral organisms, and decreasing the incidence of gingivitis, oral plaque, and oral
ulcerations after SCT. Apart from our preliminary data, we are well-positioned to carry out the proposed work
as we have a multicenter collaborative team consisting of pediatric bone marrow transplant physicians, dentists,
and infectious disease specialists with focus and expertise in microbiome analyses. The following specific aims
are proposed: AIM 1: Determine the effectiveness of twice-daily xylitol-wipe application on reducing BSI from
oral organisms through a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pediatric SCT
recipients. AIM 2: Determine the effectiveness of twice-daily xylitol-wipe application in reducing dental plaque,
mucositis, oral GVHD, and gingival inflammation. AIM 3: Evaluate the influence of twice-daily xylitol-wipe
application on oral microbiome diversity and saliva levels of pathogenic microbial species. The innovation of this
proposal lies in the simplicity and affordability of the intervention. Xylitol is commercially available, inexpensive
($0.15 per application), non-toxic, and can be rapidly adopted into practice. If our hypotheses are proven, xylitol
application could reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with BSI and decrease healthcare-associated
costs of an estimated $40,000 per infection. At the successful completion of the proposed research, our
expectation is to have demonstrated a significant reduction of bacteremia from oral organisms (Aim 1);
decreased oral dental plaque, gingivitis, and oral ulceration (Aim 2); and preserved oral microbiome diversity
and reduction of pathogenic microbial species in the oral cavity in those receiving daily dental xylitol wipe
application (Aim 3) leading to substantial changes to the prevention of BSI in this population."

The goal of this project is to advance to the clinic an oral drug candidate to treat cocaine use disorder (CUD).
An estimated 1.3M persons in the US have CUD, and more than 19K people die each year from overdoses
involving cocaine. There are no approved drug treatments for cocaine abuse. Most individuals seeking
treatment for CUD receive only psychosocial treatments that have high treatment dropout and relapse rates.
Omeros developed a novel class of small molecules that selectively inhibit phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7).
Cocaine inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamine neurotransmitters, eliciting dopamine surges
that is considered the primary mechanism through which cocaine evokes reward and initiates addiction. The
PDE7 class of inhibitors is thought to restore the physiological dopamine phasic-to-tonic ratio that is altered by
chronic exposure to drugs of abuse to reduce craving. The Omeros PDE7 inhibitor, OMS182399, is orally
available with pharmacokinetics that supports once-daily dosing. OMS182399 reduces cocaine seeking in
preclinical animal models of CUD and is safe and tolerable in healthy volunteers. The objective of this U01
project is to advance OMS182399 toward clinical trials for CUD by completing required preclinical interaction/
toxicology studies and then performing a clinical study to test the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary
efficacy of OMS182399 in persons with CUD. This project meets the goals of PAR-19-327 in that it accelerates
the development of a novel oral drug candidate to treat CUD, for which there are no approved drugs.
Aim 1 is to conduct IND-enabling interaction/toxicology studies of OMS182399 in rats and non-human
primates. Although prior studies showed that OMS182399 is safe in rats, cynomolgus monkeys and people,
the FDA requires drug interaction safety studies to ensure that it is safe in people with CUD who may use
cocaine while in treatment. Aim 2 is to prepare and submit an IND application for the clinical trial proposed in
Aim 3. Omeros will write and submit an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA to test
OMS182399 for safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy during concurrent cocaine administration in
persons with CUD. Aim 3 is to conduct a 2-week randomized, single dose, double blind, parallel group, in-
patient clinical study to compare the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of oral OMS182399 to
placebo (vehicle solution) in the treatment of adults with CUD who receive concurrent intravenous cocaine.
Outcomes will be tolerability, safety, subjective preliminary efficacy measures and pharmacokinetics.
Successful completion of this project will lead to a future Phase II clinical proof-of-concept study to advance
OMS182399 toward FDA approval for CUD, which will have vast public health implications."

The GCU will provide comprehensive, end-to-end CLIA-compliant genomic testing and cutting-edge research-
level analysis of patients with MM, CRC, and CHOL who are engaged by the PEU. This testing will be
conducted on diagnostic tumor samples and matched normal tissue from 300 patients for each of the three
cancer types during the WU PE-CGS research program. Additional follow-up samples from 150 of these
patients will also be analyzed during disease progression. Sample processing by the GCU will include nucleic
acid extraction and QC. Diagnostic samples will be analyzed using 250X tumor/normal exome sequencing
(WES) with both somatic and germline analysis for gene-level single nucleotide variants (SNV and
insertion/deletions (indels). Tumor-only WGS (60X) will be performed to detect tumor-associated structural
mutations, and tumor RNA-seq will support, confirm, and extend findings from the DNA-based assays. Tumor
tissue and/or cell-free DNA will also be analyzed with targeted deep sequencing (>10,000X) using unique
molecular indexes (UMI) for sensitive detection and monitoring of tumor-associated mutations. All of these
assays will be performed using CLIA-compliant procedures with integrated quality management practices. The
GCU will also conduct research-level scRNA-Seq, proteomics, and cellular imaging studies on selected
samples to enhance our understanding of these tumor types. Genomic assays will proceed according to a
planned schedule for year-by-year combinations of diagnostic specimens and follow-up collections, with small
numbers of candidates selected for research studies. Results from these assays will be returned to participants
using a tiered reporting system that will depend on participant preference. Tier 1 results will highlight findings
with established clinical relevance obtained from CLIA sequencing of individual participants, including
pathogenic, tumor-associated somatic drivers and inherited mutations that are clinically actionable according to
published guidelines and that will be reported using established categorization for somatic drivers and
pathogenic germline variants, their clinical implications, and possible actions. Participants can also elect to
receive Tier 2 results, which will be comprised of additional mutations from the same CLIA-compliant data that
are identified with advanced methods and are predicted to be clinically relevant via functional annotation, as
well as results from targeted sequencing of follow-up samples for monitoring tumor evolution over time.
Research-level Tier 3 molecular studies may also be provided to participants as aggregate, deidentified reports
that can be used to enhance and extend interpretations of their individualized CLIA results. These results will
also be securely uploaded to the NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) for use by the cancer biology
community. All GCU activities will be coordinated with the PEU and EOU to ensure clarity and consistency
across the WU PE-CGS program."

The overall goal of the Engagement Optimization Unit (EOU) of the Washington University Participant
Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS) is to conduct ongoing and iterative
research to integrate optimal approaches to participant engagement in the recruitment, consent, follow-up and
communication of genomic characterization results. The EOU will optimize the engagement process for genomic
characterization of patients diagnosed with three rare of understudied cancers including those that significantly
impact minority and rural populations (cholangiocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and early onset colorectal
cancer). The outcomes of research conducted within the EOU will be fully integrated with the Participant
Engagement Unit and the Genome Characterization Unit to optimize participant experiences throughout the
genomic research process. The EOU will support the overall mission of WU-PE-CGS through the following aims:
(1) conduct ongoing evaluation of participant engagement and ELSI concerns related to genomic testing among
underserved populations with rare cancers; (2) conduct a randomized controlled trial to optimize the return of
results process; (3) utilize an embedded ethics approach to synthesize and address ELSI issues arising across
all units and the Patient Engagement Advisory Board to optimize participant engagement. The EOU will use an
implementation science framework for the main research objectives. Aim 1 will interview a random sample of
participants at various stages in their study participation (decliners, post-consent, post disclosure). Aim 2 will
expand and test a web-based decision aid to elicit participants' values and preferences for receiving results from
cancer genomic sequencing. Participants will be randomized to intervention (Genomics ADvISOR decision aid)
or control (standard discussion). In Aim 3, will use embedded ethics to explore ELSI concerns that arise when
genetic testing is offered to minority and rural-residing adults with rare cancer. This approach will ensure that
ethical issues arising within components (PEU, EOU and GCU) will be identified and communicated across the
entire center. The innovation of this project brings rigorous implementation science to the otherwise slow
diffusion of guideline driven genetic testing and return of results to cancer patients. We will focus our engagement
optimization research on rural and high-risk minority populations that are under-represented in cancer genomic
analyses and have often been omitted from implementation science directed studies in the area of genomic
medicine."

10895357,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
MYC oncoproteins (including c-MYC, L-MYC and N-MYC) have been implicated in up to 70% of all human
cancers. In prostate cancer, elevated levels of MYC protein expression are observed across all grades. In
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), there is evidence of further upregulation of c-MYC levels with gene
amplification occurring in 45% of cases. In late-stage, therapy-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC),
N-MYC is overexpressed in 40% of cases. In preclinical studies, inhibition of MYC can effectively kill CRPC and
NEPC cells. A viable therapeutic strategy to inhibit MYC is therefore likely to have a significant impact on this
disease and to fulfill the ongoing need for novel impactful therapies spanning the spectrum of castration resistant
prostate cancer. Despite its recognition as an attractive cancer target, MYC has proved difficult to target, and
there are currently no clinically viable small molecule MYC inhibitors (MYCi) available. By employing a
pharmacophore-based in silico screen of a large chemical library (32 million compounds) coupled to a rapid in
vivo screen in mice, we identified a series of novel small molecule inhibitors. These MYC inhibitors are highly
drug-like and have shown excellent pharmacokinetic, toxicological and anti-tumor activity profiles in MYC-driven
models of prostate cancer and leukemia. The compounds engage MYC inside cells as shown by the cellular
thermal shift assay (CETSA); disrupt MYC/MAX complex formation which is required for MYC activity; and inhibit
MYC-driven target gene expression. Furthermore, the MYCi compounds enhance phosphorylation of MYC on
threonine-58 (T58P) which promotes MYC degradation via a well-characterized ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Consequently, treatment with MYCi impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. The goals of this project are to
develop the lead MYC inhibitor, MYCi975, for clinical application in the treatment of prostate cancer and to
characterize the mechanisms of MYCi-induced degradation of c-MYC and N-MYC oncoproteins. We will
implement the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to investigate the mechanisms of MYCi975 regulation of c-
MYC and N-MYC phosphorylation and stability and the potential of MYC pT58 as a pharmacodynamic marker.
Aim 2 will assess MYCi anti-tumor efficacy and impact on pharmacodynamic biomarkers in preclinical models
of c-MYC and N-MYC driven prostate cancer. Aim 3 will seek to develop MYCi975 for use in patients by
conducting formal IND-enabling toxicology studies and initiate a phase 1 trial in mCRPC patients.
Impact: Successful completion of these studies could lead to first-in-class therapies for lethal prostate cancers
dependent on c-MYC/N-MYC activity. This benefit can extend to other human cancers as well because of the
pervasive role MYC proteins play in cancers of all types."
10895366,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Limited options are available for the treatment of mPC, a lethal prostate cancer. Immunotherapy has significantly
improved survival in patients with a variety of solid tumors; however, it has had limited efficacy in patients with
metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). There is a lack of understanding of underlying mechanisms for this de novo
resistance. In our pre-clinical studies, we have identified a novel mechanism that prostate tumors use to subvert
and evade the immune system. We have found that metastatic prostate tumor cells convert the stress-induced
immune stimulatory cell surface molecule, the MHC I Chain related molecule (MIC), to a highly immune
suppressive soluble MIC (sMIC), through proteolytic-mediated shedding. Importantly, patients with mPC have
significantly elevated immune suppressive sMIC in the circulation and severely suppressed immune cell function.
To overcome the immune suppression of sMIC, we have developed a first-in-class sMIC-targeting monoclonal
antibody (mAb) B10G5 that has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in eliminating prostate metastasis as a single
agent in preclinical models. When used in combination, B10G5 synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade
and reduces immune checkpoint therapy-induced colon toxicity. The mAb B10G5 has been optimized for human
use (termed as huB10G5), proven to be safe in non-human primates (NHP) in pilot toxicity assessments, and is
currently under IND-enabling studies. The goal of this SPORE project is to fulfill critical pre-clinical studies and
to translate the B10G5 therapy into a potential therapy for treating mPC. Very recently, we found that androgen
receptor (AR) activity could protect PC cells from immune cytotoxicity by upregulating the granzyme inhibitor
serpinB9 and that B10G5 therapy could activate FAS-mediated killing. Thus, we hypothesize that the
sMICtargeting antibody huB10G5 can be an effective immunotherapeutic agent for treating mPC as a single
agent or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy and/or standard AR-targeted therapy. We
propose three Specific Aims: 1) to define the landscape of serum MIC levels in mPC patients with clinical
characteristics and association with tumor immune modulation; 2) to determine therapeutic efficacy of targeting
sMIC alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and/or AR-targeting for treatment of
concurrent visceral and bone mPC; 3) To conduct a first-in-human Phase I clinical study of huB10G5 in mCRPC
patients. These studies will provide us critical information for future Phase I expansion and Phase II study."
10930846,"ABSTRACT: PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT UNIT (PEU)
H/L tend to be diagnosed at a younger age and with higher stage, and we have previously reported that Mexican
H/L in California have the greatest proportion of young (<50 years of age) diagnoses compared to other H/L
subgroups. Moreover, Mexican H/L showed higher prevalence of rectal cancer cases compared to other H/L and
NHW. Our most current analyses using the California Cancer Registry data (unpublished results), including data
for 52,557 H/L diagnosed between 1995-2017, show that ~43% of US H/L are diagnosed before 62 years old
(median age of diagnosis across NHW and H/L). Moreover, they show a greater proportion of distant tumor
diagnoses compared to NHW, and greater proportion of metastatic CRC. Overall, in spite of the various
disparities observed among H/L that contribute to their cancer burden, there are scarce studies that have focused
on this minority population, contributing to further disparities in this group. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
increase resources that will contribute much needed data about the tumor landscape of US H/L taking into
account genetic ancestry. Therefore, to address the lack of knowledge about the CRC tumor landscape among
H/L, and increase engagement and participation of H/L in genetic research, we propose to develop effective and
culturally tailored participant engagement approaches tailored to H/L, through the following specific aims, 1) to
address the knowledge gap in H/L CRC participation using a culturally appropriate direct cancer participant
engagement platform for recruiting, consenting, and communicating genomic risk based on cancer genomic
sequencing; 2) to deploy current best practices for collection and quality assessment of biospecimens and
relevant clinical and epidemiological data among H/L participants; 3) To develop and assess the effectiveness
of using culturally sensitive strategies for communication in clinical settings, that consider participant preferences
in receiving results from genomic analyses, and return of their clinical and epidemiological data; and 4) To
continuously improve participant engagement by assessing benchmarks and working with the Engagement
Optimization Unit to identify strategies to optimize informed consent, communication of results, and follow-up,
taking into account the patients and providers perspectives. The results of these aims will be integrated across
an engagement optimization framework to create a robust and validated model for engaging H/L cancer patients
into cancer genomic research studies."
10930855,"ABSTRACT: ENGAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION UNIT (EOU)
With advances in molecular genomics, we have an improved understanding of the drivers of tumor evolution and
therapy response, yet inclusion of Hispanic/Latino CRC patients in these studies has been minimal. Moreover,
there are virtually no empirical data to inform best practices for educating, consenting, enrolling and retaining
H/L patients in cancer genomics investigations, nor are there culturally, language, literacy and numeracy
appropriate tools to utilize to reach these patients or to facilitate interpretation of data they receive. A better
understanding of how H/Ls understand, value and communicate genomics-related information is the essential
foundation for rigorous research to optimize patient engagement and outcomes. The Engagement Optimization
Unit (EOU) will fill these gaps by conducting rigorous research to generate evidence-based best practices and
by validating culturally specific tools for optimizing Hispanic/Latino patient engagement and empowerment. This
will be accomplished via an iterative process of experimentation, evaluation, implementation and re-evaluation
in a study population at LAC+USC and Norris of 275 H/L participants with metastatic CRC, as well as a separate
cohort of 500 H/L participants with CRC (both newly diagnosed and survivors) who will be engaged in genomic

H/L CRC patients related to participation in cancer genomics research; and evaluate the role of language,
acculturation, numeracy and health literacy; (2) to develop best practices for engagement of H/L CRC patients
in informed consent for genomic characterization; (3) to determine the most efficacious strategies to
communicate genomic results to H/L CRC patients; and (4) to develop and test a comprehensive tool kit (The

those containing dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) – include understanding the risks for neural
tube defects (NTDs) and for the effect of weight gain on pregnancy outcomes. The Tsepamo Study
(R01HD080471, R01HD095766) is the largest pregnancy surveillance system in Africa, and has evaluated over
180,000 deliveries in Botswana since 2014. The study has provided critical safety data and treatment guidance
related to specific ART regimens that have been adopted for early use within the Botswana ART program. In
2018, the Tsepamo Study demonstrated a potential association with DTG and NTDs, and while this concern has
decreased over time following expanded surveillance, it has not disappeared. Ongoing NTD surveillance is
required both for DTG and for other new antiretroviral agents. New considerations regarding weight gain with
modern ART regimens have also been analyzed successfully in Tsepamo, but further data stratified by baseline
maternal weight groups are needed. The existing Tsepamo award was funded to continue birth surveillance
through December 2022, and the P01 mechanism can extend surveillance for 4 additional years from January
2023 through December 2026. This will allow the completion of aims that include: 1) ongoing surveillance to
understand and characterize the neural tube defect risk associated with DTG over a longer period, and with
additional evaluation of dietary folic acid intake; 2) a new aim to conduct an emulated clinical trial comparing the
most relevant ART regimens when used at different weight strata; and 3) new aims that utilize a unique identifier
to capture data across multiple pregnancies for the first time in our surveillance. These novel aims take
advantage of the unique ART landscape in Botswana, and build on the scientific findings from our highly
productive surveillance system. Data generated from this study will be critical for updating international
guidelines for the use of ART in pregnancy."
10914860,"Project Summary/Abstract, Point-of-Care HIV Testing and Early Dolutegravir Use for Infants (Project 3) 
The stakes of delaying HIV diagnosis and treatment in infancy are high. Infants progress to AIDS and die at a 
higher rate than any other age group, with over 30% of deaths occurring in the first 42 days of life. Even when 
treatment is started for infants, the available treatment regimens are limited – current recommendations include 
drugs such as nevirapine, zidovudine, or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) that are rarely used in adults – and treatment 
failure is common. Studies on the use of newer agents in children are lacking, leading to a reluctance to use 
newer agents in guidelines even after their approval for infants. Dolutegravir (DTG) was approved for use in 
infants from 30 days of life in June 2020, but has not become the first-line treatment regimen for infants in any 
current ART program in Africa. There is therefore an urgent need for implementation research to embed early 
infant diagnostics at the time of birth within national treatment programs in Africa, and to begin using modern 
DTG-based ART regimens for infants from as early in life as possible. 
With the support of Botswana's Ministry of Health and Wellness and this P01 program, the Botswana–Harvard 
AIDS Institute Partnership is uniquely positioned to pioneer a research program to support birth diagnosis and 
DTG treatment for infants in Botswana. Building on prior research within the Early Infant Treatment (EIT) Study, 
we will implement targeted birth testing (screening only exposed infants with the highest risk of HIV acquisition) 
by facility-based point-of-care (POC) testing with the Cepheid Xpert platform. Infants with HIV will be treated 
immediately, and referred for enrollment into a cohort that is transitioned to DTG-based ART at four weeks of 
life and followed for at least 96 weeks. With comparisons to alternate diagnostic approaches and to children who 
received LPV/r-based ART within the EIT Study, the study design will allow us to 1) evaluate the feasibility of 
adding low-cost, targeted early infant diagnosis to the Botswana national treatment program; 2) quantify the 
number of children identified as HIV infected at birth and determine time from diagnosis to ART initiation when 
POC testing is deployed; 3) compare the time to suppression and 12-week suppression between DTG-based 
and LPV/r-based ART; and 4) compare 96-week outcomes and overall viral suppression between DTG-based 
and LPV/r-based ART. Results from this study will inform programs that wish to implement birth diagnostics and 
early infant treatment with DTG-based ART, and will answer critical questions regarding the clinical, virologic, 
and immunologic impact of early DTG-based ART."
10917136,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Only half of the >60 million US adults for whom statin therapy is indicated receive statins, and adherence and
persistence is low. The most common reason of statin discontinuation is statin-associated muscle symptoms
(SAMS), a spectrum of muscle symptoms the patient perceives as intolerable enough to impair daily activities
and quality of life. A major driver of SAMS includes patient beliefs that statins are unsafe, further propagated
by misconceptions, conspiracy theories, and negative lay media coverage. Over 90% of patients who
experience SAMS can tolerate continued statin therapy after simple regimen modifications such as dose
reductions, switching to a different statin, or alternate-day dosing. The most effective interventions to improve
statin use, dose intensity, and outcomes in patients with SAMS include careful follow-up and management with
team-based care models. However, reimbursement models, patient and provider acceptance, and other factors
are significant barriers to the widespread implementation of team-based care. Even when team-based care is
available, time constraints and the unique psychology associated with SAMS management have resulted in
only 50% of those who experience SAMS ever re-challenging statin therapy. Systems-based practice—which
uses ancillary personnel, mid-level providers, provider-facing health information technology, and patient self-
management—combined with insights from clinical psychology and novel technology can help address these
challenges to effectively managing SAMS. We propose to develop and test virtual SAMS management (VSM):
a self-guided, web-based tool that incorporates (1) collection of self-reported patient beliefs, medication use
behavior, and symptoms; (2) assessment of the likelihood that statin use is causing the self-reported
symptoms; (3) provision of individualized cardiovascular risk, statin benefit, and SAMS treatment options, with
delivery informed by cognitive debiasing literature; and (4) as appropriate, patients’ ability to self-manage their
SAMS by modifying their statin regimen according to set protocols. First, we will use user iterative design and
usability testing to develop the VSM software (Aim 1). Then, we propose a hybrid type II effectiveness-
implementation randomized trial to determine whether VSM can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
team-based care at managing SAMS (Aim 2), and to identify facilitators and barriers that affect the uptake,
adoption, and impact of the VSM strategy in team-based care settings (Aim 3). Results from our analysis of
this innovative approach will answer important and timely questions concerning strategies for improving how
patients view statins and encouraging statin re-challenge with evidence-based statin regimen modifications
after SAMS occur. This will address an urgent public health need and open new avenues for research by
optimizing SAMS management leading to increased statin adherence and persistence and, thereby, decreased
ASCVD risk."

Abstract
In 2016, the NIH NIDDK selected a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from three institutions (UPENN,
Vanderbilt, University of Florida) to establish the pilot phase of the Human Pancreas Analysis Program
(HPAP). Over the past three years, type 1 diabetes (T1D)-relevant tissues from more than 50 organ donors
were profiled at the anatomic, physiologic, metabolic, immunologic, genomic and epigenomic levels. The
resulting data were compiled and organized into the publicly accessible PANC-DB database and website.
Here, we propose not only to continue, but to expand our efforts to apply and develop state-of-the-art
technologies designed to phenotype and molecularly profile human tissues relevant to the etiology of T1D
through a series of innovative efforts by six Cores. Core A (Pancreas Procurement and Islet Isolation) will
procure/process pancreatic islets, pancreas and lymphoid organs, expand donor outreach (in collaboration
with the well-established nPOD program) and increase the collection of non-pancreatic tissues. Core B
(PhysiologicalPhenotyping)will provide a comprehensive metabolic profile and probe the key regulatory steps that
govern hormone secretion from the major pancreatic endocrine cell types. Core C (Immunobiology) will
develop an immune atlas of peripancreatic lymphoid populations, obtain transcriptomic profiles of the T1D-
specific T cells, and perform immune repertoire profiling of B and T cells in association with single cell and
antigen-specific cell approaches. Core D (Advanced Molecular Profiling) will perform RNAseq, ATACseq and
DNA methylome analysis on sorted alpha-cell, beta-cell and exocrine cell population as well as scRNAseq
and scATACseq and carry out whole genome sequencing. In addition, islet endocrine and major lymphocyte
populations will be quantified precisely using flow CyTOF. Core E (Tissue Analysis & Biobanking) will
analyze pancreatic tissue architecture and immune cell/epithelial cell interactions using multiple modalities
including imaging mass cytometry, multi-spectral imaging and CODEX. Complete image data will be made
available via PancreatlasTM and PANC-DB. Finally, Core F (PANC-DB, Data Analysis and Integration) will
expand the PANC-DB resource by adding new features that will make the public web page even more useful,
as well as add a Computational Biology and Data Science Unit for applying state-of-the-art analytical tools,
allowing for the integration and visualization of generated datasets using different experimental modalities
such as multi-spectral imaging and omics technologies. In addition, Core F will continue to expand its outreach
activities, exemplified via the deposition of transcriptome and epigenome data into the Diabetes Epigenome
Atlas (DGA). HPAP-T1D will be directed by an experienced, collaborative multi-PI team that confers weekly
and will meet in-person on a biannual basis in coordination with NIDDK leadership to review the progress of
the entire program."

The Training Program in Lung Biology and Translational Medicine at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) provides multidisciplinary training in a stimulating and collaborative environment that nurtures
the development of highly competent and innovative biomedical research scientists. This Program, initiated in
2010 to train M.D. or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows in lung-related research, is currently in its 10th year with a current
allocation of 6 trainees/year. In the first 10 years of the Program, 16/17 (94%) of trainees who have completed
training have continued in research-intensive career tracks, and 14/17 (>80%) hold academic faculty positions.
The multidisciplinary and translational approach to the proposed training has been highly successful, and is
highlighted by a diverse and interactive group of thirty faculty mentors who hold primary appointments in eight
UAB Departments (4 – clinical; 4 – research). The faculty mentors are grouped into three thematic areas based
on scientific expertise: (1) immunology-microbiology; (2) cell biology-tissue repair; (3) translational sciences.
Translational research in statistical genetics, computational biology, biomarker discovery, and drug
discovery/development and clinical trials will facilitate the clinical translation of basic science research (groups 1
and 2). Based on the existing expertise and ongoing research efforts at UAB, training will focus on the
manifestations, diagnosis, risk/prognostic stratification, mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of lung diseases,
primarily acute lung injury (ALI), cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD), and
interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Training programs will be highly individualized and tailored to maximize success
of each trainee with the creation of individual development plans (IDPs). In addition to the research projects that
will be conducted in the mentor’s laboratory, training will encompass a highly structured didactic program that
includes weekly teaching conferences in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, a “survival
skills” curriculum (in collaboration with the UAB Office of Postdoctoral Education) and a Research Core
Curriculum, conducted by the T32 training faculty, that includes emerging themes such as cellular plasticity,
human immunology, stem cell biology, aging, drug discovery/development, bioinformatics, and personalized
medicine. Formal instruction will include the responsible and ethical conduct of research and a course on rigor
and reproducibility in research. This T32 Training Program is committed to “mentoring of mentors”, workforce
diversity, and maintaining the current high-rate of trainee retention in academic biomedical research careers."
10906934,"Abstract
As of March 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 50 million infections and 2 million
deaths, constituting an unprecedented pandemic in the modern world. While infected individuals
rapidly develop IgG responses against the viral Spike after infection, some studies have
indicated that individuals with mild infection generate weaker neutralizing Ab responses
compared to those with severe disease. The durability of the immune response following natural
infection and its afforded protection against subsequent infections and emerging related variants
remain unclear. Interestingly, unlike other respiratory viruses, children are rarely develop severe
disease following SARS CoV-2 infection. Antibody responses in hospitalized children and those
who developed the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) have been characterized, but,
there is a gap in knowledge of the magnitude, quality, durability, and breadth of antibody
responses in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children, responses that may contribute to
making children less susceptible to severe infection compared to adults. Moreover, the
possibiltiy of reinfection or infection with a novel variant in previously-infected children is not
known, making the possibility of restarting congregate settings for children without a childhood
vaccine quite challenging. Our overarching goal is to characterize the kinetics, function,
breadth, and durability of humoral immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection across
the pediatric age spectrum in comparison to that of adults. We hypothesize that pediatric
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from that of adults, and associates with
protection against symptomatic disease and durability of immunity. Using samples from two
unique ongoing community studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and children, we will test
our hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Define the similarities and differences in the
kinetics, magnitude, specificity, function and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses in
children and adults; 2) Investigate the breadth and potency of antibody responses in SARS-
CoV-2-infected children against established and predicted variants of SARS-CoV-2; and 3)
Define the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire and characterize the potency of pediatric
SARS CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies. These evaluations will identify immune correlates
of protection against severe disease and provide insights for immunization strategies towards
the long term control of SARS CoV-2 which will likely become an endemic pathogen."
10837003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Existing single cell sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented understanding of the unique genomic
and transcriptomic differences that underlie heterogeneous biological samples. These differences are key to
understand disease pathologies in clinical samples and fundamental mechanisms in basic biological
applications. Recent attention has been directed towards the development of multiomic technologies that better
capture the differences in paired datasets such as genome and transcriptome or transcriptome and
epigenome. Currently however, there is no single cell technology that can profile sequence information with the
corresponding phenotypic behavior of the cell.
The purpose of this project is to develop a novel sequencing platform to address this technology gap. To
demonstrate the utility of this platform, I will then apply it to rapidly characterize a tunable genetic oscillator.
To accomplish this goal, I propose the following 2 specific aims. In Aim 1, I will develop FAB-seq
(Fluorescence Annotated Barcoding and Sequencing). I will first demonstrate a novel dual barcoding
approach that co-delivers optical and DNA barcodes to create single cell maps between microscopy image
data and sequence data. I will also show that FAB-seq can be used to perform targeted sequencing according
to an arbitrary phenotype. Then, I will leverage additional injected DNA barcodes to enhance the total barcode
space of FAB-seq. In Aim 2, I will then demonstrate that FAB-seq can be used to rapidly characterize a tunable
genetic oscillator. First, I will demonstrate that FAB-seq can detect oscillatory phenotypes from a circuit library
containing oscillatory and non-oscillatory genetic circuits. Then I will show that when the oscillatory behavior of
the circuit is perturbed, FAB-seq can map individual oscillation dynamics to the corresponding single cell
transcriptome.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a platform technology that can map single cell microscopy data
to single cell sequencing data at ultra-high throughput. I envision FAB-seq to be a transformative tool in
addressing questions at the frontier of the genomics field."
10828743,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Intracellular vesicle fusion is primarily mediated by SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor
attachment protein receptors), which consist of vesicle membrane protein synaptobrevin II (syb2, VAMP2 or v-
SNARE), and target membrane proteins syntaxin (syx) and SNAP-25 (collectively called t-SNAREs). As the
vesicle approaches the target membrane, the v-SNARE and t-SNAREs assemble in a zipper-like manner to form
a vesicle fusion machine, enabling release of the molecular cargo. After fusion, the assembled SNARE complex
is disassembled by the recycling machinery, composed of NSF and α-SNAP, into individual proteins for the next
round of fusion. Since vesicle fusion is a ubiquitous process and is critical for cell-cell communication, mutations
in SNAREs lead to numerous neuronal and metabolic diseases. Over the past few decades, extensive studies
have revealed great details of individual steps in the SNARE cycle. However, the molecular mechanism that
orders the sequence of each step remains unclear. A pressing need exists to probe this relationship. Here, we
seek to understand the assembly and disassembly of SNAREs in vitro and in live cells. In Aim 1, we will develop
a hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) approach to analyze SNARE complex formation
and deformation in vitro under physiologically relevant conditions. We have shown that the sequence coverage
collected after MS of the individual SNARE proteins includes their SNARE motifs, supporting that subsequent
HDX-MS will reveal details into their mechanism. We will use this approach to study SNARE binary and ternary
complex to examine assembly, then introduce the recycling proteins to assess complex disassembly. In Aim 2,
our objective is to understand the spatiotemporal regulation of the SNARE cycle during vesicle exocytosis by
developing a genetically encoded intensity-based conformational sensor for SNAREs assembly and disassembly
(icsenSNARE). Using reconstituted assays, we have identified the first design, icsenSNARE000 that showed a
1.5-fold fluorescence increase upon assembly of the SNARE complex and could be reversed by the disassembly
machinery. Finally, we plan to employ icsenSNARE in live cells to reveal how the spatiotemporal regulation of
the SNARE cycle is coupled to vesicle fusion. Together, the proposed study will advance mechanistic
understandings of vesicle exocytosis, develop a new approach for studying SNARE assembly and disassembly,
and generate a new probe for the SNARE proteins. Achievement of this work has the potential to help study
SNARE-related pathologies to improve human health."
10907482,"Project Summary
 The intestinal microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.
Metabolites produced by the microbiome reach extraintestinal tissues, and can be found in the bloodstream, and
are thereby able to influence almost all tissues of the body. Interestingly, the expression of a number of genes
of the gastrointestinal tract is dependent on colonization by the microbiome. In this project, we will explore the
mechanisms through which the gut microbiome controls gene regulation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs),
through the study of a microbiome-modulated gene involved in IEC cell death. Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (STm) is a pathogen that is adept at overcoming host defenses in order to cause disease. STm
triggers an inflammatory response that benefits growth of the pathogen by taking advantage of the host response
to infection. Our preliminary findings suggest that STm is able to benefit from a homeostatic microbiome-
mediated cell death pathway that has yet to be described. Under steady state conditions, metabolites produced
by the microbiome lead to pyroptosis of IECs, which helps maintain normal epithelial turnover. However, upon
STm infection, the pathogen harnesses this pathway to elicit increased IEC pyroptosis, leading to increased STm
numbers in the gastrointestinal tract. Our early results indicate loss of components of the IEC pyroptosis pathway
led to lower STm luminal outgrowth and dissemination to extraintestinal organs, yet, it is unclear how STm
activates IEC pyroptosis, and whether this pathway indeed leads to an increase in pyroptosis of intestinal
epithelial cells during infection. Thus, I hypothesize that during infection of the gastrointestinal tract, STm takes
advantage of a microbiome-controlled homeostatic IEC-specific cell death pathway to bloom to high numbers.
 In order to elucidate how the microbiome and STm activate IEC pyroptosis, and how this activation leads
to cell death and downstream pathogen expansion within the gastrointestinal tract and in extraintestinal sites,
we propose two specific aims. In AIM 1 we will assess the contribution of the gut microbiome to induction of IEC
pyroptosis, by using a combination of sequencing and in vivo mouse models using conventional and gnotobiotic
mice. In AIM 2 we will use mouse infection models to determine how STm elicits IEC pyroptosis during infection,
and define the upstream activation pathway. Our mechanistic approach will provide a causal link between the
microbiome, a host cell death pathway, and pathogen expansion. Successful completion of this proposal will
identify a previously undefined IEC cell death pathway that plays a crucial role under steady state and infectious
conditions. This project will additionally expand my training to include key methods and concepts in IEC biology
and in the study of the microbiome. Altogether, the research and training plan proposed will facilitate a better
understanding of IECs and their role in host immunity, while preparing me for a future career as an independent
investigator in the field of host-microbe interactions."
10848341,"Despite recent advances in the understanding host-microbiome interactions in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), the complexity of the host’s response to changing gut microbiota is daunting and still incompletely understood. In this proposal, we show that poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation), a post-translational modification that involves the enzymatic transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPr) from NAD+ to specific amino acids of target proteins, plays key roles as a mediator of inflammatory response in the gut. For the first time, we provide evidence that PARP1 is the primary PAR writer in the colon, where it serves as a powerful transcriptional modulator. Commensal bacteria are necessary for mucosal PARP1 activity and PARylation and, reciprocally, PARP1 controls the microbial composition and metabolic activity, modulates colonic epithelial barrier function, and restricts the mucosal Treg compartment. Importantly, human and murine colitis is associated with mucosal hyperPARylation, which can be transferred to germ-free mice with complex microbial community from IBD patients. Total or epithelial-specific knockout of PARP1 (or pharmacological inhibition) protect from and promote recovery from mucosal injury. Based on these novel preliminary observations, we hypothesized that hyperPARylation is a significant contributor to mucosal inflammation and impaired mucosal restitution via both extrinsic (interaction with gut microbiota) and intrinsic effects in the colonic mucosa. We will address this hypothesis in the following three well-integrated, but not mutually contingent specific aims, which will: (1) Define the role of NAD+ depletion vs. hyperPARylation as putative culprits in the pathogenesis of experimental colitis (2) Define the role of PARP1 and PARylation in colitis mediated by human IBD microbiota; and (3) Mechanistically define the roles of PARP1 in the highly interactive relationship between gut microbiota and epithelial barrier function and mucosal restitution.in the inflamed colon. This novel research plan will greatly advance the field of fundamental mucosal biology and will offer targeting of PARP1 activity as a potential IBD therapy."
10831833,"ABSTRACT
The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by members of the p21 Rho family of small GTPases by propagating
signals to downstream effectors including the mammalian diaphanous-related formin 1, mDia1. The formin
mDia1 directly modulates the actin cytoskeleton by nucleating actin and assembling linear actin filaments. In
addition to the enzymatic activity, mDia1 can recruit proteins containing SH3 domains such as non-receptor
tyrosine kinase, Src. There is a limited understanding of the mDia1-specific, RhoGTPase-mediated functions
that contribute to cellular protrusive structures, specifically at the leading edge. To protrude, cells require
polymerization of actin filaments to mechanically extend the leading edge. The newly extended protrusion can
become stabilized by formation of adhesion sites or retracted by disassembly of adhesions. In this proposal we
seek to delineate RhoGTPase paralogs that regulate mDia1 and its subsequent downstream functions in
leading edge cell protrusions. We hypothesize that the RhoGTPases RhoC and/or RhoA are activating mDia1
at the leading edge to recruit Src to sites of adhesion and to polymerize actin filaments, respectively. To gain
understanding into the RhoGTPase regulation of mDia1, in Aim 1 we will develop Förster Resonance Energy
Transfer (FRET) based biosensor tools capable of reporting the activity status of mDia1 in living cells. We will
focus on the development of Near-Infra red (NIR) fluorescent protein biosensor of mDia1 to allow simultaneous
detection of cyan-yellow FRET RhoGTPase biosensors or to use the blue-green optogenetic tools targeting
RhoGTPases and their upstream regulators, in single living cells. We will use this approach to determine the
RhoC and RhoA regulation of mDia1 at the leading edge. For Aim 2, we will uncover the downstream function
of mDia1 by recruitment of Src to sites of adhesion and how this impacts adhesion turnover during protrusive
events. Additionally, we will elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of mDia1 in mediating linear actin assembly
at the leading edge protrusions. We will discern the mDia1-specific, localized activities and functions using our
newly developed mDia1 biosensor in WT and RhoGTPase perturbed cells. Our approach will allow us to
delineate the spatiotemporal dynamics of mDia1 and the respective RhoGTPase paralogs regulating them in
cells during leading edge protrusions."
10830266,"Cocaine use disorder (CUD) imposes a large burden on public health, particularly because there are no FDA-
approved pharmacotherapies for the disorder. The onset and maintenance of CUD is driven by physiological
and molecular changes within the brain that lead to maladaptive behavior associated with cocaine taking and
seeking. A key neuronal population in this dysregulation is dopamine 1 receptor expressing medium spiny
neurons (D1 MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These cells are activated by acute cocaine, undergo
physiological and transcriptional plasticity following repeated cocaine exposure, and are recruited by cocaine-
associated cues to drive drug seeking. While their causal role in drug-induced behavior has been identified,
the molecular mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced dysregulation remains poorly understood. The goal of
this proposal is to define how chromatin regulation – through a recently identified cocaine-induced chromatin
modifying enzyme [lysine acetyltransferase 2a (KAT2a)] – is a key substrate involved in the motivation to
take and seek cocaine. We present in our preliminary data a detailed series of proteomic bioinformatic studies
through which we identified KAT2a as an upstream regulator of the wide-scale transcriptional dysregulation
associated with cocaine exposure in the NAc of both males and females. We also show that mutations to
KAT2a that impair its function only in D1 MSNs greatly impair cocaine self-administration and disrupt
physiological responses in D1 MSNs. I hypothesize that KAT2a acts within NAc D1 MSNs to control cocaine
self-administration and cue-induced seeking via regulating D1 MSN activity at baseline and in response to
drug-associated stimuli.
To address this question, I will combine cocaine self-administration in mice with viral-mediated gene transfer
and optical imaging in awake and behaving animals. In Aim 1, I will define the role that KAT2a in D1 MSNs
plays in motivation to consume cocaine, cocaine reward sensitivity, and cue-induced seeking. In Aim 2, I will
use optical imaging to define how KAT2a alters D1 MSN activity at baseline and in response to cocaine. In Aim
3, I will define the role of KAT2a in D1 MSN responses to cocaine-associated cues in awake and behaving
animals and determine how these neural dynamics relate to drug-seeking behavior. The training goals in this
proposal will provide the technical and conceptual expertise necessary to investigate the transcriptional and
epigenetic mechanisms underlying substance use disorder. Finally, the experimental findings will define a cell
type-specific neuroepigenetic mechanism of CUD in males and females."
10889954,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alcohol misuse, which includes alcohol use disorder (AUD), is present in up to 2 million patients admitted to an
intensive care unit (ICU) each year. The ICU admission may be a “teachable moment” and many ICU survivors
are motivated to change their drinking. Unfortunately, the current paradigm for linking ICU survivors to alcohol
treatment is ineffective. The unique challenge in harnessing an ICU patient’s motivation is that alcohol treatment
programs are separated from the acute care environment. This proposal describes a 2-year research fellowship
program that will iteratively develop and pilot a peer-narrated virtual tour regarding treatment for ICU survivors
with AUD and will allow Dr. Kelsey Hills-Dunlap to develop an academic career in Critical Care Medicine.
The proposed research program will develop the first and only virtual intervention for ICU survivors with AUD
aimed at increasing entry to alcohol treatment and will provide the research skills necessary to further Dr. Hills-
Dunlap toward her goal of becoming an independent investigator in alcohol health services and critical care
research. The program will consist of direct mentoring from a multidisciplinary team of nationally renowned local
experts in alcohol and critical illness, health behavior change, decision aids, and qualitative methodology. In
addition, a formalized research advisory committee will ensure that the goals and benchmarks of this proposal
are met. The program will also include coursework in clinical sciences, addiction medicine and medical decision
making. This cohesive program will help Dr. Hills-Dunlap learn and apply multiple research methods, acquire
foundational knowledge of addiction medicine focusing on AUD, and gain expertise in the development and
implementation of decision aids for ICU survivors with AUD.
The overall research goal of this proposal is to optimize the way in which alcohol treatment options are delivered
to ICU survivors with AUD through the creation of a peer-narrated virtual tour prototype. Presenting treatment
options in the form of a peer-narrated virtual tour may help overcome the separation between the acute care
environment and alcohol treatment programs. Dr. Hills-Dunlap will build this prototype by first conducting semi-
structured interviews in ICU survivors with AUD to determine the content of the tour. Subsequently, she will
use a rigorous process of development and feedback to create a video prototype of a peer-narrated virtual tour
of the Center for Dependency, Addiction and Rehabilitation (CeDAR), a nationally recognized addiction
treatment center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, and will pilot the prototype for
acceptability. This will pave the way for a NIAAA K23 submission to complete peer-narrated virtual tours for the
remaining treatment options in the Denver area and conduct a pragmatic effectiveness study. A peer-narrated
virtual tour for ICU survivors with AUD would help to close the treatment gap for a large population of patients at
a time when they are uniquely motivated to change."

10911962,"Klebsiella species are a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, and gastrointestinal colonization
often precedes infection. Klebsiella colonize ~20% of intensive care patients, and 4% of these patients will
develop pneumonia, bloodstream or urinary tract infections from this pathogen. In 80% of these cases, the
infecting isolate is detectable by culture at the time of admission. These colonizing and infecting Klebsiella
strains are highly diverse, as measured by typing of the capsule locus gene wzi and their gene content. In a
case-control study of colonizing strains that progressed to infection or remained asymptomatic, we identified
147 wzi types across 245 isolates and found that some patients are colonized by more than one Klebsiella
strain simultaneously. Over 22,000 genes varied between these isolates, suggesting that genetic diversity
could lead to large differences in fitness and pathogenic potential. The diversity of colonizing strains between
and within colonized patients raises fundamental questions about how the complex dynamics of colonization
affect infection risk. This high diversity of wzi types also provides a novel tool to answer these questions: a
barcoding scheme that can enable granular characterization of Klebsiella populations and large-scale
competition experiments between non-isogenic strains. The long-term goal of our research is to identify
markers of infection risk that can be used to prevent Klebsiella infections in colonized patients. The goal of this
exploratory study is to develop deep sequencing of the wzi capsular locus as a tool to study Klebsiella
population dynamics and enable rapid and large-scale competition experiments. Our hypothesis is that the wzi
locus is a naturally-occurring barcode that, analogous to 16S sequencing, can be used to measure the relative
abundance of Klebsiella strains in large, diverse populations. Our approach is to develop a wzi amplicon-
sequencing method, apply it to measure population dynamics in patient samples and competitive fitness, and
integrate these data with clinical modeling and comparative genomics. We will leverage an existing set of rectal
swab samples from cases of infection and matched controls, and corresponding fully sequenced Klebsiella
isolates, to complete the following Specific Aims: 1) Validate wzi deep sequencing and measure population
dynamics during colonization. We will develop a wzi sequencing pipeline and validate it on contrived and
archived rectal swab samples. Then we will pilot this technique on rectal swabs to measure diversity of
Klebsiella during human colonization and its impact on infection risk. 2) Apply wzi deep sequencing to non-
isogenic competition experiments in ex vivo colonization and infection models. We will measure relative fitness
from >100 strains simultaneously in human urine, serum, bronchoalveolar fluid, and stool, and against a
potential de-colonization intervention. We will correlate fitness with clinical case status, discover and validate
novel fitness genes in each condition, and test them in animal models. The outcome of this study will be a
powerful approach to accelerate progress in understanding how Klebsiella colonization progresses to infection."
10837649,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) are promising solutions for restoring function to people with
paralysis with orders of magnitude greater performance than their non-invasive analogs. Present iBCIs monitor
the user’s brain signals and use a decoding algorithm to map the measurements from the brain directly to
external variables, such as computer cursor velocity. People with tetraplegia have indicated that restoring hand
function is their highest priority, however, current hand-focused iBCIs are unable to match the capabilities of the
native human hand in terms of the number of independently-controlled fingers, the quality of the control, and the
simultaneous use of the fingers with movements of the arm. These limitations hinder the widespread clinical
deployment of hand-focused iBCIs.
 Recent studies have shown that much of the activity in motor cortex does not directly correspond to
movement variables (like finger angles), but instead serves an internal, computational role to reliably generate
motor outputs. Neural population dynamics, which are rules that govern the evolution of neural population activity
over time, can be used to more accurately parse movement- and computation-related activity in motor cortex.
Dynamics-based decoders first model the dynamics driving recorded neural activity, then use a decoder to map
the estimated dynamics to movement. Dynamics-based decoding has already improved iBCI performance for
predicting the arm movements of monkeys by 36%, but it remains unknown how well dynamics-based decoding
can predict the movements of human fingers.
 The objective of this proposal is to restore dexterous finger control with an iBCI in people with paralysis.
The central hypothesis is that dynamics-based decoders will bridge the gap in capabilities between hand-focused
iBCIs and able-bodied hand function. The rationale for the proposed research is that the performance
improvements introduced by dynamics-based decoders will translate from predicting arm movements to
predicting finger movements. The hypothesis will be tested with people with upper extremity paralysis through
the following two specific aims: 1) increasing the number of independently-controlled fingers of a robotic hand
without sacrificing control quality, and 2) maintaining performance of controlling dexterous finger movements
while simultaneously controlling movements of the entire robotic arm. The dynamics-based decoders will use
state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs)-based dynamics models to achieve the best estimate of the
underlying dynamics paired with ANN-based dynamics decoders to translate the estimated dynamics into
movement. The dynamics-based decoders will be compared against direct decoders that have been traditionally
used in human iBCIs. This work may be the first step toward providing people with paralysis a general-purpose
iBCI-controlled robotic arm to assist them with independently completing activities of daily living at home."

10906893,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 4
Precision Methods for Assessing Brain Health and Age-related Cognitive Impairment and AD
Combatting the growing public health and societal burdens associated with age-related cognitive impairment
(ARCI) and cognitive decline will not be easy. What is needed are reliable risk assessment, early detection,
and ultimately, intervention strategies for maintaining cognitive health at older ages. The development and
implementation of such strategies are complicated by the number, complexity, and heterogeneous nature of
the factors that contribute to ARCI. To understand this complexity, it will be necessary to collect and integrate
different sources of information. These data will come from large samples of longitudinally characterized
individuals through the use of assays designed to interrogate phenomena such as molecular, genetic,
physiological, biometric, clinical, psychometric, social, lifestyle, and environmental factors. In addition,
appropriate methods for integrating the data obtained from these assays and drawing comprehensive yet
compelling inferences are essential. The research to be pursued in the proposed Precision Aging Network
(PAN) will involve collecting comprehensive data on 1,620 older individuals face-to-face and over 50,000
individuals tracked longitudinally who are cognitively characterized based on a set of validated online tests.
PAN Project 4 “Precision methods for assessing brain health and age-related cognitive impairment” is
devoted to integrating these data, along with complementary data from the public domain, using a suite of
techniques designed to identify factors contributing to the maintenance or vulnerability of cognitive function in
the face of aging, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Project 4 will work with
Project 2 to explore predictive models of cognitive decline, as well as Project 3 to identify preventive and
therapeutic targets. Data are to be generated as part of the Molecular Profiling (MP) Core, Cognitive
Assessment and Neuroimaging (CAN) Core, and the Non-Invasive Technology (NIT) Core – all in the
service of the large-scale human cohort studies to be pursued in Projects 1 - 3 of the proposed research.
Project 4 will work closely with members of the Data Science (DS) Core to ensure that all data collected and
analyzed across all Projects and Cores funnel seamlessly into a pipeline that will allow for reliable model
building. Project 4 deliverables, which are meant to seed potential products to be used to combat ARCI and
age-related cognitive decline, include prediction models to classify individuals into subgroups more amenable
to possible interventional strategies; long-term prognostic models that suggest activities or daily living
strategies to maintain cognitive health; monitoring strategies for individuals exhibiting cognitive changes that
could be implemented on a mobile device; markers for intervention efficacy as well as potential drug targets
and therapeutic molecules; and novel intervention trial designs enabled by PAN study findings. Project 4 will
enable the PAN goals to develop individualized interventions to maintain health, well-being, and function to
optimize cognitive healthspan and prevent or reduce the burden of ARCI, AD, or ADRD."
10907576,"The Administrative Core provides the overall leadership for this U19 study,
Resistance/Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease in Centenarians and their Offspring
(RADCO) and it acts as the communication hub for the 3 cores and 2 projects, NIA scientific

supports and encourages optimal interactions amongst the RADCO community in part by
facilitating all of the study-wide, core- and project-specific video conference calls and posting the
minutes and action items on the Study's internal Confluence-based website. The Core provides
the leadership of the Publications and Presentations and Ancillary Studies Committees and
orchestrates triannual RADCO-wide video conference meetings to discuss progress in achieving
the aims, to update everyone on what others are doing and provides, particularly for junior
investigators, opportunities to present their work. In years 2 and 4, the Spring meeting is held in
person in Bethesda. The Administrative Core also coordinates with NIA staff, biannual meetings
with the OSMB. The Core leads the outreach to the greater scientific community with the creation
and maintenance of the RADCO's public facing website and orchestration of publicly available
and well-advertised biannual scientific workshops. These scientific outreach efforts also include
implementation of NIA's Alzheimer's Disease-related data sharing policy by working with the
Phenotyping and Biospecimen and the Neuroimaging Cores to perform quality control, curation
and transfer of all generated data to the AD Knowledge Portal within 3 months of the data
becoming available for analyses. All of these responsibilities are integral to successfully achieving
the goals of the proposed research and they are reiterated as the following specific aims."

successful conduct of its six aims is critical to RADCO's investigation of centenarians and their offspring as
models of cognitive resilience and resistance to cognitive impairment and AD. Those 6 Specific Aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Establish a cognitive superagers (n=496, ages 100-110 years), offspring (n=600), and offspring
spouses (n=120) sample with baseline neuropsychological assessments, other phenotypic data, blood samples,
and genetic and biomarker data provided by 2 ongoing NIA-funded centenarian studies. Specific Aim 2. Perform
annual Covid-19-safe virtual neurocognitive assessments and other phenotypic data collection that are uniform
with the ILO study and LCCP measures. Also, to enhance accuracy of the neurocognitive assessments by
performing interdisciplinary expert diagnoses consensus conferences. Specific Aim 3. Employing REDCap,
manage and perform QC, and make easily but securely available all of the data collected and generated by the
RADCO Cores and Projects, including the neuropsychological, neuroimaging, neuropathologic phenotype and
biomarker and transcriptomic data. Specific Aim 4. To receive from the ILO+LCCP studies and then
longitudinally collect blood samples (centenarians annually, offspring and offspring spouses every other year)
from RADCO participants for use by the two projects. To maintain samples in a biorepository as a sharable
resource. Specific Aim 5. Support the RADCO Neuroimaging Core's aims by recruiting RADCO participants for
local neuroimaging and linking scan data to clinical data. Specific Aim 6. Recruit RADCO participants for future
brain donation, ensure that autopsies proceed smoothly, and link clinical data to anatomic, pathologic and

10907589,"NEUROIMAGING CORE SUMMARY
Much has yet to be understood about the brains of ""superagers"" and what and how resilience
factors impact the typical brain-aging trajectory, and identify which aspects of brain reserve are
most associated with preserved cognition functioning in centenarian cognitive superagers. The
Neuroimaging Core oversees the acquisition, storage, and analysis of imaging data at three
participating imaging centers: MGH (Boston), Columbia University (NYC), and UCLA (Los
Angeles). These sites have identical scanners, the Siemens Prisma 3T MRI, that are also
the most advanced pulse sequencers available. The Core will optimize acquisition and analysis
approaches to ensure that the data across centers are highly standardized and achieve equivalent
contrast to noise ratios (CNRs) to ensure that data integration is successful. The Core's broad
goal is to answer specific questions about resilience by identifying a set of high-resolution
pulse sequences that examine brain structure and function, in a time interval tolerable for
centenarians, using state of the art data analysis techniques. The NIC's general hypothesis
is that preserved structural and functional connectivity are essential to long-term preserved
cognition. This hypothesis will be tested by generating optimal MRI data combined with analysis
tools designed to examine network dynamics and longitudinal trajectories, focusing on brain
networks and regions most critical to cognition and memory. The three specific aims are: Aim
1:Test and employ across three sites, state of the art pulse sequences on the Prisma platform
that are essential for understanding the resilient brain structure including Multi-echo/Multiband,
navigator high-resolution T1/T2, resting-state functional connectivity MR, Diffuser Tensor
Imaging, Pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling, and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping.
Aim 2:Perform ongoing with-and between-site QA, pre-processing for image standardization
and bias corrections, and centralize data across sites into an imaging data repository. Aim 3:
Conduct image analysis that combines data across sites/within modality; create output metrics
for each data-type, and in conjunction with the projects, assist in integrating imaging
measures into project hypotheses. The imaging centers are joined and further integrated by a
state-of-the-art data analysis center at the University of Utah. Experts in imaging statistics
interface with the other RADCO cores and projects to integrate data types for hypothesis testing."
10904020,"The Central Dogma of molecular biology is that DNA is used to make mRNA, which in turn is used to make
proteins. Central to physiology of every live cell, translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is
catalyzed by the ribosome, structurally complex and dynamic macromolecular machine. Dysregulation of
translation plays an important role in a number of human diseases including cancer. While some fundamentals
of protein synthesis have been revealed, many molecular details of ribosomal translation remain unknown. For
example, it is unclear why some mRNAs are translated orders of magnitude more efficiently than the others,
and how mRNA structure regulates protein synthesis. My laboratory investigates molecular mechanisms of
translation by studying structural dynamics of the ribosome, and the role of mRNA secondary structure in
translation regulation. We use single-molecule microscopy and biochemical approaches to address the
following questions: (i) How does the small ribosomal subunit move along mRNA in search for the start site for
translation initiation in eukaryotes? (ii) How does the intrinsic compactness of mRNA and intramolecular
basepairing interactions formed by the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA regulate the efficiency
of protein synthesis in eukaryotes? (iii) How do mRNA stem-loop structures induce ribosome translation
pauses, which control expression of a number of proteins in bacteria, eukaryotes and eukaryotic viruses,
including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2? (iv)
How are structural dynamics of eukaryotic ribosome (in particular, rotational movements between the small
and the large ribosomal subunits) converted into the intricate process of protein synthesis? Our studies will
substantially contribute to establishing the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis, and provide the basis
for the future development of antiviral and cancer therapies."
10813717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While the cellular movements and shape changes that drive morphogenesis within the neural plate are well
characterized, how morphogenesis of different cranial mesenchyme (CM) lineages contributes to neural fold
elevation and how disruption of these mechanisms results in neural tube defects remains an open question.
This application is based on the hypothesis that aberrant eHSP90 secretion and changes in the CM
matrisome result in abnormal CM behavior, disrupting CM expansion in the Hectd1 mutant embryo. To
model abnormal CM morphogenesis, a Hectd1 mouse mutant that fails neural tube closure will be used to
determine both lineage relationship and gene expression changes that occur with CM morphogenesis leading
to the neural tube defect.
 Aim 1 will assess how the neural crest (NC-CM) and paraxial mesoderm derived CM (PM-CM) interact in
the Hectd1 mutant embryo leading to abnormal CM morphogenesis and failure of neural fold elevation. Both
CM lineages are implicated as critical mediators of neural fold elevation. Analysis using SiMView adaptive light
sheet microscope during normal CM expansion demonstrated distinct movements of the PM-CM and the NC-
CM. Secondly, preliminary analysis of CM cells indicates that NC-CM cells are the primary migratory cells.
Hectd1 is required in the NC-CM for neural fold elevation, but the PM-CM also fails to expand in the Hectd1
mutant. Therefore, lineage tracing and conditional genetic models of Hectd1 will be used to test the
contribution of the NC-CM and PM-CM to abnormal morphogenesis in the Hectd1 mutant line using live
imaging of in vitro CM explant assays. Lastly, increased extracellular HSP90 (eHSP90) secretion is observed
in NC-CM cells of our mutant mouse. This potential mechanism for their abnormal interaction leading to the
neural tube defect will be tested with additional live imaging of CM explants with the addition of eHSP90.
 Aim 2 will assess the changes in matrisome gene expression of the CM during neural fold elevation. The CM
cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which undergoes expansion during neural fold elevation.
The ECM is critical to morphogenesis in many systems. Embryonic tissues from key timepoints will be
analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing to identify extracellular matrix genes implicated in CM morphogenesis in
neural fold elevation. Bioinformatics analyses will identify differentially expressed genes, and in situ
hybridization experiments will map critical differential gene expression across different time points. Successful
completion of these studies will transform our understanding of the mechanisms leading to neural tube defects
and address a crucial gap in our understanding of neural tube formation."
10912624,"Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics represent one of the most exciting emerging biomedical
research tools. These technologies leverage massively multiplexed single-molecule RNA imaging to provide a
direct measure of not just the expression profile of every cell within intact samples but also the location of every
RNA molecule within those cells. As such, these techniques combine the ability of single-cell RNA sequencing
to generate whole-transcriptome expression measurements and discover and catalog cell types, states, and
lineage with the ability of high-resolution, fluorescence microscopy to interrogate the molecular organization of
cells, define their morphology, and reveal their interactions and organization. Thus, in situ transcriptome-scale
molecular imaging promises advances in a vast array of topics, from the role of intracellular RNA organization in
synaptic remodeling, to the spatial organization of commensal microbial communities and its effect on host gene
expression, to the modulatory role of the microenvironment in tumorigenesis, to name only a few examples.
 One image-based single-cell transcriptomics technique—MERFISH (multiplexed error robust fluorescence
in situ hybridization)—has emerged as a leading technology given its high resolution, high capture efficiency,
single-molecule sensitivity, and unparalleled throughput combined with its proven ability to map the intracellular
organization of large fractions of the transcriptome and discover, functionally annotate, and map cell types within
intact tissues. However, MERFISH remains a nascent technology, and to fully unlock the transformative potential
of both MERFISH and spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics in general, this technology must be matured.
 First, MERFISH must be made whole-transcriptome. Multiplexing is not the barrier, rather several RNA
categories—highly expressed RNAs, short RNAs, and highly homologous RNAs—remain challenging for this
technique. Through a combination of new experimental and computational advances, we will extend MERFISH
to these categories, creating whole-transcriptome MERFISH and allowing hypothesis-free discovery.
 Second, the biological demands for single-cell throughput are staggering, as even small tissues often contain
tens of millions of cells. By combining new sample preparation techniques, an emerging approach to ultra-high-
throughput microscopy, and advanced image storage and analysis tools, we will increase the throughput of
MERFISH by orders of magnitude, allowing characterization of large tissue areas and tens of millions of cells.
 Finally, the transformative potential for whole-transcriptome imaging could be very broad, yet MERFISH has
been validated in only a few tissues. Thus, we will provide a robust suite of sample preparation protocols and
quality metrics to make routine the application of MERFISH to all tissues and organisms.
 Here we will unlock the potential of this emerging technique by delivering rapid, robust, and routine whole-
transcriptome MERFISH. As gene expression is key to cellular identity and behavior in all domains of life, this
general tool could empower a truly remarkable range of basic and translational biomedical research."
10836005,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Puberty is a remarkable time during which the body develops secondary sexual characteristics and becomes
capable of reproduction. Puberty onset is due to a complex interplay of factors, including genetic influences.
Genetic mutations in disorders of puberty, including central precocious puberty (CPP) and delayed puberty,
provide windows into understanding the neuroendocrine mechanisms of puberty and reproduction.
The most common genetic cause of precocious puberty is due to loss-of-function mutations in Makorin Ring
Finger Protein 3 (MKRN3), and accounts for ~40% of familial CPP. The function and regulation of MKRN3 are
not well understood, but its protein structure suggests E3 ubiquitin ligase and RNA binding activities. Expression
of Mkrn3 is high in the mouse hypothalamus and rapidly declines before puberty onset. This supports its role as
the first identified inhibitor of puberty onset, hypothesized to act upstream of GnRH and/or its activators, such as
kisspeptin.
The current proposal aims to explore if alterations in Mkrn3 expression can similarly lead to delayed pubertal
onset using innovative mouse models and human investigation. Preliminary studies demonstrate a delayed
puberty phenotype in wild type female mice injected intracerebroventricularly with a recombinant virus
overexpressing Mkrn3. This current model will be used to explore MKRN3’s mechanism of action, including its
impact on known neuroendocrine players in reproduction. This recombinant virus will be used to assess if Mkrn3
overexpression can also lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism postpubertally following bilateral stereotaxic
injection into the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus. In a more specific model of overexpression, Mkrn3 will be
selectively overexpressed in kisspeptin neurons using a novel transgenic mouse model to better identify
MKRN3’s targets. Additionally, given the observation in preliminary studies that increases in Mkrn3 expression
can delay puberty onset, a well-characterized cohort of children with delayed puberty will be screened for coding
and non-coding variants in MKRN3 as this has not been previously explored.
Delayed puberty puts children at risk for long-term health risks. Therefore, elucidating the impact and
mechanisms of action of MKRN3 in delaying pubertal onset has important implications for advancing child health,
including improving diagnosis and management of pubertal disorders and can serve as a future therapeutic
target. Using the proposed tools to identify MKRN3’s targets of action is critical to understanding this key player
in the neuroendocrine control of puberty and reproduction."

the Cancer Center, reflects the Baltimore-DC corridor, and includes the Maryland State capital of Annapolis.
Eighty percent of our analytic tumor registry cases originate in this area, which is notably 32% African American.
Baltimore City is 62% African American and has a median income substantially lower and tobacco use rates
considerably higher than averages in Maryland and the United States. These factors make racial/ethnic and
socioeconomically rooted cancer disparities a critical priority for the Cancer Center. UMGCCC brings
considerable infrastructure to support community outreach and engagement (COE) activities, including an
experienced core team, a highly engaged and cancer-focused Community Advisory Board, a cadre of lay Cancer
Health Ambassadors recruited from the catchment area, and a host of longstanding community partnerships that
facilitate and support our work. We apply this infrastructure to the overall goal of COE: apply community
outreach and engagement strategies to inform UMGCCC research and make an impact along the cancer
continuum in the catchment area, with a particular focus on eliminating cancer disparities. The aims of COE are
to describe the UMGCCC catchment area using a data-driven approach, conduct evidence-based and impactful
cancer control activities, and apply COE strategies to inform research and support integration of COE throughout
the UMGCCC Programs. This involves communicating community needs to UMGCCC leadership and ensuring
that clinical trial enrollments reflect the demographics of our catchment area and that research priorities are
aligned with our COE strategic planning process. Our four-pronged strategic planning process used to identify
COE priorities, activities, and metrics includes analysis of catchment area data, community needs assessment,
Community Advisory Board engagement, and UMGCCC leadership and program inreach. This process guided
UMGCCC activities during the past grant cycle and drives our future plans with regard to priority populations,

shared service functions to enhance and accelerate the pace of discovery in cancer biology, immunology, cancer
mechanisms, populations science, and translational and clinical cancer research that meets the needs of patients
in our catchment area. UMGCCC supports seven shared services: Biostatistics, Flow Cytometry, Genomics,
Imaging, Pathology and Biorepository, Translational Laboratory, and Structural Biology. Dr. Nicholas Ambulos
serves as the associate director for Shared Services and as director of the University of Maryland School of
Medicine (UMSOM) Center for Innovative Biomedical Resources which houses the UMSOM core facilities. This
dual role enables him to manage these complimentary sets of state-of-the-art resources without duplicating
services. The shared service management team also includes Mr. Robert Mitchell, associate director for
Administration; Dr. Richard Eckert, UMGCC deputy director and associate director for Basic Science; Dr. Rena
Lapidus, assistant director for Shared Services (AstDSS); and three administrative staff. A key to successful
shared service management is open and transparent communication with UMGCCC leadership and
investigators. Multiple mechanisms allow users to provide critical feedback. Each shared service has a Faculty
Oversight Committee (FOC) that meets twice annually, sponsors user surveys, provides mechanisms for web-
based feedback, and presents lectures on the shared services to key stakeholders. Communication enables
users and shared service directors to work as partners to acquire new, cutting-edge instrumentation and to offer
new services. UMGCCC provides considerable financial support for shared services, including salary support,
direct operational support, funds for pilot grants that use the shared services, and funds for purchasing new
instrumentation. UMGCCC has invested $25 million in funding during the past 5 years to help procure state-of-
the-art instrumentation for most shared services. In return, the share services create a dynamic environment in
which the shared services accelerate the pace of research and provide innovation to enable discoveries that
lead to new diagnostics and therapeutics. Shared services impact all five research programs, providing support
for basic discovery science, translational research, clinical trials, and clinical care. Integration within the
University of Maryland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) enables UMGCCC members to
access ICTR funds, which can be used to purchase shared services. Shared service management guides

10916281,"7.0. Abstract: Clinical Protocol and Data Management
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM): The Clinical Research Management Office (CRMO)
provides clinical trial management services to more than 35 investigators and oversees high-quality conduct and
reporting of all cancer clinical trials at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) and the University of Maryland network sites. Comprising more than
50 full-time equivalent personnel, CRMO works closely with UMGCCC Disease/Modality Focused Groups (DFG)
to manage a robust cancer clinical trial portfolio that prioritizes institutionally and externally peer-reviewed trials
and complements UMGCCC's patient catchment area. CRMO utilizes the OnCore® database to track the
conduct of and patient accrual to all oncology clinical trials and to centrally report clinical research activities to
UMGCCC leadership. During the last grant period (CY2015–2019), CRMO supported the activation of 381
interventional clinical trials, resulting in 2,029 interventional trial enrollments during the reporting period. During
FY2019, costs to support CPDM were $4,569,709, of which $204,148 were funded by the CCSG. Data and
Safety Monitoring: UMGCCC's Data Safety Monitoring/Quality Assurance Committee (DSM/QAC) serves the
data safety monitoring function for protocols that do not have an external data and safety monitoring board
(DSMB). The DSM/QAC annually reviews safety information for patients accrued to all oncology protocols
considered “greater than minimal risk,” as defined in the UMGCCC-approved DSM Plan. This includes
investigator-initiated trials of any phase, all Phase I trials, and selected industry Phase II trials without a sponsor-
appointed DSMB, as well as multi-institutional, investigator-initiated trials for which UMGCCC is the coordinating
center. During FY2019, costs to support DSM/QAC were $93,938, of which $23,592 were funded by the CCSG.
This funding supported the annual review of 344 trials during the reporting period, as well as a percentage of
salaries for three staff members. Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research: UMGCCC
continues to demonstrate a robust enrollment of women and minorities into clinical trials. Among the 2,029 people
enrolled into interventional trials from CY2015–CY2019, 1,146 (56 percent) were women. Overall minority
accrual to clinical trials is 56 percent. This includes 48.2 percent underrepresented minorities as well as 7.8
percent Asians, the latter reflecting clinical trials examining health disparities in that group. Underrepresented
minority accrual to therapeutic trials is 34.7 percent. Inclusion of Individuals Across the Life Span in Clinical
Research: UMGCCC is strongly committed to including individuals across the life span into clinical research. Of
the 2,029 people enrolled into interventional trials from CY2015–CY2019, 448 (22 percent) were older than 65
years of age, and an average of 17 percent of all new UMGCCC pediatric patients were enrolled into

Disease/Modality Focused Group (DFG) meetings, where faculty and staff involved in specific disease teams
discuss current and proposed clinical trials. Step 2 involves the Clinical Research Committee (CRC) which
reviews all new cancer-related protocols for scientific merit, methodology, competing studies in the portfolio, and
reasonability of accrual goals before submission to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The CRC ensures an
expert biostatistics review of clinical trial design and calculation of sample size for each institutional and selected
non-institutional protocols. CRC reviews the Data Safety Monitoring plan to ensure sufficiency and receives DFG
and UMGCCC Protocol Feasibility Committee input to ensure proper prioritization and utilization of resources.
CRC continually reviews accrual to studies supported by UMGCCC and closes poorly accruing trials. Finally,
CRC provides scientific review for issues that arise relating to accrual, safety or adverse events noted by the
Data Safety Monitoring/Quality Assurance Committee, and addresses IRB questions. During the 2019 calendar
year, the CRC performed full committee level reviews of 123 protocols; 71 were approved as written, 31 were
approved with minor modifications, 15 were approved with major modifications requiring re-review, and 6 were
deferred. An expedited review process exists for research that is deemed to pose minimal risk, based on
University of Maryland–Baltimore IRB guidelines, and that involves chart reviews, interviews or surveys, studies
of archived biospecimens, collection/banking of biospecimens during routine clinical procedures, Phase III
industry-sponsored trials, or any Phase IV postmarketing study seeking more information on safety and efficacy.
During CY2019, expedited review approved 21 studies. To further refine the use of CRC resources, a new
category of review (Acknowledgment Review) was created in 2019 to allow for UMGCCC CRC acknowledgment
of research approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) or of
studies that have undergone external peer review (e.g., approved by the PRMS of another NCI-designated
cancer center or consortium trial). During CY2019, 172 trials were monitored for accrual and any protocols not
accruing at a rate suggesting successful completion of targeted enrollment within three to five years were
targeted for corrective action. In CY2019, UMGCCC received the “Most Improved” award, granted by Forte
Research for achieving a 90-day reduction in overall trial activation including a 9-day reduction in CRC approval.
Sixty-five warning letters were issued, resulting in closure of 11 protocols in CY2020. During FY2019, costs to
support PRMS exceeded $800,000, of which $40,479 in funding was from Cancer Center Support Grants."

10899756,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects the majority of men in later life and leads to considerable dysfunction.
Current treatments do not address the pathophysiology of the disease but rather target the overall prostate
physiology. The goal of our proposal is to identify BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) specific treatments by
uncovering its pathophysiology. BPH is marked by proliferation of both epithelial and stromal cells in the
transition zone of the prostate. This expansion of tissue surrounding the prostatic urethra presumably gives
rise to many of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with BPH. A number of biologic pathways
have been proposed to drive BPH including epithelial or stromal senescence, inflammation possibly related to
infection, and aberrant activation of developmental pathways.
We have recently performed gene expression profiling of BPH and identified at least two subtypes of BPH with
possible therapeutic implications. One of the two most significantly differentially expressed genes in our study
is CXCL13 which modulates the immune response. The CXCL13 finding represents an important lead in
understanding how the immune response is established in BPH. We hypothesize that immune-related
pathways play a significant role in BPH pathophysiology and that pathways associated with CXCL13 are
drivers.
The Aims of this proposal undertake to identify differences in immune response between BPH and normal
prostate and to uncover important pathophysiology relationships that arise from these differences. In Aim 1, we
will profile immune cell types in BPH and normal prostate using MIBI-TOF (Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by
Time-Of-Flight) to measure 14 different immune cells and understand their spatial relationships with the
epithelium and stroma. In Aim 2, we will identify spatial relationships and interactions between immune and
other cell types. We will do this by combining RNA profiling of the stromal and epithelial compartments with
multiplex IHC and computational modeling. In Aim 3, we will determine whether CXCL13 expression and
accompanying immune cells is part of an immune response or a senescence response. We will examine
whether senescent cell accumulation correlates with CXCL13 expression and BPH subtypes. We will also look
for the presence of B and/or T cell clonality."
10812427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The New York State International Training and Research Program (NYS-ITRP) proposes to continue
its HIV Research Training Program in Ukraine, through partnering with the School of Public Health of
National Ukraine Kyiv-Mohyla Academy School of Public Health (SPH NaUKMA) and the Ukrainian
Institute for Public Health Policy (UIPHP) in Kyiv. The long-term goal will address humanitarian crisis
sparked by the Russian invasion through a linked partnership with Ukraine’s leading academic public
health training institution and a research-focused nongovernmental organization. While NYS-ITRP
investments have strengthened the ability of Ukraine to respond to the HIV epidemic, the disruption of
the war presents new challenges. Utilizing the advanced studies in population-based topics and
implementation science, we will address Ukraine’s HIV delivery needs in a time of crisis. Proposed
objectives include providing: 1) HIV Research Fellowship to 6 students, composed of in-person
training, a NYSDOH AIDS Institute internship and opportunities for post-training mentorship and/or
research awards.; 2) provide advanced degree training (MS) in epidemiology for 3 early career
investigators which culminates in an HIV-focused thesis; 3) provide three scientific writing workshops
to 85 participants, with HIV Research Symposia in Years 1 and 5, and a scientific writing workshop in
Year 4; 4) build research training capacity at SPH NaUKMA through revising their core curricula and
adding coursework in implementation science, addiction, and qualitative research. Linked with post-
training mentorships, the program provides short- and long-term training modalities designed to
provide the maximum, cost-effective training coverage for individual trainees and expand research
training at NaUKMA given the exigencies of the ongoing conflict. NYS-TIRP will strengthen its
previous investments in public health training and capacity-building at NaUKMA. taking advantage of
its unique in-country research assets (including an extensive research portfolio by alumni trainees).
All training is designed to bolster research capacity focused on implementation science in response
to the war and to enhance the role of NaUKMA as a national leader in HIV-related research training.
Measures to demonstrate increased capacity include assessment of academic and research progress
of trainees; advanced in-country research awards; and SPH NaUKMA curricula review and
development."

The goal of this proposal is to provide research training in HIV genomic, treatment, and cure research at the
Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP), building on advances in laboratory research and clinical
trial infrastructure at BHP that support training opportunities in the most advanced HIV laboratory techniques
and study designs in the region. The environment at BHP offers a host of research opportunities for trained
researchers in Botswana, matching current research activities of the faculty mentors and key partners working
at the Botswana site. BHP is a partnership is between the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and the
Ministry of Health (MOH) in Botswana (and the University of Botswana), and the largest HIV/AIDS research
organization in Botswana (and one of the largest in Africa). The long-term goals and objectives of this Fogarty
training program are to continue training research leaders who can take responsibility for BHP within the next
5–10 years, and researchers who can become academic faculty at the University of Botswana (UB) and HIV
experts at MOH. Botswana currently has the third-highest prevalence of HIV in the world for adults (21%), but
has also had the highest rate of antiretroviral drug treatment (ART) for patients with HIV (over 90%), and BHP
has led efforts to support the treatment program with cutting-edge research in resistance and other genomic
work, supported by Fogarty trainees. This work is now extending into the realm of HIV cure research, and into
the intersection between HIV and SARS-CoV-2; BHP is now an internationally recognized center for research
to understand the relationship between new SARS-CoV-2 variant emergence and the HIV epidemic. The
training faculty at Harvard and at BHP will focus their ongoing efforts on keeping Fogarty trainees at the
forefront of genomics, treatment, and cure research and strengthening training opportunities that are not
available elsewhere in the region. We have requested funds for 2 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral positions
each year. We estimate that we will train about 18 trainees over 5 years, allowing for multiple years for each
PhD candidate and some postdoctoral fellows, and assuming several short-term trainees could fill a single
annual training slot. Stipends will be based on current degrees and research experience. All trainees would
have at least a BSc degree. We estimate that about half will be physicians with clinical experience. Some will
be postdoctoral fellows who have PhD’s in a related area but no experience in HIV research. Each trainee will
have a primary mentor. Selection of trainees is based on previous academic performance, references,
experience, and assurance that the candidates will return to participate in HIV research in Botswana. The
quality of the program will be monitored by a Training Advisory Committee composed of experts from the US
and the southern African region. The success of the training program will be judged by the implementation of
successful treatment research programs that involve trainees, numbers of trainee publications in high-impact
journals, and relative increase in senior research positions at BHP, UB, and MOH held by former trainees."

10914093,"Project Summary 
Perhaps the most notable example of “interoception” is the “gut feeling”. The stomach can affect intuition, emotion and cognition; the brain can regulate food ingestion and digestion. The stomach contains its own enteric nervous system, or the “little brain” in the gut. It connects directly to the central nervous system via the vagus. The vagus nerves provide a bi-directional – afferent and efferent – neural pathway for rapid interactions between the stomach and the brain. The stomach-vagus-brain connectome is central to human health and has significant health implications at dysfunction. However, this connectome has not been mapped or characterized in detail. It is unclear where and how the brain monitors and regulates the function of the stomach in terms of its electrical rhythm, mechanical contraction, and nutrient handling. It is also not exactly clear how the vagus nerves relay sensory information from the stomach to the brain and convey motor control from the brain to the stomach. To fill these gaps, this project is aimed to characterize the central and peripheral neural circuits of stomach-brain interoception in rats. For the central component, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake animals to map the central gastric network and characterize its activity and connectivity with respect to gastric electrical rhythm, mechanical contraction, and nutrient handling. To verify the central gastric network, we will use neuroanatomical tracing with pseudorabies virus and herpes simplex virus type-1. For the peripheral component, we will use the vagus nerve and nodose ganglion electrophysiology to characterize the afferent signaling from the stomach to the brain and the efferent signaling from the brain to the stomach. To elucidate the causal interaction between the stomach and the brain, we will use cell-type specific chemogenetics to perturb the central gastric network and assess the resulting effect on the stomach and use vagotomy to perturb the vagal circuitry and assess the resulting effect on the brain. This project has 4 specific aims for mapping the central gastric network (Aim 1) and characterizing the central and peripheral neural circuits for stomach-brain interoception related to gastric electrophysiology (Aim 2), motility (Aim 3), and ingestion of nutrients (Aim 4). To accomplish these aims, we form a collaborative and interdisciplinary team of experts with leading and complementary expertise in magnetic resonance imaging, gastroenterology, neuromodulation and electrophysiology. Upon its successful completion, this project will have integrated cutting-edge technologies into a unique platform for comprehensive assessment of the central and peripheral functional neural circuits underlying stomach-brain interoception. As the immediate outcome, we will have established the central gastric network in the rat brain, disentangled its functional roles, and elucidated the causal, rather than correlational, interactions between the stomach and the brain. These outcomes will lay both mechanistic and technical foundations for better understanding of stomach-brain interoception and its profound implications to mental illnesses (e.g., stress and anxiety), neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s diseases) and gastric disorders (e.g., functional dyspepsia), and the co-occurrence of both brain and gastric disorders."
10909201,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Physical and emotional trauma are linked to numerous negative health effects, including a nearly three-fold
increase in the odds of reporting chronic pain. Research suggests that post-traumatic chronic pain is preceded
by at least three classes of factors (i.e., psychological, neurobiological, and social) that might allow for earlier
identification of vulnerable individuals. Yet, current data used to elucidate potential mechanisms linking
traumatic events to pain development have been limited. Capturing longitudinal data that identifies early risk
factors and vulnerabilities to pain is particularly difficult. Additionally, few studies have evaluated the role of
social perception and sensitivity to negative social stimuli (i.e., ‘social sensitivity’) as potential mediators linking
trauma exposure to physical pain. The current proposal seeks to address these limitations by integrating
multiple domains and levels of analysis to examine the impact of traumatic response on the development and
persistence of chronic pain. The project will first leverage existing longitudinal and experimental data collected
as part of the Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR traumA (AURORA) study (NIMH U01MH110925) to
explore psychological and neurobiological contributions to post-traumatic pain vulnerability. The project will
then expand beyond the data available in AURORA by conducting an experimental study in participants with
varying histories of trauma and clinical pain characteristics to examine the associations between social
perception and sensitivity, trauma sequelae, and pain. The study will utilize experimental paradigms
measuring emotion perception, perspective-taking, and social sensitivity and assess these social processing
factors as potential mediators of the association between trauma sequelae and pain characteristics. The
association between survey measures of social perception and pain symptoms will also be assessed over
time. This research proposal is part of a larger training plan that allows the candidate to develop expertise in
trauma and pain, longitudinal data analysis, and experimental methodology; and leadership skills through
management of a small study team. The candidate has assembled a mentorship team of experts with
extensive expertise in pain phenotyping, trauma, experimental methodology, and statistical analysis.
Combined with the rich environment of the University of Michigan, this award will provide focused training to
establish a unique niche of expertise and an independent research program focused on the intersection of
trauma and pain. It will also provide critical preliminary data for future funding dedicated to advancing our
understanding in this critical area of research."

ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core supports the goals of the Collaborative Center to Develop Improved Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Approaches to Endometriosis of developing advanced tools and insights for
improved understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis.
The overall objective of the Administrative Core is to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the Center.
The Administrative Core will achieve this objective by Promoting Communication (Aim 1). Multidirectional
communication will be enhanced by scheduled weekly, monthly, and yearly meetings that will have a clear pre-
set agenda. The Administrative Core will also Ensure Regulatory Compliance, Budgetary Compliance, and
Scientific Quality (Aim 2). Our emphasis will be on providing budgetary oversight and ensuring scientific rigor
and reproducibility, with assistance from the Research Integrity Officer (RIO) at UNC if needed. The
Administrative Core will also Oversee the Organization and Function of the External Advisory Committee (Aim
3). A board of 2 expert clinician-scientists and a basic scientist will serve to broadly discuss and critique the
program’s research efforts. Finally, the Administrative Core will Fund and Oversee the Pilot Project (Aim 4). The
pilot is intended to both extend the overall goals of the Center and support a project that will have a high likelihood
of future independent, external funding. Collectively, our four aims will provide guidelines whereby the
Administrative Core can facilitate data-sharing and interaction among the three large projects of the Center led
by four outstanding investigators, a pilot project, and two cores, further enhancing the synergism among the
research projects.
The Administrative Core, under the leadership of Dr. Young, will be assisted by a talented and experienced
administrator and research grant accountant. The infrastructure and support provided by the UNC Center for
Women’s Health Research, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the UNC School of Medicine will
serve as a buttress to ensure the administrative success of the core. The multidirectional communication and
administrative leadership provided by this core will coordinate the research response with an ultimate outcome
of improving female reproductive health through successful prevention and treatment of endometriosis."

current therapeutic approaches prevent fertility and are minimally effective. The dependence on surgical
assessment delays diagnosis and limits clinicians and researchers from confirming endometriosis lesion
recurrence or response to therapies. Thus, a better paradigm is needed to scientifically address this disorder.
Chronic inflammation underlies both infertility and pain in the disease. While resolution of inflammation
throughout the body requires specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including derivatives of arachidonic
acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, these mediators have not been closely examined in
women with endometriosis. Some SPMs require SIRT1, a histone deacetylase that epigenetically regulates
many disease processes and is overexpressed in the eutopic endometrium of individuals with endometriosis in
humans, baboons, rhesus macaques, and mouse endometrium. However, inflammation persists in
endometriosis, suggesting that SIRT1 induction of SPM resolving activity is compromised. Our preliminary data
indicate that a change in receptor expression results in a shift from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory actions
of SPMs. Therefore, SIRT1 and SPMs may represent novel therapeutic targets for endometriosis.
Our specific aims address the gaps in endometriosis diagnosis and therapy as follows:
In Aim 1, we approach the problem of diagnosis by refining a novel imaging technique that takes advantage of
both steroid hormone expression in endometriosis lesions and the associated inflammation: we propose imaging
endometriosis using a progestin-based tracer 21-[18F]fluoro-furanyl-nor-progesterone (FFNP) for positron
emission tomography (PET) combined with simultaneous gadolinium(Gd)-contrast, magnetic resonance imaging
(GMRI), to allow anatomic localization of endometriosis lesions and highlight areas of inflammation.
In Aim 2, we directly address the issue of treatment by investigating why endometriosis-related inflammation is
not resolved by SPMs, including evaluation of post-translational modifications of SIRT1 and expression of SPM
biosynthetic enzymes and receptors in women with and without endometriosis; and the correlation of these
parameters with inflammation and metabolic alterations in human and non-human primate tissue.
This project exhibits clear synergy with both Project 2 (Jeong and Lessey) and Project 3 (Slayden) and provides
cross-species and cross-model comparisons between humans, nonhuman primates, and mouse models, aided
by the Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB) Core."

The Administrative Core will be co-led by Diné College (tribal college of the Navajo Nation) [MPIs: MC Bauer, 
PhD and CB Kahn, DrPH (Navajo)] and Northern Arizona University (NAU) [MPIs: NI Teufel-Shone, PhD and J 
Wilson, MPH (Navajo)] using a collaborative leadership model. In contrast to a hierarchical or autocratic 
approach, collaborative leadership supports a style of administration and management in which the skills and 
knowledge of all members of the leadership team are honored for their potential contribution to decision 
making, resource allocation, communication and organization. This approach supports the equitable 
integration of the senior MPIs (M. Bauer and N. Teufel-Shone) and the junior MPIs (C. Kahn and J. Wilson). 
Dr. Kahn and Ms. Wilson have worked with the Navajo NARCH for more than four years as component 
coordinators, but now will be transitioning to assuming new roles in the leadership team. This approach will 
assure that the 4 MPI leadership team functions effectively and efficiently, and effectuates the goal of 
mentoring early career Navajo scholars to develop the skills and confidence to lead a multi-component 
research-education center. For four years, Navajo NARCH has prioritized the development of reciprocal 
relationships with agencies and program directors/managers to gain experience for a new generation of health 
researchers and public health practitioners and in turn, to offer the skills of this eager and now, well educated 
workforce to contribute to health research and public health efforts within Navajo Nation. The Center has 
assembled a diverse group of Community Advisory Board (CAB) members from across Navajo Nation, 
representing public health, primary health care, health research, education, government, and tribally and 
federally-run programs to assure the regional and cultural relevance of NARCH activities. The aims of this 
Core are designed to ensure effective, coordinated action and progression towards the goals of the Center. In 
Years 1-4, the Administrative Core will 1) Manage an infrastructure that fosters transparent communication 
among all Center personnel and Community Advisory Board (CAB) members, supports efficient operation and 
promotes an environment conducive to ethical and productive training, collaboration and research, 2) Provide 
clear leadership and oversight to facilitate effective distribution of resources and identify training and career 
development opportunities for NARCH team members, and 3) Convene quarterly with the CAB to obtain 
guidance and feedback on implementation and dissemination activities, and solicit strategies to leverage the 
Center's resources to build the service and research capacity of the Navajo Nation. The Administrative Core 
will use a mixed methods approach to track factors contributing to progress, achievements, delays and related 
changes of the Center components’ stated goals and aims and to evaluate the Center's outcomes and 
challenges."

Significant resource and infrastructural disparities hinder Native populations’ access to the health and public
health services enjoyed by the general U.S. population. To develop culturally relevant approaches to building
healthy communities, more Native health professionals and researchers are needed for Native Nations to
exercise their sovereignty and to achieve health equity. Yet, for aspiring health professionals on rural
reservations, education and training opportunities are limited. From 2017-2020, the Navajo Native American
Research Center for Health (NARCH) Partnership’s SEP built and institutionalized key components of an
educational pathway for Navajo students, specifically a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health (BSPH) at
Diné College and the Indigenous Health concentration within the Master’s in Public Health (MPH) program at
Northern Arizona University (NAU). These programs are foundational to the infrastructure needed to conduct
relevant, evidence-based health research and provide essential public health services to the Navajo people.
Informed by SEP evaluation, recognizing the need to cultivate a generation of pre-college students to select
public health and health research as a profession, and identifying the importance of professional development
at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels, the overarching goal of Navajo NARCH SEP
(2021-2025) is to build and sustain an “education to profession pathway” pertinent to health research
and public health needs of the Navajo Nation. The Navajo NARCH SEP specific aims are to: 1) Expand
NARCH collaborations with high schools and related organizations to inform and expose students to the roles
and career paths of health-related professions; 2) Expand the Diné College BSPH program by developing
additional local research experiences, strengthening academic skills and alignment with graduate programs,
and building connections across six campuses on Navajo Nation to better support student learning and
development; 3) Adapt the NAU MPH program Indigenous Health (IH) concentration, to align with the practice
and research needs of the Navajo Nation Department of Health, Indian Health Service and Diné College and 4)
Mentor recent Navajo post-doctoral fellows or Early Stage Investigators to build skills for successful, externally
funded research careers focused on health equity for the Navajo Nation. SEP will leverage existing academic
and professional partnerships and coordinate with the NARCH Administrative Core and pilot research projects
to provide experiential learning and training opportunities with on-going and community-based projects.
Engagement with health services and active research allows students to apply their knowledge and build
professional contacts. Project impact will be tracked quantitatively, through student enrollment, degrees
awarded, accomplishments (job placement, graduate school and grants submitted) and qualitatively, through
student voice documenting factors associated with academic success and application of learned skill sets."
10933411,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive subtype of breast cancer
characterized by the highest potential for metastasis and thus the worst clinical outcomes of all breast cancer
subtypes. The outcome in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) is particularly poor with a median overall survival time of
< 16 months. Chemoimmunotherapeutic treatment strategies employing chemotherapeutics, including both
conventional compounds and targeted therapies, and PD-1 blockade have proven efficacious for a variety of
solid tumor malignancies, however, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 chemoimmunotherapy is limited in the context of
mTNBC with an estimated overall progression-free survival of < 10 months and overall survival < 2 years for the
best-case scenarios. While the outcomes observed thus far represent a minor improvement for mTNBC, anti-
PD-1 chemoimmunotherapy has achieved > 40% 5-year overall survival with greater improvements in response
rate and progression-free survival in other solid tumor malignancies. Thus, further studies are needed to optimize
anti-PD-1 chemoimmunotherapeutic strategies in mTNBC.
 Despite the essential synergistic role that chemotherapy plays in anti-PD-1 chemoimmunotherapeutic
treatment strategies, the identification and selection of the optimal chemotherapeutic agent(s) that best synergize
with PD-1 blockade for an individual patient remain a critically unmet need. Previous studies have identified that
the immunomodulatory effects of chemotherapy (chemo-immunomodulation) are imperative for anti-PD-1
chemoimmunotherapeutic efficacy, thus, understanding the factors that influence chemo-immunomodulation
may be critical for optimizing anti-PD-1 chemoimmunotherapeutic treatment strategies. Nevertheless, while
studies have sought to understand genomic and transcriptomic features that influence chemoresistance, few
studies have focused on factors that influence chemo-immunomodulation. The objectives of this proposal are to
identify, characterize, and establish the clinical relevance of genomic and transcriptomic features that influence
chemo-immunomodulation and utilize the data generated from the studies herein to develop a machine-learning-
based model predictive of chemo-immunomodulation by select agents. Aim 1, 2A, and 2B of this proposal will
identify and characterize genomic and transcriptomic factors that influence chemo-immunomodulation using bulk
and single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches in in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models of mTNBC. Aim 2C will
establish the clinical relevance of these findings for selected chemotherapeutics using preclinical mTNBC murine
models. Aim 3 seeks to utilize the abundance of data generated through single-cell RNA-sequencing to generate
preliminary machine learning models that are predictive of chemo-immunomodulation for selected
chemotherapeutic agents. The results of this study may provide information that guides novel approaches in
designing, optimizing, and maximizing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 chemoimmunotherapeutic strategies based on
patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic characteristics and their influence on chemo-immunomodulation."

Liver cirrhosis and its complications cause significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cirrhosis and
cirrhosis-related mortality are rising in parallel with shifts in the demographics driven by increases in alcoholic-
and nonalcoholic- fatty liver disease. Current cirrhotic populations are enriched with older patients with damage
in other tissues caused by obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and/or alcohol. These factors confound cirrhosis
management and often preclude liver transplantation as a therapeutic option. Consequently, the number of
patients with decompensated cirrhosis is growing. Hepatic decompensation results from loss of functional liver
parenchyma and the severity of liver dysfunction is a proven-predictor of cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, our overall objective is to develop novel approaches to preserve liver function and prevent hepatic
decompensation in cirrhosis. Success necessitates more information about: i) modifiable risks that drive hepatic
dysfunction and ii) how hepatic dysfunction impacts the health of other organs. To address these gaps in
knowledge, we will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of patients with cirrhosis (Aim 1) and develop/implement
an interventional trial using an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) in cirrhotic patients who are at high risk for
hepatic decompensation. Both aims are grounded by the scientific premise that cirrhosis is caused by defective,
maladaptive liver regeneration. Our pre-clinical research: i) reveals that liver regeneration requires tightly scripted
reactivation of developmental signaling pathways that were once thought to be silenced in adult livers (but known
to reactivate in cancer) and ii) shows that when these pathways become dysregulated, they impair regeneration
and drive liver disease to progress to cirrhosis and cancer. These findings explain why organ failure, fibrosis
and cancer risk typically evolve in parallel and justify research in human cirrhotic populations to identify factors
that impact the regenerative mechanisms (Aim1). They also provide a strong conceptual basis for evaluating
the ability of statins to improve liver function in cirrhosis (Aim2) because statins have anti-inflammatory and
metabolic actions that are predicted to favorably modulate regenerative pathways. The Duke Liver Program is
ideally-positioned for membership in the new Cirrhosis Clinical Network which will be configured to accomplish
these aims: our multidisciplinary team of providers cares for a large, diverse cirrhotic population and we have
had strong institutional support to develop outstanding programs in liver disease research and personalized
medicine. Successful accomplishment of our Aims will enable a more ‘personalized’ approach to management
that will improve cirrhosis outcomes despite challenging co-morbid conditions."

10693474,"Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia (PjP) in immunocompromised patients.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the first line drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of PjP.
However, many patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMX due to severe allergic reactions. Secondary treatments such
as pentamidine are either toxic or not as effective as TMP-SMX. PjP remains refractory to most common
antifungal drugs necessitating novel approaches for new agent discovery.
 Echinocandins, β -1,3 -D-glucan synthase inhibitors, are a newer family of antifungal agents. Reports of the
efficacy of echinocandins for PjP have been contradictory, due in large part to the anecdotal nature of the reports
and combinations with other agents. However, new data from meta-analyses indicate that a combination of
TMP-SMX with echinocandins can lead to a reduction in mortality and improved treatment responses. This new
finding together with the novel insights on the effects of echinocandins on Pneumocystis pneumonia we accrued,
position us to take the next steps in optimizing and understanding this synergy.
 Mouse and rat models of Pneumocystis pneumonia are surrogates for P. jirovecii infection, since no species
of Pneumocystis can be cultivated outside the lung. Fortunately, rodent models are predictive of drug efficacy
in humans. During the tenure of the previous VA Award, we have made several significant discoveries that
we will use to our advantage for the proposed studies, most notably the fact that Pneumocystis spp. are obligated
to undergo sexual replication to survive, grow, and transmit the infection. Treatment with echinocandins interrupt
the sexual cycle, leading to its eventual elimination.
 We will concentrate on the effects of anidulafungin monotherapy (AnM) and combination therapy with TMP-
SMX (AnTS), on the P. carinii sexual cycle and the ability of the host to transmit the infection. We posit that as
sexual obligates, a better understanding of these treatments on the sexual cycle will lead to more efficient
regimens and identify at what point hosts are unable to transmit the infection. Our approaches will employ single
cell RNA-seq and in vivo animal strategies. Typically used to interrogate mammalian cells, application of sc-
RNA-seq to a human fungal pathogen is highly innovative. The aims of this proposal are to:
 Aim 1. Define the perturbations by anidulafungin monotherapy (AnM) and anidulafungin/TMP-SMX
combination therapy (AnTS) on the sexual cycle of Pneumocystis carinii using single cell profiling
(scRNA-seq). We have shown that scRNA-seq can be used to identify clusters of life cycle stages from BALF
of P. carinii-infected rats (Preliminary Data). In the present aim, three groups of P. carinii-infected rats will be
employed to achieve our goals: (i) Untreated, infected, and immunosuppressed rats (Control); (ii) infected,
immunosuppressed treated with AnM; and (iii) infected, immunosuppressed, treated with AnTS. BALF will be
used for scRNA-seq and harvested at 3 time points during treatment. Data from these studies will vastly improve
our understanding of the effects of the treatments on the infection and potential synergy.
 Aim 2. Temporally assess the recovery of the sexual cycle of P. carinii after release from
echinocandins. We have shown that asci return 6-7 days after cessation of anidulafungin treatment. Here we
will withdraw AnM and AnTS treatment after the 3-week period while the rats will continue on immunosuppression
to allow repopulation of infection. We will use scRNA-seq to determine the life cycle stages that repopulate and
at what point the rats can transmit the infection. While we anticipate the AnTS may eradicate the infection, we
know that An does not. Concomitant with the weekly scRNA-seq data, we will evaluate when the rats are
infectious to immunosuppressed recipient rats. These studies will allow us to examine the early events of the
sexual cycle and determine at what point the fungi can transmit the infection and what genes are associated with
the infective phase."

renewal of support for a pre-doctoral and postdoctoral training program that emphasizes four broadly
defined areas of vision research: (1) Advanced optical technology for vision correction and retinal
imaging, (2), cell biology of the normal and diseased eye, (3) neural mechanisms of vision and (4) vision
in behavior.
Training faculty have extensive cross-campus and cross-department collaborations, a strong record of
mentoring and high research funding levels. Training is interdisciplinary, drawing particularly on the
unique technical and intellectual resources of CVS. It covers a broad range of basic and clinical
problems in vision but emphasizes approaches that link visual performance to underlying biological
mechanisms.
The program has a strong record of trainee productivity, PhD student retention and fast average time
to PhD. Similarly, postdoctoral trainees overwhelmingly pursue scientific careers, with significant
numbers entering tenure-track positions in academia. Trainees have a good record of subsequent
individual training and research funding, as well as successful research and research-related career
paths. The program also has a good record of recruiting, training and career placement for trainees
from under-represented minority groups.
For our renewal application, we request support for 5 pre-doctoral trainees per year, who will generally
enter the program through the Departments of Brain and Cognitive Science, Biomedical Engineering,
the Neuroscience Graduate Program and the Institute of Optics. Students will take core courses plus
advanced seminars in visual science, augmented by courses from the departments through which they
entered the program. Concurrently with course work, students complete research projects in CVS
preceptor labs.
Finally, we also request support for two postdoctoral fellows per year. Postdoctoral training has a heavy
emphasis on research performance, productivity and communication. All trainees take part in topical
workshops, special topics seminars, regular colloquia, research talk series, the CVS retreat, and the
biannual CVS Symposium."
10918333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Acute gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for over 2.2 million hospital days and 19.2 billion dollars of
medical charges annually. 52% to 55% of patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding are unnecessarily
hospitalized, leading to wasted resources. Although risk stratification of patients presenting with gastrointestinal
bleeding is recommended, risk-assessment scoring systems are not commonly used in practice, have sub-
optimal performance, may be applied incorrectly, and are not easily updated.
 Most current risk scores were designed for use based on the location of the bleeding source: upper or
lower gastrointestinal tract. However, the location of the bleeding source is not always clear at presentation. A
risk score that bases initial assessment on presenting symptoms (e.g., hematemesis, melena, hematochezia) is
more relevant and useful in clinical practice. The electronic health record can be used to identify patients with
acute gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms and extract clinical data to automatically calculate risk scores that are
made available to providers. Machine learning (field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without
being explicitly programmed), particularly deep learning using neural networks (collection of nodes that process
and transmit information), can create electronic health record-based models that perform better than clinical risk
scores for gastrointestinal bleeding and are well-suited for learning from new data.
 This proposal will use deep learning tools on electronic health record data to decrease unnecessary
hospitalization in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding by identifying low risk patients. The goals are to 1)
Develop and validate an accurate and clinically useful deep learning algorithm for initial risk stratification superior
to existing clinical risk scores 2) Develop and validate a dynamic deep learning tool to model risk over time, and
3) Pilot the best performing algorithms in the electronic health record. Deep learning algorithms will be developed
using a dataset of electronic health record data of 7,000 patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding from two
academic hospitals in the Yale-New Haven Health System. Validation will be performed on a separate dataset
of patients at Partners Healthcare in Boston, Massachusetts. Neural network approaches will be applied to
patients’ data updated over time to evaluate the trajectory towards requiring transfusion of red blood cells. Finally,
a pilot study will implement the best-performing algorithms in the electronic health record for a 3-month period
to test feasibility of deployment and acceptability to providers and patients. Planned coursework includes deep
learning with biomedical data, risk assessment and longitudinal analysis.
 This work has potential to generate cost savings through better integrated risk stratification of patients
presenting with overt gastrointestinal bleeding. To meet the research and educational goals of this proposal, the
mentorship team includes a primary mentor in gastrointestinal bleeding and co-mentors in deep learning,
electronic health record-based clinical trial design of prognostic algorithms, and implementation science."
10906086,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) occurs along a continuum from normal cognition to dementia and affects nearly
a quarter of individuals 70-79 years old, with the prevalence drastically increasing each decade after. Although
most older adults with MCI (OAwMCI) are independent in their daily living, they are known to have significantly
greater likelihood of falls compared to their cognitively intact counterparts. In addition to cognitive deficits,
persons with MCI can experience motor dysfunction, including deficits in gait and balance. While changes in
stance posture control and gait functionality have been thoroughly investigated in this population, reactive
balance control and protective stepping responses that are recruited to recover from unpredictable, larger
external perturbations have not yet been extensively examined. Additionally, though OAwMCI show slower
adaptation and motor learning in comparison to their healthy counterparts, it remains to be unknown whether
OAwMCI can adapt to task-specific training via repeated exposure to unpredicted perturbations as healthy
older adults (OA) do. Furthermore, it is well established that OAwMCI have worse dual-task performance
during both stance and gait. This presentation is related to impaired executive function, visuomotor function
and spatial awareness. However, dual-task performance during perturbed stance and gait in association with
increased fall-risk has not yet been investigated in OAwMCI. In addition, it is well-established that higher
cortical centers play a vital role in modulation of reactive balance control. Interestingly, in OAwMCI, the decline
in volitional balance control under sensory and cognitive challenges is corelated to an increased resting state
activation of the default mode network, reduced white matter integrity and reduced gray matter volume.
However, there is limited evidence examining the association between impaired structural integrity and
neural correlates with reactive balance control measures and resulting higher occurrence of falls in this
population. Our previous research has shown that two key variables, reactive control of stability and vertical
limb support, contribute to more than 90% of laboratory slip-falls in OA. Thus, improving these key variables
can contribute to significant reduction in fall risk in OA. However, such task-specific intervention-based studies
are lacking in the MCI population. To fill the gap in the literature, our study proposes to investigate the
differences in neuromechanics of reactive stepping responses to externally-induced balance perturbations
in OAwMCI compared to OA. Further, our study proposes to relate reactive stability control to changes in
brain structural and functional connectivity. Lastly, our study proposes to determine the effect of a novel task-
specific perturbation-based cognitive-motor intervention for enhancing fall-resisting skills in OAwMCI."

10884203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Latinos are at an elevated risk for medical undertreatment of chronic spine pain (CSP) due to having a lower
socioeconomic status, inconsistent access to healthcare, limited English proficiency, comorbid conditions, high
prevalence of occupational injuries, and systemic prejudicial discrimination. Physical activity (PA) has been
widely accepted as an effective non-pharmacological pain management strategy, yet many Latinos with pain
do not engage in PA. Latinos with CSP face distinct challenges to engaging in PA that may be influenced by
multiple levels of the socioecological model including intrapersonal (e.g., social identities, pain or PA-related
beliefs), interpersonal (e.g., social support), and environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood walkability). These
multilevel factors may also intersect to influence PA engagement in Latinos with CSP. Considering the
complexity of PA behavior, integrating the socioecological model and intersectional framework support the
assessment of how predictors intersect to influence PA. Furthermore, there are time-varying elements of PA
(e.g., pain, social support, and environment) among Latinos with CSP that can be triggered by a specific event
or at random. Thus, assessing momentary fluctuations in the relationships between multilevel factors with PA
and identifying specific environmental contexts that facilitate or impede PA engagement is warranted. The
proposed study aims to conduct a secondary analysis of baseline data from an ongoing clinical trial near the
US-Mexico border to assess how multilevel factors intersect to influence PA (Aim 1). A mixed methods
approach will then be conducted to first explore what multilevel factors have the potential to influence
momentary PA and second, use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to assess how these real-time
factors intersect to form person-specific networks predicting free-living PA among Latinos with CSP (Aim 2).
Both aims will conduct an intersectional sub-analysis that evaluates subgroups that may be at a greater
disadvantage for physical activity opportunities. Findings from this study are expected to shed light on PA
disparities among Latinos with CSP while setting the foundation for the applicant’s future research goals of
developing momentary and personalized behavioral interventions targeting this population. Through this F31
mechanism, the applicant will gain advanced interdisciplinary training in the fields of physical activity, pain, and
digital health that will significantly contribute to the applicant’s long-term goal of being an independent, public
health researcher."
10873716,"Project Abstract
The United States (US) has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world. Hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy (HDP) such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia are major
contributors to maternal mortality and morbidity, complicating approximately 2% to 8% of all pregnancies. In the
US, Black women have disproportionately higher rates of HDP and are almost four times more likely to die from
HDP compared to White women. Urgent action is required to address this racial disparity in HDP and lower the
maternal mortality rate. While traditional cardiovascular risk factors are important contributors to HDP, social
determinants of health (SDOH) have been identified as a fundamental cause of disease and health disparities,
acting at multiple levels of influence. Yet, few studies go beyond the individual level to examine how SDOH,
particularly multi-level products of structures and systems, contribute to the substantial racial gap in HDP. To
address this need, I will identify contributors to HDP disparities using the socio-ecological framework.
Specifically, this proposal will determine whether neighborhood-level racial residential segregation,
interpersonal-level perceived discrimination, and individual-level pre-pregnancy CVD risk factors contribute to or
explain the observed Black-White disparity in HDP. This multi-level research model considers the complex
interplay between individual, community, and societal factors providing a comprehensive approach to
understanding the etiology of HDP disparities. To do this work, I will leverage data from the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults study, a prospective cohort study of 5,114 Black and White adults
(nBlackWomen=1480; nWhiteWomen =1307), age 18-30 in 1985 and followed for over 30 years. In aim 1 (neighborhood),
I will determine whether racial residential segregation is associated with incident HDP among Black parous
women. In aim 2 (interpersonal), I will determine whether perceived racial discrimination in the medical care
setting is associated with incident HDP and whether it contributes to the Black-White disparity in HDP. In aim 3
(individual), I will determine whether pre-pregnancy CVD risk factors (defined by the American Heart
Association’s Life’s Essential 8) are associated with incident HDP and whether these factors contribute to the
Black-White disparity in HDP. These aims are embedded within a training plan designed to build my competence
in epidemiology and health disparities research while facilitating my success as a physician-scientist specializing
in women’s health. Identifying reasons for the disparities in HDP is fundamental to develop targeted and effective
interventions to close the racial gap and improve maternal care in the US. This proposal will therefore address
a critical and emergent public health priority to reduce maternal mortality, particularly among Black women."
10872169,"Summary
Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the Western World with a
complex etiology. The fundamental abnormalities occurring in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) resulting in
their progressive dysfunction and subsequent atrophy in AMD, are still not known. However, candidate
pathogenic pathways linked to the development of disease have emerged from the convergence of a sundry
of epidemiological, genetic, morphological, and biochemical studies, including inflammation, lipid
dysregulation, apoptosis, and RPE barrier dysfunction among others. Currently there are no drugs available
to treat dry AMD.
In this proposal we concentrate on investigating the biology and function of osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular
glycoprotein known for its involvement in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative and systemic
diseases, in which inflammation is key, in part through its role as a macrophage recruitment and retention
factor. However, OPN reportedly plays a two-sided role having both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties.
Furthermore, OPN has also been shown to regulate cellular homeostasis effecting cell differentiation,
metabolism, autophagy, phagocytosis, and apoptosis to name a few. This potential paradox in the role of
OPN may in part be due to the fact that (1) OPN function is cell and tissue specific, and (2) most studies
have not delineated the roles of the different OPN isoforms, which include intracellular versus secreted OPN
and splice variants OPNa, b, and c. With this in mind, we propose to systematically investigate the role of
OPN in AMD vulnerable cells with a focus on RPE biology and test the therapeutic potential of modifying
OPN levels in animal models that present with dry ‘AMD-like’ pathologies.
Published studies and key preliminary observations that precipitated pursuing this study include (1)
circulating soluble OPN (sOPN) levels increase in a subpopulation of individuals with age; (2) the role of
intracellular OPN, is less known but associated with amelioration of inflammation; (3) intracellular OPN
expression in human RPE cells is decreased in early dry AMD donor tissue; (4) secreted OPN accumulates
extracellularly in drusen and basal deposits of human AMD donor tissue; (5) plasma OPN is elevated in late
dry AMD patients; and (6) human RPE cells secrete OPN following oxidant injury and are a potential local
source. Based on our preliminary data and the known paradoxical anti- and pro-inflammatory roles of OPN
in neurodegenerative and systemic diseases that share common pathogenic pathways with AMD, we will
test the hypotheses that OPN regulates inflammation, aberrant RPE barrier function, and cell homeostatic
mechanisms, in an isoform dependent manner."

The motivation to consume ethanol is a fickle thing. It differs wildly between individuals, but even in one
individual, this motivation is not always constant. However, the exact dynamics that translate motivation to
consume to the literal act of consumption remain poorly understood. The central nucleus of the amygdala may
be an essential piece in this process. Its anatomical connections hint at its potential role in ethanol and food
reward consumption, given that it is densely innervated by canonical reward processing centers and itself
innervates regions directing motor behaviors and attention. However, the exact mechanisms and firing patterns
that drive the central nucleus of the amygdala’s involvement in driving reward consumption remain poorly
understood. This proposal makes use of a foundational technique, in vivo electrophysiology, to uncover how
the central nucleus of the amygdala electrical activity relates to alcohol seeking and taking. In looking at the
activity of this region over the course of a whole instrumental task session, a clearer conclusion about the
central nucleus of the amygdala’s role in synthesizing motivation to drive motor behaviors can be obtained. In
aim 1, the neural activity pattern in the central nucleus of the amygdala will be monitored over the course of an
ethanol self-administration task to understand how activity in this region changes across trials as an animal’s
motivation to consume ethanol wanes. For aim 2, the proposed electrophysiology recordings will occur when
water-deprived rats perform a choice task that promotes a switch in reward preference from water to ethanol.
These planned recordings will elucidate central nucleus of the amygdala activity when there are competing
motivations. In aim 3, the effect of dependence on both instrumental tasks will be assessed to understand how
the firing in this region following dependence-inducing high concentrations of ethanol. In completing these aims
and disseminating the data I find, I will also further my independence and confidence as an independent
researcher while also improving my theoretical, technical, and professional skills. Overall, this project aims to
understand the central nucleus of the amygdala’s role as a nexus point between reward seeking and reward
consumption. This would not only deepen our understanding of this nucleus’s role as a whole, but could
potentially contribute to novel therapeutic behavioral and medical interventions."
10817028,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Land plants like flowering plants and liverworts produce an array of natural products with various
biological functions. Polyketide meroterpenoids, comprising structures partially derived from terpenoid
biosynthetic pathways and partially derived from polyketide synthase biosynthetic pathways, have attracted
scientists for decades from their unique and diverse biological activity. Neuroactive plant meroterpenoids, like
phytocannabinoids from Cannabis sativa, represent a particularly exciting suite of compounds with therapeutic
promise due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and engage GPCR targets. However, much of the
pharmacological data present in the literature to-date has focused on the cannabinoids, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), while minor constituents and unique analogs from other producers remain less
well studied. Lack of pharmacological data for these compounds is partly due to low accumulation of more rare
plant meroterpenoids in native producers, production in less widespread plants (i.e. specific liverwort species),
and lack of convergent synthetic routes capable of producing several analogs from one common intermediate.
Heterologous production of plant meroterpenoids has been accomplished in eukaryotic hosts (i.e. yeast) but
suffers from a pathway bottleneck caused by low catalytic activity and poor expression of plant prenyl cyclization
enzymes (e.g. THCA synthase). Bacterially derived cyclization enzymes that generate the same key
intermediate, an ortho-quinone methide, provide an attractive alternative for biocatalyst generation toward
production of plant-like meroterpenoids and their analogs. Here, I propose the development of new cyclization
biocatalysts engineered from bacterial biosynthetic enzymes for chemoenzymatic production of rare and
designer plant-like meroterpenoid products and their pharmacological evaluation to assess therapeutic promise.
 This proposal aims to address issues of supply present for rare meroterpenoids with low accumulation in
native producers, generate novel, structurally diverse scaffolds using engineered biocatalysts, and test the
pharmacology (i.e. therapeutic promise) of such compounds. In Aim 1, I will engineer biosynthetic pathway
enzymes recently identified from the Moore lab, Clz9 and Tcz9, to chemoenzymatically produce meroterpenoids
with alternative regioselectivity and steric modification. While neuroactive meroterpenoids are predominantly
produced by flowering land plants, other species, like liverworts or marine bacteria, produce similar-looking
natural products. In Aim 2, I will identify new prenyl cyclase enzymes from marine bacteria and liverwort sources,
expanding the toolkit of biocatalysts for producing plant-like meroterpenoids, especially compounds with unique
stereochemistry and larger steric modifications. In Aim 3, produced compounds will be subjected to pre-
pharmacokinetics experiments to determine likely metabolic products, and both compounds and their metabolic
products will be assessed for ability to activate GPCR targets from the human brain. This research proposal will
produce rare and designer plant meroterpenoids using biocatalysts from bacterial hosts and identify which of the
produced analogs possess noteworthy therapeutic potential."
10906786,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Brain tumors result in a disproportionate rate of cancer morbidity and mortality. Standard of care treatment
includes maximal safe surgical resection, with extent of surgical resection (EOR) representing the most relevant
prognostic factor for patient survival. Because EOR is dependent on the surgeon’s capability to distinguish
between healthy brain tissue and tumor-invaded tissue in or adjacent to brain areas that support cognitive
function, the neurosurgeon must balance clinical objectives against causing cognitive impairments. The ground
truth standard-of-care procedure to facilitate this distinction is awake craniotomy with brain mapping using direct
electrical stimulation mapping (DES). Knowing the location of specific functions with respect to real-time surgical
targets allows the clinical team to protect those functions. It is also standard of care for pre-operative behavioral
data and brain scans to be collected on all brain tumor patients. However, there is no evidenced-based platform
that allows clinical teams to choose the most sensitive task to map and measure a given brain region, or to
understand the implications for future cognitive function of removing a specific volume of brain tissue. To fill this
gap, MindTrace Technologies, Inc. is developing a cloud-based software platform to be used before, during, and
after a neurosurgical procedure to improve the process of evaluating and choosing an optimal treatment plan.
The MindTrace platform supports the administration of functional brain mapping protocols (functional
neuroimaging, DES mapping), and the pre-processing and co-registration of behavioral and neural data in the
service of optimizing the effectiveness of brain mapping during awake brain surgery. The overall goal of this
Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal is to further improve the advanced prototype MindTrace software platform and
deploy it under IRB in the context of a research study to collect prospective longitudinal data at 4 major medical
centers. Completion of these Aims will result in a commercializable product and lay the empirical and
technological foundation for the development of real-time AI-based predictive analytics, a large-scale clinical
trial, and FDA clearance. The design of the protocol proposed herein is based on written feedback from FDA
(qSub meeting) regarding the parameters of a dataset needed for successfully apply for Breakthrough Device
Designation. The dataset to be generated by this prospective study will be the empirical basis for follow on
technology development in AI/ML predictive analytics.
MindTrace is the only company to integrate correlational data (behavior, functional MRI) with the causal evidence
generated during awake brain surgery, and the comparison of post-operative neuropsychological performance
to preoperative neuropsychological performance. Commercialization of the platform deployed within the current
proposal represents a turn-key software product that integrates multiple sources of information to enable
clinicians to plan neurosurgery more effectively in support of the best postoperative quality-of-life."
10907579,"Project 1 Summary
Cognitively intact centenarians as extreme outliers are likely to be an informative cohort for
discovering behavioral, environmental, and/or biological mechanisms of resistance and resilience
to AD and related dementias. Aims 1-3 of this RADCO Project 1 titled, The Cognitive Resilience
and Resistance Phenotypes Project, are 3 different approaches to gauging cognitive resilience
amongst a sample of almost 500 centenarian cognitive super agers, 600 offspring with and
without cognitive impairment, and 120 spouse controls without parental longevity. With no
cognitive impairment, particularly at their extreme age, centenarian cognitive superagers are by
definition, cognitively resilient. In the absence of neuropathologic changes associated with AD,
they would be resistant to AD. Project 1 proposes the following 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1.
Cognitive Function-Neuroimaging Correlation. Gauge cognitive resilience in centenarian
cognitive superagers, assessing discordance between cognitive function measures and structural
and functional MRI correlates of cognitive impairment and AD. Specific Aim 2: Cognitive
Function–Biomarker Risk of AD Correlation. Gauge cognitive resilience in the RADCO sample
by assessing discordance between cognitive function measures and longitudinally assayed
biomarker indices of AD, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Specific Aim 3: Cognitive
Function-Neuropathology Correlation. Gauge cognitive and brain resilience and resistance to
AD and other neuropathologies in brain donors by assessing discordance between cognitive
function measures and neuropathological measures. The conduct of these aims will differentiate
participants according to resilience endophenotypes. These endophenotypes along with
associated biosample resources including plasma and brain tissues will be passed on for use by
Project 2 investigators for the discovery of protective factors and mechanisms associated with
resilience."
10909152,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the proposed project is to develop multiparametric mapping magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
techniques to assess the effect of stem cell therapy on Intervertebral Disc (IVD) degeneration, a major source
of chronic low back pain (LBP). LBP is a common cause of morbidity and disability, and the most common
cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work in the United States. If a patient with
LBP has several degenerate discs, further examination is required to determine which disc is the source of
pain, prior to a decision of medical treatment or surgical intervention. However, there are no diagnostic
methods in clinical use that help to differentiate between a pathologically painful and an aging disc. On the
other hand, there are no good surgical solutions for patients suffering from chronic LBP as they failed to show
long term pain relief compared to conservative treatment. A potential alternative approach to surgical
procedures is the use of injected stem cells as a potential treatment to regenerate the discs, which have shown
promising therapeutic effects in several recent studies. In this proposal, we hypothesize that a combination of
multiple MR parameters T1, T2, T1ρ, ADC, and qCEST can detect painful discs and quantitatively measure the
effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injection to degenerate discs on LBP better than any single MR
parameter. In Aim 1, we will develop a highly efficient and simultaneous multiparametric mapping approach for
T1, T2, T1ρ, ADC, and CEST quantification. The centerpiece of the technical development is our newly
developed Multitasking framework, published in Nature BME in 2018, which allows motion compensated,
highly efficient, simultaneous, multiparametric mapping using low rank tensor reconstruction, taking advantage
of the vast data redundancy among multiple time dimensions. We have applied the technique to quantitative
cardiovascular and body imaging with excellent results. In Aim 2, we will validate that multiparametric
mappings are better associated with molecular pain markers than any individual parameters alone and can
detect the therapeutic effect of MSC injection in a minipig model of disc degeneration. Successful completion
of this project has the potential to make major impact on the way we diagnose and treat chronic LBP.
Multiparametric quantification MRI will provide a reliable and noninvasive tool for LBP detection and guide
physicians which discs to treat. It could also be used to monitor the therapeutic effect of various stem cell
injections, or other disc-targeted therapies that are currently in development."

10841019,"Powerful clinical strategies exist for people at risk for or living with HIV, with unprecedented promise of positive
outcomes across the HIV care continuum. Yet, the HIV landscape is characterized by progress for some, but
continuing gaps for others. Thus, it is imperative to identify, understand, and address the multi-level factors that
impede adoption of HIV testing, prevention, and treatment strategies and, likely, use of a future HIV vaccine.
These drivers include individual-level, contextual, system-level and structural factors, and co-occurring
epidemics (e.g. racism, drug use and emerging infections, etc.). The Clinical Translation Core will advance the
behavioral and biomedical clinical science research necessary for implementation of biomedical strategies that
can “move the needle” on ending the global HIV epidemic. The Core will embrace a syndemic perspective that
addresses social determinants of health as well as an implementation science perspective that identifies and
addresses parameters for making innovations in real world practice. Its multidisciplinary faculty of HIV
biomedical, health behavior, mental health, implementation research, epidemiology and bioinformatics
researchers and their stakeholder partners uniquely equip the Core to catalyze and support research that bridges
gaps between biomedical discovery, adaptation, and sustained implementation in often resource-constrained
systems and underserved communities. In order to put forward the next generation of research leaders, two
Early Stage Investigators (one biomedical, one behavioral) will have active roles in Core leadership and function.
The Core has the following Specific Aims: (1) To promote application of behavioral science theory and formative
methods to the development and use of new biomedical strategies for HIV prevention and treatment; (2) To
stimulate development and evaluation of innovative, efficacious interventions that integrate biomedical strategies

10841023,"The Health Equity Core focuses on one of the greatest US and global public health challenges in the persisting
HIV epidemic – reducing inter-related inequities in (a) HIV prevention and care and (b) screening for treatment
of mental health (MH), including substance abuse. MH problems are among the most significant barriers to
achieving UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. Remarkable advances have transformed HIV prevention and treatment;
likewise, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) address a range of MH problems that are consistently associated
with poor health outcomes; for example, delayed HIV diagnosis, poor engagement, and retention in care, and
virologic failure. Nevertheless, disparities in accessing HIV services and MH services for HIV-affected
populations (HIV-MH services) – and in the associated HIV continuum outcomes – persist among minoritized

10840398,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The use of cannabis for recreation and medicinal purposes is disproportionately high among people living with
HIV (PLWH) and nearly half of cannabis using PLWH are estimated to be at risk for cannabis use disorder. Yet,
whether cannabis is therapeutic or detrimental on the central nervous system (CNS) of PLWH remains
controversial, highlighting the need for well-controlled studies generating reproducible data from specific
cannabinoids, brain regions, and CNS cell types. Our research has shown that cell-type specific epigenetic
patterns relate to HIV-associated cognitive impairment in PLWH, more frequent or recent cannabis use may
reduce myeloid inflammation and impact brain structure in PLWH, and our recent single cell studies of the CNS
in PLWH revealed distinct CSF microglia-like cells expressing CD204 in PLWH and ongoing HIV viral
transcription in cerebrospinal fluid cells despite ART. Prior research has shown neurogenic brain regions
including the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and hippocampus are of high relevance to persistent
HIV infection and cannabinoid exposures. However, critical gaps in understanding neurogenic brain regions at
single cell level in the setting of HIV and cannabinoid exposures remain. We are leveraging brain tissues from
an established oral dosing model of cannabidiol and THC in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of HIV,
application of new single cell technologies permitting the simultaneous profiling of gene expression and open
chromatin from the same cell (10X Genomics Multiome: RNA+ATAC) in brain tissues, a new single cell assay
capable of measuring multiple histone modifications, and pharmacological profiling of current ART regimens and
cannabinoid levels in brain tissues. Our central hypothesis is a therapeutic role of cannabinoids in ameliorating
HIV neuropathogenesis in the CNS by enhancing the proliferation and survival of neural progenitor cells and
immature neurons and reducing glial inflammation. To identify cell types, epigenetic cell states, and gene
pathways relevant to neuropathogenesis, viral persistence, and cannabinoid exposures, we are harnessing 180
brain tissue samples from an established oral administration of either cannabidiol (CBD) or Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in NHP and single cell assays (10X Genomics single nucleus multiome and a new
single cell assay developed at the NYGC capable of measuring the genome-wide presence of multiple histone
modifications and protein-DNA binding sites). Moreover, accompanying single cell data will be generated from
conserved neurogenic brain regions of human postmortem brain tissues from 40 donors based on HIV status
(+/-) and cannabis exposure (+/-). We will also explore the frequency of single cells in neurogenic regions of the
brain that are infected and impacted by cannabinoids by harnessing a bioinformatics pipeline that detects both
viral transcripts and transposase accessible provirus. This project will generate comprehensive single cell
datasets in NHP and humans to improve our understanding of the cross talk between HIV and cannabinoids in
neurogenic regions of the brain and has high programmatic priority to goals of the SCORCH program expansion."

10899754,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is the benign enlargement of the prostate gland that occurs in older men,
obstructing bladder outflow. The resultant lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urgency, frequency and
incomplete emptying, have considerable morbidity, and carry annual healthcare costs in the Billions. Current
BPH treatments are not very effective because the drugs target normal prostate physiology but not BPH
pathophysiology, which is still poorly understood. New disease-targeted therapies will require a more detailed
knowledge of BPH pathogenesis. In genomic studies of BPH clinical samples, we discovered a stromal gene
signature that correlated with BPH symptoms, and an enrichment of fibroblasts overexpressing signaling
proteins BMP5 and CXCL13. Fibroblast BMP5 enhanced prostate epithelial proliferation and drove gene
expression profiles to mimic BPH tissue. From these data, we hypothesize that BPH is driven (at least in part)
by pathogenic fibroblast cell subset(s), where defining those subsets will provide important new opportunities
for disease targeted therapies. Towards that goal, the proposed studies aim to Define the fibroblast subsets in
BPH versus normal prostate; Determine the key interactions between BPH fibroblast subsets and prostate
epithelium that drive prostate enlargement; and Distinguish between BPH origins in embryonic re-awakening
versus injury response. Study findings will provide new understanding of the contribution of prostate stroma to
BPH pathogenesis, and identify new strategies for targeted treatment."
10897119,"Dental health benefits of fluoride in drinking water have never been tested in a randomized controlled trial
(RCT). Instead, results from observational studies and a few non-randomized, community intervention studies
were sufficient to justify addition of fluoride to many public water systems during the 20th century and to defend
against fluoridation’s critics. However, growth in fluoridated public water systems has stalled, leaving 100
million Americans living in places that do not have fluoridated water and which probably never will. A related
problem is that, nationwide, 15% of children do not drink tap water for reasons ranging from consumer
preference to distrust of public water. One solution, capitalizing on consumers’ demand for bottled water, is to
increase consumption of fluoridated bottled water. However, RCT evidence of dental health benefits of
fluoridated bottled water will be essential if public health is to embrace it as a strategy to extend fluoridation. In
the absence of a precedent, and in the face of uncertainty as to compliance and likely effect size of the
intervention, a fully powered RCT is premature. We instead propose a phase II, proof-of-concept RCT to
evaluate dental caries preventive effects of fluoridated bottled water in a community not served by water
fluoridation. The primary recruitment population is ~470 babies born during a one-year period in Kinston, NC,
the state’s community with the largest non-fluoridated public water system where caries prevalence exceeds
the state average. In households where measured content of fluoride in tap water is <0.2 ppm, we will
randomize 200 infant/family dyads in a 1:1 ratio to receive either fluoridated or non-fluoridated bottled water.
The two types of commercially water in 5-gallon bottles will be relabeled to mask infants, families and
researchers as to the fluoride content. For 3½ years after randomization, each household will be provided with
water, dispensers and other supplies to encourage water consumption consistent with nutritional
recommendations. Bottled water consumption will be monitored and fingernail clippings collected to provide a
biomarker-measure of fluoride intake. A dental examination conducted when children are aged 48?3 months
will measure caries experience using the index of decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (dmfs). Statistical
analysis will compare mean dmfs between study-groups to generate effect size estimates and standard errors
needed to calculate sample size requirement for a future, multi-site, Phase III RCT. The investigative team has
a strong record of accomplishment in observational and interventional studies of dental caries in children, and
is experienced in work needed to plan (during the UG3 phase) and conduct (during the 5-year UH3 phase) the
study as required by PAR-18-547. Local, state and national stakeholders have expressed support for the
proposed study, noting its potential to improve oral health in underserved communities. By applying the rigor of
a placebo-controlled RCT design, the study will address a serious shortfall in the evidence that hampers the
nation’s primary public health strategy for dental caries prevention."

broad integrative scientific approach by investigating relevant chemicals; nutrient:chemical interactions; both
animal models and human subjects; and both sexes through state-of-the-art methods including multi-‘omics.
EDC/MDC exposures may also impact liver disease through their effects on obesity and diabetes. Thus, obesity
and diabetes endpoints will also be evaluated.
 While the specific projects are expected to evolve over time, the initial work focusses on exposures to
polychlorinated biphenyls and vinyl chloride. Both of these chemicals currently rank in the top five in the Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Substance Priority List. ELD-RIVER strictly adheres to the
principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility and data transparency and availability. ELD-RIVER leverages
existing collaborations between multiple organizations including academia, government agencies, industry, and
scientific/medical societies. The vision is for ELD-RIVER to become the global hub for environmental liver
disease research. To accomplish its translational mission, the program integrates the work of basic scientists,
epidemiologists, and physicians. The project will also develop diagnostic biomarkers, new treatments, practice
guidelines, and it has the potential to impact policy change. Along the way, unique institutional education/training
resources will be utilized so that ELD-RIVER will help produce the next generation of environmental health
scientists. The work proposed is relevant to Strategic Plan of the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (Themes 1, 2, and 5 and Goals 1, 4, 7, and 8)."
10912006,"1. Project Summary/Abstract
Osteoporosis is a health problem of major proportions. It affects more than 40 million Americans and results in
more than 2 million fractures annually among Medicare patients alone. Hospital admissions for osteoporotic
fractures exceed those of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer combined. Osteoporosis is commonly
considered a disease associated with menopause. This estrogen deficiency related bone loss is characterized
by high bone turnover with increased resorption without commensurate changes in bone formation. It is in
contrast to age-related bone loss, which starts as early as in the fourth decade of life and continues with
increasing age. Age-related bone loss is usually associated with lower bone turnover and decreased bone
formation is the main abnormality. Current therapies do not address age-related bone loss and the special needs
of the age-related osteoporosis population is currently ignored. This is to a great degree due to difficulties
associated with the bone biopsy necessary for determination of bone turnover status. Thus, the current standard
of care relies on starting with an antiresorber, which is less effective in age-related osteoporosis, and in fact
impedes the effectiveness in this population of the appropriate anabolic medication.
Our study seeks to achieve two specific aims: Aim 1) to establish a novel precision medicine approach to
treatment of age-related osteoporosis based on recognition of low bone turnover and initial treatment with
anabolics, and Aim 2) to find a non-invasive method for diagnosing low bone turnover in osteoporotic patients
by measurements of serum carboxylated osteocalcin (1-43/49) with validation via the “gold standard” bone
biopsy and histomorphometry.
Our approach will be to enroll female patients who have been diagnosed with osteoporosis in a prospective,
proof of concept study. Patients will undergo bone biopsy and blood draws at baseline. Bone turnover status will
be assessed employing histomorphometry. In addition, blood levels of carboxylated osteocalcin (1-43/49) will be
measured in order to determine their validity - alone or in combination with other bone markers - for diagnosing
low bone turnover prevailing in age-related bone loss.
Patients will be grouped according to turnover status. Low-turnover patients will be randomized (1:1) either to
treatment with the anabolic teriparatide (Group 1) or with the standard of care antiresorber alendronate (Group
2) for one year. In order to provide the necessary comparison group for the non-invasive assessment of turnover,
normal-high turnover patients (Group 3) will be treated with standard of care alendronate for one year. At baseline
and at one-year bone mineral density measurements will be performed by DXA and 1-year changes in BMD will
be compared between groups. Our central hypothesis is that low turnover, age-related osteoporosis needs to be
diagnosed and treated differently from estrogen deficiency related osteoporosis. The results will provide a
paradigm shift in the treatment of osteoporosis."
10922745,"HIV Treatment as Prevention (TASP) is critical to Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE). At-risk alcohol use and alcohol
used disorder (AUD) are barriers to TASP through direct impacts on the HIV Care Continuum (HIV-CC). The
impact of alcohol use on other comorbidities among persons with HIV (PWH) including liver disease,
cardiovascular disease (CVD), malignancy, cognition, and frailty is increasingly relevant as persons age with
HIV. The goals of ARCH are to implement evidence based alcohol interventions across the alcohol use spectrum
(from no use, low risk, at-risk, AUD, recovery (low risk use or no use) or remission (no use) and relapse); to
understand the contextual factors (i.e., social determinants of health [SDH] from the individual to community
level) impact on alcohol use spectrum, the alcohol care continuum (Alc-CC), HIV –CC, and comorbidities; and
to determine the optimal alcohol targets (abstinence, reduction in WHO risk score) and use different sources of
alcohol measures to maximize information for determining alcohol status. The goal of the ARCH Biostatistics
and Methods Core (ARCH-BMC) is to ensure that high quality contemporary research is carried out in terms of
formulating research questions, study design, and analyses of the projects included within this P01. The ARCH-
BMC will provide expertise and leadership in epidemiology and biostatistics in the quantitative support of the
consortium. As has been done in prior years of ARCH, our group we will increase the depth to which research
questions are pursued, resulting in increased quantity, quality, and effectiveness of the consortium research
objectives, including the overall goals of the P01 (implementation science of alcohol interventions, impact of
social determinants of health, and measures of alcohol). To accomplish this goal, we propose activities for both
project support and methodological development. The specific aims of ARCH BMC are: 1) To provide wide-
ranging, high-quality epidemiological and statistical support to ARCH, 2) To provide leadership in developing
new statistical and epidemiological methods that address deficiencies in causal methods relevant to the novel
research aims of the consortium, and 3) To integrate supplemental data sources and assessment of novel
methodologies across the alcohol care continuum. ARCH-BMC adds value by contributing quantitative and
epidemiological perspectives to the ARCH P01 scientific agenda and simultaneously operationalizing the science
with appropriate study designs, data management, and analytical methodology. Successful research is
accomplished by creating comprehensive partnerships that provide expertise throughout the entire research
process, from the beginning with the conceptualization of the research question through all steps to publication.
Innovation and improved research insights are obtained when collaborations integrate novel and improved
methodology, uncovering further methodological challenges and motivating new areas for research. By
supporting the research projects and working collaboratively with the transdisciplinary ARCH team, ARCH-BMC
will increase the likelihood of success of ARCH in achieving its overall project goals."
10922750,"Unhealthy alcohol use is prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and associated with poor outcomes
including less engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (HIV-CC) and increased age-related comorbidities.
Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV–Epidemiology Research Arm (ARCH-ERA) was formed to investigate
short and long-term effects of alcohol on outcomes among PWH in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical
Systems (CNICS). CNICS is an 8-site network that is a large, geographically and racially diverse, gender
representative cohort of >37,000 PWH in care. Careful outcomes adjudication, a large diverse population, and
systematic longitudinal assessments of patient reported alcohol use, drug use, mental health symptoms,
adherence, and context-based factors such as housing status, stigma, and social support enables a rigorous
approach to key questions on HIV and alcohol that are highly responsive to NIH HIV priorities and RFA-AA-20-
009. Our rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the remarkable agility of CNICS to adapt to
changes in health care and research priorities as they emerge. We have previously described the high
prevalence of unhealthy alcohol use among PWH, and its detrimental effects on outcomes including HIV-CC
steps. We build on that work focusing on the HIV-CC in the current era of a pandemic and expanding
telehealth; expanding focus to including the Alcohol Care Continuum (Alc-CC) as well as additional patterns of
alcohol use; adding age-related outcomes such as heart failure that are becoming increasingly important in the
aging population of PWH; and incorporating emerging outcomes such as due to COVID-19-related illness.
 Capitalizing on the resources and infrastructure of CNICS, we propose the following aims: 1. Obtain, expand,
improve, and validate high quality alcohol and social determinants of health data including expanding CNICS
PROs to better capture alcohol use patterns and adding U.S. Census data to better capture socioeconomic
context; 2. Examine longitudinal relationships of alcohol use, drug use, and mental health disorders on the
HIV-CC and Alc-CC including impacts of the pandemic and key social determinants of health such as among
sometimes hidden or marginalized groups of PWH. 3. Determine clinical outcomes among PWH with unhealthy
alcohol use including age-related comorbidities and COVID-19 related illness, and the role of alcohol use
patterns and social determinants of health on these and other long-term outcomes.
 ARCH-ERA will capitalize on and expand CNICS’s comprehensive clinical data to address novel research
questions on the impact of alcohol use among PWH including generating new knowledge on the intersection of
HIV and alcohol to inform future research and clinical care. ARCH-ERA will enhance the overall ARCH
consortium by providing new and expanded data types, informing alcohol interventions, and leveraging results
from this rich cohort to provide data and address important questions focusing on the impact of alcohol use
patterns on current care and health outcomes of PWH within the modern pandemic context."
10922755,"Despite availability of evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions (EBI), unhealthy alcohol use remains a
barrier to HIV medication adherence, viral suppression and retention in HIV care and consequently HIV
treatment as prevention (TASP). As such, optimizing translation of alcohol EBIs into clinical HIV clinical
practice is an important aspect of U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic initiatives. Guided by complementary
implementation and evaluation frameworks–the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)
and RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance), we will conduct a Hybrid
Type 3 effectiveness-implementation evaluating implementation outcomes as primary and effectiveness
outcomes as secondary. We will specifically test whether practice facilitation, an evidence-based multifaceted
implementation strategy, increases reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of stepped care for
unhealthy alcohol use (our clinical intervention) in three Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of
Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) HIV clinics located in Boston, San Diego, and Chapel Hill. We will
secondarily test whether practice facilitation is associated with decreased unhealthy alcohol use, and improved
ART adherence and viral suppression at the patient level. In practice facilitation, a practice coach will offer
tools, resources, hands-on guidance, and content expertise to assist sites in offering a stepped care model of
alcohol treatment to patients with unhealthy alcohol use. Stepped care will include brief intervention, cognitive
behavioral therapy, and alcohol pharmacotherapy. To align with patient and provider preferences, flexible
modes of intervention delivery (in-person, telemedicine, and computer-delivered) will be available. The practice
facilitation intervention will be rolled out sequentially across sites, allowing prior experiences to inform future
implementation. There will be three phases at each site: pre-implementation planning, implementation with
formative evaluation, and post-implementation summative evaluation. Using mixed methods, we specifically
propose to meet the following specific aims: (Aim 1) Tailor the practice facilitation intervention to each site
using mixed methods (pre-implementation); (Aim 2a) Determine the effect of practice facilitation on reach,
adoption, and maintenance of evidence-based alcohol treatment using mixed methods (formative
evaluation); (Aim 2b) Determine the effects of practice facilitation on implementation of stepped care (primary)
and alcohol use and HIV-related outcomes (secondary) using interrupted time series analysis with synthetic
controls (summative evaluation) and (Aim 3) Describe barriers and facilitators to implementation of alcohol-
related interventions at each site to describe maintenance and inform widespread sustainable
implementation. Our study capitalizes on our strong transdisciplinary team and is well aligned with OAR
priorities of addressing TASP barriers, HIV related comorbidities, and advancing cross-cutting research in
implementation science."
10922761,"At risk alcohol use and alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and
cause well-documented harms across the HIV prevention and care continuum. A number of effective person
and computer delivered alcohol treatments exist for PWH; however, to date they have largely focused on at-
risk alcohol use and do not address the sizeable population of PWH with AUD who are at risk of relapse.
Indeed, in the general population, approximately 50-75% of people who stop drinking alcohol relapse within
one year, indicating that relapse is a significant part of the alcohol use spectrum. Relapse prevention
interventions (RPI) potentially extend the alcohol care continuum by building skills to reduce frequency and
intensity of relapse episodes, maintain treatment engagement, and motivate renewed efforts toward drinking
reduction. Thus, there is a high clinical need to investigate RPI effectiveness to maintain drinking reductions in
PWH and, if effective, to integrate RPI into HIV-CC.
 We propose a 3-arm type 1 pilot implementation-efficacy trial for PWH with AUD to examine the
feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an adapted 2-session, computerized and person delivered relapse
prevention intervention. Our proposed pilot is a NIH Stage 1 Model for behavioral intervention development
that defines Stage 1A as intervention adaptation and refinement for new patient groups and settings, and
Stage 1B as intervention piloting to test preliminary effectiveness and feasibility/acceptability. Our project has
three phases. First, we will adapt a relapse prevention intervention for PWH, train the interventionist for
person-delivered administration, and use authoring software to develop the computerized administration.
Second, we will recruit and randomize 150 patients who have an AUD diagnosis and who are at risk for alcohol
relapse from a large, urban HIV clinic. The three study conditions are computer delivered RPI, person
delivered RPI or treatment as usual. Alcohol and HIV outcomes will be assessment for one-year. Third, we will
use the RE-AIM implementation framework to evaluate study participants, and clinical and organizational staff
with mixed methods to assess barriers and facilitators to RPI integration in the HIV clinical setting. To our
knowledge this is the first avatar delivered, evidence-driven intervention developed for alcohol relapse
prevention in HIV patients. For long-term success in Ending the HIV Epidemic, it is critical that the alcohol
treatment field expand types of clinical services and availability/ease of access within the HIV care continuum.
In the future, this will enable a personalized medicine approach to care that more precisely and intensively
targets those patients at highest risk of relapse, and thereby optimizes health and quality of life for PWH with
AUD."
10929963,"Project 2 - Summary
Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia: Understanding, Predictive Modeling and Developing Photon and
 Proton-Based Mitigation Strategies
There is accumulating evidence across many types of cancers that radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is
common, but it is often ignored as an unavoidable side effect. Severe RIL has been shown to correlate with
poor disease-specific outcomes. Extensive use of radiotherapy (RT) in the curative management of solid
tumors necessitates the development of RIL-mitigation strategies. We have compelling evidence of significant
differences in the lymphocyte-sparing effects of proton therapy (PT) vs. photon (or x-ray) therapy (XRT),
presumably attributable to the differences in their dose distribution patterns. Our work has further
demonstrated that both patient-specific and dosimetric factors contribute to the risk of severe RIL and T-cell
clonality. Our hypotheses are as follows: (1) RIL predictive models that account for individual patient
susceptibilities and dosimetric factors will have clinically significant predictive power; (2) reducing dose to
circulating immune cells and immune structures at risk preserves not only the quantity but, more importantly,
the quality of lymphocytes, which has a direct positive impact on cancer immunity and disease outcomes; (3)
through the utilization of intensity-modulated proton and photon RT (IMPT and IMRT), employing individualized
dosimetric constraints derived from the models, we will be able to select the optimum treatment modality
(protons or photons) and develop patient-specific strategies to substantially mitigate RIL and its consequences.
To test these hypotheses, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize our large databases of
mainly esophagus, liver and brain cancer patients to improve our understanding of lymphocyte depletion as a
function of dosimetric and patient-specific baseline clinical factors and develop models to accurately predict
individualized severe RIL risk. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the clinical impact of the radiation treatment modality
on T-cell diversity, immune repertoire, and functional immune status. We will test the hypothesis that the
quality of lymphocytes as measured by immune phenotyping, T-cell diversity, and functional immunity after RT
is a major driver of clinical outcomes rather than just the absolute lymphocyte count. In Aim 3, we will assess
the validity of our models using independent retrospective and prospective data. We will also apply the models
to select the optimum treatment modality and technique for a given patient and define the personalized
dosimetric constraints to be used to optimize proton and photon radiation dose distribution patterns to minimize
RIL severity and risk. Upon the completion of this project, we will have a better understanding of how the
baseline clinical characteristics and proton and photon dosimetric factors impact RIL risk and severity, T-cell
diversity, and functional immunity. Moreover, we will have developed advanced proton and photon dosimetric
strategies to reduce RIL risk. Our research has the potential to better select the optimum modality for each
patient, to optimize IMPT and IMRT treatments to maximally mitigate lymphopenia to improve RT outcomes,
and to optimally integrate RT with immunotherapy strategies in the future."
10929968,"Project 3 - SUMMARY
While proton beam therapy (PBT) has superior physical characteristics compared to standard photon
radiation, its biological properties have been thought to be similar to photons. This is reflected in the use of a
generic relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 to scale the physical dose delivered for both cancer
and normal tissues. However, pre-clinical data from our groups and others are emerging to indicate that the
RBE of PBT varies and may be dependent on intrinsic tumor cell biology. Such RBE variations are likely
genomically defined and exist across individual tumors of a given cancer type. This is a vastly understudied
area with potential for substantial clinical impact as we are advancing our ability to genomically profile
cancers to identify candidate predictive biomarkers. Thus, our overall objective is to establish distinct
biological properties of PBT relative to photon radiation and determine if these differential properties result in
variable RBE values across genomically diverse tumors. By combining synergistic MGH and MDACC
expertise, we will integrate advanced physical computation techniques with novel biological tools, such as
nucleosome-resolution genomic mapping of DNA double-strand breaks, to study the hypothesized unique
biological damage produced by protons. We will conduct the following Specific Aims: (1) Simulate DNA
damage induction and repair for proton vs photon irradiation; (2) Experimentally elucidate targetable
differences in the induction and removal of DNA breaks following proton vs photon irradiation; (3) Identify
candidate genomic biomarkers that predict increased proton RBE in annotated cancer cell lines; (4) Validate
biomarker-correlated proton sensitivity in clinically relevant tumor models and in patients. These studies will
leverage extensive pre-clinical tumor model collections as well as clinical trial specimens at both institutions.
The knowledge gained will quickly influence the treatment of cancer patients through the introduction of
novel clinical trials with stratification based on genomic biomarkers that predict sensitivity to PBT."

10925246,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite its overall decreasing occurrence, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the fourth most common cause
of cancer deaths in the US. Unfortunately, epidemiological studies demonstrate an alarming increase in inci-
dence in populations below the age of 50, who are not routinely screened. Furthermore, CRC detection is difficult
in high-risk groups, including those with a genetic predisposition (e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis), disease
traits (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease), or from certain demographics (e.g. Black-Americans). Thus, there is a
significant need for the development of innovative solutions for the early detection of CRC and the prevention of
the transition from adenoma to CRC. To address this need, our interdisciplinary research team will develop
genetically engineered bacteria using synthetic biology approaches to identify early CRC development, monitor
and report changes in the adenoma and CRC microenvironment, and prevent cancer progression. To achieve
the above objectives, engineered bacteria have to engraft and colonize the hostile luminal environment, sense
and distinguish an abnormal environmental signal, compute this signal, and express a reporter or a therapeutic
agent. However, appropriate vectors with these features remain lacking, constraining synthetic biology applica-
tions for cancer research. Importantly, CRC is highly associated with E. coli, for which we have many synthetic
biology tools. Furthermore, our preliminary proof-of-concept studies have revealed that native E. coli can be
engineered to perpetually colonize fully conventional (i.e. non-microbiome depleted) hosts and to execute func-
tions of interest, e.g., deconjugation of luminal bile acids. Deconjugated bile acid and resultant farnesoid X re-
ceptor (FXR) agonism can suppress CRC development, indicating a potential therapeutic use of engineered
native bacteria. Building on our strong supportive preliminary results, we will identify native E. coli from healthy,
adenoma, and CRC tissues of a genetic model of CRC and engineer them to detect and treat CRC in response
to the cancer microenvironment. Furthermore, we will characterize the effects of different tumor environment
factors on the colonization and performances of engineered native E. coli in the colon organoid model in an
organ-on-chip with the support of mathematical modeling, thereby identifying specific CRC signals for program-
ming the responses of engineered native E. coli as CRC reporters and therapeutics. Finally, we will engineer
native bacteria to detect and attenuate the progression of CRC by quantitatively reporting the level of CRC-
related cysteine proteases and selectively inhibiting their activity. The research described in this proposal will
generate new, much-needed synthetic biology vectors that can be developed as biosensors and therapeutics of
adenoma and CRC, as well as many other diseases. Furthermore, this project will enrich our fundamental
knowledge about the CRC-microbiome relationship and elucidate the roles of cysteine proteases in CRC pro-
gression and treatment."
10932381,"Abstract
In the United States alone, more than three million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are placed
each year to provide IV therapies, where in about half of cases navigation through the venous system is
typically performed blind, or without navigation guidance. Improper PICC placement is relatively common, is
costly, and has serious complications for critically-ill patients. Unfortunately, under blind placement 30-55% of
PICC tips are not optimally placed on the first attempt and require repositioning, which has an average direct
cost of $223 per patient and often necessitates the removal and reinsertion of the catheter line that carries a
4-6% risk of pneumothorax. Moreover, approximately 17% of these improperly positioned PICCs are placed
into the right atrium, which is associated with a multitude of life-threatening complications. Improper placement
of PICCs also often requires referral to an interventional radiologist for fluoroscopic-guided central line
placement, which is expensive ($1,000) and requires more radiation exposure for the patient. Not surprisingly,
over half of all PICCs are administered to patients over the age of 60. Therefore, safe and accurate PICC
placement is critical for providing high-quality care to older Americans. Despite serious adverse events
associated with blind placement of PICC lines, current vascular access systems have not been widely adopted.
The Teleflex ARROW® G4 VPS and the Bard Sherlock 3CG® TCS are PICC guidance systems that employ
ECG for positioning the PICC tip into the correct location: the region that includes the lower superior vena cava
(SVC) and cavoatrial junction (CAJ). While these procedures often limit the need for a confirmatory X-ray, they
have poor and variable successful placement rates (44-84%), are 30-70% more expensive than standard
PICCs, require skilled staff, and have significantly longer procedure times as compared to standard, blind PICC
placement. Additionally, these guidance systems rely solely on the use of ECG, which is ineffective for patients
with cardiac arrhythmias, a condition that affects approximately 16% of all patients requiring a PICC line. To
address the need for accurate, safe, and cost-effective PICC placement, Piccolo Medical has developed the
Smart PICC™ system, a point-of-care catheter system that uses unique hemodynamic signatures of different
vascular regions in combination with ECG for real-time vascular access guidance into the SVC/CAJ. The goal
of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) is to support the commercialization of a cost competitive
Smart PICC™ system in the vascular access marketplace. First, we will design a Gen 2 Smart PICC™
system with improved usability and performance, and reduced cost of goods sold (COGS) to enable
commercial launch (Aim 1). Second, we will submit a 510(k) to the FDA for the Smart PICC™ Gen 2 system
(Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims will allow us to commercialize this refined system within ~2.5
years of the funding of this proposal."

10699996,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Acne is one of the most common diseases worldwide, affecting 85% of adolescents and often persisting
into adulthood. Acne is responsible for a greater global burden of disease than psoriasis, cellulitis, and
melanoma. Although mild acne can usually be managed with topical medications, moderate to severe acne
often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, spironolactone, and isotretinoin.
While these medications are a standard part of care, there are very few randomized clinical trials showing
efficacy and none that show comparative effectiveness between these commonly used treatment options. The
Institute of Medicine has identified this area as one of the top priorities for comparative effectiveness research.
In addition, little is known about the effects of these different treatments on the microbiome.
 Previous work by our group has shown oral antibiotics are the most common systemic medication used in
the treatment of acne and patients frequently use them for more than one year. In fact, dermatologists
prescribe more antibiotics per capita than any other specialty. However, prolonged antibiotic use may be
associated with a variety of adverse outcomes including bacterial antibiotic resistance, pharyngitis, collagen
vascular illnesses, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast and colon cancer. As a result, there is growing
international interest and attention specifically from the Centers for Disease Control regarding improving
antibiotic stewardship in the outpatient setting and multiple clinical guidelines for acne have recommended
reducing the use of antibiotics through the use of non-antimicrobial therapies and by limiting the duration of
therapy.
 For women with moderate to severe acne, spironolactone may represent an effective, well-tolerated
therapeutic alternative to oral antibiotics. Originally developed as a potassium-sparing diuretic, for many years
it has also been used off-label for acne due to its potential impact on hormonal pathogenesis of this disease.
However, despite expert opinion supporting the use of spironolactone in the treatment of acne, its use remains
relatively uncommon and clinical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of spironolactone is limited to
small, often retrospective studies. Trials comparing the effectiveness of spironolactone to that of other
medications such as oral antibiotics are lacking.
 In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled non-inferiority comparative
effectiveness study of spironolactone versus doxycycline for women with acne. Since oral tetracycline-class
antibiotics like doxycycline are currently the most common systemic medication prescribed for acne, the results
of this trial will have substantial implications for the treatment of acne. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the
impact of spironolactone versus doxycycline treatment on the microbiome, which will provide valuable insights
regarding the relative effects of antibiotic (doxycycline) versus non-antibiotic (spironolactone) acne treatments
on the microbiome. This trial will significantly influence healthcare practice with respect to the treatment of
moderate to severe acne in women and inform policy regarding more appropriate use of antibiotics throughout
medicine."
10954305,"Project Summary
Since the early days of the epidemic, psychoneuroimmunology research established that there is a bi-
directional relationship between depression and HIV pathogenesis. Among people with HIV (PWH), substantial
damage to the gastrointestinal tract occurs during acute HIV infection, which is partially responsible for
dysregulation of the gut microbiome (i.e., dysbiosis) and translocation of inflammatory microbial products into
the periphery. Even among those receiving effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART), these pathophysiologic
alterations in the gut drive persistent immune dysregulation that partially explains amplified risk for depression
and other neuropsychiatric disorders in PWH. An important gap is that no prior clinical research in PWH
receiving effective ART has examined the functional connections between the microbiome, gastrointestinal
tract, immune system, and the brain – the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis. Treatment Research Investigating
Depression Effects on Neuroimmune Targets (TRIDENT) is a randomized controlled trial that leverages an
evidence-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Adherence and Depression (CBT-AD) treatment as an
experimental probe to advance our understanding of how decreasing depression alters MGB axis pathways in
PWH. TRIDENT will enroll 120 depressed PWH taking an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based
ART regimen who have an undetectable viral load. TRIDENT will have a brief run-in period (i.e., waiting period
prior to randomization) where potentially eligible participants will be asked to complete a baseline psychosocial
assessment, provide biospecimens, and attend a separate baseline fMRI assessment. A total of 120
participants who complete the run-in period will be randomized to receive either: 1) CBT-AD (n = 60); or
2) a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n = 60). Immediately following randomization, CBT-AD participants will
receive up to 12 individual sessions over 4 months. WLC participants will have the opportunity to receive the
CBT-AD treatment after a 6-month delay. During the intent-to-treat period, follow-up assessments at 2 months
and 4 months (i.e., during and immediately following the delivery of CBT-AD) will characterize changes in the
microbiome, soluble immune markers relevant to HIV pathogenesis, and leukocyte signaling to measure the
conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). These will be examined as plausible mediators of
CBT-AD related improvements in the primary outcome – resting state activation and connectivity of the
negative valence system at 6 months (assessed via fMRI). Six months after randomization, WLC participants
will crossover and have the opportunity to receive CBT-AD, and all participants (both CBT-AD and WLC) will
complete a final follow-up assessment at 10 months. TRIDENT will have an exceptional impact by providing an
experimental model to advance our understanding of how decreasing depression changes the MGB axis in
PWH. TRIDENT will include multi-level, high dimensional data on the MGB axis to catalyze a new generation
of pharmacologic and behavioral treatments for depression and its neurobehavioral substrates in PWH."

Polytobacco use, defined as concurrent use of more than one tobacco product including electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS), is rising and high in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) young adults (YA).
Between 22-40% of LGBT YA (vs 12-21% of non-LGBT YA) report past 30-day polytobacco use, and LGBT YA
are less likely to perceive tobacco use as harmful. Low risk perceptions may reinforce tobacco use and widen
existing disparities. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is mandated
educate the public about tobacco product risks, yet no evidence describes how to effectively frame anti-
polytobacco risk communications. The proposed training objectives are for the applicant to develop advanced
skills in health communication science; bio-behavioral methods, including psychophysiological measurement;
and randomized controlled trials. These skills will be used to determine effective communication of polytobacco
use risks to at-risk LGBT YA. This proposal directly supports the FDA’s mandate to educate the public by
addressing the research priority area of Communications. While studies indicate that antitobacco
communications can successfully increase public knowledge about tobacco use risks, there are limitations to the
extant literature, as follows: (1) While strategies for effective risk communication are well-established, less is
known about how to frame behavioral choices (e.g., total tobacco cessation vs switching to ENDS) to increase
tobacco risk perceptions and intentions to quit in polytobacco users. (2) Antitobacco campaigns often leverage
cultural targeting, a broadly supported but costly communications strategy, to increase at-risk population
engagement. No studies have experimentally tested the effectiveness of LGBT culturally targeted vs non-
targeted anti-tobacco messages. (3) Mobile multimedia messaging has been used to disseminate smoking
cessation communications and may be feasible for distributing anti-polytobacco messages to LGBT YA, but this
has not been investigated. Using formative and summative evaluation, the applicant will address these gaps with
three Specific Aims: (1) Identify absolute and relative risk anti-polytobacco messages that effectively
communicate polytobacco risks to YA; (2) Determine the effects of cultural targeting on LGBT YA polytobacco
users’ attention to anti-polytobacco messages and perceived effectiveness; (3b) Assess the feasibility of
delivering MMS anti-polytobacco messages developed in Aims 1 and 2 to LGBT YA via texting; and (3b) Estimate
effect sizes of exposure to anti-polytobacco messages on risk perceptions and tobacco use over time. These
aims support the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) tobacco control research priority to reduce tobacco disparities
by determining effective antitobacco message framing and cultural targeting to increase polytobacco risk
perceptions and reduce tobacco use in an at-risk population, LGBT YA. Findings will provide public health
officials, NCI, and the FDA CTP critical information about messages and digital media that may be leveraged in
national health communications to reduce poly-tobacco use in at-risk populations."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge, and it has been
estimated that its effects on healthcare, work productivity, and criminal justice costs the US over
$600 billion annually. Engagement with the clinical care team is critical to an individual’s path to
SUD recovery; however, limited capacity of and access to addiction treatment providers and
trained staff presents an even greater challenge when faced with an increasing demand for
care. Our proposed innovation, Suzy, is a novel and intelligent chatbot designed to provide
usable, engaging, on-demand follow-up support for individuals in long-term SUD recovery
guided by their clinical care team. In this Phase II work, we will evaluate effectiveness and
implementation of Suzy with primary care patients working closely with recovery coaches who
play a critical role in following up with and engaging patients in care. We will use a mixed
methods approach to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of Suzy following three specific
aims: In Aim 1, we will follow a human-centered design approach to build a fully functional
enhanced HIPAA-compliant chatbot. In Aim 2, we will conduct a single-group mixed methods
interventional study (Study 1) with patients to evaluate Suzy’s effectiveness and
implementation. In this aim, primary care patients will be enrolled with Suzy and complete
baseline, weekly, and endline assessments over the course of a 12-week intervention period. A
purposive sample of patients and their recovery coaches will participate in qualitative interviews
to collect perspectives on Suzy user experience and patient care. In Aim 3, we will assess
sustainability and conduct cost analyses (Study 2) for the system. Results of this Phase II
project will inform further development and adoption of a cost-effective, scalable solution built on
a community-based model of care to support continuing care for individuals beyond SUD
treatment and in pursuit of long-term health and wellbeing."
10695329,"The suicide rate among active duty service members and veterans increased substantially following the
onset of post-9/11 conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan1. Accordingly, veteran suicide prevention has been
identified as a national healthcare and research priority2. Psychosocial interventions for suicide risk vary
substantially in dose and resource allocation. A single therapy session designed to evaluate risk factors and
provide support resources (e.g., Enhanced Crisis Response Plans [ECRP]3) has been shown to reduce risk for
future suicide attempts. Other interventions consisting of 10-12 outpatient sessions following inpatient
discharge (e.g., Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for suicide prevention [BCBT]4) have been shown to
reduce suicide attempts by 50-60% relative to treatment as usual. Although both forms of intervention have
been shown to reduce risk, interventions that vary in dose and resource allocation have yet to be directly
compared, leaving two critical gaps in our ability to intervene most effectively. First, the assumption that more
time- and resource-intensive 10-12 session interventions translate to greater suicide risk reduction has yet to
be demonstrated. Second, it may be that less resource intensive interventions are adequate for some
individuals whereas others require more intensive care. To date, there is no evidence to guide what
interventions are indicated for specific clinical presentations.
 Pharmacological and brain stimulation interventions for suicide risk are extremely limited. This is due, in
part, to an incomplete understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of suicide risk. Although numerous
studies have examined cross-sectional neuroimaging correlates of current suicide ideation or compared
individuals with and without history of a suicide attempt, to date no studies have examined a) neurobiological
predictors of future suicide attempts in high-risk samples, b) how changes in neurobiological markers over time
relate to changes in suicide risk, or c) theoretically and mechanistically relevant neuroimaging procedures in a
prospective design. Cross-sectional research examining neuroimaging markers of past or current self-injurious
thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) has identified dysfunction in regions associated with emotion regulation,
inhibitory control, and decision-making5,6, namely in cognitive control networks (CCN). On the other hand,
dysfunction has also been observed in regions associated with negative affect and rumination such as limbic
(LN) and default mode (DMN) networks. Despite these cross-sectional findings, identification of neuroimaging
predictors of future suicide attempts, and neural markers of successful suicide risk intervention outcomes
represents a completely novel, critical step to guiding optimal targeting of neurobiologically-informed
interventions and translating neuroimaging of suicide into practice. Whether these potential neuroimaging
predictors are identifiable during resting state, or whether more suicide-relevant cognitive tasks are required,
such as death-related bias or inhibitory control, remains an open yet critical question.
 The purpose of our proposed study is to compare two evidence-based suicide risk interventions that
vary in dose in order to a) directly test if a more intensive intervention produces greater risk reduction, b)
identify veterans for whom a more intensive intervention is indicated, and c) identify resting-state and task-
based neurobiological markers of future suicide attempts and examine how changes in these markers relate to
changes in suicide risk over time. We will recruit and evenly randomize 136 male and female veterans
hospitalized for suicide risk to ECRP or BCBT. We will collect neuroimaging data immediately upon discharge,
post-treatment, and 12-months post-discharge and assess SITBs out to 12-months post-discharge."
10695330,"Sexual minority Veterans (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) are one of the highest risk populations for psychiatric
disorders due in part to the experience of discrimination and stigma-based stressors (sexual minority
stressors). These stressors and the associated stress responses contribute to greater severity of depression
and anxiety, which confer risk for negative health outcomes (hazardous substance use and suicide). However,
very few interventions target distress related to sexual minority stressors, and even fewer have been tested in
Veteran Health Administration (VHA). Brief, easy to implement interventions that target distress related to
sexual minority stressors are needed to address the unique mental health concerns of this high risk community
of Veterans. Expressive writing is a brief, well-developed paradigm that involves writing about thoughts and
emotions related to a stressful experience for at least 15 minutes, 3-5 times based on a structured writing
prompt. Over 30 years of research supports expressive writing’s effectiveness in reducing stress, depression,
and anxiety related to a stressor. Expressive writing on a minority stressor (EWMS) has been shown to reduce
depression and anxiety among sexual minority non-Veterans but has never been tested among sexual minority
Veterans. The aim of the proposed study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
effectiveness of EWMS, a promising intervention for sexual minority Veterans. Based on consultation with
experts in expressive writing and sexual minority Veteran health, EWMS will be adapted for sexual minority
Veterans and a VHA clinic setting. EWMS will be implemented as a 3 session, one-on-one intervention with a
therapist. The proposed EWMS protocol will be iteratively refined in a case series (n = 5), and then tested in a
pilot randomized control trial (RCT; n = 54) comparing EWMS to a neutral writing control condition. Aims of the
pilot RCT are: 1) demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of study procedures and EWMS; 2) examine the
preliminary effectiveness of EWMS relative to control in reducing depressive and anxiety symptom severity;
and 3) exploratory analyses will examine the preliminary effectiveness of EWMS relative to control in reducing
substance use (alcohol and drugs) quantity and frequency and suicidal ideation. The proposed research aims
are in direct alignment with the applicant’s short term and long term training goals. The proposed research and
complimentary mentorship and training plans will enable the applicant to: 1) gain expertise in intervention
adaptation and clinical trial research; 2) gain expertise in sexual minority health; 3) develop aptitude in
implementation theory and processes to inform future implementation of the proposed intervention and other
interventions; and 4) achieve career independence. The results of the pilot RCT along with the training and
mentorship of this project will inform a Merit award submission comparing EWMS with an active control in a
hybrid I implementation-effectiveness trial to test the efficacy of the intervention while collecting information on
barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention. This proposed research, training, and mentorship
plan will provide the applicant with the necessary skills and experience to transition into an independent clinical
researcher in VA focused on the development, enhancement, and implementation of interventions for minority-
related stress among sexual minority Veterans. The research and training will take place at the National Center
for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at the VA Boston Healthcare System under the supportive, collaborative, and
accomplished mentorship team, including Drs. Brian Marx (primary mentor), Katherine Iverson (co-mentor),
and Nicholas Livingston (co-mentor). These mentors have unique, yet complimentary, areas of expertise and
have an established and successful history working together and with the applicant. The research, mentorship,
and training proposed will facilitate the applicant’s transition into a successful and productive independent VA
investigator conducting research that directly aligns with VA’s priority to provide equitable, patient-centered
services to Veterans."
10917063,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall vision of the proposed research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how phosphorylation
regulates the activity and function of a key regulator of immune signaling, the Ser/Thr protein kinase C (PKC)
Theta (). This kinase is selectively expressed in hematopoietic cells where it transduces signals resulting in T
cell and platelet activation.1,2 Its dysregulation is associated with a variety of pathophysiological conditions
including blood cancers,3,4 inflammatory diseases,5 thrombosis,6 and hemostasis.7 Despite this, the regulation
and function of PKC remains largely unknown and necessitates further investigation. Phosphorylation of PKC
plays an essential role in regulating its maturation, catalytic activity, and subcellular localization,8 all of which are
crucial for PKC function in T cells and platelets. This proposal aims to understand how phosphorylation at
known conserved priming sites (activation loop, turn motif, hydrophobic motif),9 a bioinformatically-identified new
potential priming site (Ser662), and an uncharacterized activation-induced site (Ser685), regulate the maturation,
activity, and/or localization of PKC. Unbiased phosphoproteomics approaches have revealed that
phosphorylation of Ser685 significantly increases in T cells10 and platelets11 in response to stimulation, however
its function has not yet been determined due, in part, to a lack of available research tools. This site, and Ser662
are positioned on a key regulatory segment, the C-tail, and are evolutionarily conserved. The central hypothesis
driving this proposal is that phosphorylation of S662 is involved in the maturation of PKC and that activation-
induced phosphorylation of S685 promotes the re-autoinhibition of activated PKC to facilitate signal termination.
To this end, I will investigate how nonphosphorylatable or phosphomimetic mutations at these residues impact
PKC biochemical properties, cellular activity, subcellular localization, and downstream signaling (Aim 1).
Additionally, I will examine the phosphoproteome of PKC in Jurkat cells and platelets and examine how
phosphorylation at the agonist-induced site, Ser685, affects downstream signaling. I will also aim to identify the
kinase(s) regulating PKC Ser685 phosphorylation using various phosphoproteomics approaches (Aim 2).
These key studies will elucidate the functional impact of PKC phosphorylation at critical residues and how this
influences downstream signaling. Moreover, this proposal will elucidate substrates and signaling networks
regulated by PKC. Uncovering the regulation and function of PKC, a key regulator of T cells and platelets, is
crucial to understanding T cell and platelet signaling in both normal and disease states."

Vocal fold (VF) scarring is the single greatest cause of poor voice after vocal fold surgery and can have a
significant negative impact on quality of life. VF scarring is characterized by disorganization in the extracellular
matrix (ECM) of the lamina propria as well as alterations in the integrity of the surrounding epithelium and an
overall reduction in VF pliability. There is no treatment that can eliminate formed scars or reverse scar
formation. Research specific to vocal fold scarring has been limited by a lack of understanding of the
contributing subpopulations of cells and cell state dynamism in the context of injury space. The overall goal of
this work is to eluicate subpopulations, location, and proximity of cells that contribute to the VF injury response
and repair in vivo. Aim 1 will use single cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify the subpopulations of cells
present during injury and healing, as well as genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between and among
them to determine where cell-specific changes in the transcriptome are important. Aim 2 will investigate spatial
differential expression using spatial RNA sequencing analysis to identify niches enriched for distinct gene sets
and localize cell subpopulations to the VF in space and time during wound healing and repair. The central
hypothesis of this mentored research training proposal is that there are subpopulations of cells – immune,
fibroblasts and epithelial cells that respond to injury, and that these cells’ spatial location and proximity to each
other have a significant effect on coordinated gene expression. This proposal will identify participating cell
subpopulations and map gene expression positional identities to niches in the VF during inflammatory,
proliferative, remodeling and mature scar phases of wound healing to inform targeted regenerative
approaches."
10929301,"Project Abstract/Summary
Congenital heart disease (CHO) afflicts up to 2% of live births in the United States. Among the most severe CHO is single ventricle disease (SVD) where infants are born with only one sufficiently functional ventricle. SVD often requires a series of surgeries that is completed with the Fontan procedure. This results in a circulation that bypasses a right-heart-driven pulmonary circulation, instead, routing systemic venous return directly to the pulmonary arteries. While it is a life-saving procedure, a common complication later in life is failing Fontan physiology which often results in heart transplant, initiation of palliation, or death. Despite regular monitoring of these patients, the underlying mechanisms leading to Fontan failure are poorly understood.
Several modes of Fontan failure are hypothesized to be secondary to changes in 3D blood flow dynamics inside the Fontan connection. Current standard-of care imaging methods (echocardiography and 2D phase contrast MRI) capture only 1D hemodynamics and have substantial user variability. 4D flow MRI, a technique pioneered by our lab, was developed to address these challenges, and enable volumetric, 3D velocity measurement over the cardiac cycle. While this technique has been used to study Fontan hemodynamics, among other CHDs, it is not optimal for thorough, life-long monitoring. 4D flow has long, unpredictable scan times which are not amenable to small children requiring anesthesia during cardiac MRI studies. Additionally, 4D flow has a limited velocity dynamic range, lacks flexible reconstruction for different temporal and spatial resolution, and does not capture respiratory driven flow, a hemodynamic feature known to be important in the Fontan connection. To address these limitations, we have developed a method termed 5D flow MRI, a free-running technique with flexible, compressed sensing reconstruction that captures 3D velocities along the cardiac and respiratory cycles.
The first aim of this proposal is to develop an under 10 minutes dual-velocity encode (venc) 5D flow method along with a streamlined processing and analysis pipeline. This will enable accurate, simultaneous measurement of flow in veins and arteries while remaining sufficiently short for patients requiring general anesthesia. The second aim of this proposal is to validate this method and to optimize the reconstruction and acquisition parameters. This will be crucial for understanding the reliability of the metrics compared to clinical standards and to ensure that respiratory resolved flow is accurate. The third aim of this proposal is to apply the developed sequence in a cohort of patients with the Fontan connection. I hypothesize that: 1. Dual-venc 5D flow will be faster and simpler than clinically standard acquisitions, 2. Respiratory resolved flow measurements reveal additional hemodynamic information, 3. Voxel-wise parameters derived from 5D flow, such as respiratory driven peak velocities, correlate with pulmonary vascular resistance, an invasive measurement."

 GABAergic neurons are the main inhibitory neurons in the adult nervous system. There are diverse cortical
and subcortical GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons with different physiological properties,
connectivity, and functions. However, few studies have been able to investigate the functions of specific
subclasses by perturbing GABA release selectively. We propose an approach to target GABA synthesis in
subclasses of GABAergic neurons. GAD activity requires the cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP). PLP
deficiency can be achieved by knocking out the rate limiting enzyme in PLP synthesis: pyridoxine-5-phosphate
oxidase (PNPO). Moreover, PLP deficiency can be rescued by systemic PLP administration. We therefore
propose to generate cell type specific PNPO deficiency mouse models. We will first generate models with
GABA deficiency in well-studied but highly distinct cell types to test the feasibility of our approach: 1) the
parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic neurons; 2) the VIP-positive GABAergic neurons; 3) the striatal
dopamine D1 receptor expressing neurons; and 4) the striatal dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons. Mice
will be assessed for general health, feeding, drinking, sleep, and potential seizures. In addition, working
memory, reference memory, reversal learning, motor coordination and motor learning will be examined. Brain
morphology and electrophysiology will be assessed. Levels of GABA, other PNPO-dependent
neurotransmitters, and their metabolites will be measured. The main goal of this R21 application is to test the
feasibility of such an approach. These models are potentially significant research tools for the research
community and may have a broad impact given the diverse distribution and functions of different GABAergic
projection neurons and interneurons."

10919770,"Veterans have disproportionately increased risks for cardiovascular (CV), diabetic, and chronic kidney
diseases (CKD) compared to the general population. Abnormal iron homeostasis has recently been suggested
to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various metabolic and CV disorders. Iron metabolism disorder is
highly prevalent in CKD, but its systemic extra-hematopoietic consequences, including diabetic, renal, and CV
risks, have not been investigated. In CKD, induction of inflammatory signaling increases hepcidin, a key
hepatic iron regulator which prevents oral iron absorption and mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial
stores. By reducing available circulating iron, hepcidin likely mediates the development of functional iron
deficiency (FID), in which insufficient iron incorporation into erythroid precursors and other cell types occurs
despite adequate body iron stores. Thus, FID is characterized by low serum transferrin saturation (Tsat),
reflecting reduced available plasma iron for cellular uptake, and increased ferritin, reflecting adequate total
body iron stores. Given that iron is essential not only for erythropoiesis but also for mitochondrial energy
metabolism, inadequate iron supply to highly metabolic organs could lead to a wide range of adverse systemic
effects. While anemia is the most recognized clinical consequence of FID, its effect on other organs has never
been assessed in the CKD population.
 We hypothesize that hepcidin-induced FID in CKD leads to (1) iron deficiency at the tissue level, with
increased risk for failure of highly metabolic organs most dependent on mitochondrial oxidative capacity, such
as heart and kidney, and (2) enhanced new-onset diabetes risk due to insulin resistance associated with
inadequate muscle mitochondrial respiration. The lack of knowledge on extra-hematopoietic consequences of
FID in CKD has led to a singular focus on anemia management without regard to its potential harm to other
organs. The current standard CKD management thus does not evaluate iron status in the absence of obvious
anemia. Yet, iron deficiency without the presence of anemia has been associated with marked mortality risk in
heart failure. Moreover, the joint thresholds of Tsat and ferritin defining FID have not been developed to predict
extra-hematopoietic clinical events in CKD, undermining the ability of clinicians to accurately diagnose the
problem. In addition, the relationship of hepcidin with FID has not been characterized in a large CKD cohort.
Improved knowledge of the role of iron in systemic complications of CKD is critical to developing a more
integrated strategy for risk stratification and identifying innovative therapeutic targets.
 We propose to address the above knowledge gap using two observational studies involving (1) a
historical cohort using data from the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) and (2)
a complementary prospective cohort from the ongoing NIDDK-sponsored Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort
(CRIC), a longitudinal observational study of 3,939 CKD patients with available biospecimens since 2003. We
propose to access biospecimens from CRIC to measure serum hepcidin and iron indices. Using these assay
results from CRIC and longitudinal data from both CRIC and VINCI, we will evaluate the relationship of FID
and hepcidin with renal, diabetic, and CV outcomes in both cohorts. VINCI provides large statistical power to
explore the joint thresholds of Tsat and ferritin defining FID and to evaluate the association between FID and
clinical risks, with direct relevance to Veteran health. CRIC allows the ability to apply the VINCI results in an
independent cohort to identify FID and to explore the role of hepcidin, which is not available through VINCI.
This is the first study to examine (i) the iron thresholds defining FID most associated with heart failure risk and
(ii) the role of FID and hepcidin in the renal, diabetic and CV complications of CKD. Positive findings from our
study will identify iron status and hepcidin as novel modifiable risk factors with the potential to impact current
CKD practice, which does not assess iron status in the absence of obvious anemia."
10834252,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the most common infectious cause of death. LRTI affects patients
more often in ICUs, especially patients with mechanical ventilators. Early initiation of short-course antibiotic
therapy is the cornerstone in managing mechanically ventilated patients with LRTI. However, using the current
clinical criteria, a diagnosis of LRTI is typically not made until an infection in the lower respiratory tract is well
established. To address the current limitations, molecular diagnostic technologies such as polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based multiplex assays have been developed. However, they cannot distinguish between
colonization and infection. Therefore, a more sophisticated diagnostic methodology is needed for LRTI
diagnosis and management. Human exhaled air has great potential to address the current limitations in
diagnosing LRTI. However, the lack of a suitable collection system for clinical use put a major barrier to
exploring the medical potential of using human exhaled air. To address these limitations, Zeteo Tech
renovated the capture mechanism and developed a novel collection system, BreathBiomicsTM, for
biomolecules for human breath analysis. Specifically, we demonstrated that BreathBiomicsTM could be
configured into mechanical ventilators for collecting biomolecules in the exhaled air from intubated patients in
intensive care units. Most importantly, by characterizing these biomolecules using mass spectrometry, we
identified truncated proteoforms, which are the products of activated proteases, and demonstrated that
truncated proteoforms had the diagnostic potential for LRTI in a pilot study. Considering this evidence, we
propose to determine whether truncated proteoforms in human exhaled air can be used as a noninvasive
method for LRTI diagnosis and early prediction of LRTI in mechanically ventilated patients. Our work would
largely assist decision-making for clinicians regarding antibiotic treatment and dramatically improve patients'
clinical outcomes by limiting antibiotic requirements and minimizing harmful exposure to unnecessary antibiotic
treatment."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. It accounts for ~15% of
all breast cancer yet is responsible for 30% of breast cancer deaths. TNBC is treated primarily by conventional
chemotherapy; however, resistance to therapy is common, leading to high mortality rates. Importantly, the
benefit of current therapeutic strategies used in chemoresistant TNBC; i.e., immunotherapy and antibody-
drug conjugates, is confined to only a fraction of patients, and survival benefit is limited. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to identify novel and effective treatment strategies to overcome resistance to chemotherapy.
Recently, we identified hypoxia-induced ECM re-modeler, lysyl oxidase (LOX) as a key mediator of
chemoresistance in TNBC (Saatci et al, Nature Communications, 2020). We showed that LOX is
overexpressed in chemoresistant tumors, and its inhibition re-sensitizes the most aggressive breast tumors
to doxorubicin using several clinically-relevant mouse models. However, the available LOX inhibitors are
either non-selective or has toxicity. Hence, our main objective in this project is to develop potent, specific and
well-tolerated LOX inhibitors to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC that has a high translational potential.
Through high-throughput compound library screening and hit-to-lead conversion studies, we identified
compounds with potent on-target cellular engagement of LOX, with good oral pharmacokinetics (PK) and
with chemosensitizer effect without major toxicity (US PTO 17/693,371 and PCT/US2022/20086, patent
pending). Starting from our current non-optimized lead molecule, we aim to develop lead compounds with
increased potency, safety and drug-likeness. To accomplish this goal, in Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR
grant, we will generate a diverse library of small molecules via an extensive structure activity relationship
(SAR) study using our initial pharmacophore. We will test the synthesized inhibitors with respect to the degree
of LOX enzymatic activity inhibition, LOX binding and selectivity towards LOX. We will perform the off-target
assessment of the inhibitors using CEREP screen as well as kinome profiling. The shortlisted candidates will
further be tested in ECM crosslinking and 3D chemosensitization assays using both cell lines and organoids.
Inhibitors with better efficacy, selectivity and stability will move to Phase II. In Phase II, we will perform several
ADME assays, including metabolic stability/identity, Caco-2 permeability and transport, cardiotoxicity and
genotoxicity, plasma protein binding, CYP inhibition/induction/reaction phenotyping to improve drug-like
properties while maintaining on-target potency in TNBC cells. Detailed PK/PD and toxicity analyses of the
most promising candidates will be carried out followed by testing their chemosensitizer effect using both
state-of-the-art immunodeficient (cell line- and patient-derived xenografts) and immunocompetent
(syngeneic) mice models. The successful completion of the proposed project will lead to potent and specific,
lead-optimized LOX inhibitors to overcome chemoresistance in TNBC, the deadliest form of breast cancer."

Neurological disorders affect millions of patients worldwide and represent a major unmet medical need. Recent
progress on developing new classes of central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics has lagged compared to
other disease areas. A key obstacle in the CNS drug discovery process has been a need for cellular models,
assays, and technologies that can more reliably assess disease-relevant neurophysiological parameters in a
human cellular context at the level of individual neurons and synapses, with the scale and resolution to capture
the complexity and variability of these systems. We propose to address this need through the integration of three
key technologies – (i) our high throughput BRITETM platform for all-optical physiology in human neurons, which
achieves single-cell and single-action-potential resolution with a throughput of ~500,000 neurons per day per
instrument; (ii) genomic screens using CRISPR nuclease to disrupt gene function; (iii) machine learning for
identification of fingerprints that represent complex physiological phenotypes with single-cell resolution. This
Phase II program includes four key objectives. 1) Establish CRISPRn screening conditions in human neurons.
We will select 20 candidate target genes, including epilepsy and neurodevelopmental targets to further optimize
assay conditions compatible with all-optical physiology phenotyping, including timing of genetic disruption and
concentration of CRISPRn/gRNA components for effective knockdown of gene targets. 2) Build deep-learning-
powered analytical tools for single-cell phenotyping. We will use deep neural networks to learn a compact vector
representation of neuronal behavior after pharmacological intervention that leverages our single cell resolution
measurements and accommodates potential heterogeneity in the population of neurons. 3) Identify genetic
modulators of neuronal function using a genome-wide CRISPRn screen. We will combine experimental
conditions and analytical models established in Aims 1-2 to carry out a genome-wide CRISPRn screen (>18,000
gene targets) with arrayed gRNA libraries in wild-type human iPSC-excitatory neurons. We will identify gene
targets whose downregulation leads to significant changes in functional parameters. Potential hits and specificity
of target knockdown will be confirmed in independent rounds using single gRNA and qPCR and immunoblotting
assays. 4) Predict and validate phenotypic rescue in a human iPSC-neuronal model of Fragile X Syndrome.
Finally, we will assess the predictive value of the functional fingerprints developed in Aim 3 to generate a
candidate list of gene targets that can rescue (suppress) phenotypic parameters we have identified in a human
cellular model of the neurodevelopmental disorder, Fragile X syndrome. We will modulate the expression of
these potential genetic suppressors with CRISPRn in FMR1-/y iPSC-neurons and benchmark phenotypic rescue
using genetic re-introduction of FMRP. Successful completion of the proposed work has potential to yield a new
understanding of the molecular architecture of human neurophysiology and a platform for novel therapeutic
target identification focused on the molecular basis for modulation of neurophysiological disease mechanisms."

 In stroke rehabilitation, patient engagement in therapy is critical for improving functional outcomes. Robot-
assisted rehabilitation can provide repeatable, high-intensity therapy tailored to the needs of the patient, while
also decreasing the load on the therapist. The Barrett Upper-Extremity Robotic Trainer (Burt®), an FDA Class-II
medical device developed and sold by Barrett Technology, is a robotic system that provides active assistance in
three dimensions in a large-human scale workspace and an engaging patient interface to enhance therapy.
 To enable more individualized treatment and maximize patient engagement while also reducing the burden
on the therapist, we are developing SmartAssist™, a real-time adaptive robotic assistance mode for Burt® that
encourages the patient to use their own volitional movement as much as possible. In previous work, we developed
a functional prototype of the real-time adaptive Burt® system. In this project, we take a user-centered approach
to continued development with goals of (1) enhancing the SmartAssist™ control functionality with tuning and new
features as requested by users; (2) adding advanced data visualization features to identify areas of difficulty;
and (3) conducting a preliminary clinical study to evaluate efficacy in partnership with researchers at Spaulding
Rehabilitation Hospital.
 The deliverables of this work are a fully functional adaptive assistive Burt® system with SmartAssist™ includ-
ing several Burt® games using adaptive assistance, an intuitive path specification interface, data visualization to
help therapists quickly identify difficult areas and adapt their training plan, and an understanding of how these
features can improve patient outcomes. We will also complete a randomised controlled trial, providing us with an
understanding of how these features can improve patient outcomes. This will prepare us for potential commer-
cialization of the Burt® SmartAssist™ system, making highly individualized training widely available across the
U.S. on an affordable and user-friendly platform."
10907582,"RADCO Project 2 Summary
Much of cognitive impairment and dementia research has concentrated on disease mechanisms
and targets for disrupting these. A compelling alternative approach is to delineate naturally
occurring mechanisms of protection. Some centenarians remain cognitively intact despite an
extreme exposure to the strongest risk factor for cognitive impairment and AD, aging. We
hypothesize that these centenarians and some portion of their offspring have protective factors
that lead to such resilience or in some cases, even resistance against cognitive decline and
dementia. With the support of the Administrative, Phenotyping and Biosamples, and
Neuroimaging Cores, and Project 1 (Resilience and Resistance Phenotypes), this 2nd project of
the “Resistance/Resilience to AD in Centenarians and Offspring"" (RADCO) study strives to
discover factors and mechanisms protective against cognitive impairment, AD and other
dementias. This project entails three related approaches: genetics (Aim 1), transcriptomic
analyses (Aim 2), and 3D human neural-glial culture models of age-related brain pathology (Aim
3). Our goals are to 1) identify genetic variants and biological mechanisms of resilience/resistance
in centenarian cognitive superagers, 2) predict mechanisms of cognitive resilience and validate
candidate drugs that can enhance the resilience/resistance in human brain cells, and 3) establish
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived 3D brain cell models of the centenarian
superagers to test those mechanisms as well as discover and test others that could be exploitable
for protective therapeutics."
10907658,"Project Summary/Abstract
There is an urgent need for effective diabetes self-management interventions that are convenient, scalable,
sustainable, and able to meet the needs of diverse patients and those with limited health literacy that may be
disproportionately affected by the disease. Based on our preliminary studies, My Diabetes Care (MDC) may fill
this critical gap by bringing together some of the best aspects of diabetes mHealth apps and incorporating
them into a patient portal intervention that was developed to be interoperable with a variety of electronic health
records (EHRs) and that offers direct integration into routine care without creating additional work for
healthcare teams or the need for additional staff. MDC is a multi-faceted patient portal intervention designed to
help patients better understand their diabetes health data as well as promote and support self-management.
Developed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), MDC uses infographics to facilitate users'
understanding of their diabetes health data, incorporates motivational strategies and access to an online
patient support community, and provides literacy level-appropriate and tailored diabetes self-care information.
To ensure interoperability and optimize scalability, we built MDC using Substitutable Medical Applications,
Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (SMART on FHIR) that allows MDC to be
installed into a wide variety of EHR platforms across the U.S. Our preliminary studies suggest MDC is
acceptable, feasible, improves understanding of diabetes health measures, and increases patient activation.
The objective of the proposed research is to: (1) expand MDC's display of user's diabetes health data beyond
hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure, cholesterol, and flu vaccination status to include microalbumin and BMI and
enhance access by creating a Spanish-language version; (2) evaluate the effects of the expanded & enhanced
version of MDC on diabetes-related outcomes while demonstrating its scalability by integrating it into another
health system and conducting a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in an ethnically and racially diverse
patient population, and (3) examine how the effects of MDC arise by studying causal mediators. The proposed
work is important because racial/ethnic minorities and those with limited health literacy are more likely to
experience barriers to diabetes self-care and technology use. By designing, testing, and evaluating, MDC in
diverse groups of patients including those with limited health literacy and developing a Spanish language
version, we will advance the understanding of how to create patient-facing health technologies to achieve
broad uptake and address health inequities. By leveraging SMART on FHIR, our project will also demonstrate
the current state of the art by implementing and testing MDC without needing to rebuild it and will serve as a
model for future patient portal-based interventions."
10909972,"The advent of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) substantially improved life
expectancy but, now, PLWHA who smoke lose more life-years due to tobacco use than they do to their HIV
infection. Unfortunately, the rate of smoking among PLWHA in the US is about 40%. The limited tobacco use
treatment research with PLWHA indicates that behavioral treatments and medications (nicotine patch and
varenicline) yield moderate effects on cessation, with quit rates that are considerably lower than they are for the
general population. Thus, there is a critical need to identify novel ways to optimize tobacco cessation treatment
for smokers with HIV. Two factors are highly predictive of cessation outcomes with pharmacotherapy, in the
general population and among PLWHA. First, a smoker's rate of nicotine metabolism, characterized by the
nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR, a marker of CYP2A6 gene variants), predicts cessation both for varenicline and
nicotine patch. Our studies with general population and HIV-infected smokers show that personalizing the choice
of medications for smokers using the NMR can increase efficacy and reduce toxicities, an approach highlighted
by the NCI (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/plan/public-health). Second, adherence to smoking
cessation medications, in the general population and among PLWHA, rarely exceeds 60% and non-adherence
lowers cessation rates 2-3 fold. We developed the Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) intervention which is
endorsed by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/ma/index.html) as
an evidence-based intervention for medication adherence among PLWHA. Thus, the application's premise is
that incorporating intervention components to tailor tobacco use medications (varenicline or patch) with the NMR
and increase adherence to the medication using MAPS will optimize tobacco treatments for PLWHA. To test this
premise, we will conduct a rigorous multi-site randomized clinical trial with 488 HIV+ smokers to evaluate
NMR-tailored treatment and MAPS as optimization strategies for tobacco dependence treatment for PLWHA.
We will use a factorial design to examine: 1) The effects of the NMR-tailored and/or MAPS interventions on end-
of-treatment (EOT) and 6-month smoking cessation rates (primary aim); 2) Mediators of the NMR-tailored and
MAPS interventions (secondary aim); and 3) Moderators of the NMR-tailored and MAPS interventions
(exploratory aim). Our overall approach is consistent with the Multiphase Optimization Strategy which has gained
prominence for guiding the evaluation of interventions for enhancing tobacco use treatment effectiveness.
Addressing these aims will determine: the use of adherence and pharmacogenetic optimization of smoking
cessation treatment for PLWHA, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of these optimization strategies on
cessation outcomes, and the variation in the effects of these optimization strategies across sub-groups of
PLWHA. In the end, this trial will help understand if getting the right medication to the right person and helping
to make sure they sufficiently use that medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatment for this population."
10903978,"Project Summary:
 Metastatic cancer is a major clinical challenge that accounts for numerous deaths annually in the United
States, particularly in women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Many tumors develop within a
microenvironment (TME) characterized by altered/stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM) and compromised
immunity. These alterations play a causal role in malignancy and metastasis. Recently tumor-derived exosomes
have drawn tremendous interest as they are implicated in modulating the TME, suppressing anti-tumor immunity,
and preparing the metastatic site for progression. A hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to evade the immune
system. Exosomes play a pivotal role in the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. In this project, focusing on
TNBC, we explore how ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension (collectively referred to as tissue tension) regulate
exosome production and cargo composition, and how these exosomes contribute to the suppression of anti-
tumor immunity and promote metastasis. We pursue a unique set of hypotheses linking tissue tension to
exosome production and defining the role of tumor-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and metastatic
progression. To test our hypotheses, we have assembled a strong team from UPENN and UCSF, integrating
expertise in bioengineering, cancer mechanobiology, and cancer immunology. In Aim 1, we address whether
and how the tissue tension affects exosome production and alters exosome cargo in vitro in TNBC cells. We will
also delineate a molecular pathway linking ECM stiffness to intracellular signaling and exosome trafficking, using
experimental and subcellular biophysical modeling methods. In Aim 2, we address how tissue tension promotes
metastatic progression via exosomes in vivo. In this aim we test the hypothesis that the tension of the primary
tumor tissue enhances exosome production and alters exosome cargo to promote the dissemination of primary
tumor cells and foster their survival and outgrowth at the metastatic site. We will use unique genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic TNBC models, and TNBC patient PDXs, combined with
multiscale pharmacokinetic modeling. In Aim 3, we address how tissue tension contributes to the suppression of
anti-tumor immunity. In this aim, we will investigate the role of exosomes derived from tumors with high tension
in stiff ECM TMEs in suppressing anti-tumor immunity through (1) reprogramming macrophages against T cells;
and (2) the engagement of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint axis in T cells. We will use a combination of in vitro cell
culture experiments, in vivo genetically engineered mouse models and syngeneic transplant manipulations and
tissue-scale agent-based modeling. The expected results will shed light on the roles of exosomes in immune
regulation and metastatic tumor progression; these are important and timely questions in cancer research. The
results will lay the foundation for future therapeutic intervention of metastatic disease through the identification
of actionable biomarkers, development of new immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICB)-based therapies, and ultimately
reduce patient mortality."
10865133,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a pressing public health issue with substantial
disparities. ADRD can only be addressed by minimizing the impact of modifiable risk factors – especially health
behaviors. However, evidence suggests that health behaviors are shaped by the community contexts (i.e. built
and social environments) in which we live, work, play, and age. Failure to understand and account for community-
level contextual factors in ADRD risk reduction may minimize the impact of public health measures to reduce the
risk of ADRD and worsen health disparities. Investigating pathways that connect community contextual factors,
health behavior engagement, and disparities in ADRD risk is an untapped opportunity to advance the science
ADRD risk reduction, and is aligned with NIA's strategic goals by “illuminat(ing) the pathways by which social,
psychological, economic, and behavioral factors affect health,” and “understand(ing) environmental, social,
cultural, behavioral, and biological factors that create and sustain health disparities.”
This study leverages data from two innovative projects funded by the NIH (Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse
Life Experiences (KHANDLE); Neighborhood Atlas) and the PolicyMap database to identify when and how
community contextual factors shape health behaviors and ADRD risk and disparities. This project will link
KHANDLE participants' residential histories from birth to late-life with the validated Area Deprivation Indices
available via the Neighborhood Atlast from 1910 to present, and geocoded measures of the built environment
available via PolicyMap. This proposal seeks to define: 1) how the timing or duration of exposure to community
contexts is associated with late-life cognitive/brain health; 2) if individual health behaviors mediate relationships
between community contexts and cognitive/brain health; 3) if these pathways differ by race/ethnicity or gender.
This research is complimented by a detailed training plan at the University of California Davis guided by a
mentorship team comprised of nationally and internationally recognized scholars. The training will build upon the
applicant's background in social epidemiology, health promotion, and healthy brain aging research to incorporate
new training in causal inference methods, geospatial analysis, modeling neuroimaging biomarkers, and
translational epidemiology. The combined research and training will prepare the applicant for a successful
independent research career focused on understanding and addressing modifiable pathways for ADRD
disparities. Findings from the proposed research are critical for advancing population based ADRD risk reduction
strategies that eliminate, rather than exacerbate, health disparities."

Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR), the new HEAT (Health Equity & Action
Translational) Research Core, we will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing action-oriented,
rigorous observational and interventional research address health disparities and promoted health equity in the
greater San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. The Core is motivated by the need to: a) design and
optimized targeting and tailoring of diabetes-related interventions and public health policy to promote health
equity and reduce inequalities, and b) to monitor the impact of innovations in care delivery, public health and
social policy on existing health inequalities.
We aim to build capacity in carrying out translational research that addresses the range of systems that
generate or undermine health – from clinical healthcare systems to public health systems to social systems.
Expanding in this way is aligned with the recognition that achieving health equity in diabetes not only will
require new ways of delivering care in diverse health systems, but also new ways to influence and transform a
range of systems within and outside of healthcare so as to affect the so-called ‘structural determinants of
health.’ This goal will be accomplished by 1.) Maintaining and deepening a vibrant and collaborative cross-
disciplinary research environment, 2.) Supporting junior investigators, 3.) Disseminating findings among the
scientific community and with key stakeholders, including the communities most affected by diabetes, and 4.)

Diabetes policy research increasingly relies on methodological expertise in five key areas: (a) natural
experiments research; (b) implementation science; (c) health economics including comparative effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness analysis; (d) simulation modeling; and (e) machine learning. The MDI core mission is to
promote those methods and data to facilitate policy research in diabetes and health equity.
The MDI Core will promote technological advances in data and research methods that can be applied to
support interventions in the T2-T4 translational research continuum ranging from ‘bench-to-bedside’ research,
clinical care and health services research, community-based intervention research, implementation sciences
research, comparative effectiveness analysis, all the way to agent-based simulation models that influence
policy, systems and environments. We will support a research environment that disseminates new statistical
and analytic approaches, such as hierarchical models, causal modeling, machine learning and artificial
intelligence techniques, and technological advances in data sources such as lab-based biomarkers, remotely
collected health data, and population health data. These goals will be accomplished by 1) Mentoring junior

diverse focused on high-risk populations; and enhancing the efficiency, productivity, effectiveness, and
multidisciplinary nature of diabetes translation research through allocation of on-demand availability of experts
across the five key areas listed above.
The National DPR Core will draw upon the research expertise in diabetes at UCSF, UC Davis, UC Merced and
Kaiser Permanente Northern California, which together have a focus on promoting health equity among
vulnerable populations and a specific portfolio of research and translation of interventions to reduce
socioeconomic and race/ethnic disparities in diabetes prevention and treatment outcomes. These include
policies related to social and structural determinants of health such as health literacy, food insecurity, healthy
food access and sugary beverage consumption, health insurance design, access to health information
technology, and barriers to safety net clinic programs.
The National DPR Core will be dedicated solely to expanding core services to investigators and others outside

studies in each year of the HDS-CDTR renewal, conduct peer review of Pilot and Feasibility award applications
on an annual basis, and leverage the Pilot and Feasibility awards as a mechanism to support junior
investigators in developing robust careers in translational research in diabetes and diabetes prevention with a
particular focus on health equity and disparities reduction. CDTR pilot awardees have submitted 10 grants,
including four R-level and three career development awards. Of these 10 grants, 8 (80%) were funded. All
former pilot awardees report still working in diabetes translational research. It is especially notable that two of
our prior P&F awardees (Lyles and Brown) have gone on to develop very successful careers as independent
investigators in diabetes translational research—so much so, that they have been invited to join the DREAMS-
CDTR as core faculty.
This renewal includes several innovations in direct response to feedback from current and former P and F
awardees. First, to facilitate connections between pilot awardees and potential senior mentors across sites, we
will identify senior mentors to serve as discussion moderator during pilot awardee presentations. Second,
because awardees described challenges in connecting with other junior faculty, we propose to create a virtual
coffee hour once per quarter to allow early stage investigators (ESI) (pilot awardees and other affiliated faculty)

Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes is growing
rapidly; California leads the nation in incident cases and costs of diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic
status, older adults, rural populations, and racial and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these
disparities include a complex combination of interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health
system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-
based diabetes interventions into widespread practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a
range of settings are desperately needed. The Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel
Science Center for Diabetes Translational Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity
science through the development and translation of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare
delivery systems that substantively reduce health inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter
the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2 Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities.
Focusing on the northern California and its Central Valley region, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct clinical
research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system, community and
policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together translational science
core faculty, half of whom are from groups under-represented in science, who have expertise in diverse, multi-
level areas including: food insecurity, medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy,
and cost effectiveness analysis. DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of
public and non-profit health systems that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern
California’s Division of Research and the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis.
The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment

of neurosensory, neurodegenerative, pain, and mental health comorbidity in Veterans TBI. The
LIMBIC extension of the Warfighter Epidemiology Cohort will extend the work begun by CENC
in which we identified a cohort of Post-9/11 Veterans and identified comorbidity phenotypes. We
also obtained DoD trauma registry (DODTR) data, where available, and Military Health System
(MHS) inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data that was included in the DoD Mental Health
Data Cube. We now propose to expand upon this important data source for over 600,000
deployed SM’s to include a broader cohort of Post-9/11 era (deployed and nondeployed
Veterans and additional data sources that provide unique opportunities to examine long-term
comorbidity phenotypes and develop risk models for comorbidities of interest such as
neurodegenerative disease, SUD, psychological comorbidities, and self-harm behaviors.
These data will allow us to accomplish the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Using “all sources” TBI severity algorithm and NLP/text embedding methods, identify
 phenotypes of mTBI in DoD and DoD+VA data that incorporate acute injury, mechanism of
 injury, and blast exposure.
 Aim 2: Identify prevalence of key comorbidities and outcomes at baseline, before and after
 mTBI exposure, and in VA (where relevant) and compare those rates by TBI severity and
 study group.
 Aim 3: Use deep learning models that incorporate mTBI phenotype, acute and chronic
 treatment approaches, and emergence of diverse comorbidities to develop risk scores for
 poor military outcomes and developing key comorbidities.
 Aim 4: Use deep learning models to identify optimal processes of care for mTBI.
 We will use data in DaVINCI to identify a cohort of Veterans who receive longitudinal VA care
(at least once a year for three or more years between FY2002 and FY19 (at least one of which is
after 2007 when TBI screening was mandated. We will also identify individuals who did not
receive VA care. We will then categorize those with and without VA care as deployed and not
deployed, creating four study groups: a) deployed with VA care; b) deployed without VA care; c)
not deployed with VA care; d) not deployed without VA care. We will compile VA and DoD data
sources and identify key comorbidities (Neuroendocrine dysfunction, substance use disorder,
mental health conditions, pain conditions, sleep conditions, self-harm behaviors) and TBI
characteristics. Those data will be used for machine/deep learning models that will develop TBI
phenotypes, comorbidity phenotypes, and model risk scores for developing key comorbidities,
and optimal processes of care for mTBI.
 Conducting these analyses for these four study groups will inform TBI pathways of care and
illuminate specific target areas to improve acute TBI care and subsequent support systems for

10929958,"PROJECT 1 - PROJECT SUMMARY
A potential benefit of proton beam therapy compared to conventional therapy is expected
for many treatment sites if solely judged by the dose distribution, i.e. physical parameters.
Biological differences between protons and photons are currently only considered by
applying a constant weighting factor to proton doses, i.e. a proton relative biological
effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. There is an urgent need for additional research to examine
whether spatial variations in dose and RBE within organs at risk can explain adverse
treatment outcomes.
The potential difference in normal tissue toxicity between proton and photon irradiation
can only be assessed with studies with a substantial amount of clinical data because the
frequencies of most overt toxicities in radiation therapy is low, thus causing variations to
be typically within the noise of patient specific radiosensitivity. There is a significant
amount of clinical data available at our two institutions and equally as important, expertise
in assessment of toxicities based on blood, imaging and dosimetric biomarkers.
We hypothesize that there are fundamental differences in normal tissue toxicities between
proton and photon radiation due not only to differences in the distribution of dose but also
variations in RBE for normal tissue toxicities, which are currently poorly understood. We
aim to 1) understand the differences in normal tissue toxicities between protons and
photons by assessing dose response relationships, 2) identify biomarkers to inform
relative normal tissue complication probabilities to replace simple RBE concepts, and 3)
advance precision medicine concepts to proton radiotherapy by identifying patients that
will benefit.
Ultimately our approach will lead to novel outcome modeling concepts applicable to both
proton and photon therapy."
10909129,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cirrhosis and its complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are increasingly common causes of
morbidity and mortality in the United States. The central hypotheses of this application are that (1) the creation
of a prospective cohort study of patients with compensated cirrhosis will facilitate the generation of novel
prediction models based on the clinical, behavioral, metabolic, and biomarker data we collect to predict clinical
decompensation, (2) this cohort can validate and then be supplemented by a larger electronic health record
(EHR)-based virtual cohort, the latter of which will enable validation of electronic cirrhosis phenotypes and
subsequent analysis of real-world data on the safety and effectiveness of individual lipid-lowering agents on
multiple outcomes among patients with cirrhosis and (3) long-term statin therapy will provide clinical benefits in
preventing hepatic decompensation and HCC independent of its lipid lowering effect. To investigate these
hypotheses, we propose unique approaches to both the cohort study and statin-based clinical trial for the Liver
Cirrhosis Network (LCN). In Aim 1a, we will create a prospective cohort of highly phenotyped patients with
compensated NASH, ALD, cholestatic and cryptogenic cirrhosis, in order to facilitate the interrogation of
biospecimens, patient reported behaviors and outcomes, and clinical data for novel predictors of disease
progression, and to understand through serum lipoproteins measurement the complex interaction between
cirrhosis and lipid metabolism. In Aim 1b, we will create a large LCN-wide EHR-based virtual cohort of patients
with compensated cirrhosis, prospectively validate electronic phenotypes for cirrhosis and its clinical
complications with our in-person cohort, and evaluate the use, safety and effectiveness of different classes of
lipid lowering medications upon outcomes in this large real-world virtual cohort. In Aim 2, we propose to study
the safety and efficacy of statins in preventing clinical decompensation among patients with NAFLD or ALD
cirrhosis while exploring the potential pleiotropic mechanisms of statins. In this trial, patients with and without an
established non-hepatic indication for lipid lowering will be randomized to pravastatin v. alirocumab (stratum 1)
or placebo (stratum 2), respectively. This innovative approach to the statin-based clinical trial will acknowledge
the patient's baseline indication for lipid-lowering therapy, and offer an alternative lipid lowering pathway in
PCSK9 inhibition, which has similar or greater LDL-lowering potency but lacks the pleotropic effects of statins,
to allow for novel insights into mechanisms by which statins might impact outcomes independent of its effects
on lipids. Throughout the cohort and interventional trials, we will study lipoprotein metabolism, inflammatory
markers, and collect microbiome and biospecimens for future translational research to better understand the
mechanisms behind disease progression in cirrhosis and for any potential impact of pravastatin and alirocumab
on clinical outcomes. These innovative strategies therefore leverage both cohort and clinical trial designs to
maximize the knowledge gained and improve clinical outcomes among patients with cirrhosis."
10894864,"Neuromodulators regulate addiction, attention, cognition, mood, memory, motivation, sleep, and more through
their influence on brain circuits. Classic tools for measuring neuromodulation in the brain have poor spatial and
temporal resolution. This has hampered the discovery of the diverse and complex functions neuromodulation
plays during behavior. Over the past few years, new indicators for imaging neuromodulator dynamics have
begun to dismantle these barriers. However, all existing neuromodulator indicators have significant limitations.
The goal of this proposal is to optimize our GPCR-activation-based (GRAB) genetically-encoded fluorescent
indicators of four major neuromodulators: dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and
serotonin (5-HT). We will make their responses bigger and more specific, create red versions for multiplexed
imaging, and make them easier for end-users to successfully deploy in vivo.
In Aim 1, we will optimize GRAB indicators for DA, ACh, NE, and 5-HT by iteratively screening libraries via
high-content confocal imaging and FACS. We will vary insertion site, linkers, cpGFP, FP-GPCR protein surface
interface, and thermostabilizing GPCR residues on a range of chimeric GCPR sensor backbones. Library
generation will be prioritized by computational prediction of function from GPCR structures. The dimensions of
optimization will be brightness, dF/F0, ligand selectivity, affinity, and non-disruption of endogenous signals. Top
hits will be validated following long-term expression in mammalian brain slice and behaving mice. Our targeted
performance levels are: 1000x ligand selectivity across all neuromodulators (3rd gen), >5x SNR improvement
over 2nd generation indicators in vitro and in vivo (3rd gen), and reliable single-trial subcellular resolution of
graded responses with in vivo 2-photon imaging of cortex during behavior for all neuromodulators (4th gen).
In Aim 2, we will use the same approach as Aim 1 to develop and validate in vivo 1st and 2nd generation red
GRABs for the same neuromodulators to enable simultaneous imaging of multiple signals. Our targeted
performance levels for second generation, spectrally orthogonal red GRABs are 10x dF/F in vitro, >50% dF/F
in vivo responses. We will also engineer out any photoactivation of red GRAB fluorescence, demonstrate
multiplexed imaging and optogenetic stimulation with zero opsin excitation crosstalk from imaging light.
In Aim 3, we will optimize GRAB packaging and distribution for maximum end-user ease of use. We will
quantify the best FPs for in vivo coexpression with GRABs, engineer viral-genetic strategies for robust, brain-
wide GRAB expression from systemic AAV injection, and make cre-reporter mouse lines for the best green
GRAB of each neuromodulator. Optimized plasmids, AAVs, and mice will be broadly disseminated.
Successful completion of our Aims will yield an optimized suite of powerful molecular tools packaged for
maximum utility and ease of use. Since these probes are well-suited for a large number of investigators, they
will have a multiplicative impact on our understanding of neural circuit function and dysfunction."
10864809,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
 Sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction are most common sensory disorders affecting
millions worldwide 1–3. Auditory and vestibular functions require mechanosensitive hair cells, with hair cell loss
leading to permanent hearing loss and disabling vestibular dysfunction/hypofunction. Recently, the neonatal
mouse utricle, one of five vestibular organs that relies on hair cells to detect linear acceleration, was shown to
harbor robust numbers of progenitor cells 6,7. However, while the existence of both mitotic and non-mitotic
mechanisms in mammals is now clear, we currently lack understanding of the timing, location, and mechanisms
of cell fate decisions. In other systems, like the skin, it is known that fate decisions are made downstream of
stem cells and their transit amplifying populations, but we do not yet know the fates of these putative populations
in the inner ear 39. A central regulator of tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance across many organs is
the Wnt pathway 8, and this signaling cascade is upregulated in the inner ear 12. I hypothesize that following injury,
mitotic regeneration leads to different cell lineages in the neonatal utricular sensory epithelium, and that Wnt
activation directs more supporting cells to adopt the mitotic cell lineage. Gaining an in-depth understanding of
the sequence of events that drive mitotic regeneration post injury will reveal potential approaches to regenerate
hair cells and supporting cells, with the ultimate goal of restoring hearing and balance functions.
 As a surgeon-scientist with a passion for treating patients with hearing and balance disorders, I am well
equipped to tackle the scientific questions outlined. My interests in the basic sciences stem from my
undergraduate years working on the genetics and development of the somatosensory cortex and studying the
olfactory system. During medical school, I saw the lack of therapies of patients with permanent hearing loss as
an opportunity, working on hair cell regeneration under the tutelage of renowned scientists, including Dr. Stefan
Heller and Dr. Roel Nusse (Jan et al., 2013, Development). As a resident in otolaryngology, I focused on gaining
the clinical and surgical expertise to treat patients and had the opportunity to continue basic science research
with a focus on hearing loss under Dr. Konstantina Stankovic. In order to gain advanced surgical skills and learn
state of the art techniques to study inner ear regeneration, I completed the T32 funded Clinician Scientist Training
Program in Otology & Neurotology. This program further allowed me to collect preliminary data and chart my
goals for this proposal as a new faculty member at UCSF. While I have extensive training in inner ear biology,
my knowledge is lacking in advanced mouse genetics, new single cell RNAseq technologies, and advanced
bioinformatics. Under the guidance of renowned stem cell physician-scientist Dr. Ophir Klein as my mentor at
UCSF, and expert inner ear surgeon-scientist, Dr. Alan Cheng as my co-mentor at Stanford, I am confident this
award will prepare me for scientific independence through the R01 grant mechanism."
10911163,"Dynamic changes in leptin levels in response to fasting are well known, and these responses are blunted in metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Leptin acts via leptin receptors in the brain to modulate many neuronal functions, including neuronal activity, neurogenesis, axonal growth, and synaptic strength. An increasing number of recent studies also highlight a role of leptin levels for the onset or progression of brain disorders like neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), learning and memory deficits, substance abuse, mental illness (e.g. depression) and neuropathic pain.  The precise regulation of the dynamic changes in circulating leptin, which is also considered an interoceptive signal, are at the core to maintain normal neuronal function in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.

Previous work from others has shown that sympathetic activation of adipose tissue suppresses the production and secretion of leptin. However, the precise nature of the neuronal populations involved in the sympathetic regulation are not completely understood. Also, it remains largely unknown how the sympathetic pathways interact with other pathways like thermo and energy-need sensory signals, that sometimes promote opposing effects to increase or decrease energy expenditure. Our previous work demonstrates that distinct leptin target sites in the hypothalamus are involved in thermo and energy need sensory signals via sympathetic adipose tissue activation to regulate energy expenditure. Yet, the necessity and sufficiency of adipose tissue sympathetic activation to control leptin levels and metabolic function has not been directly studied. 

This R01 application uses the mouse as a model, and will investigate how the brain communicates with select white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots via pre- and post-ganglionic sympathetic nerves to regulate leptin levels and to elucidate their interactions with thermo- and energy need sensory circuits in the hypothalamus, brainstem, preganglionic spinal cord and sympathetic ganglia in a variety of physiological conditions such as high versus low temperature and fasting versus feeding. It will identify novel excitatory and inhibitory neural circuits to these two types of adipose tissue through incorporating cutting-edge techniques proposed perhaps for the first time in this field, such as immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO) to allow impressive detailed visualization of peripheral circuits including the entire trunk of the spinal cord, and the use of stimulatory and inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in postganglionic neurons projecting to BAT and/or WAT to assess necessity and sufficiency of these adipose tissue depots for the physiological responses to changes in ambient temperature or the nutritional status."
10929532,"Summary:
Biomedical research on rodent models of disease depends on research tools that not only facilitate the actual
experiments, but also improve reproducibility while enhancing animal care and welfare. In this SBIR
application, we propose to develop a complete “turn-key” system for studying physiological biopotentials
obtained from immature rodents (i.e., rat and mouse pups). Specifically, we intend to provide tools and devices
that will facilitate physiological experiments on immature rodents by designing, building, testing, and then
commercializing a wireless recording system with a focus on the electroencephalogram (EEG), a common
clinical tool. We will build and test a new temperature-controlled recording chamber, which is specifically
necessary for immature rodents because they cannot control their body temperature when separated from the
dam. This novel system will also allow investigators to simulate clinical hypothermia for rodent studies of the
EEG while modelling neonatal stroke and during the subsequent phases of brain injury. BIOPAC Systems, Inc.
will continue to collaborate with researchers at the University of Utah, and have already developed and tested
a proof of concept device. This collaboration will engage the engineering expertise of BIOPAC and
collaboratively build on the experience of the academic lab at the University of Utah to generate an optimized
system for recording and analysis of seizures and other EEG abnormalities similar to those used clinically. This
novel system will be a major extension of one of BIOPAC’s current products, the EPOCHTM miniature wireless
recording system, which was invented and patented at the University of Utah and is already commercially
available from BIOPAC. Upon completion, the novel EPOCHTM miniature wireless system will greatly facilitate
research on immature rodents as animal models of neurological disease and injury, while improving the
reproducibility and animal care for this type of research."
10903975,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the U.S. Earlier detection is the key to
increased survival for women with ovarian cancer, yet a screening tool that is both sensitive and specific
enough for use in the general population has yet to be developed. In contrast, screening for cervical cancer by
Pap tests has been routinely performed for over 50 years. In the liquid-based Pap test, cells are collected from
the cervical opening and placed into an alcohol-based fixative and then examined for abnormal cells. Since
ovarian cancer cells have been observed in Pap tests, ovarian cancer peptide biomarkers may also be
present; yet Pap samples have not been rigorously examined for diagnostic peptides. Our central hypothesis
is that proteins shed by ovarian cancer cells can be detected in the Pap test fixative and on cervical-vaginal
swabs by Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. The Pap test fixative and swabs are ideal for biomarker
discovery since they are derived from a site proximal to the ovarian cancer (i.e. proteins may be secreted or
shed from the tumor and flow through the fallopian tube into the uterus and out the cervical opening).
Recently, ovarian cancer precursor lesions have been identified in the fimbria of the fallopian tube,
strengthening the hypothesis that ovarian cancer proteins will be found in the lower genital tract, perhaps even
at early stages. In preliminary studies, candidate biomarkers were successfully identified by MS-based
proteomics in Pap test fixatives from women with ovarian cancer, and the levels of biomarker peptides were
quantified in cases vs. benign and healthy controls, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. The long-
term goal of this project is to develop a noninvasive screening test that can be incorporated into a routine Pap
test or a self-administered home test, so that women can be screened simultaneously for cervical and ovarian
cancer. The objective of this study is to verify ovarian cancer biomarker peptides identified in Pap test samples
and extend the results to cervical swabs, using our collection of biospecimens from over 600 patients and
controls. Aim #1 will build on our preliminary studies to prioritize ovarian cancer biomarker candidates found in
liquid-based Pap test samples by performing Tandem Mass Tag™ 11-plex isobaric labeling, 2D LC-MS/MS,
and bioinformatics integration. In Aim #2, the most robust candidate biomarkers will be quantified by
developing a targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM)-MS assay coupled with a multi-protein classifier,
which will then be used to test hundreds of Pap test samples from women with ovarian cancer, other
gynecologic cancers, and benign gynecologic conditions, as well as healthy women. In Aim #3, proteins eluted
from cervical swabs will be tested to determine whether they are also detected by our SRM-MS assay. Results
from this study may be extended to the early detection of ovarian cancer in women in high risk groups and
eventually for screening the general population, thereby shifting the paradigm for how women are screened for
ovarian cancer and improving survival rates for the >22,000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year."
10911771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, more than 500 genomic loci associated with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia,
depression, and autism spectrum disorders, have been identified. This makes it possible to generate
polygenic risk scores (PRS) to stratify individuals by risk for different psychiatric disorders compared
to the general population. As a prediction tool, psychiatric PRS would likely be most valuable when
applied to individuals before the onset of illness. In about 75% of cases, the onset of psychiatric disorders
or prodromal features occurs by early adulthood making psychiatric PRS likely most useful for children and
adolescents. PRS have the potential to improve early identification, and lead to enhanced monitoring and
interventions to potentially prevent or delay onset, and minimize morbidity and risk for suicide, the second
leading cause of death in the U.S. in ages 10–24. Despite their promise, PRS could be especially perilous
in the context of psychiatry, and our preliminary work has found that PRS are already being used in
child and adolescent psychiatry. There is significant stigma around mental illness, and a history of misuse of
“predictors” of “undesirable” behaviors or mental illness in the US. Thus, psychiatric PRS could be another tool
used against patients with psychiatric disorders. Further, psychiatric PRS are arguably the first tool with the
capacity to generate risk predictions about psychiatric disorders for any individual and there are key legal gaps
in the protection of the privacy of this information and the prevention of genetic discrimination. To promote
responsible use of psychiatric PRS in children and adolescents, we will use a mixed-methods approach that
includes qualitative, quantitative, and legal analysis to: 1) give voice to stakeholders (i.e., patients,
parents/caregivers, clinicians) by examining their perspectives regarding whether psychiatric PRS should be
used and, if so, how; and 2) examine the legal and regulatory landscape to identify what safeguards may be
necessary. Although some of these gaps also apply to other genetic information, we will focus on identifying
potential policy solutions for the likely uses and misuses of psychiatric PRS against individuals with or at risk of
psychiatric disorders, almost 30% of the US population. The long-term goal of this research is to develop
ethically-justified and empirically-informed guidelines to address the ethical challenges raised by the use of
psychiatric PRS with children and adolescents. Building on our NIH-funded Child and Adolescent Psychiatric
Genetics Survey (CAPGS), which examined child and adolescent psychiatrists’ perspectives about PRS
(3R00HG008689-05S1), the objective of the current proposal is to use a mixed-methods design to examine:
1) challenges in the clinical use of psychiatric PRS, 2) key stakeholders’ perspectives on psychiatric PRS, and
3) gaps in legal protections against privacy violations and discrimination based on psychiatric PRS."
10929341,"Project Summary
Individuals that suffer from chronic sleep disturbances are at high risk of developing intestinal dysfunction, which can
promote acute cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases. My lab recently discovered that sleep and the gut have a
bidirectional relationship. They found that the gut is specifically and critically injured during chronic sleep loss: sleep
suppression causes the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this organ, which in turn causes oxidative stress
and premature death of animals. The lab also uncovered a gut-to-brain peptidergic signaling pathway that regulates sleep
depth. It is critical to determine how low sleep amount and poor sleep quality negatively impact the gut's physiology and
function. I will use fruit flies as a model system to study the fundamental molecular, cellular, and functional relationship
between sleep and the gut. My study will test the hypothesis that sleep loss results in an altered gut cellular composition
that promotes increased sleep depth during recovery from sleep loss. The first aim of the proposal will focus on determining
changes to gut cell composition in chronically sleep-deprived flies. I propose that sleep loss promotes intestinal stem cell
proliferation and biases daughter cells toward enteroendocrine cell fate (gut sensory and secretory cells). I will combine
immunofluorescence and fluorescent reporters to determine changes in intestinal stem cell proliferation and enteroendocrine
cell fate determination. The second aim will examine sleep quality and lifespan in flies recovering from chronic sleep loss.
I propose that changes in the gut cellular composition resulting from chronic sleep loss promote deeper sleep in flies
recovering from sleep loss as a way to compensate for insufficient sleep. I will quantify the depth of sleep in chronically
sleep-deprived flies throughout their lifespan and perform functional experiments to assess if peptides secreted by the
enteroendocrine cells are responsible for increasing the depth of sleep during recovery. I will also functionally determine
the contribution of these enteroendocrine cell-secreted peptides to the longevity of flies recovering from chronic sleep loss.
Defining how cellular changes in the gut can impact the function of this organ and its role in regulating sleep will be
fundamental for understanding the bidirectional sleep-gut relationship. More generally, this work will contribute to
understanding how sleep problems negatively affect health and suggest solutions for how many of the problems can be
reversed."

 Pancreatic cancer, most commonly diagnosed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is
amongst the top three leading causes of cancer death in the United States. These tumors are notoriously
resistant to apoptosis and richly populated by stromal and immune cells that create a therapy-resistant
microenvironment. Immunotherapy shows no benefit to patient survival, and despite advances in combinational
chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate sits around 11%. Therefore, investigating alternative forms of cell death
represents a unique strategy for targeting PDAC. Ferroptosis is a recently described form of cell death distinct
from apoptosis. It is dependent on an accumulation of lipid peroxides, generated by free labile iron, resulting in
osmotic cell lysis. Targeting ferroptosis can potently induce cell death in cultured PDAC cells. Yet, in PDAC
tumors in mice, triggering ferroptosis has a modest response with distinct cases of intrinsic and acquired
resistance currently limiting its therapeutic utility. It is therefore urgent that we address the gap between the in
vitro and in vivo responses for future clinical studies. In pursuit of this, I am taking a reductionist approach to
distill the mechanisms that regulate ferroptosis by osmotic and reductive-oxidative (redox) forces.
Mechanistically, it is known that ferroptosis requires osmotic pressure to induce cell lysis, but this fact is not
well studied within the current growing literature on ferroptosis in cancer. We hypothesize that cell death via
ferroptosis requires an imbalance of redox metabolism and sufficient osmotic pressure, to which PDAC cells
are particularly vulnerable. AIM I studies the biochemical dependencies between osmolarity and redox
metabolism. AIM II distinguishes changes in the external osmotic pressure from the cellular biochemical
adaptations, scaling up from monolayer to 3D culture techniques. Together, these aims investigate whether
ferroptotic cell death can be simplified to a balance of redox and osmotic pressure. The overall goals of this
study are to outline the boundary of these parameters and explore their application for targeting ferroptosis in
PDAC."
10974014,"Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental fungus and opportunistic pathogen of people with compromised
immune systems that causes an estimated 181,000 deaths annually. A key step in C. neoformans pathogenesis
is adaptation to the host, which is mediated by several signal transduction pathways. Translatome
reprogramming, changes in protein synthesis, is a key output of these signal transduction pathways that allows
C. neoformans to rapidly fine-tune the stress response, and defects in this process are associated with reduced
virulence. The Hog1 p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) module is one signaling module that mediates this process, though
the mechanism and effectors by which Hog1 mediates reprogramming are unknown in C. neoformans. We
propose to identify the molecular basis of Hog1 activation, and generate a high throughput characterization of
its interactome. We also found that another translatome regulatory pathway, the Gcn2 pathway, is differentially
regulated in hog1∆, and aim to evaluate the implications of this change in both translatome reprogramming as
well as virulence. Thus, we hypothesize that Hog1 mediates changes to a broad interactome via its kinase
activity, and that crosstalk with the Gcn2 pathway masks more severe defects in stress tolerance and
virulence in hog1∆. We will be testing two specific aims: (1) Determine the mechanism by which Hog1 regulates
stress responses in C. neoformans, and (2) Evaluate whether increased eIF2α phosphorylation compensates
for loss of Hog1. This project is significant as it will elucidate the mechanism of reprogramming by Hog1, will
identify effectors that could be targeted to inhibit this process, and will also examine a convergence point between
two major signaling pathways. The overall goal of this research training plan is to equip the candidate with the
necessary skills to answer these questions, and to provide them with relevant training to establish themselves
as a successful academic investigator studying fungal pathogenesis and stress adaptation. These goals will be
accomplished under the guidance of a sponsor and thesis advisory committee, with the help of training
opportunities and equipment provided by the University at Buffalo, and through professional development
opportunities at conferences and workshops."
10917172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to determine whether vaping is associated with smoking cessation in US
adults by conducting secondary analyses that leverage a novel “intensive” longitudinal national data source
with bi-weekly survey waves. Current observational evidence of the association between vaping and smoking
cessation using national longitudinal data sources (e.g., the PATH study) may provide insufficient temporal
precision due to the long inter-survey intervals (e.g., 12-month). Long intervals are problematic because many
smokers make multiple quit attempts within a year and vacillate between abstinence and smoking. In addition,
given that smokers who try e-cigarettes are more likely to have nicotine dependence, have higher quit smoking
motivation, and have sociodemographic factors that may impact cessation, selection biases are always a
threat to observational studies examining vaping-assisted smoking cessation. Also, addressing mental health
in studies examining the prospective association of vaping with smoking cessation is crucial because quit
attempters may face anxiety, depression, and other symptoms that spike within the first several weeks of
nicotine abstinence. To address this research gap, the proposed study will leverage the nationally
representative longitudinal panel survey of the Understanding America Study, including 8,306 US adults with
26 bi-weekly survey waves (April 2020 - July 2021) and nine additional monthly follow-up surveys (October
2021 - June 2022) with past-week vaping and smoking frequency measures. Specifically, this study will use the
subsample of baseline past-week smokers (n=1154, 16.6%) to assess bi-weekly associations of time-varying
nicotine vaping with time-lagged smoking abstinences two weeks later across follow-ups extending up to 110
weeks after baseline, which will enable us to avoid insufficient temporal precision in previous national studies
of vaping-assisted smoking cessation. In addition, intensive longitudinal multi-level modeling that partitions
between- and within-subject variance to address between-person confounds will be used to test our
hypothesized model of vaping-related smoking cessation, which will also mitigate selection bias. Specific
research aims are to: (1) determine short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (up to 110 weeks) associations of daily
or non-daily (vs. no) vaping with smoking cessation; (2) determine whether anxiety/depression symptoms are a
mediator and consequence of vaping-related smoking cessation; (3) examine other substance use as a time-
varying moderator of the association of vaping with smoking cessation and the anxiety/depression mediation
pathway. The proposed study will address whether vaping encourages smokers to initiate and sustain smoking
cessation in the real world, and if they experience cessation-related mental health benefits."
10888900,"Proposal Summary
 The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a vital part of the peripheral nervous system and is responsible for
the control of critical gut functions like peristalsis and gastrointestinal secretion. Abnormal development of the
ENS can lead to life threatening disorders like Hirschsprung’s disease, characterized by the absence of
innervating neurons and glia in the gut. Seminal experiments in chick have shown that two distinct neural crest
cell populations innervate the gut and give rise to the ENS: the vagal and the sacral neural crest. Although
extensive research has been done on the vagal neural crest’s contribution to the ENS, very little is known about
the role of the sacral neural crest in the post-umbilical gut. We aim to address this gap in knowledge by using
modern-day molecular biology techniques to gain granular understanding of sacral neural crest-
derivatives in the post-umbilical gut, characterize their unique gene signatures, and determine the
requirement of sacral-specific transcriptional regulators in ENS development. We hypothesize that the
sacral neural crest contributes to unique derivatives within the post-umbilical gut, distinct from vagal-derived
structures, and that these derived-cells are under the regulation of a novel gene regulatory scheme. Ultimately,
this work will address a lack of understanding of the sacral neural crest in ENS development and shed light on
the etiology of ENS-derived congenital disorders.
Aim 1: Retroviral mediated lineage analysis of the chick sacral neural crest: Previous work in quail-chick
chimeras had multiple disadvantages like traumatic surgery and cross-species artifacts. Here we will implement
our technique of replication incompetent avian (RIA) retroviruses for comparative cell lineage analysis of vagal
and sacral-derived cells in the post-umbilical gut, visualize interactions between the two populations, and perform
clonal analysis of sacral neural crest cells.
Aim 2: Transcriptional profiling of sacral neural crest-derived cells in the post-umbilical gut: In order to
identify the gene signature of sacral-derived structures of the ENS and regulators of their differentiation, we
propose single cell RNA sequencing of sacral neural crest derivatives across multiple time points to characterize
the transcriptional profile of sacral neural crest entry into the gut and neuronal differentiation. Upon identification
of transcriptional regulators, we will perform conditional loss-of-function analysis to examine their role in
regulating the sacral neural crest’s neuronal differentiation."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients develop fatal paralysis as a result of progressive motor neuron loss
in the brain and spinal cord. There are more than 5,000 new cases of ALS per year in the United States, with
typical age of onset between 40 and 70 years of age. While SOD1 is a cytoplasmic protein, misfolded SOD1 can
be secreted and form extracellular oligomers and aggregates. Mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 (mSOD1)
result in misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 and are found in a subset of familial ALS cases. However,
misfolded SOD1 has also been identified in spinal cord samples from many sporadic cases of ALS. Regulatory
T cells (Tregs) have tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory functions and are being pursued as cell-based
therapeutics to block auto-inflammatory immune cells. Higher numbers of Tregs (CD4+CD25hiCD127lo) in ALS
patients are associated with a slower disease progression. We have developed novel chimeric antigen receptors
(CARs) that recognize aggregated SOD1 and trigger Treg function. In this manner, we aim to provide a large
number of Tregs that are specific for a disease-associated protein and will become activated at the site of
misfolded, aggregated SOD1. We have further enhanced the activity of CAR Tregs by engineering them to
produce BNDF, a key neuronal survival factor. We have developed a novel mouse model for ALS by breeding
the G93A SOD1 transgene onto the NSG mouse background to create mSOD1-NSG mice. These mice allow
the engraftment of human cells and they develop a progressive disease resulting in inflammation in the spinal
cord and limb paralysis that mimic findings in ALS. The aim of this project is to perform IND-enabling studies
required for translation of this therapy into the clinic."

Despite a growing demand for health care workers and evidence that a diverse health workforce is vital for
public wellbeing, most young people lack awareness of health career options and how to pursue them. Narrow
career exposure, insufficient advising, lack of encouragement to pursue STEM subjects, and lack of concordant
mentors are significant barriers for Black and Latino/x youth—two groups consistently under-represented
across health professions. This project will help these adolescents to overcome barriers and develop positive
health identities so they are more confident in their ability to undertake challenging health career pathways and
to make informed health decisions. To do so, a joint team from Hats & Ladders, Inc., Mentoring in Medicine,
the University of Texas at Austin School of Human Ecology, CareerVillage and Applied Curiosity Research will
design, develop, and test Hats & Ladders for Health: Data-driven Decision-Making for Future Health Citizens
and Professionals (HLH). This blended digital experience targets 9th- and 10th-grade students and educators in
general career and health education programs, and will consist of a digital gamified app, project-based
activities, live health career panels, near-peer mentoring sessions, and a robust instructional toolkit with training
videos, progress reports, lessons and other educator supports for providing accurate, actionable student
feedback. The overall outcomes of HLH’s data-driven, inquiry-based, and inclusive intervention could have
broad reaching public health impact, and are to (1) increase students’ confidence in their ability to pursue
challenging health career pathways and solve problems along the way; (2) increase their ability to find,
understand, and use information to make health-related decisions; and, (3) develop educators’ capacity to
provide quality health career guidance and health literacy instruction. Designed to strengthen our organization’s
impact on high school youth, our intervention will bring a novel set of interactions––as requested by our
existing users––and use them to deepen inquiry-based learning related to health careers and literacy during the
critical stage of early high school.
In Phase I, the H&L R&D team will collect, analyze and input data from concordant healthcare professionals
into a new health career database that we will integrate into the HLH app. To gather the data, we will develop,
and test for relevance, an online survey targeting 500 racially and professionally diverse respondents through
CareerVillage’s community of 3,000 health professionals (52% BIPOC) and 1,500+ Mentoring in Medicine
volunteers. A subset of 25-30 survey respondents will participate in video interviews. Survey data and video
snippets will be tagged with metadata and inputted into the database enabling us to recommend authentic and
relevant health content to students with shared demographic and career attributes. We will test usability and
feasibility of app designs and prototypes with students in small groups or dyads, and both app and dashboard
components with educators using in-depth interviews. We will also adapt two student outcome measures, the
Assessment of Adolescent Health Literacy and the Career Decision-Making Self Efficacy Scale, using expert
reviews and cognitive interviews with students, and then test the measures with a sample of 400 students. All
participants will be recruited from NYC Department of Youth and Community Development’s network of 180+
community-based organizations that work with NYC high schools. In Phase II, we will iterate and develop a
near final product to pilot test in five NYC classrooms to further explore the usability, feasibility, and support
from educators. Following the pilot test, in year two of Phase II we will implement a mixed-methods
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the completed HLH innovation to impact students’
career efficacy and health literacy. The RCT, led by the External Evaluation team at Applied Curiosity
Research, will help us determine the overall effectiveness of HLH to increase students’ health career efficacy
and health literacy."

Closed-loop stimulation is key to the study and treatment of neurological disorders. However, largely due to
current wireless power demands, stimulation systems are restricted to wired connections, which impact
natural behavior, induce motion artifacts, and limit complexity of study design. While a few wireless recording-
only systems have been developed, the power demands of these devices prohibit the addition of wireless
electrical stimulation while staying within size and weight limitations for smaller animal models. These
limitations are roadblocks to the next phase of neuroscience research and clinical development.
In this Phase I, 1.5 year, STTR project, Spike Neuro is partnering with Duke University to develop a novel low
power hybrid backscatter radio frequency system to enable the commercialization of a series of wireless
recording and electrical stimulation headstages for small and large animal electrophysiology research. This
innovative wireless technology shifts the high-power demand features out of the headworn components to the
base station, significantly reducing battery size and weight enabling the addition of the electrical stimulation
components and allowing for more flexibility in recording only experiments.
This development work will result in two headstage options for small animals with 5 and 16 channels of recording
and 2 channels of electrical stimulation and two slightly larger systems for 32 and 64 channels of recording with
8 channels of electrical stimulation. Aim 1 focuses on the development of the 5 and 16 channel systems and the
electrical stimulation integration. Aim 2 will build upon the efforts in Aim 1 to expand the system to up to 64
channels with 8 channels of electrical stimulation. Both aims will also include hardware and software integration
with the Spike Neuro data acquisition system. Aim 3 will conclude with benchtop and in vivo validation of our
system to demonstrate successfully achieving key features needed for a commercial wireless recording and
stimulation headstage.
This proposal brings together a strong team of experts in wireless technology, electrophysiology, and
commercialization to develop a wireless system that meets the growing needs of the neuroscience community.
The Phase I work will result in a multiple headstage options ready for commercialization while informing
continued Phase II development. In our future work, we will continue to scale our system to increase channel
count and reduce the latency of the closed-loop electrical stimulation."
10840985,"Project Summary
Epilepsy, a disorder of the brain manifested by seizures, is the fourth most prevalent neurological disease,
affecting over 50 million people worldwide, or about 1 out of 150 individuals on average. The frequency of
epilepsy is distributed unevenly, however, with the vast majority of cases occurring in less developed regions of
the world. The likely explanation for this distribution is that one third of all epilepsy cases are due to
neurocysticercosis, known to be the most common parasitic infection of the nervous system. Neurocysticercosis
is caused by the presence of larval cysts of Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, in the brain, which can cause
seizures and illness ranging from mild to fatal depending on their location, number and viability. In contrast to
idiopathic epilepsy, a complex disease which can be difficult to treat and resistant to cure, neurocysticercosis
can be treated and in many cases cured with inexpensive and available anti-helminthic drugs. Distinguishing
whether the cause of seizures is idiopathic epilepsy or neurocysticercosis is thus a critical part of the diagnostic
workup and essential to determine the appropriate course of treatment for patients. The established procedures
for diagnosing epilepsy comprise electroencephalography and imaging via MRI, but these sophisticated tools
are of limited availability in the less developed world where neurocysticercosis is most frequent. On the other
hand, neurocysticercosis can be diagnosed with a serological test that detects antibodies to T. solium cysts. The
gold standard serological test, the Enzyme Immunotransfer Blot (EITB) developed at CDC, is a laboratory-based
test, however, it is not widely available and requires significant training to carry out. Thus there is a critical need
for a rapid, commercially available point-of-care test for neurocysticercosis that can be used to test patients with
seizures, in order to identify those with the parasitic infection so that they can be treated effectively. Development
of such a test has been identified as an urgent priority by the World Health Organization.
In the Phase I project, we utilized recombinant and synthetic T. solium antigens corresponding to those used in
the EITB to develop a prototype lateral flow, point-of-care serological test for neurocysticercosis aimed at
meeting the criteria in the World Health Organization’s Target Product Profile. These antigens have shown high
sensitivity and specificity in prior studies, and in combination further increase the sensitivity for detection of single
viable cysts, the most challenging disease manifestation. In Phase II, the lateral flow neurocysticercosis test will
be evaluated in prospective studies on neurological patients with symptoms suggestive of neurocysticercosis,
and in retrospective studies on well-characterized sera from neurocysticercosis patients confirmed by EITB or
clinical diagnosis, and for specificity on healthy controls and other disease state sera. Phase II will support
complete development to commercial stage, clinical evaluation and preparation for CE mark and FDA
submission of the neurocysticercosis point-of-care test."
10815737,"Hookworm infection, caused by Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum is
a leading cause of malnutrition and stunted growth in poor communities across sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and
parts of South America. Recent studies have revealed the re-emergence of this parasite in the USA. The burden
of hookworm infection is generally associated with chronic illness rather than mortality in the host. Anemia,
stunted development, and intellectual and cognitive deficiencies are among the most serious outcomes of
persistent hookworm infections in children and women of reproductive age. In addition, chronic low-intensity
hookworm infection reduces vaccine efficacy and exacerbates other globally relevant infectious diseases such
as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, which are co-endemic with hookworm. Current strategies to control hookworm
rely primarily on the Mass Drug Administration of anthelminthic drugs. However, recent evidence calls into
question the long-term effectiveness of this approach to control and eliminate hookworm in endemic populations,
raising concern about the emergence of drug resistance. The current method to screen for STH infections is
microscopic demonstration and quantification of eggs in the stool. For screening, WHO considers the Kato-Katz
thick smear as a benchmark for diagnosing hookworm infection. This method, however, has poor sensitivity.
Processing multiple smears per sample or examining multiple samples over consecutive days can increase the
sensitivity of the Kato-Katz thick smear. While screening multiple samples improves sensitivity, it presents
considerable logistical and financial challenges and is not practical in all settings. To address this, WHO recently
published a Target Product Profile for soil-transmitted helminths to develop low-cost screening tools that meet
demands, currently not met by the Kato-Katz thick smear. To address this need, in Phase I we propose the
development of an ELISA to screen for human IgG against hookworm infection. In collaboration with Yale
University, we will perform a combination of in-silico and in-vitro studies, to help characterize biomarkers of
interest (Aim 1), which will be used in the development of an ELISA (Aim 2). We will then evaluate assay
performance (Aim 2) using well-characterized cohorts of serum samples. Our goal is to achieve sensitivity and
specificity as outlined in the TPP, with further improvement in Phase II. The proposed commercial ELISA kit will
allow for the replacement of the existing, relatively insensitive microscopic tools, to integrate as part of monitoring
and evaluation programs for hookworm infection around the world. This will directly impact future global policy
and strategy for the control of hookworm infection."
10929984,"CORE 1: COMPUTATIONAL - PROJECT SUMMARY
Core 1 aims to address the important task of developing clinical and dosimetry data storage at the time of
planning, delivery and follow up of patient treatments. Traditionally, data is typically not recorded in a well-
structured and standardized way. Examples include the use of inconsistent structure names; multiple treatment
plans and lack of clarity as to which plan(s) were actually used to treat vs. used simply during the plan
optimization; and incomplete data, for instance missing contours of an organ at risk to be studied. For reliable
correlative studies, it is essential that a curation process removes such deficiencies. Such tasks are often
attempted manually. We propose to supplement manual processes with automated techniques to identify
specific problems and rectify them automatically where possible or flag them for manual intervention.
While large sets of treatment planning, clinical outcomes and research related data sets have already been
produced, access to the data is often obstructed by technical problems mentioned above and also by problems
arising from legal issues of inter-institutional data sharing and general data safety issues. In addition, data
captured at different institutions may have different elements and formats that need to be reconciled. Many
software and infrastructure solutions are already available to overcome such hurdles, but significant effort will
be necessary to implement and integrate them into an infrastructure and to maintain these to ensure efficient
and safe data management. Novel tools will have to be developed, tested and implemented, for inter-
institutional data exchange and management.
In addition to the curation of already accumulated data, accurate dose and LET distributions are necessary for
the biological studies proposed in the projects. These experiments may be prospectively designed using Monte
Carlo simulations in order to actively explore the dependence of biological and immunomodulatory effects on
both dose and LET."

TRANSLATIONAL BIOSPECIMEN AND IMAGING BIOMARKER CORE
SUMMARY
The Translational Biospecimen and Imaging Biomarker Core Component (Core 2) is a unique, centralized
resource to support biospecimen and imaging data collection from radiation-treated patients and will provide
sample collection, processing, and sharing. These activities will be carried out for patients enrolled in clinical
trials of experimental radiotherapy at the two partnering sites using standardized protocols and procedures. This
core will 1) obtain voluntary, informed consent from oncology patients who will undergo or be evaluated for
radiation therapy to allow for: (i) identification, storage, and use of patients’ blood, tissue, and clinical information
for research purposes, (ii) linkage of clinical information to results from research performed on biospecimens in
cooperation with core 1, (iii) sharing and publication of de-identified data generated from scientific study; 2)
provide a comprehensive, secure and standardized process for collecting, annotating and storing imaging
biomarkers and biological specimens from patients who have undergone, will undergo or be evaluated for
radiotherapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Centers (UTMDACC); and 3) facilitate the conduct of basic and translational research to further personalize
therapy using imaging and blood biomarkers collected during the course of clinical care together with clinical
data. Core 2 will support innovative approaches in the projects, such as multiplexed protein analyses and
immunophenotyping and new imaging methods. The Core will facilitate translational biomarker studies based on
understanding of intrinsic tumor biology and lymphocyte alterations following proton versus photon radiotherapy,
which remains largely uncharacterized in the field of particle therapy. Moreover, supporting Project 1, the use
of imaging biomarkers to gain information on the effects of proton therapy on normal tissues as a function of
both dose and LET is highly innovative, as is the development of AI-based autosegmentation algorithms for MRI
and XNAT image analysis pipeline, including the voxel-based analysis of functional imaging for liver, central
nervous system and lung. Core 2’s support will enable novel understanding of the interaction of the immune
system with proton versus photon radiotherapy in Project 2. Project 3 will rely on Core 2 to provide human
tissue specimen for the creation of PDX models and a catalogue of cell lines available for preclinical research
across institutions, thereby harnessing the strengths of MGH and UTMDACC. The strength of Core 2 is that it
leverages the unique patient population and capabilities at the two Cancer Centers. The MGH site will contribute
20 years of expertise in circulating biomarker studies in over 40 clinical trials, while the UTMDACC site will
provide extensive experience in leading nationwide multicenter collaborative proton versus photon therapy
clinical and translational research that includes standardized procedures of patient enrollment, patient consent,
and biospecimen collections. Both sites will also provide superb imaging biomarker study capabilities and the
core will facilitate transfer of these datasets between the two centers."
10925403,"Project 2: SIRT1 as a Therapeutic Target in Endometriosis
ABSTRACT
Progesterone resistance is now recognized as a key element in the pathophysiology of endometriosis, though
its underlying mechanism is not well understood. Using mouse and non-human primate models, as well as
human tissues, we have developed a hypothesis surrounding the histone deacetylase Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1),
which appears to play a critical role in progesterone resistance of endometriosis. Triggered by
inflammation, SIRT1 orchestrates progesterone resistance that appears to have a pathophysiological role during
endometriosis-related infertility in the mouse. Due to profound and chronic inflammation elicited by
endometriosis, SIRT1 is overexpressed during all cycle stages in women with endometriosis. By promoting
progesterone resistance, endometriosis becomes self-sustaining and progressive, with progesterone resistance
promoting estrogen action and curtailing the antagonistic effects of progestins. Understanding these principles
provides unique testable hypotheses for both the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis in a preclinical mouse
model of endometriosis. In Project 2, we propose synergistic studies that complement the overlying goal of this
P01 to develop both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to endometriosis. In two specific aims we will use
highly innovative engineered mouse models, including Sirt1 overexpression and endometriosis models with
bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters for non-invasive imaging; integrated bioinformatic analysis to
investigate the role of SIRT1 in the progesterone resistance of endometriosis; and preclinical assessment of a
new therapeutic approach for endometriosis using an FDA-approved drug for Huntington’s disease. In Aim 1 we
will determine the essential nature of progesterone resistance and endometriosis progression. We will examine
structural, molecular, and inflammatory features of endometriosis and define the specific transcriptomic and
epigenetic changes involved in progesterone resistance and infertility that depend on SIRT1 overexpression.
These progesterone resistance signatures will be compared in both the mouse and human endometrium. In Aim
2 we will further investigate and explore the very real and exciting possibility that a specific SIRT1 inhibitor (EX-
529; selisistat), given at the proper dose and time, can reverse progesterone resistance and infertility and treat
lesion ontogeny and progression in our mouse endometriosis model. These studies will serve to identify new
mechanistic targets and set the stage for human trials of specific SIRT1 inhibitors that could dramatically
improve therapeutic options for women with this common and devastating disease."
10925404,"Project 3: Imaging and treatment of endometriosis in nonhuman primates
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this P01 Center is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis
in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease in women. Endometriosis is a painful disorder of
women and nonhuman primates (NHPs) in which endometrium-like tissues form estrogen-dependent lesions
outside the uterus. There is currently no cure; all approved therapies target estrogen (E2) action to manage
symptoms, which is of limited use in reproductive-age women due to unwanted side effects. Macaques provide
excellent preclinical models for testing novel therapies that have not been fully vetted for clinical trials. However,
no reliable methods exist to detect early-stage disease in either women or monkeys, and improved diagnostic
approaches are needed to evaluate new therapies. Our premise is that endometriotic cell metabolism is a novel
target for improved therapies for the disease. This premise emanates, in part, from studies that have revealed
that consumption of an obesogenic ""western-style"" diet (WSD) combined with testosterone (T) treatment
increases the rate and severity of endometriosis in macaques. Furthermore, a key feature of endometriotic
lesions is the presentation of chronic peritoneal inflammation. Endometrial Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported
as a biomarker of endometriosis. SIRT 1 mediates endometrial progesterone resistance associated with
endometriosis-induced infertility. Moreover, SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase enzyme that functions as a metabolic
sensor, regulating mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysis. Increased understanding of the role of SIRT1
and other inflammatory and metabolic markers may help to identify more reliable methods of diagnosis and
treatment of endometriosis. Accordingly, in Specific Aim 1, we will refine positron emission tomography-
computed tomography (PET-CT) with estrogen and progesterone receptor-specific tracers. We will monitor
endometriotic lesion size and abundance in macaques by PET-CT and ultrasound and compare the results with
a laparoscopic examination, which is currently the ""gold standard"" for staging the disease. In Specific Aim 2,
we will evaluate cellular mediators of inflammation, progesterone resistance, and metabolic response in serum,
peritoneal fluid, endometrium, and endometrial lesions; and quantify immune cell infiltration in endometriotic
lesions from macaques. We will correlate these measures with the lesion burden detected by PET-CT and
laparoscopy. In Specific Aim 3, we will use the macaque endometriosis model to test the effect of inhibitors
against SIRT1 (Selisistat; EX-527) and the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (dichloroacetate; DCA).
During each aim, macaque samples will be archived for future study, and relevant findings will be used to inform
Project 1 (Dr. Young, PI; involving PET/MRI imaging and inflammation of the disease in women) and Project 2
(Dr. Jeong, PI; involving the role of SIRT1 in mediating progesterone resistance). This work is highly
complementary to the other proposed projects and will support our long-term goal of advancing novel therapies
for this debilitating disease in women."
10925406,"Comparative Genomics And Bioinformatics Core
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Comparative Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB) Core will provide state-of-the-art comparative genomic
and bioinformatic analyses, and data warehousing to support the overarching goal of the P01 to improve our
understanding of endometriosis disease pathophysiology in women and provide a foundation for improving
treatment. The scientific premise that evolutionarily conserved genomic features inform function is well-
established. An innovative aspect of the Core is the use of comparative genomics in humans, monkeys and
mice, including transcriptomics and epigenomics, to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways central to
endometriosis pathophysiology. The CGB Core has 4 Specific Aims to support the overall goals of the P01: 1)
Identify transcriptional pathways and networks associated with disease status in women (Projects 1&2), mice
(Project 2), and rhesus macaques (Project 3); 2) Integrate transcriptome data with epigenome (chromatin) and
metabolome data generated in the Projects to prioritize pathways and causal networks most likely to have
regulatory roles in disease status; 3) Identify disease-associated genes, pathways, and causal networks that are
conserved among the three species; and 4) Provide a data warehouse for organizing and sharing data generated
in the CGB Core and the Projects, and comply with NIH data sharing requirements. The Core Leader Dr. Cox
has extensive comparative genomic expertise that includes studies with marsupials, rodents, nonhuman
primates, and humans. All methodologies, analysis tools, and data management practices proposed for the Core
are routinely used and well-established in the Core Leader’s laboratory, supporting success of the CGB Core to
achieve these aims. Successful completion of these aims will reveal molecular pathways and networks
associated with disease status for each species and, by identifying those conserved among humans, mice and
rhesus, will nominate regulators that are central to the disease process. Achieving these goals will contribute to
a better understanding of the disease process which will inform diagnosis and treatment for long-lasting
improvement in the lives of women suffering from endometriosis."
10906117,"Project Abstract
The specific goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize methods for quantitative pre-clinical PET imaging
for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We will leverage an
existing co-clinical trial using our genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinoma to
develop, test and implement the methods and populate a web-accessible research resource. This web-
accessible research resource will in turn leverage recent developments in quantitative cancer imaging
informatics using the industry-standard DICOM format. In response to PAR-18-841 there are four components
to our proposal: (1) appropriate models, (2) a co-clinical trial including a therapeutic goal, (3) quantitative
preclinical and clinical PET imaging, and (4) an innovative quantitative cancer imaging informatics platform.
Our longer term goal is to improve outcomes for NSCLC patients, as lung cancer is still the leading cause of
cancer deaths worldwide. Although ICI therapy has been a tremendous clinical benefit for some NSCLC
patients, only ~20% of NSCLC patients respond to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. Using PET co-clinical imaging to
improve ICI therapies for NSCLC is challenged by a lack of suitable informatics methods to capture and track
necessary meta-information, appropriate response criteria for preclinical imaging, which in turn is a
consequence in part of the lack of quantitative preclinical PET imaging methods that are linked to quantitative
clinical PET imaging methods. We will address these challenges with three Specific Aims:
1, Develop and optimize quantitative preclinical quantitative imaging methods and protocols. These methods
will involve novel long-lived phantoms that can cross-calibrate multiple preclinical and clinical PET scanners.
This will be tested with partner members of the Co-Clinical Imaging Research Resources Program.
2. Implement the optimized methods in our co-clinical trial of ICI treatment of NSCLC with a GEMM lung
adenocarcinoma model and a GEMM model lung squamous cell carcinoma. From this we will evaluate how the
information gleaned from the pre-clinical and clinical studies can be used to inform future pre-clinical studies in
terms of optimized mouse imaging protocols and response criteria.
3. Share data and resources on co-clinical trials using quantitative PET imaging using a web-accessible open
science approach (open source + open data) by extending the DICOM standard for pre-clinical small animal
imaging with DICOM-compliant structures that provide necessary quantitative meta-data.
These methods and resources developed during this project will be distributed to accelerate the development
of needed effective cancer therapies by improving the utility of early-phase oncology trials using co-clinical
studies with PET imaging. In addition, we will determine, and potentially improve, the utility of PET imaging as
a biomarker for early assessment of response in co-clinical immunotherapy studies by using an appropriate
mouse model."
10919190,"In the United States, there are about 800,000 people per year suffering a cerebral stroke, and the associated
cost is about $33 billion per year. Stroke is also a leading cause of disability, and most stroke survivors exhibit
persistent motor impairments despite extensive rehabilitation after the stroke. As a result, independent living
and return to the work force is limited in a majority of stroke survivors. A majority of stroke survivors exhibit
upper and lower limb motor impairments, ranging from incapability of reaching and grasping objects to limited
ambulation. Despite extensive rehabilitation therapy in the clinic, these persistent impairments still severely
limit independent living, partly because the training effect in the clinical setting is not effectively transferred
to activities of daily living (ADL). Furthermore, the inability to perform essential daily functions at the chronic
stage can further exacerbate the impairment, due to limb disuse and/or maladaptation of the neuromuscular
system. We hypothesize that a continuous rehabilitation training that is integrated into community living (e.g.,
at home, in the shopping mall, or at the park) can capitalize the clinic rehabilitation effect and enhance daily
functions of stroke survivors.
The goal of this project is to develop a personalized community-based rehabilitation sensing system to
improve daily functions of these individuals. Thus, our proposal directly addresses the NICHD scientific
research theme 5: Advancing Safe and Effective Therapeutics and Devices for People with Disabilities. We
seek a truly wearable system that is comfortable to wear, low power in operation, and friendly to use (e.g.,
via smartphones). The system will include three essential components: a nanomaterial-enabled multimodal
wearable sensor network to monitor arm and leg functional activities; a low-power data acquisition,
processing, and transmission protocol; and a smart phone APP to communicate training outcomes to the
users and clinicians via internet and receive feedback from them. Specifically, we propose the following aims.
Aim 1: To develop truly wearable sensor network that can monitor the physical activities involving the affected
and contralateral limbs of stroke survivors. Aim 2: To integrate the multi-modality sensing network into a
coherent system and efficiently communicate the sensor data. Aim 3: To extract prominent features from the
acquired motor activity information and provide personalized community rehabilitation guidance. Aim 4: To
evaluate the system performance and clinical feasibility.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The outcome of the proposed research could transform personalized rehabilitation of stroke survivors with a
truly wearable system for continuous rehabilitation at various community settings, which could enable tele-
rehabilitation, and maximize functional recovery of stroke survivors. Wearable physical activity tracking
promises a paradigm shift for healthcare and wellbeing. The user-friendly nature of our system can also
facilitate wide applications in other clinical populations with motor impairment."
10914016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Researchers and health practitioners use data from federal health surveys, electronic health records (EHRs),
and research studies to monitor the health of sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Compared to
non-SGM populations, SGM populations are disproportionately affected by poor health, including disparities in
alcohol use, substance use, and mental illness. Substantial prior work has supported the minority stress
framework to contextualize SGM health disparities; stressors related to discrimination and victimization tied to
SGM status are strongly associated with disparities. The ability to accurately identify such disparities and
potential causal pathways is vital to ensure that public health and health care research, policy, and practice are
appropriately equipped to address the health needs of marginalized populations such as SGM individuals. This
is particularly true in the case of alcohol, which remains one of the most commonly used and abused drugs
nationwide, particularly among both adolescent and adult SGM. However, measurement of demographic
characteristics associated with SGM identity and stigmatization – e.g., sex, sexual orientation, and gender
identity (SSOGI) – remains poorly defined and inconsistently used across health research and practice
settings. For example, despite evident limitations, most studies, providers, and national surveys continue to
use a binary framework (male vs. female) to assess sex assigned at birth. This approach fails to capture a
substantial population of intersex individuals (estimated prevalence of 1-2 per 1,000 live births). Further, most
surveys continue to use the non-recommended practice of conflating sex and gender identity by asking about
only one of these constructs, thereby failing to appropriately identify or characterize transgender, non-binary,
and gender nonconforming individuals. While a growing number of surveys ask about sexual orientation, they
frequently do not account for its multidimensional nature: many items conflate identity (e.g., gay, bisexual), with
behavior (e.g., sex with only same-sex partners) and attraction (e.g., only attracted to male-presenting
individuals). This is especially concerning as research has shown that a substantial number of individuals
would only be classified as a sexual minority based on one category, but not another (e.g., a person who
identifies as heterosexual but has sex with same-sex partners). Furthermore, current measures often are not
comprehensive, exclude understudied or emerging orientations (e.g., asexual, pansexual, queer), lack the
ability to select multiple options, and fail to account for changes in identity over time. Without comprehensive,
validated measures to assess SSOGI, the ability to understand the magnitude of SGM disparities or how best
to intervene to promote SGM health equity is limited. Therefore, it is vital to develop standardized, flexible
measures for use across diverse demographics and regions. This project will address these gaps through
iterative, community-engaged development of new SSOGI measures, and will assess the effectiveness of new
vs. prior measures to characterize disparities in alcohol use, substance use, and mental health among SGM."
10695370,"A complete understanding of disease is not possible without being conceptually grounded by etiology. Many
findings are consistent with the possibility that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an etiology for Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE), but none that establish EBV as an original cause of SLE. We propose to extend our
continuing work using sera collected over time from active duty military, available through the Department of
Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR), and apply a Matched Etiologic Exposure Window (MEEW) strategy to
test whether EBV is, indeed, an etiology of SLE. The exposure window is defined from the moment that the first
serum is collected to the time that the serum is collected containing the earliest SLE-specific evidence of an SLE
pathologic process. During the exposure window, under the expectation that pre-disease cases and matched
controls are indistinguishable, variables that do not affect SLE etiology will follow the null expectation of
equivalence in the Cases and Matched-Controls. We will test whether EBV infection and anti-EBNA1 antibodies
deviate from the expected null distribution. If the associations are obtained and cannot be alternatively explained,
by error, reverse causation, confounding, or pleiotropy, then we conclude that the exposure showing association
is probably a causal etiology. This approach has been recently used to establish that EBV is a cause of Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) with Hazard Ratio (HR)=32, p<0.0001, in the absence of any evident alternative explanation.
 We have had much experience working with sera and data from the DoDSR, publishing 11 DoDSR papers
describing the sequence of events that occur before the SLE is apparent. This experience allows us to make
reliable estimates of the needed sample size and establishes technical competence with the needed assays and
analyses. To obtain an adequate sample size we will include Veterans seeking healthcare in the US Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) who had their first diagnosis of SLE in the VA soon after DoD service separation.
 We will test the hypothesis that EBV causes SLE using the MEEW approach. We will ascertain alleged SLE
cases, identify those satisfying SLE classification criteria, and test their first DoDSR serum samples for the EBV
infection and anti-EBNA1 antibodies. Our published data are consistent with anti-EBNA1 antibodies being the
primordial precursor from which SLE-specific autoantibodies develop via molecular mimicry mechanisms.
Experiment 1 will test whether EBV-infected and anti-EBNA1 negative (EBV+/aEBNA1−) Cases develop anti-
EBNA1 more frequently in the exposure window than do Matched-Controls who are also EBV+/aEBNA1− and
matched on age, ancestry, sex, time of service, serum samples available, and, for VA-ascertained SLE cases,
time of first seeking VA care. The relationship of the appearance of anti-EBNA1 in relation to the appearance of
SLE-specific antibodies will define the exposure using conditional logistic regression for matched cases and
controls. Experiment 2 will then perform a MEEW analysis on Cases and Matched-Controls who have not been
infected by EBV using serology (EBV−) in their first, earliest DoDSR serum sample to determine whether EBV
infection (EBV+) occurs more frequently in Cases than in Matched-Controls during the exposure window.
Experiments 3 will test pleiotropy. Expt. 3.A. will test the cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody serology transition
from the absence of anti-CMV (CMV−) to its presence (CMV+) using MEEW. Expt. 3.B. will compare cases to
controls at the point that SLE-specific autoantibodies first appear using a phage display library to evaluate the
relative antibody responses >400 viruses. If our ideas are correct, then the results will provide strong inference
that EBV and anti-EBNA1 are etiologic causes of SLE without evidence supporting an alternate explanation. The
mechanisms causing SLE via EBV would then become the focus of future academic and commercial research,
resulting in better diagnostics, therapeutics and management, and, even, preventive measures, eliminating risk
of SLE (e.g., a successful anti-EBV vaccine) or that abort the disease process in its nascent form, all of which
would benefit the next 30,000 active-duty military and Veterans who otherwise will be on a path to develop SLE."
10840333,"Project Summary / Abstract
Reia is working to address a prevalent gynecological condition, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), which
affects more than 50% of women over the age of 50. POP occurs when the pelvic floor connective
tissue and muscles weaken, allowing the uterus or vaginal walls to descend. In extreme cases, the
uterus descends through the opening of the vagina and hangs outside of the body. POP can be treated
non-surgically with a pessary that is inserted into the vagina and acts as a shelf to support the
descending organs. Commonly used pessaries have a fixed and rigid design, making them difficult or
impossible for patients to remove and insert independently. Reia has developed an innovative
collapsible pessary to reduce pain and discomfort associated with pessary insertion and removal.
During Phase II, the pessary successfully passed all FDA required mechanical, microbiological, and
biocompatibility tests. Reia has evaluated its pessary in n=50 current pessary users between its early
feasibility and feasibility trials. Subjects reported increased comfort during insertion and removal when
using Reia’s pessary compared to their current pessaries and their prolapse was effectively supported.
During Phase IIB, Reia will (1) prepare and submit a 510(k) clearance application to the FDA. Reia will
achieve this aim by professionally manufacturing and testing fitting pessaries, performing packaging,
shipping, and distribution testing, and compiling the 510(k) application. Reia will (2) modify and optimize
a pessary applicator, which was designed during Phase II to increase access to self-management. To
achieve this aim, Reia will professionally manufacture a ß-prototype with medical grade materials,
perform benchtop mechanical, biocompatibility, and cleaning validation testing, and assemble a 510(k)
application. Reia will (3) conduct a clinical trial comparing success of home-management between
Reia’s pessary system (pessary and applicator) and the standard of care in pessary-naïve patients.
Defined evaluation criteria have been established to measure progress and success.
Reia’s founding team is comprised of a urogynecologist with 25 years of experience fitting pessaries
and treating POP and a 3-person, female executive management team with combined experience in
product development, operational manufacturing and production practices, and IP advisory.
Additionally, an advisory board contributes expertise in urogynecology, commercialization of medical
devices, and successful completion of numerous NIH grant funded projects. Reia has strategically
aligned with manufacturing facilities, testing laboratories, and regulatory consultants to gain access to
necessary equipment, resources, and guidance to successfully complete this project.
Reia is committed to optimizing its pessary system for clinical use and manufacture to bring to market
the first-ever pessary specifically designed to address women’s needs."

PLWDs, which have associated health disparities. These health disparities result in AA PLWDs experiencing
greater morbidity and worse quality of life. There are no structured programs specifically aimed at guiding AA
parent-adult daughter dementia dyads' and families' formal care decision-making processes for AA PLWDs,
and AA caregivers tend to exhaust informal caregiving sources before using formal care. My preliminary
research focused on AA dementia dyads (i.e., AA PLWDs and their AA caregivers) found that AA non-spouse
(primarily adult daughters) dementia dyads both experienced worse quality of life than both members of AA
spouse caregiver dementia dyads, supporting our focus on AA adult daughter caregivers. In addition, AA
caregivers identified a lack of cultural tailoring of formal care as a barrier for use by AA PLWDs and desired
more family involvement when making formal care decisions for AA PLWDs. Aligned with the National Institute
of Aging's Behavioral and Social Science high-priority dementia caregiver research, the K23 award aims are
to: 1) examine the influences (i.e., behavioral, sociocultural, and environmental) on the formal care decision-
making process and the quality of life of AA PLWDs and their AA adult daughter caregivers, 2) describe the
decision-making processes of members of AA parent-adult daughter dementia dyads that affect current and
future formal care use for AA PLWDs and explore how these processes influence the quality of life of both
members of these dyads, and 3) design and test the feasibility of a prototype intervention for AA parent-adult
daughter dementia dyads and families to enable them to develop tailored strategies to support the formal care
decision-making process for AA PLWDs. Building on my training as a clinician with expertise in ADRD
caregiving, I will: 1) develop expertise in multidisciplinary decision-making models that can be adapted to
conduct culturally-relevant research within AA dementia dyads and families, 2) acquire skills in analyzing
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods dyadic data for intervention development, and 3) obtain expertise
using intervention mapping and design thinking for the development, implementation, and evaluation of
intervention studies. I have assembled an excellent team of mentors (Drs. Hepburn, Powell, and Lyons) and
consultants (Drs. Whitlatch, Dunbar, Higgins, and Yeager). The K23 award will provide me with the necessary
foundation to become an independent nurse scientist dedicated to improving the quality of life of AA dementia
dyads and families, which ideally aligns with NIA's mission to “understand health disparities and develop
strategies to improve the health status of older adults in diverse populations.”"
10897810,"Project Summary/Abstract
Brain function requires coordinated activation of specific networks engaged in systems that process
information in localised and distributed manners. In order to develop such specific networks, the brain
engages groups of neurons that fire together in ensembles that can be observed with calcium imaging.
Patterns of spontaneous activity in the cerebral cortex are thought to enable the formation of circuits
specialised for processing different types of sensory information. How the brain first switches on activity across
areas is unknown. I propose to investigate exactly how and when in fetal life these patterns first occur in vivo,
what regulates their development, and how they shape neural circuits and later brain function. A major barrier
to addressing this question has been that patterns of activity such as patchwork-type activity in S1 and
travelling waves in V1 are present at birth in rodents making it difficult to study this question in vivo as the
brain apparently switches on before birth. To address this, I propose to apply modern scientific tools and
technologies to an Australian marsupial mammal: the fat-tailed dunnart (S. crassicaudata; Dasyuridae),
thereby developing a new approach for investigating brain development. Dunnarts are small (adults weigh
~15g), carnivorous animals whose pups (joeys) are born at an equivalent stage of development to embryonic
day 10 in mouse or seven-week gestation in humans, and therefore most of their brain development occurs as
they develop inside their mother's pouch. Despite this more primitive developmental phase, dunnarts have a
six-layered cerebral cortex which is similar to a mouse but with advantageous exceptions such as a more
advanced binocular visual system. Dunnarts are also able to solve complex configurable problems and learn
quickly. To ensure feasibility of this project, I provide evidence that we can use targeted electroporation to
introduce sensitive calcium indicators such as GCaMP6S into the cortex. In preliminary experiments we find
that patchwork-type activity in S1 and traveling waves in V1 are evolutionarily conserved in dunnarts,
motivating this new direction of my research to understand the development and function of these patterns of
spontaneous activity. Having access to study the entire genesis and development of these patterns enables
longitudinal studies that can link cells, circuits and behavior/function. The creation of longitudinal imaging
capabilities bridging micro/meso/macro scales as well as awake behavior across the lifespan will be required
in order to identify which neuronal cell types initiate spontaneous synchronous activity and whether these
activity patterns are instructive in forming functionally-specific circuits. I will also explore how spontaneous
activity in the cortex evolves throughout life as circuits begin to function to mediate sensory experience and
behavioural reactions. I

propose that by understanding the fundamental processes r equired to build
of patterned activity in the brain and how these affect behavior, this work will advance our
of the neural basis of mental experience."

10912473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the prevalence of tobacco use has declined in developed nations in recent decades, the prevalence
of smoking remains strikingly high in many low-income countries. In Cambodia, recent national surveys have
indicated that 33%–43% of adult men and 3% of adult women smoke cigarettes. Certain special populations,
such as people living with HIV (PLWH), are confronted with disproportionately high risks associated with
tobacco use. Available estimates indicate that 43%–65% of male PLWH and 3%–5% of female PLWH smoke
cigarettes. Although Cambodia has widespread coverage for antiretroviral treatment (ART), no known efforts
have been made to provide tobacco treatment to ART recipients who smoke. Thus, complementing ART with
efficacious tobacco cessation treatment offers tremendous potential to improve HIV care and to prolong life for
PLWH. To address this need, we propose a randomized controlled trial with pharmacological and behavioral
treatment components, including a fully automated, interactive smartphone-delivered intervention. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions are proliferating in the US, but efforts to utilize similar approaches in Cambodia
are extremely limited. The World Health Organization acknowledges that mHealth is cost-effective, scalable,
and sustainable, including for the least developed countries. We have already developed the mHealth platform
and intervention approach proposed for this study, and we have completed a pilot study with 50 Cambodian
PLWH who smoked and received care at an ART clinic. Results from this pilot indicated that the biochemically
confirmed, 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 2-months follow-up were 40% in the group receiving the
mHealth intervention vs. 8% in a standard care control group (relative risk: 5.0). In this proposed study,
Cambodian PLWH of all sexual identities will be recruited through the 6 largest ART clinics in Phnom Penh,
which provide comprehensive care to more than 14,000 PLWH. Participants (n=800) will be randomized to one
of 2 treatment groups: Standard Care (SC; n=400), or Automated Messaging (AM; n=400). SC consists of brief
advice to quit smoking delivered by research staff, self-help written materials, and an 8-week supply of nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of transdermal patches. AM consists of the SC components plus a fully
automated smartphone-based treatment program that involves interactive and tailored proactive messaging.
The primary outcome is biochemically confirmed self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12-months
post-study enrollment. Secondary outcomes include abstinence at 3- and 6-months post-enrollment. The
primary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of AM for Cambodian PLWH who smoke and to compare the cost-
effectiveness of AM vs. SC. If our findings indicate that AM is efficacious and cost-effective, our collaboration
with influential Cambodian governmental agencies will facilitate wide-scale implementation to HIV clinics
across the country. Thus, the project has the potential to transform HIV care delivery throughout the country
and to reduce tobacco-induced cancer morbidity and mortality significantly."
10928162,"Project Summary
Recently, breakthrough work has led to a wave of discoveries of biomolecular condensates. Such
membraneless organelles that cluster specific biomolecules away from the surrounding cellular milieu have
long been theorized and are now experimentally tractable. These dynamic structures contain a wide range of
proteins and nucleic acids and assemble through the process of phase separation. While many proteins are
prone to phase separation (either by themselves or via complexation with other proteins, nucleic acids, or small
molecules), these condensates have primarily been found in eukaryotic cells. Since bacteria do not typically
contain membrane-enclosed organelles, we hypothesize that bacteria instead use phase-separated
membraneless organelles as novel organizers of their cytoplasm to regulate biochemical activity while they
respond to changing environmental conditions.
In this proposal, our multidisciplinary team combines state-of-the-art in vitro approaches, in vivo experiments,
and in silico modeling and theory to explore the structural organization of the bacterial cytoplasm and
characterize phase-separated membraneless organelles in bacteria. We will focus on a candidate protein
system, the DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps), that drives the organization of the bacterial
chromosome and leads DNA to form a separate subcellular compartment within bacterial cells upon stress. We
will first study this system’s chemical and mechanical properties, map the phase space for condensate
formation, ascertain whether it occurs through spinodal decomposition or nucleation and condensate droplet
growth, and determine its kinetics in vitro. Next, we will elucidate how phase separation controls the access of
cytoplasmic and nucleoid-associated biomolecules to the bacterial chromosome and image the structure of
membraneless DNA-organizing organelles in living bacteria to measure the effect of condensation on
chromosome structure and dynamics in vivo. Finally, we will characterize the impact of chromosome phase
separation on the mobility of cytoplasmic and DNA-binding proteins in vivo and determine the role of
chromosomal condensation in bacterial physiology and survival. Together, our results will define the
contributions of the unique physicochemical properties of the bacterial cytoplasm to compartmentalization
within these cells. Phase separation provides an alternate mechanism for spatial and functional organization in
the bacterial domain of life. Indeed, phase separation is emerging as a universal organizing principle across
the tree of life, and our work will ultimately shed light on the origin of life and provide new targets for rationally
designed antibiotics."
10923971,"Glycosylation is one of the most complex protein modifications; more than 50% of mammalian
proteins are glycosylated. The fact that there are 100,000 proteoforms coded by only ~20,300
genes identified in the human genome emphasizes the importance of posttranslational
modifications (PTMs) like glycosylation. Aberrant protein glycosylation has been implicated in
many diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, congenital/metabolic disorders, diabetes,
inflammation, Parkinson’s disease, bacterial/viral infectious diseases, and various cancers. More
recently, glycans have been associated with coronavirus spike glycoproteins, including the SARS-
CoV-2 virion. The diverse biological roles of glycans and their implications in diseases have
created a demand for reliable qualitative and quantitative glycomic approaches, which facilitates
sensitive investigation of glycan changes in different biological and biomedical samples. Mass
spectrometry (MS) is the most efficient technique in glycomics due to its high sensitivity and
capacity for acquiring structural information. However, glycomic research remains a challenge
because of the microheterogeneity of glycan compositions in complex biological samples; the
relatively low abundance in nature and low ionization efficiency in MS analysis; and the existence
of variant positional and linkage isomers caused by the biosynthesis process. To overcome these
challenges, several separation methods have been coupled to MS. Despite the development of
these separation techniques, isomeric separation of glycans remains insufficient. There is an
increasing demand for more efficient isomeric separation approaches since glycan isomers have
been related to different diseases.
 The main aim of this proposal is to provide easily accessible, adaptable, and affordable
strategies for better separation and characterization of glycans and glycan isomers derived from
different glycoconjugates. Aim 1 is focused on finding a replacement for porous craphitic carbon
columns that sufferes from low reprodcubility and loss of resolution and efficiency with time. The
in-house mesoporous graphitic carbon (MGC)-LC-MS will be investigated for both permethylated
(Aim 1a) and native (Aim 2b) isomeric separation of N- and O-glycans, glycolipid glycans, and
free oligosaccharides. Other alternatives (also part of Aim 1a), such as 50 cm and 200 cm micro
pillar array columns (μPAC)-C18-LC-MS, and a 50 cm long capillary nanoC18-LC-MS, will also
be evaluated to achieve an improved isomeric separation of glycan isomers. Subsequently, GUI
will be utilized to improve the identification of glycan isomers. A GUI libraries for the separation
strategies developed in Aim 1 will be established to normalize the possible retention time shift
among different runs (Aim 2). LC-M based glycomics quantitative strategies will be developed
and assessed in Aim 3. The combination of permethylation and TMT will capitalize on the
advantages of both techniques, providing enhanced sensitivity and accuracy in glycan
quantitation (Aim 3a). Additionally, the combination of 8-plex isotopic permethylation and 6-plex
TMT will facilitate a reliable 48-plex, thus significantly increasing the throughput of analysis (Aim
3b). Furthermore, with the improved separation and identification (Aim 1 and 2), PRM will be
employed to assist the better quantitation of glycans and the differentiation of glycan isomers. A
library containing the fragments fingerprint of each glycan isomer will be created to aid the glycan
isomeric identification (Aim 3c). The development of automated software for easy, fast, and
accurate glycomic data processing is the main focus of Aim 4. Finally, the aforementioned
strategies and tools will be applied to clinical samples to address a variety of biological and
biomedical issues such as COVID-19, breast cancer brain metastasis, liver cancer vs. cirrhosis,
kidney diseases, algae development, and others (Aim 5). The development of the proposed
methods and algorithms will help us and our collaborators to better understand the attributes and
biomedical significance of glycan isomers in the development and progression of esophageal,
breast, and liver cancer. Furthermore, we expect the analytical tools and algorithms proposed
here to benefit researchers and scientists who are interested in understanding the biological
attributes of glycan isomers in other systems."
10908454,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant morbidity and
healthcare costs, especially severe exacerbations that require hospitalization. Traditional bronchodilators and anti-
inflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing
hospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this
regard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission
rates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as
well as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR
overall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of
PR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The
number of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.
In addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.
 New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to
underserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional
models of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways
of delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical
barriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,
regardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To
test our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a
real-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following
Specific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in
patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR
intervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant
reduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,
especially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation."
10917224,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Research Design, Data, and Analytics Core
Quantitative analysis methods are essential for almost all forms of diabetes translational research. Along with
traditional biostatistics, it has become essential to include methods from the social sciences (e.g., economics,
sociology, decision sciences) in order to evaluate observational data and quasi-experimental studies, to assess
outcomes such as health care costs and health care utilization, and to fully understand the long-term population
level impact of novel interventions and policies. Diabetes translation research can also extend into specialized
data sources such as health insurance claims data and electronic health records. At the Chicago Center for
Diabetes Translation Research (CDTR), our close proximity and active collaboration with investigators based in
social science departments as well as research institutes and laboratories of the University of Chicago and
Northwestern University helps to ensure that our research methods have a solid theoretical foundation and a
close link to innovations. The Research Design, Data, and Analytics (RDDA) Core has a strong history of
accomplishments that have helped to advance quantitative methods in cost-effectiveness analysis, decision
analysis, quality of life assessment, personalized medicine, and informatics.
The RDDA Core provides support to numerous new and established investigators affiliated with the CCDTR as
well as external diabetes investigators across the U.S. Many of our ongoing studies are the byproduct of cross-
fertilization of investigators from different disciplines that leads to innovative studies of diabetes prevention and
care. For this renewal, the RDDA Core will continue to provide cutting-edge analytic support for a wide range of
projects in diabetes translation research ranging from clinical and pragmatic trials to cost-effectiveness analysis
to natural experiments. This support is available in terms of technical expertise and material resources for
analysis such as data storage and computational processing capacity, software, and simulation models. Ongoing
methodological areas of support include Biostatistical Analysis, Economic Analysis (Diabetes Simulation
Modeling and Business Case Analysis), Health Care Claims Analysis, Social Network Analysis, and Agent-
Based Modeling. New methodological areas of support will include Informatics and Natural Experiments.
The aims of the RDDA Core are: 1) To provide cutting edge quantitative analysis support for a wide range of
diabetes translation research focused on improving the care and outcomes of vulnerable populations in resource-
constrained settings; 2) To facilitate access to and support for analysis of specialized data sources such as
national health insurance claims and electronic health records; 3) To strengthen and forge new partnerships,
connections, and collaborations with leading methodologists and investigators of the CCDTR. The innovations
and support of the RDDA core will help the CCDTR expand its role as one of the pioneering national leaders
investigating how to translate diabetes research findings into real-world practice, with an emphasis on improving
the quality of care and outcomes for vulnerable populations."
10917229,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Community Engagement and Health Equity Core
The overall goal of the Community Engagement and Health Equity (CEHE) Core is to build the capacity of
diabetes investigators and community stakeholders to conduct high-impact community-engaged research
(CEnR) that promotes health equity. As the nation's third largest city, Chicago is widely known for its segregated
neighborhoods with stark social and structural inequities that contribute to health disparities. Diabetes represents
an especially relevant and poignant example, with a prevalence that ranges from 3.8% in Chicago's wealthiest
community area to 19.7% in one of its poorest neighborhoods. To eliminate these unacceptable disparities,
investigators and community stakeholders must partner to conduct diabetes translation research that has real-
world impact. CEnR represents a promising approach to promote diabetes health equity by facilitating an
understanding of the lived experiences of community members, prioritizing research questions of importance to
communities, tailoring interventions for cultural salience, and honing dissemination strategies. The Chicago
Center for Diabetes Translation Research (CCDTR), and its leaders from the University of Chicago (UC) and
Northwestern University (NU), are national experts in CEnR and health equity, engaging diverse communities
throughout Chicago and beyond in groundbreaking research that has produced meaningful improvements for
individuals and neighborhoods locally, regionally, and nationally. The CEHE Core leverages a rich array of
combined institutional resources and community partners from two of the nation's premier universities, in a truly
citywide, community-engaged approach for promoting diabetes health equity. In Aim 1, CEHE will consolidate
numerous existing educational opportunities focused on CEnR, offering them to both investigators and
community stakeholders to build their collective capacity to conduct high-impact diabetes translation research.
Aim 2 offers consultative services to enhance community and stakeholder engagement in CCDTR-supported
research. This aim also includes creating a novel Diabetes Stakeholder Database to catalyze new diabetes
translation research partnerships. In Aim 3, CEHE will leverage existing resources for disseminating research
products to communities and other stakeholders who can translate them into practices and policies that promote
diabetes health equity. The CEHE Core builds on a long history of prior successful diabetes-related CEnR and
health equity research at UC and NU, combining these leading institutions' faculty expertise, educational
opportunities, and community partnerships. This exciting partnership in CEHE is responsive to RFA-DK-20-002
by: 1) enhancing educational opportunities in CEnR and health equity that will prepare both academic
investigators and community stakeholders to conduct impactful diabetes translation research; 2) fostering
collaboration between academic investigators and a large array of community stakeholders with experience
translating research into practice; and 3) demonstrating established reach into diverse communities across the
entire city of the Chicago and beyond."
10917232,"PROJECT SUMMARY - National/Regional Resource Core
The overall goal of the national core is to catalyze equity-focused diabetes translation research in community
health centers (CHC), the primary ambulatory system of care for vulnerable populations across the U.S. The
proposed core, entitled Accelerating Health Equity And Eliminating Diabetes Disparities in Community Health
Centers (AHEAD-CHC), engages three of the largest and most capable CHC network organizations nationwide:
AllianceChicago (Alliance), Health Choice Network (HCN), and MidWest Clinicians' Network (MWCN).
Collectively, these organizations support a total of 246 CHC sites across 29 U.S. states serving ~7.5 million
patients. AHEAD-CHC will also partner with Clinical Directors Network (CDN) for dissemination activities
reaching a national audience of relevant stakeholders in all 50 states. AHEAD-CHC leverages the following
existing assets and critical infrastructure to accomplish the aims of this national Core successfully. In Aim 1,
Alliance and HCN will expand an existing National Diabetes Data Repository that currently includes over 1 million
CHC patients, and make this resource available to a national audience of diabetes translation researchers and
CHC clinicians for equity-focused analyses. In Aim 2, Alliance, HCN, and MWCN will offer a range of consultative
services to support collaborations pairing diabetes investigators with CHCs, and help catalyze successful
practice-based research by these groups. Specifically, AHEAD-CHC partners will leverage existing infrastructure
to offer consultations, participate in meetings, and provide analytic support to accelerate new diabetes translation
research conducted in their CHC networks. In Aim 3, AHEAD-CHC offers a national dissemination arm led by
CDN, which will leverage its existing audience of over 50,000 researchers, CHC staff, and other stakeholders
for a webinar series featuring diabetes research supported by the Core. CDN will then archive the webinars on
the AHEAD-CHC website, along with associated research products (e.g. peer-reviewed publications,
intervention protocols, and white papers), so that these materials can be accessed on demand by an unlimited
audience. With extensive collective experience conducting high-impact diabetes research in CHCs and then
translating findings into improved diabetes care and outcomes, members of the AHEAD-CHC leadership team
are national authorities in this area, who are uniquely positioned to succeed in the proposed work. AHEAD-CHC
is highly responsive to RFA-DK-20-002 by: 1) focusing on health equity among the vulnerable, high-risk
populations served by CHCs; 2) offering resources and services that catalyze work across the research
continuum from partnership building to translation of research products into practice and policy; 3) enhancing
efficiency, productivity, and effectiveness by centralizing these diverse assets and making them available from
a single access point; and 4) demonstrating established reach beyond the Chicago Center for Diabetes
Translation Research into all 50 U.S. states."
10917235,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Pilot and Feasibility Program
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) grant program at the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (CCDTR)
supports new areas of inquiry in diabetes translation research, with a special focus on improving the care and
outcomes of vulnerable populations. The main aim of P&F program is to provide funding for investigators to
explore novel hypotheses and to obtain preliminary data in order to secure long-term support from conventional
funding mechanisms. Funding from the P&F program has supported new investigators who are seeking to
become fully independent scientists in diabetes translation research and established investigators who are
seeking to initiate diabetes-related research. Since 2011, the CCDTR P&F has received 68 applications and has
awarded 41 grants, leading to 52 abstract presentations, 55 publications, and funding of 29 grants from NIDDK,
NHBLI, AHRQ, and others. Grantees have received $25 million in subsequent awards with a return on investment
of $28 for every $1 invested. The P&F program has made a difference for many investigators and has help
establish a more diverse and collaborative network of researchers while launching the careers of several
investigators in the fields of diabetes translational research. Grants have gone to 31 (76%) women, 23 (56%)
investigators who identify as racial/ethnic minorities, and 19 (46%) women of color across eight institutions and
12 departments. The areas of study have included sleep interventions, care of patients with pre-end-stage kidney
disease, mobile phone interventions on sedentary behavior, and human centered design approaches. Looking
forward, we will amplify our reach through a novel partnership with Northwestern University (NU). This
partnership will further catalyze the work that UC and NU have been conducting by providing broader reach
across disciplines, institutions, and geography. Additionally, the P&F program will be furthered strengthened by
expanding our scope by encouraging applications from grantees who: (1) are testing novel interventions in health
equity, dissemination, and implementation; (2) bring unique perspective to diabetes research through
nontraditional fields of expertise (e.g. engineering, design, environmental science); and (3) identify as URM
and/or engage with stakeholders/community organizations that are URM serving and/or led. Acknowledging the
importance of the P&F program, the Deans of the Biological Sciences Division at UC and Feinberg School of
Medicine at NU will support the P&F program by providing $100K total in matching funds per year. With $150K
funds per year, we will grant up to five grants of $25k per year and up to five “mini” grants of $5K to improve
engagement and dissemination efforts. The success of our P&F program to date is a reflection of the
interdisciplinary nature of our center and the strong research base it provides. Through a renewal of the CCDTR
and collaboration with NU, the P&F program will be able to continue to provide necessary funding support to a
new generation of innovative and diverse diabetes translation researchers and increase their chances of
securing long-term funding in the future."
10917239,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Enrichment Program
The Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research Enrichment Program (CCDTR EP) is designed to amplify
T2-T4 diabetes research focused on population health and health equity through the promotion of scientific
exchange among Chicago-area and national junior and senior investigators. Diabetes translation research
encompasses a broad array of research methods from behavioral research to clinical trials to community-based
participatory research to cost-effectiveness analysis, and the proposed enrichment program reflects the diversity
of these areas. The CCDTR EP is designed to integrate key elements of UC and NU diabetes translation
research infrastructure and complement this integration with outside resources to improve population health and
health equity for vulnerable populations with diabetes. With the integration of NU into the CCDTR, there is an
important opportunity to create a robust cross-Chicago program of diabetes translation seminars, guest
speakers, visiting scientists, consultants, and workshops. The Specific Aims of the CCDTR EP will be to: Aim
1) Enhance and enrich the environment for diabetes translation research in Chicagoland through seminars,
symposia and workshops for trainees, junior investigators, senior investigators, and non-academic stakeholders;
and Aim 2) Create a Chicagoland network of diabetes translational investigators who work together and with
City of Chicago public health leaders to improve diabetes health and diabetes health disparities. We will establish
a joint CCDTR incubator weekly meeting and cross-pollinate UC and Northwestern researchers by integrating
cross-institutional leaders in the planning of the CCDTR-sponsored Annual Chicago Diabetes Day and NU's
Institute for Public Health and Medicine's Annual Population Health Forum. In addition, the CCDTR EP will
intentionally connect with investigators from diverse backgrounds and community stakeholders throughout
Chicagoland to join the center in order to strengthen collaborations and provide opportunities for dissemination.
Finally, the CCDTR EP will systematically identify and connect with all of Chicagoland's diabetes translation
researchers, public health experts, and community stakeholders. The major benefit of the CCDTR EP will be to
provide diabetes researchers, ranging from trainees to senior investigators, as well as partners and stakeholders,
with a forum to collaborate, innovate, and disseminate outstanding diabetes translation research. In concert with
other CCDTR activities, the EP will accelerate the equitable conduct, dissemination, and implementation of
translational diabetes research across Chicagoland."

The Administrative Core (ADM) is a necessary component of the Columbia University Senescence Tissue
Mapping (CUSTMAP) Center; it will provide research and logistical oversight and facilitate communication
amongst all Center Cores as well as with the SenNet Consortium Organization and Data Coordination Center
(CODCC), the SenNet consortium at large, and the NIH. The ADM, composed of a Director, all Center PIs (MPIs),
an Executive Committee (all Core leadership), and support staff (Program Manager and Systems Analyst), will
oversee and coordinate the direction of three Cores (a Biospecimen Core (BIO), a Biological Analysis Core
(BAC), and a Data Analysis Core (DAC)). These Cores will contribute to the study of senescence in three primary
tissue types, i.e., skin, brain, and spinal cord, across the adult lifespan. The ADM will have three main functions
in support of the CUSTMAP Center and ultimately the SenNet consortium initiative. The first is Leadership,
highlighted in Aim 1: Provide scientific leadership and governance structure to ensure integration and
function of the CUSTMAP Center components and activities. CUSTMAP Center activities will span multiple
sites (CUIMC-All Cores, Edinburgh University-BIO, New York Genome Center-BAC, and New York University-
DAC) and therefore will require a central governing and organizing structure. The ADM will be the hub for
decision making, all Center documentation, and adherence to ethical policies. Importantly, the ADM will ensure
the CUSTMAP Center research is compliant with agreed upon standards and a resource sharing plan, formally
set by the Center and with the NIH. The second role is Center Coordination, highlighted in Aim 2: Facilitate
internal communication and promote synergy within the CUSTMAP Center. The ADM will provide
coordination across all CUSTMAP Center Cores. Central to this Aim is an innovative, customized laboratory
information management system (LIMS) in coordination with OpenSpecimen to track samples, the associated
metadata, and experimental outputs. The ADM will organize regular Executive Committee meetings as an open
forum for the sharing of successes, ideas and trouble shooting. The ADM will compile biannual Progress reports
from each Core for evaluation by the SenNet Steering Committee and annual reports for evaluation by an Internal
Advisory Board (internal to CUIMC, external to CUSTMAP). Finally, the ADM will facilitate Network
Coordination, highlighted in Aim 3: Foster collaboration and integration of the CUSTMAP Center with the
SenNet consortium. The ADM will collaborate with the CUSTMAP DAC and the SenNet CODCC to develop
harmonious Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), Common Data Elements (CDEs) and suitable data packages
and will oversee the delivery of quality data to the CODCC. The ADM will also leverage interactions with other
TMCs in the SenNet consortium to optimize SOPs, assay protocols, consent materials, and data analysis, etc.
The ADM will provide the seamless integration of multiple moving parts, at multiple sites, to produce high quality,
meaningful data towards the SenNet goal of high-resolution atlases of senescence in diverse healthy tissues."
10898656,"BIOSPECIMEN CORE (BIO): PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is characterized by the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage resulting in decreasing cellular
functionality. The extent and temporal progression of this damage is a heterogeneous process due to the
complex interactions of environmental and genetic factors that can ameliorate and/or exacerbate normal
aging. The overarching goal of the Columbia University Senescence Tissue Mapping (CUSTMAP)
Center is to focus on key organ systems with vulnerability to age-related degenerative processes; the central
nervous system and skin. These systems were selected as they represent organs with prominent
adaptive/regenerative ability and heterogeneous cell types that will allow us to investigate the local effects of
aging on gene expression signatures and how this impacts upon cellular composition and increase
susceptibility to age-related damage and diseases. At the core of the CUSTMAP Center is consistent
accessibility to well-phenotyped, high-quality, non-diseased human tissue that has been consented for
broad data sharing. We are ideally positioned for this effort through our premier clinical phenotyping and
biobanking resources. Through our Biospecimen Core (BIO), we will compile one of the largest
multinational cohorts with tissues spanning the lifespan, with comparable and quantifiable clinical
correlates, by continuing our prospective collection of comparably phenotyped high quality cases at both the
University of Edinburgh and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Our BIO will bring together a
leadership team from diverse clinical and research backgrounds with complementary established expertise
in clinical phenotyping and tissue biobanking. The aim of this core is not only to synergize with our Biological
Analysis Core to deliver the outcomes of the proposed aims, but also to establish an international framework
for a standardized approach to phenotypic tissue banking. Our hope is that by establishing this framework it
will enable a higher quality of ante- and post-mortem, human-relevant research to be carried out in this field."
10898660,"DATA ANALYSIS CORE (DAC): PROJECT SUMMARY
To characterize signatures of senescence and their functional implications in multiple human tissues across
the life span, the Columbia University Senescence Tissue Mapping (CUSTMAP) Center proposes a novel
combination of genome-wide and targeted molecular panels to map cellular composition with spatial context.
The Data Analysis Core correspondingly plays a key role in all aspects of data processing and analysis,
tissue mapping, and identification of markers of senscence, as well as data harmonization, coordination, and
dissemination through the SenNet Consortium Data Coordination Center (CODCC). To achieve these goals,
the DAC will use an integrative analysis approach to combine multi-modal data consisting of transcriptome-
wide and targeted proteomics profiling in the tissues being examined across the adult human lifespan. This
includes the three major data modalities described in the Biological Analysis Core: large-scale high-resolution
Iterative Indirect Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i) data, genome-wide spatially resolved Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data, and transcriptome-wide single-nucleus RNA-seq data. These three data
modalities in concert allow for comprehensive (genome-wide) molecular characterization at single-cell
resolution in space; this combination of attributes has not been demonstrated by any single experimental
technique at scale currently in human tissue. By integrating these modalities using established processing
and analysis workflows, the Data Analysis Core will generate maps of known and novel senescence-
associated markers, senescent cells, and the effects of senescent cells on their surroundings in each tissue
type. To achieve these goals, the Data Analysis Core will implement modality-specific data processing
workflows, followed by cross-modal data analysis, cross-individual map-building, and identification of novel,
cell type-specific senescence signatures in brain, spinal cord, and skin. This includes cross-referencing
tissue-based signatures to data from ongoing efforts to identify senescence-related signatures in
cerebrospinal fluid and blood, the primary biofluids associated with central nervous system and skin. Finally,
the Data Analysis Core will work closely with the Administrative Core to interface with the SenNet CODCC,
in order to harmonize all aspects of data management and analysis with other members of the consortium."
10898662,"BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS CORE (BAC): PROJECT SUMMARY
Thus far, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogenous, cell type-
specific phenotypes of senescence, including potentially convergent mechanisms, has been hindered by the
inability to collect in situ ‘omics’ data across the range of scales required, from subcellular to whole organ, in
multiple modalities, and with sufficient depth and throughput to locate the small percentage of cells that would
exhibit a senescence phenotype. To address this unmet need, the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) will generate
and analyze a single-cell level spatial atlas of cell type-specific transcriptome and proteome signatures at a depth
sufficient to permit identification of the rare and heterogeneous senescent cell population. This will be achieved
in intact tissues from healthy individuals ranging in age from 20 – 80 years, which represents a full spectrum of
the human adult lifespan. The ultimate goals of the BAC are to identify and validate a panel of robust senescence
biomarkers for each cell type in our target tissues, and their spatial context, at the single-cell level, and to assess
the cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous effects of senescent cells on the cellular composition and
molecular signatures of the tissue microenvironment. We will take advantage of the advanced technologies,
workflows, and novel computational tools developed and established in the Columbia University Senescence
Tissue Mapping (CUSTMAP) Center and our expertise/experience in generating multimodal omics data at the
single-cell level in three target tissues – brain, spinal cord, and skin. We will achieve our research goals by
employing: 1) the Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) approach pioneered by our team to generate an unbiased,
transcriptome-wide, and cell type-specific map of senescence in the context of intact human tissues, in
conjunction with single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and novel computational methods developed by the Data
Analysis Core (DAC) to uncover the signatures of heterogeneous senescent cells; and 2) Iterative Indirect
Immunofluorescence Imaging (4i)-based proteomic profiling to enable the interpretation of spatially resolved
gene expression data in the context of cell type-specific senescence-associated changes at the single-cell level.
This combination, allowing for genome-wide molecular and cellular characterization of senescence at single-cell
resolution in space, has not been attempted at this scale and is one of the primary strengths of the CUSTMAP
Center approach. The BAC will achieve its goals in close coordination with the Biospecimen Core (BIO) and the
DAC, using optimized tissue preparation and ST/snRNA-seq/4i parameters. In conjunction with the DAC, the
BAC will integrate these data with analyses of CSF and blood (the biofluids associated with these tissues), to
relate SASP factors with tissue-level signatures. The BAC will also carry out critical validation studies of the
identified tissue- and cell type-specific senescence markers and senescence-associated molecular and cellular
features, using both cutting-edge iPSC-based in vitro models and tissues from mouse models of genetic and
pharmacological senolysis."
10697477,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), the most common cause of aortic stenosis, affects ~2% of the general
US population and given their age, a higher fraction of veterans. In the absence of effective medical therapies,
CAVD treatment is limited to surgical or percutaneous valve replacement. Efforts aimed at developing an
effective medical therapy for CAVD have failed in part due to knowledge gaps, lack of representative animal
models, and lack of tools to assess valvular biology in vivo. The overarching goals of this project are to develop
and validate a novel molecular imaging approach and leverage it as a component of multimodality molecular
and structural imaging to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic agents for CAVD. The hallmarks of CAVD
include valvular interstitial cell osteoblastic differentiation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and leaflet
calcification. Molecular imaging tracers, including those recently developed by our group that target matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, can potentially detect and track these biological processes in vivo. Gene
expression profiling has singled out MMP-12 as the most highly upregulated gene in human CAVD and our
preliminary data suggest that MMP-12 deletion may ameliorate aortic valve remodeling. This in conjunction
with other lines of evidence suggest that MMP-12 may serve as a therapeutic target to prevent progression of
CAVD. The novel observations that calcified nodules can regress in vitro and this regression can be modulated
by pharmacologic interventions, suggest that valvular interstitial cells may acquire an osteolytic phenotype.
Taking advantage of this phenomenon, we have established an in vitro screening platform to select agents that
promote reversal of valvular interstitial cell calcification. Here, we seek to evaluate MMP-12 as a diagnostic
and therapeutic target in CAVD, and identify novel agents that reverse aortic valve calcification. Using a
combination of genetically modified mice, including a novel murine model of CAVD that phenocopies human
disease, and novel MMP-12-targeted tracers and inhibitors, we will validate MMP-12 imaging for tracking
valvular biology in vivo; and through serial high-resolution multimodality molecular and structural imaging in
vivo followed by tissue analysis in vitro, we will evaluate the effect of MMP-12 inhibition on CAVD progression,
and in the case of agents identified through screening, their effect on regression of aortic valve calcification.
Combined, these studies will identify novel therapeutics with a direct path to clinical translation, while
advancing our knowledge on CAVD pathobiology. This may ultimately transform the management of patients
with aortic stenosis."
10916254,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to understand how loss of protein homeostats (proteostasis) in aging blood-forming
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) applies a selective pressure that promotes leukemia initiation. Loss of
proteostasis is one of the least understood hallmarks of aging, particularly as it relates to malignant
transformation. As an organism ages, misfolded proteins can accumulate in post-mitotic cells, or in cells that are
largely quiescent. This stresses the cell and can drive adaptive changes that are required to rebalance
proteostasis. HSCs are particularly susceptible to a loss of proteostasis. Adult HSCs have low rates of protein
synthesis relative to more frequently dividing lineage-committed blood progenitors. This helps maintain
proteostasis by preventing the biogenesis of misfolded proteins, and it is required to maintain adult HSC self-
renewal capacity. However, we have discovered that aged HSCs experience significant protein stress in vivo,
and proteostasis must be actively maintained through changes in gene expression and stress-response
pathways to sustain HSC self-renewal activity and longevity. In this regard, we have generated preliminary data
demonstrating that Hsf1, a critical proteostasis sensor that dynamically remodels the proteostasis network in
response to stress, is activated within aging HSCs where it is required to attenuate protein synthesis and
preserve HSC self-renewal capacity. These data indicate that aged HSCs must actively maintain proteostasis to
remain functional, and loss of proteostasis may create a selective pressure that promotes clonal hematopoiesis
and leukemia initiation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that a loss of proteostasis and pressure to maintain
proteostasis in aging HSCs promotes clonal hematopoiesis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initiation in older
adults. We propose two aims to test this hypothesis. In the first aim, we will use Aarssti/sti mice, which have a
defect in tRNA editing activity, to disrupt proteostasis in young and old adult mice. We will test whether
proteostasis disruption accelerates clonal hematopoiesis and AML initiation during aging in the setting of
Dnmt3aR878H and Tet2D/D mutations. In the second aim, we will test if normal age-related activation of Hsf1 creates
a permissive context for AML initiation in aging HSCs. We will conditionally delete Hsf1 in young and old adult
HSCs in the setting of a Dnmt3aR878H mutation with and without a cooperating NrasG12D mutation to determine if
it contributes to the emergence of clonal hematopoiesis and increased incidence of AML in older adults. These
studies will open new lines of investigation into a previously unappreciated link between age-related loss of
proteostasis (a hallmark of aging) and leukemia initiation. Therapies that mitigate proteostasis dysfunction could
preserve HSC clonal diversity later in life while reducing susceptibility to AML."
10888256,"Novel Approaches for Tau PROTAC Drug Discovery
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are a group of
neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau (P-tau)
protein, in the form of intracellular paired helical filaments (PHFs) or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), or aggregates,
within neurons and glia of affected brain regions, leading to cell death. Several approaches to remove aggregates
of pathogenic tau have failed, including antibody therapy. Novel approaches to remove aggregated proteins are
desired. Targeted protein degradation by PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has emerged as novel
therapeutic modality. PROTACs are heterobifunctional small molecules that simultaneously bind to a target
protein and a ubiquitin E3 ligase, thereby leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target.
They present a new opportunity to modulate proteins in a manner independent of enzymatic or signaling activity.
PROTAC drugs offer many advantages, such as: 1) target can be selectively degraded with catalytic specificity;
2) weak binders can be converted into selective PROTAC drugs; 3) overexpressed or mutant targets can be
degraded; and 4) limited target engagement can lead to maximal degradation. Although most misfolded and
aggregated proteins in the human proteome can be degraded by proteasomal system, some native and mutant
proteins prone to aggregation, such as tau oligomers are resistant to all known proteolytic pathways thus subject
to autophagic or lysosomal pathway. Development of PROTACs that can efficiently degrade pathogenic tau
aggregates is an attractive and breakthrough therapy for AD and FTD. No one, industry or academia has shown
credible data for tau PROTACs to succeed in the clinic. Traditional methods for PROTAC analysis, western blot
or reporter gene analysis are time consuming, cumbersome, and prone to artifacts. In this proposal we describe
a high throughput method for rapid development of tau PROTACs. Development of PROTACs that promote tau
degradation by lysosomal/autophagic mechanism is challenging. This grant proposes strategies to screening
different E3 ubiquitin ligases for tau PROTAC that will remove pathogenic (monomeric) as well as aggregates
through autophagic mechanism. Goal of the project is to establish rules that govern pathogenic tau degradations,
such as poly-ubiquitin signatures conjugated on tau aggregates to differentiate proteasomal vs lysosomal
degradation. Development of the technology that degrades tau aggregates can be directly applied to Parkinson’s
disease, Huntingdon disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Scleroses."
10992696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 An area of significant unmet need is the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive, fast-growing
and lethal brain cancer that represents 48% of all malignant brain tumors. Untreated, GBM is fatal within three
months, and due to its high rate of recurrence and invasive nature, the current standard of care, consisting of
safe maximal tumor resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, only extends survival following initial
diagnosis to one year. Invasion and proliferation, also known as Go and Grow, are defining phenotypes of GBM,
and GBM cells do only one or the other. However, blocking invasion stimulates proliferation and vice versa,
implying that an ideal therapeutic needs to block both Go and Grow simultaneously. Extensive genetic
interventions have shown that simultaneous disruption of two non-muscle myosin II (NMII) molecular motors
(NMIIA and IIB) meet these criteria. However, the translational potential of this research has been limited by the
lack of a clinically safe, CNS-penetrant NMII small molecule inhibitor. Following extensive medicinal chemistry
efforts to optimize selectivity for safety and tolerability, MT-125 was identified. MT-125 is a well-tolerated, dual
small molecule inhibitor of NMIIA and IIB with a high degree of brain penetrance, a requirement for an effective
GBM therapeutic. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies show that MT-125 blocks the Go and Grow phenotypes
and extends survival. Due to its unique mode of action, MT-125 also synergizes with existing FDA-approved
treatments, presenting a path to a potentially curative treatment. The overarching goal of the current proposal
is to ready MT-125 for rapid entry into IND-enabling studies. This will be achieved through several activities.
Phase I will focus on confirmation of preclinical efficacy with a clinically viable route of administration, in vitro
studies of synergy between MT-125 and additional existing FDA-approved treatments, and in vitro safety
profiling, pre-formulation studies and demo batch scale-up of MT-125. Quantitative milestones for transition to
Phase II are detailed in the application. In Phase II, in vivo efficacy testing will be performed on the most
promising synergy combinations identified in Phase I, as well as a non-GLP dosing safety study, GLP synthesis,
and formulations development with polymorph screening. The Commercialization Plan details the GBM market,
as well as Myosin Therapeutics’ clinical and regulatory strategy for rapid advancement of MT-125 to the clinic."
10797019,"Cryptosporidium, an AIDS-defining pathogen and one of the most common causes of diarrheal disease
worldwide, still lacks any effective therapeutic options. Despite recent advances, there are too few drugs in the
development pipeline to guarantee success in advanced clinical trials. A screen of compounds produced by
fungi isolated from deep within the Soudan Iron Mine in northern Minnesota identified a set of 14 related
norditerpene lactones from Oidiodendron truncatum, eight of which have activity against Cryptosporidium and
three against Toxoplasma, with no cytotoxicity to mammalian host cells. The discovery of a natural,
synthesizable derivative series that includes compounds with nanomolar activity against two opportunistic
pathogens allows for a detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) study that can be quickly built upon to
generate an optimal compound for entry into preclinical studies. We hypothesize that this newly discovered
anti-parasitic scaffold will yield a compound with in vivo activity and pharmacokinetic parameters favorable for
therapeutic development. We further hypothesize that these compounds will identify a new druggable target in
apicomplexans. We propose to test these hypotheses in two specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine anti-parasitic efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of the derivative series. In this
aim we will determine EC50s, selectivity indices and ADME/PK parameters of active compounds and use
these data to choose compounds for testing in Cryptosporidium-infected severely immunocompromised mice.
An exploratory sub-aim will identify and test additional minor structural analogs to expand the structure activity
relationship studies.
Aim 2: Identify the molecular target of the most potent Oidiodendron derivatives. In this aim we propose
to take advantage of the anti-Toxoplasma activity of three of the derivatives to conduct a forward genetics
experiment to identify the target of the compounds. In parallel, drug affinity responsive target stability assays
will be conducted with Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium lysates to complement the data obtained from the
genetics approach. Potential homologs in other apicomplexans will be identified by bioinformatics.
Natural products have a proven track record as effective and robust therapeutics for parasitic diseases; one
need look no farther than artemisinin and ivermectin to grasp the potential of the Oidiodendron derivatives for
development of a new anti-Cryptosporidium therapeutic. The dual activity of some of the derivatives opens up
the possibility that the compound(s) may also be effective against AIDS-associated toxoplasmosis. These
studies are ideal for the R21 mechanism as they are exploratory and high-risk/high return, potentially providing
a new therapeutic pharmacophore and a new therapeutic target for untreatable cryptosporidiosis."
10875418,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT.
 Gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal damage and destruction of the gut epithelial barrier are the defining
features of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Accumulated evidence indicates that neutrophils play a critical
role in the gastrointestinal and liver damage in HIV-1 infection. Neutrophils infiltrate the GI tract in HIV-1-
infected individuals at high levels and their presence is associated with damage to the epithelial barrier,
elevated epithelial permeability, and increased disease severity in animal models and HIV-1-infected patients.
In this application, we propose that microbial translocation and the resulting systemic innate immune
dysregulation mediated by changes in neutrophil subpopulations in circulation, gut-associated lymphoid tissue
(GALT), and liver plays a fundamental role in HIV-1 disease progression. The overall objectives of this
proposal are to define the role of neutrophil subpopulations and NETosis as driving mechanisms of
gastrointestinal and liver damage in HIV-1 infection and to identify the mechanisms responsible for chronic
neutrophilic activation in HIV-1 infection in order to reveal the specific checkpoints for intervention. Our central
hypothesis is that HIV-1 infection is associated with the induction and expansion of specific neutrophilic
subpopulations with increased capacity to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and undergo NETosis. ROS
and NETs released from activated neutrophils promote damage in the GI mucosa and liver and drive the
progression of HIV-1 infection. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our preliminary data and
recently published reports demonstrating the critical role of neutrophils in HIV-1 infection. In preliminary
studies, we optimized methods for detailed neutrophil characterization and demonstrated that neutrophils from
HIV-1-infected individuals display an activated phenotype, immunosuppressive properties, specific
transcriptional profile, increased rate of degranulation, and a high capacity to undergo NETosis. Specific
properties of the newly identified neutrophil subpopulations strongly indicate that they play a critical role in
damaging GI mucosa and the pathogenesis of liver disease in HIV-1-infected individuals. We propose to
determine the effect of induction of specific neutrophil subpopulations on the progression of liver disease in
ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals, to identify specific properties of neutrophil subpopulations in the GALT
and liver of HIV-1-infected individuals, and determine whether the innate immune dysregulation in these
tissues is associated with a shift in the ratio of tissue macrophages exhibiting M1 versus M2 phenotype
resulting in lowered efferocytosis and accumulation of neutrophils undergoing NETosis. The significance of the
proposed studies is that once the role of neutrophils in the progression of HIV-1 infection is defined, neutrophil
activation and induction of pathogenic populations can be pharmacologically targeted."
10828429,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) effects 14 million Americans resulting in approximately 900,000 myocardial
infarction’s (MI) and 650,000 deaths annually. Percutaneous intervention (PCI) is the most frequently performed
procedure to treat CAD. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and “no reflow phenomenon” (NRF) are major
barriers that preclude optimal outcomes and are independent risk factors for mortality and heart failure. Current
devices are only partially effective in mitigating MVO and NRF following PCI for MI. The mechanisms responsible
for MVO are complex and multifactorial. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, attenuates many of the
mechanisms responsible for MVO. Seminal studies in our laboratory demonstrated that intravenous adenosine
resulted in striking myocardial protection, a finding confirmed in large clinical trials. Adenosine’s full therapeutic
potential is compromised due to its ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 second) in human blood. By combining
guidewire design, surface chemistry, jet milling of adenosine and creation of novel hydrophilic drug-loading and
diffusion barrier coatings, we developed a guidewire platform (Adenowire) which allows for continuous delivery
of adenosine throughout a PCI procedure. In vitro studies confirmed an ideal elution profile for adenosine that
was verified in large animal models where robust vasodilatation and rapid reversal of vasoconstriction was
identified. The novel inert coating also provides antiplatelet effects that are amplified with the addition of
adenosine in the coating. Bench studies reveal that wire performance and coating quality are comparable to inert
hydrophilic commercially available guidewires. While our phase 2 SBIR grant and subsequent development
resulted in a safe and functional product, a significant funding gap remains before the device can be
commercialized. Manufacturing and coating of Adenowires were not subjected to rigorous FDA regulatory
requirements and utilized a non-sterilized product. Adenowire is classified as a combination product and both
adenosine and guidewires are already FDA approved. A pre-IND submission by a regulatory consultant
determined that approval would occur via CDRH (device) division utilizing a “de novo“ pathway. In order to
proceed with clinical trials, the following assistance is needed: 1) Late Stage Research and Development on
guidewire manufacturing and application of coating utilizing good manufacturing practice (GMP) and evaluation
of biocompatibility and functional parameters on a sterilized product; 2) Regulatory Assistance to include
strategy, documentation, submission of IDE application and determination of size of requirements for clinical
trials. Results obtained from these studies would be invaluable since such data would result in finalization of the
product allowing issuance of an IDE and initiation of a First in Man (FIM) clinical trial. This will greatly enhance
our ability to obtain additional funding and strategic partnerships. Adenowire is a transformative device that is
inexpensive, will have a large target market and represents a major technological advancement for treating CAD
patients with PCI."

Deaths from solid tumors vastly outnumber deaths from hematopoietic cancers. Yet progress in
immunotherapies for solid tumors is well behind those for lymphoma. CAR-T cell therapies and
engineered T cells have become revolutionary approaches for hematopoietic cancers, but their
potential for solid tumors is yet to be realized. Significant challenges hinder the potential of
immune therapies in solid tumors, including insufficient activation and eventual exhaustion of
effector T cells; and suppression of T cell effector responses in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal we consider these hurdles and offer a biomaterial solution that overcomes them.
This proposal is significant in facilitating endogenous T cells to fight solid tumors. Surgery is a
major treatment modality for both invasive and in situ tumors, but at this time, there are no specific
immunotherapies initiated at the time of surgery; they all start days to weeks later. Our proposal
is significant for offering a way to start treatments early, right at the time of initial surgery. Here
our synthetic scaffold, SymphNode can be injected at the time of biopsy or surgery not to only
recruit and active tumor-experienced local immune cells but also to suppress the inhibitory cells
created by tumor cells. Our long-term goal is to develop this bioengineered, locally injected,
“synthetic lymph node” into a therapy for human tumors."
10894917,"Abstract
The larynx governs our most basic life-sustaining functions and serves as the foundation of our self-identity.
Even the most minor aberration within this delicate and complex structure can result in life-altering or life-
ending consequences. The ability to breathe, swallow, and voice are all regulated by the larynx. Even though
these functions can be replaced with various tubes and prosthetics, they cannot replace the normal human
experience. Patients state that losing their voice feels like losing their identity. They wish to talk with their own
voice again, sing to their children, and have a meal with their families. Coughing mucus out of a tracheostomy
tube, feeding one’s self through a stomach tube, and speaking like a robot are embarrassing, leading most to
live a life of social isolation. Development of a bioengineered patient-specific implant can restore all three
laryngeal functions and improve healing, thereby saving lives and improving quality-of-life. The goal of our
project is to optimize a process and a product to restore all three laryngeal functions -- breathing, swallowing,
and voice -- with a patient-specific, immobile hemilarynx implant that obviates the need for revision surgery,
improves healing, and enhances implant integration. To achieve our goal we will complete the following 3 aims:
Aim 1: To refine the design process for a patient-specific implant shape, we will quantify voicing,
breathing, and swallowing of excised larynges tested with different patient-specific implants. Aim 2: To
optimize laryngeal wound healing without the muscle flap, we will evaluate flat scaffold patches with
cellular and acellular components in an in vivo model of a laryngeal mucosal wound. Aim 3: To evaluate the
performance of the bioengineered implant in a long-term in vivo hemilarynx reconstruction model, we
will assess immune response, tissue integration, epithelial development, and function -- voicing, breathing, and
swallowing -- with canine-specific implants with both optimal shape and optimal cellular and acellular
components."

Mental health disorders are the most common disease of childhood. Yet, millions of teens do not receive
mental health care. Most at risk are teens from underserved populations (e.g., low socioeconomic status;
racial/ethnic and/or gender/sexual minority), who face a myriad of barriers to mental health screening and care.
As such, traditional methods for reaching underserved teens with mental health disorders are not working,
resulting in life-long health disparities and a significant public health impact. Consistent with the
recommendations made in the NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council Workgroup report, the goal of
this K08 application is to use and adapt existing digital mental health technologies to advance the engagement,
assessment, detection, treatment, and delivery of services for pediatric mental health. Specifically, the
Accelerated Creation-to-Sustainment Model will guide the development and implementation of the Teen
Assess, Check, and Heal (TeACH) System into a pediatric primary care clinic serving teens and families from
the West Side of Chicago. In Aim 1, the PI and her mentorship team will collaborate with underserved teens
(n=20) and their parents (n=20) to identify strategies to target top barriers to engagement as well as top ethical
concerns and requirements for cultural relevance, usability, and usefulness of the TeACH System. In Aim 2,
the plan for implementing the TeACH System will be refined through observations, interviews, and co-design
workshops with pediatric primary care pediatricians and staff. In Aim 3, the TeACH System will be
implemented into a primary care clinic and evaluated in a randomized trial for: 1) engagement and
implementation outcomes; and 2) assessment of remediation of health disparities by analyzing differential
outcomes (e.g., race, insurance status, individual perceptions of mental health) in a randomized trial. This
innovative research will inform general digital mental health technology engagement adaptations needed for
underserved teens and identify implementation practices to support the TeACH System in pediatric primary
care settings. The PI and her mentorship team will also determine the feasibility and satisfaction of the TeACH
System in preparation for the PI’s planned expansion of the System across multiple primary care clinics in a
future R01 proposal. The proposed research and career development plans logically build from the PI’s
foundational training in pediatrics/behavioral health, user-centered design, and mobile health (mHealth)
evaluation to provide opportunities to gain knowledge and skills in: 1) pediatric health disparities; 2)
dissemination and implementation science; and 3) ethics specific to deploying digital mental health
technologies for underserved populations. Supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts and in institutional
environment invested in supporting innovative initiatives to improve the mental and behavioral health of
underserved populations, this K08 will launch the PI into a successful career as an independent clinical

My lab has been the leader in the field of mouse modeling for brain tumors over the past 15 years. We have
developed a suite of genetically engineered mouse models that are demonstrably representative of human
gliomas and other tumor types. These models have been used to inform treatment options for clinical agents,
and this now enables us to propose these models are suitable testbeds for testing potential major improvements
to how these diseases are treated. We have three projects. 1) We are understanding the central role of specific
splice variants of TrkB in embryonic development and oncogenesis throughout the body. The RCAS modeling
system has been used here to show that forced expression of the embryonic splice variant in adult tissues
leads to cancer formation broadly. In this project we will investigate the mechanisms of oncogenesis for this
splice variant and determine if it could be a good diagnostic or therapeutic target. 2) We are now using the
modeling system developed for glioma to address the biology of rare tumors driven by gene fusions. In this
grant we propose to understand the mechanisms of oncogenesis for YAP1 gene fusions in the rare tumors
ependymoma, porocarcinoma and aggressive meningioma (all for which we have YAP1 gene fusion driven
models currently). 3) And, we will use these mouse models to study therapeutic response and identify
therapeutic strategies for these fusion driven tumors including identification of FDA approved drugs that would
intervene downstream of the action of the gene fusion."

in the country. The HIV epidemic is driven by a complex interaction of biopsychosocial factors, and PWH have
high comorbidity with common mental disorders (CMD) – some estimates indicate that one in five PWH
demonstrate symptomology for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance use disorders. The
synergistic stress of HIV and CMD has significant adverse impacts across the HIV care-cascade, most notably
on adherence to antiretroviral therapy, retention in HIV care, and viral suppression. To address these concerns,
the HIV Mental Health Research Unit (HIV MHU) has conducted NIH-funded descriptive and intervention trial
research for more than a decade, which resulted in the Unit developing a new master’s degree program in
Behavioural Medicine – a novel and emerging field in South Africa. While research and training at UCT at the
intersection of HIV and mental disorders has grown steadily, these elements require clear cohesion and strategic
direction. Specifically, the proposed training programme intends to leverage existing research programs in the
HIV MHU to build research training capacity in HIV-associated behavioural medicine. A two-year planning grant
will allow us to document and analyse the existing research and training capacity at UCT and other South African
universities in HIV-associated behavioural medicine to define gaps and needs. Moreover, through collaborative
relationships with partnering institutions, we aim to establish an organisational structure that would support a
Fogarty D43 application and identify potential trainee candidates at UCT that could be recruited for training in
behavioural medicine within the D43 Fogarty training program. During the grant period, we aim to consolidate
our behavioural medicine program within the Unit, the wider University, and with our international collaborators,
to ultimately offer a suite of master’s, doctoral and post-doctoral training to a new cohort of both clinician-
scientists, as well as basic and social scientists. While our research to date has led to improvements in HIV
treatment adherence, viral suppression, and mental health outcomes, behavioural medicine is an emerging and
evolving field in South Africa. To date, there are no established behavioural medicine programs in South Africa
that focus on HIV, mental disorders, and behaviour. The proposed planning grant will facilitate establishing the
field in South Africa and the African continent."

10841696,"Project Summary
Our program, “Preventing Infant Infection with Implementation Science in Malawi”, PRI3SM, will conduct 3
clinical studies to address incident maternal HIV infections during pregnancy and breastfeeding and
(re)engage pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV frequently missed by traditional HIV care. Our
research projects will be supported by an Administrative Core, an Implementation Science Core and a Data
Science and Analytical Core. Our accumulated experience with EMTCT research in Malawi since 2002;
established local partnerships; cross disciplinary expertise in clinical research, epidemiology, implementation
and behavior science; and our synergistic projects put us in a superb position to impact MTCT by addressing
the following aims: Aim 1. (Research Program) Conduct 3 synergistic research projects focused on
addressing gaps in the EMTCT cascade that collectively expand HIV treatment and prevention in pregnancy
and postpartum to avert maternal and infant infections.Aim 1a. Project 1 (PrEP in Pregnancy) To evaluate
maternal and infant safety of PrEP regimens in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Cabotegravir (CAB)
injectable PrEP represents a substantial advance over daily oral PrEP7 and could dramatically reduce new
maternal infections. But CAB has not been systematically studied in pregnant and lactating women. We will
establish a national registry of CAB and TDF/FTC PrEP users who become pregnant alongside a safety cohort
of pregnant women receiving PrEP to compare pregnancy and infant outcomes. Aim 1b. Project 2
(Postpartum Prevention Package) To optimize post-partum HIV prevention including PrEP uptake and
persistence among at-risk lactating women to prevent primary HIV infection and subsequent infant infection
using a novel integrated task-shifting intervention strategy including partner engagement and testing, PrEP,
and community outreach. Aim 1c. Project 3 (PAC-Man) To evaluate reach and effectiveness of a novel
community-based service model, the “Point-of-care (POC) Active Case-finding & Management” (or
PAC-Man) model to identify and test infants missed through routine facility testing and determine
effectiveness and measure implementation outcomes including, adoption, implementation, sustainability, and
cost per pediatric HIV case identified. AIM 2. (Admin Core) Create a robust administrative structure to
implement and integrate research protocols efficiently and effectively, support the Implementation Science and
Data Science and Analytical Cores, and nurture existing rich partnerships with the sponsor, Ministry of Health
and HIV PEPFAR implementing partners. Aim 3. (Support Cores) To establish robust Implementation
Science and Data Science and Analytical Cores to provide support to the study projects, support Ministry of
Health program evaluation, and facilitate engagement of early-stage investigators through existing D43
capacity building programs. Broadly, we expect to identify successful implementation strategies with the
potential to achieve elimination of pediatric HIV in Malawi and beyond."
10888286,"Delivering meaningful, project-based learning for science and engineering in elementary
classrooms is increasingly recognized as essential for training the workforce required to solve
our most pressing health and environmental problems. However, many educators and
classrooms are not adequately supported with the funding, materials, or training necessary to
conduct and assess effective learning activities in these areas. Furthermore, even with such
support, many concepts are difficult to grasp. However, the use of interactive digital media
(IDM), specifically augmented reality (AR) holds great promise and shows results for addressing
this gap. This project’s long-term objective is to utilize AR to provide interactive, collaborative
game-based activities that are feasible for delivery across educational settings and in particular
for low resource communities. Furthermore, with each content area students and teachers will
have the opportunity to appreciate the nature and behavior of scientific systems while also
solving problems through design-thinking for real-life applications. The project aligns with the
NIH mission by developing the scientific human resources at the critical elementary age with the
knowledge and skill sets necessary to study, understand, and impact systems for better health
outcomes. This SBIR Phase II project will expand the impact of the framework and infrastructure
from the mobile application developed in Phase I for simulation-based learning; design and
critical-thinking; and increasing diversity and inclusion in STEM. The first specific aim focuses
on the feedback capabilities. Each interaction provides evidence to trigger formative feedback
for the student and realtime support based on students' AR actions and requests. The second
specific aim develops the visualization dashboard to provide actionable insights for educators.
These first two aims propose to research, develop, and refine the machine learning or artificial
intelligence algorithms and user interfaces for critical student feedback and educator
dashboards for content specific knowledge and design and problem-solving processes,
targeting troubleshooting and prototyping. The third specific aim is to develop the software and
hardware systems necessary to increase the impact of the technology through both curricular
expansion and hardware compatibility. The curricular areas of focus would include magnetism,
sound (auditory) and light waves (optical) as well as bioengineering. The expanded technology
and activities will be tested throughout design and development for feasibility. Each aim is
anchored through student and educator classroom testing essential to provide a commercially
viable and educationally effective product."
10901952,"PROJECT SUMMARY, ABSTRACT
The objective of this program is to develop broadly effective chemistry for the stereocontrolled chemical
synthesis of complex structures of use to chemists and medicinal chemists. The research plan is divided into
two Specific Aims, each opening access to distinct classes of natural products. Aim 1 describes the
development of an unexplored, dearomative-Claisen rearrangement, which allows functionalization of the C2
position of indoles, thereby enabling the stereocontrolled, asymmetric synthesis of 2,2-disubstituted indoline
derivatives. This new Claisen rearrangement transform will be incorporated into the design of efficient
strategies to indoline-containing natural products. Aim 2 presents the development of two [4+3]-cycloaddition
based routes for the synthesis of indole-fused cycloheptanes and the application of this chemistry to the
synthesis of the intricate and bioactive ambiguine natural products. The research plan is supported throughout
with compelling preliminary results, and the synthesis applications are designed to make maximal use of the
methodology, while addressing unmet synthetic challenges posed by the complex targets. The new chemistry
is expected to be broadly useful to organic and pharmaceutical chemists involved in drug development,
chemical synthesis, and natural product research. The final products of the total synthesis efforts and many
advanced intermediates will be submitted to a screening facility for biological testing. The proposed projects
will provide excellent training to graduate students and postdoctoral associates in chemical synthesis and
problem solving, preparing them for successful careers in the pharmaceutical industry and academia."

10818543,"Hexanucleotide repeat translation in ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia
The most common genetic cause of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) is an intronic GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72
(C9FTD/ALS). Despite its position within an intron, the C9orf72 repeat triggers synthesis of dipeptide
repeat proteins (DPRs) via a process known as Repeat Associated Non-AUG (RAN) Translation. Studies
by our group and others over the past decade have defined key mechanistic parameters that regulate
RAN translational initiation and identified selective modulators of RAN translation that suppress disease
relevant phenotypes in model systems.
In this renewal application, we will address two key questions. 1) What mRNA template(s) are used for
C9RAN translation endogenously? Some data suggests that repeat-containing lariats are stabilized and
translated. We propose an alternative model where aberrant transcription initiation within the intron itself
generates linear 5’ M7G capped mRNA species that robustly support RAN translation. 2) What impact
does repeat RNA structure have on C9RAN translational initiation and elongation? Our preliminary
studies suggest that both repeat RNA structure dynamics and ribosomal quality control (RQC) pathways
act as critical modulators of RAN translation by eliciting ribosomal stalling and altering translational
initiation and elongation rates.
Our central hypothesis is that GC-rich repeats generate aberrant mRNA species whose RNA structure
directly influences their capacity for translation and neurotoxicity. Our goals are to determine the relative
contributions of different potential endogenous mRNA species to C9RAN translation and the impact of
repeat RNA structure on RAN translational efficiency and RQC engagement. Our central premise is that
a detailed understanding of C9RAN translation will both uncover potential therapeutic targets for repeat
expansion disorders including C9 FTD/ALS and reveal novel biological insights into aberrant translation
events in neurons. In sum, this work will rigorously explore the mechanisms underlying C9 RAN
translation, enhance our understanding of protein translational dynamics in neurons and repeat
expansion disorder pathogenesis while simultaneously providing a rational path towards therapeutic
development in ALS and FTD."
10885915,"Project Summary:
 Fatal opioid overdose is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and in 2021 more
than 60% of drug overdose deaths were associated with fentanyl and its analogs. While current pharmacological
treatments for opioid use disorder are effective, stigma and limited access make these medications underutilized
and rates of relapse are still high. Despite the prevalence of illicit fentanyl use, there are very few studies
investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying fentanyl seeking. Advancing our understanding of the
neural circuits underlying fentanyl seeking may facilitate the development of novel treatments for fentanyl use
disorder and reduce fentanyl overdose deaths. Recently, we showed that systemic administration of the
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist Exendin-4 (Ex-4) attenuates fentanyl reinstatement, a model
of relapse. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of Ex-4 on fentanyl seeking are
unclear. Our exciting pilot studies demonstrate that activation of GLP-1Rs in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN),
a brain region known to regulate the mesolimbic dopamine system, is sufficient to attenuate fentanyl-seeking
behavior during abstinence in male and female rats. Additionally, we discovered µ opioid receptors and GLP-
1Rs expressed on GABAergic neurons that project from the IPN to the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg),
a nucleus that sends projections to the VTA and plays an important role in drug seeking and opioid-induced
reward. These results highlight a neural circuit that may mediate the suppressive effects of GLP-1R agonists on
fentanyl seeking. However, the activity of this circuit during fentanyl-seeking behavior has not been investigated.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of acute fentanyl and Ex-4 on neural activity in the GABAergic
IPNàLDTg pathway and the relationship between such activity and fentanyl-seeking behavior. To investigate
the role of the GABAergic IPNàLDTg projection in fentanyl reinstatement, Aim 1 will use in vivo calcium imaging
to characterize the real-time activity of GABAergic IPN projections to the LDTg during fentanyl-seeking behavior.
Aim 2 will determine how Ex-4 pharmacotherapy alters calcium activity of GABAergic IPNàLDTg projections to
reduce fentanyl seeking. Successful completion of these aims will be an important foundation for future studies
investigating the neural basis of fentanyl seeking. Ideally, results from this work will suggest novel therapeutic
avenues for fentanyl use disorder. Completion of this fellowship will achieve the training goals of expanding the
technical expertise of Ms. Herman in addiction neuroscience and facilitate her career goal of becoming a leading
researcher in the neurobiology of substance use disorders."
10895288,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are genetic disorders caused by monogenic germline mutations and have broad
clinical manifestations. Here, we present two patients affected by pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), an extremely
rare and severe neutrophilic necrotic skin disorder, without severe systemic autoinflammatory symptoms. Whole
exome sequencing (WES) revealed a homozygous R57C OTULIN missense mutation in each patient. OTULIN
encodes a deubiquitinase that is the only known enzyme that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin chains that
have been added to target proteins by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). The balance
between removal and addition of ubiquitin is crucial for immune homeostasis and responses to infection.
Previously reported germline OTULIN mutations affect this protein’s catalytic domain and cause a severe
systemic autoinflammatory largely driven by overactivation of NF-B signaling called OTULIN-related
autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Here, we define a new monogenic disease caused by mutations in a
different domain of OTULIN and causing a distinct clinical phenotype. We have demonstrated that the R57C
mutation prevents OTULIN from binding to the LUBAC component HOIP but the ability to downregulate NF-B
activity remains intact suggesting a context-specific function of OTULIN. These patients’ unique phenotype
suggests that a previously unrecognized function for OTULIN in the skin. The overall hypothesis of this proposal
is that OTULIN’s function in keratinocytes differs from that in other cellular contexts, and this novel
mutation leads to development of pyoderma gangrenosum in patients. We will use computational method
and cutting-edge in vitro and ex vivo approaches to identify the roles of post-translational modification in
regulating OTULIN-dependent immune signaling. This discovery adds to the emerging spectrum of human
diseases caused by defects in the ubiquitin pathway and suggests a role for targeted cytokine therapies for
maintaining immune homeostasis."
10852840,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Global histone deacetylation is linked to many types of cancer and is controlled by histone deacetylases
(HDACs). Although HDAC inhibitors are widely used in cancer treatment, their activity does not target specific
HDAC isoforms nor specific genes and therefore results in significant side effects for patients. Thus, there is a
pressing need to target HDAC activity in a highly precise, gene-specific manner to develop safer and more
effective treatments. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand how HDACs are recruited to specific
genome regions. Because HDACs do not possess intrinsic DNA binding activity, they are thought to be recruited
to chromatin through interactions with DNA binding proteins, though this mechanism has not been fully explored.
Recently, our lab and others identified that the SHARP RNA-binding protein directly interacts with the Xist long
noncoding RNA (lncRNA) to specifically recruit HDAC3 to the future inactive X chromosome (Xi). In this way, the
Xist-SHARP/SMRT/HDAC3 repressive complex deacetylates histones and silences gene expression on the Xi.
Our lab has also demonstrated that SHARP localizes to many nuclear sites (beyond the Xi) in an RNA-dependent
manner, raising the question of which additional RNAs recruit it (along with HDAC3) and to what specific genomic
locations. Notably, nearly all human HDACs associate within multi-protein complexes containing SHARP and
other RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that this mechanism of RNA-guidance may extend beyond SHARP and
Xist.
I hypothesize that HDAC complexes are recruited by RNAs to achieve specificity to their various regulatory
targets throughout the nucleus. First, I will determine which SHARP-RNA interactions are functionally important
by genetically perturbing the SHARP binding sites of candidate RNAs. I will then measure effects on gene
expression and if HDAC3 activity is required for these effects (Aim 1). Second, I will comprehensively identify
RNA-binding proteins associated with other cancer-associated HDACs and define their in vivo RNA binding sites.
I will then determine which protein-bound candidate RNAs from this screen are regulated in an HDAC-dependent
manner (Aim 2). The proposed research has the potential to transform our understanding of RNAs and RNA-
binding proteins as central regulators in organizing chromatin modifications by HDACs in both normal and
cancerous cell states."

10915665,"Project Summary
Macromolecular interactions are the basis of cellular processes. Structural characterization of these interactions
is important for better understanding of these processes and for our ability to manipulate them. The number of
macromolecular interactions in a cell is significantly larger than the number of individual macromolecules.
Structures of their assemblies are more difficult to determine experimentally than that of the individual molecules,
which further emphasizes the role of modeling in reconstruction of life processes. The project will advance our
understanding of macromolecular interaction and will facilitate development of better tools for their modeling.
The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) Resources for development of docking techniques, (2) Resources for
knowledge-based docking, and (3) Assessment of predicted interactions and CAPRI community-wide
experiment. Our long-term goals are: (a) development of resources and tools for reliable cell-scale modeling of
macromolecular interactions, which will account for dynamic changes in the molecular structures and kinetics of
association, and (b) application of these resources and tools to structural modeling of a cell, a new frontier and
a grand challenge of computational structural biology. The focus of the proposal is further development of the
integrated resource for studying macromolecular interactions. The DOCKGROUND system will be radically
expanded and diversified to become an ultimate resource for structural modeling of cellular processes, and
eventually the cell itself. The DOCKGROUND system of databases of soluble protein-protein complexes will extend
to other types of macromolecules, to serve as a source of knowledge on molecular recognition and a data
resource for docking procedures. The core of the resource will consist of regularly updated and maintained sets
of experimentally determined macromolecular complexes. The databases of unbound and modeled structures,
built upon the core bound set, will be significantly expanded and improved to advance their role in comprehensive
benchmarking for the development of docking methodologies. The database of docking decoys will provide
community-wide scoring benchmark and an important resource for development of new docking tools.
Downloadable template sets and libraries of rotamers and rotamer transition probabilities will be valuable
resources for data-driven docking. The automated template set updater will maintain the template sets for all
types of macromolecules in the expanded and diversified DOCKGROUND resource. The rotamer libraries and
rotamer-rotamer transition probabilities will be recalculated according to the growth of the DOCKGROUND sets.
Automated assessment protocols will be developed in a joint effort with the CAPRI blind prediction experiment.
The resource will integrate the developed databases and assessment protocols, with a user-friendly interface,
combining options to build customized sets of complexes based on various criteria, easily accessible and
downloadable standard sets, visualization, and assessment tools."
10873360,"Over 30M people in the U.S. suffer from diabetes; one-third have CKD and almost half of incident ESRD is
due to diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Albuminuria and decreased GFR reflect glomerular dysfunction, and are
risks for DKD progression. However, tubular atrophy is superior to glomerular pathology as a predictor of DKD
progression. The mechanisms for loss of tubular epithelial cells have not been established.
 Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) circulate bound to albumin, or as triglycerides. Neither is filtered due to
their size. Low concentrations of filtered NEFA are reabsorbed by apical scavenger transporters in the proximal
tubule. This segment normally uses NEFA as metabolic substrates that are taken up across the basolateral
membrane. In DKD, injured glomeruli permit filtration of albumin-bound NEFA in large quantities, which are
then reabsorbed by apical proximal tubule transporters, causing accumulation of NEFA, long-chain acyl-CoAs,
and apoptosis. Apical NEFA uptake is mediated primarily by fatty acid transport protein-2 (FATP2), and at
NEFA concentrations that mimic DKD in vitro, is cytotoxic. Basolateral NEFA uptake is FATP2-independent
and not cytotoxic.
 We showed that global FATP2 deletion in genetic and inducible mouse models of DKD improves GFR,
tubular atrophy and plasma glucose, but the mechanisms are not understood. First, FATP2 deletion does not
completely block AP proximal tubule NEFA uptake. Second, how FATP2 deletion account for the enhanced
synthesis and decreased degradation of NEFA associated with DKD, has not been reconciled.
 In DKD proximal tubules accumulate lipid droplets (LD), which store excess NEFA to prevent lipotoxicity.
Perilipin (Plin) proteins facilitate LD assembly and maintenance. Plin5 augments LD docking with mitochondria,
thereby enhancing autophagy, reducing ER stress and apoptosis, and shifts metabolism from -oxidation to
lipid storage and glucose utilization. Our data show that proximal tubule Plin5 expression is blunted in DKD,
and increased with FATP2 deletion. Plin5 overexpression inhibited, and Plin5 loss of function exacerbated
lipoapoptosis. These data suggest that the beneficial effect of FATP2 deletion is partly due to enhanced
expression of Plin5. We also propose that Plin5 mediates metabolic reprogramming from -oxidation to
glycolysis and decreased gluconeogenesis, which would mediate the hypoglycemic effects of FATP2 deletion.
 Hypothesis: In DKD-associated glomerular injury, constitutive basolateral NEFA transport, combined with
apical FATP2-regulated proximal tubule NEFA uptake leads to lipotoxicity, tubular atrophy and progressive
DKD. Tubular atrophy can be circumvented by proximal tubule FATP2 deletion or enhanced Plin5-dependent
lipid droplet expansion. The hypothesis will be pursued with the following specific aims: 1. To determine
whether proximal tubule FATP2 mediates lipotoxicity and DKD progression. 2. To determine the role of Plin5 in
proximal tubule metabolism and DKD. 3. To determine the therapeutic utility of FATP2 inhibition in DKD."
10927344,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Increasing evidence suggests an immunologic link between cancer and autoimmunity. The immune system is
able to reject cancer through recognition of altered self-antigens; however, recognition of self-antigens in healthy
tissues could lead to autoimmunity. Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis (SSc), offers a unique opportunity to
study this relationship since patients with autoantibodies to RNA polymerase III (RPC1) have an increased risk
of cancer coincident with SSc onset. Genetic alterations (somatic mutations or loss of heterozygosity, LOH)
within the RNA polymerase III locus (protein name RPC1) were identified in cancers from anti-RPC1+ SSc
patients and distinct populations of CD4+ T cells were detected that recognized normal and mutated versions of
RPC1. Together, these observations suggest that antitumor immunity initiated against the mutated RPC1 protein
could cross-react with the wild-type protein and lead to SSc. While CD4+ T cells are critical in orchestrating anti-
tumor immune responses, CD8+ T cells are critical for eliminating tumor cells. Moreover, the observed LOH
suggests that tumor immunoediting driven by RPC1-specific CD8+ T cells occurred in these patients, and at the
same time, there is increasing evidence implicating CD8+ T cells in SSc pathogenesis. An important outstanding
question remains: whether RPC1-specific cytotoxic T cells can be identified in patients with SSc and cancer.
This proposal seeks to investigate RPC1-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and target tissues of
patients with SSc and cancer. Aim 1 will examine RPC1-specific CD8+ T cells that are directly involved in both
the antitumor response at the site of the cancer as well as in the autoimmune damage of affected skin tissue
from SSc patients. In Aim 2, the frequency, phenotype, and effector molecules of RPC1-specific CD8+T-cells
will be studied and correlated with cancer status. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the effect of anti-RPC1
autoantibodies on cross-presentation, and potential differences between anti-RPC1+ SSc patients with and
without history of cancer. The results of this study will lay the foundation for future studies exploring whether
CD8+ T cell responses to RPC1 could be used as targeted monitoring tools and the RPC1 CD8+ T cell epitopes
as antigen-specific immunotherapies for SSc, as well as inform the study of other cancer-associated rheumatic
diseases. This K08 proposal is designed to promote the career development of the candidate to an independent
investigator. To successfully carry out this proposal, she has assembled an outstanding team of mentors, each
of whom brings distinct expertise to her project and her scientific development. Moreover, this proposal takes
advantage of the rich resources of the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center. Building on the candidate’s previous
experience studying antigen-specific T cell immunology and antigen processing, this K08 award will enable her
to gain additional skills in bioinformatics important for the conduct of translational immunology, develop expertise
in the specific niche of autoreactive CD8+ T cells as it pertains to autoimmunity and cancer, and acquire the data
and publications necessary to support a strong R01 application."

of providing a critical bridge between the biological sciences and experimental therapeutics. In order to
achieve this objective, the training program emphasizes a didactic curriculum in clinical research
methodology, mentor-supervised clinical and basic science research experiences, and ongoing Scholar
monitoring and feedback. All Scholars are assigned a clinical trial project during the course of the training
program. All 40 clinical and laboratory mentors participating in this training program have extensive
experience in neuro-oncology research and training, active research funding, and provide an excellent
resource for Scholars interested in translational research. All Scholars have access to dedicated biostatistical
and computing support on all projects. An Internal Advisory Committee, as well as an External Advisory
Committee, oversee the training program. There is no significant overlap between our unique grant focused
on nervous system tumors and other training grants at Harvard focused on medical oncology. Candidates
include physicians completing clinical training in adult and pediatric neuro-oncology, adult and pediatric
neurosurgical oncology, adult and pediatric medical oncology and radiation oncology. A qualified pool of
applicants from these disciplines can be expected to grow from existing and developing sources. Each
Scholar has a dedicated two-year block for research and training with minimal clinical responsibilities. Four
postdoctoral positions are requested per year for five years with each Scholar making a two-year commitment
to investigation. Applicants will be solicited through advertisements, and by active recruitment by the program
and individual faculty. The training program remains committed to recruitment of a diverse Scholar pool. We
believe that the proposed training program capitalizes on a group of outstanding mentors and superb training
facilities and will have the capability to produce productive patient-oriented researchers in neuro-oncology.
Since the original award 20 years ago, the quality of the program has steadily improved based upon such
metrics as diversity in Scholar clinical specialties, Scholar publications, Scholar academic positions, Scholar
leadership of national clinical trials, and Scholar grant awards."
10886587,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common, chronic, and debilitating psychiatric condition in Veterans.
Beyond psychiatric features, PTSD has been linked multiple physical health conditions due to poorer health
behaviors and dysregulation of biological processes such as immune dysregulation and chronic inflammation.
Prior evidence has indicated an association between PTSD and risk for autoimmune (AI) conditions, a group of
over 80 complex diseases involving self-reactive immune responses. However, research linking PTSD and AI
disease risk has largely focused on only a few prevalent AI conditions, has not estimated potential causal
relationships, has been in European mostly White samples, and has not examined risk or mitigating factors.
Causal methods, such as marginal structural modeling, can account for time-varying factors in observational
data to better estimate causal links between factors, providing more precise inferences than prior associational
studies. Additionally, research is needed to determine associations between PTSD and all AI diseases, which
are largely heterogeneous but share underlying etiology. Indeed, determining links between PTSD and certain
forms of AI dysregulation may point to patterns of immune processes that underlie disease risk. Given higher
rates of PTSD and some AI diseases in racial or ethnic minority groups, it is necessary to explore potential
health disparities in associations between PTSD and AI disease. Moreover, other important risk or protective
factors influencing AI disease risk in PTSD can be examined empirically by utilizing a large clinical sample and
testing multiple predictors in a machine learning context. Relatedly, no studies have determined whether
treatment for PTSD, such as antidepressants or evidence-based psychotherapy, may mitigate AI disease risk
among individuals with PTSD. This study is designed to respond to these gaps in the literature by estimating
causal associations between PTSD and AI disease in a large, diverse sample of US Veterans. The first aim is
to estimate the causal impact of PTSD on AI disease risk (e.g., any AI disease, individual AI conditions) and
examining the effect of psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., multiple psychiatric diagnoses) on AI disease. The second
aim is to determine whether race and ethnicity modify the association between PTSD and AI disease and to
use data-driven methods to explore clinical factors that increase or mitigate risk for AI disease in those with
PTSD. The third aim is to investigate whether receiving treatment (e.g., antidepressant medications,
psychotherapy) for PTSD attenuates risk for AI disease compared to those with PTSD not receiving treatment.
For all aims, data from national VA electronic health records (EHR) of approximately 9 million Veterans will be
accessed and analyzed to identify diagnoses of PTSD, AI disease, and relevant covariates across time. We
will apply marginal structural models, machine learning algorithms for feature selection, and logistic regression
with propensity score matching to address the aims. Aligned with the research aims, the training aims will
support my development as an independent researcher, including to develop: 1) knowledge of clinical PTSD
pathology and treatment; 2) expertise in psychoneuroimmunological processes in PTSD; 3) understanding of
AI disorders and their etiology; and 4) proficiency in big data methods including implementing causal inference
and machine learning in large-scale EHR data. My research and training aims will be supported by an excellent
mentorship team of interdisciplinary researchers and will be conducted at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs

10850858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) has revolutionized the treatment of HIV but ART regimens are not
without drawbacks. Cost, the need for daily administration, side effects, and social stigma all contribute to
reduced patient compliance. Moreover, despite treatment, some 15-55% of people living with HIV will develop
some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).
Because of these problems with ART regimens, we and many other investigators have been studying the use
of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy vectors to deliver antibodies and other HIV
therapeutics to people living with HIV. Because expression from these vectors is essentially permanent;
patients could be protected for life from HIV infections with only a single AAV treatment (i.e. a ‘functional’
cure). Although numerous nonhuman primate experiments and two human clinical trials have been conducted
to study the use of AAV for functional cure, however, we are unaware of any efforts to determine whether or
not rAAV-expressed biologics can prevent or treat HAND.
We have developed an anti-HIV biologic called eCD4, a fusion of CD4-Ig with a carboxy-terminal co-receptor
(CCR5/CXCR4) mimetic peptide. We hypothesize that eCD4 is uniquely suited to preventing replication of
the neurotropic strains of HIV that preferentially infect the brain (macrophage-tropic isolates) because these
viruses necessarily evolve high affinity for CD4 to compensate for the low abundance of CD4 on macrophages
and microglia.
The organizing hypothesis of this project, then, is to determine if rAAV-delivered eCD4, either expressed from
the periphery or within the central nervous system, can prevent or treat HAND. To test this hypothesis, we
will use a pigtail macaque model of SIV-induced central nervous system disease, developed in our
laboratories, in which co-infection with an immunosuppressive swarm (SIV/DeltaB670) and neurotropic clone
(SIV/17E-Fr) establishes a highly reproducible CNS infection. Animals will be treated with ART until aviremic
and rAAV will be used to deliver a pigtail macaque version of eCD4 to skeletal muscle and/or brain tissue.
ART will be withdrawn to determine whether or not rAAV/eCD4 can prevent the re-emergence of CNS viremia.
If successful, these studies may open new avenues to the functional cure of HIV and treatment of HAND."
10875620,"Summary/abstract. Leptospirosis is a globally important neglected disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira.
It is estimated to cause more than 1 million global cases annually with a 5-20% case-fatality rate, significant
morbidity, and important public health consequences. Currently there is no safe and effective vaccine to
prevent human leptospirosis. LeptoX, Inc. proposes to develop the first human leptospirosis vaccine.
Pathogenic Leptospira are extracellular organisms, but mechanisms by which they exert their pathogenetic
effects were unclear until our discovery of the leptospiral Virulence Modifying (VM) proteins’ cytotoxin function,
followed by our demonstration of the potential for VM proteins to be the antigen components of a pan-
leptospirosis vaccine. Severe human leptospirosis has almost exclusively been reported to be due to strains of
L. interrogans. This proposal focuses on a L. interrogans VM protein-based leptospirosis vaccine, although
cross species protection may be possible. Recently published animal model data demonstrated that as few as
two recombinant VM proteins provide robust cross-serovar protection from disease/death after lethal L.
interrogans challenge in mice. These data indicate strong potential for VM proteins as pan-L. interrogans
protective antigens. In this Phase I, we will optimize dose, delivery and composition of recombinant E. coli-
produced VM proteins in combination with human-compatible adjuvant to determine protective efficacy in the
lethal hamster challenge model of leptospirosis. In Aim 1, we will produce recombinant tagless VM protein
immunogens, analyze their immunogenicity and, in the standard hamster model, compare their protective
efficacy to standard, commercially available bacterin vaccines; contingency experiments will also assess
chemically inactivated wild type proteins and proteins purified from inclusion bodies as alternative forms of the
VM protein immunogen; structural modeling suggests that VM protein disulfide bond-dependent conformation
may not be critical for antigenicity. In Aim 2, we will compare wild type and genetically mutated toxoid-forms of
tagless, recombinant E. coli-produced VM proteins in the lethal hamster model.
Protective immune responses
for both Aims will be assessed by protection from clinical disease and death and by determination of bacterial
load and viability in liver and kidney at various time points. Biomarkers of protective immunity (i.e., antibody
titers against the prototype vaccine antigens and cross-reactivity among serovars and between different
Leptospira species’ VM proteins) will be measured; the putative antibody-mediated protective mechanism of
immunity will be tested by passive transfer experiments. At the end of this Phase I project, we will have
developed final pan-L. interrogans VM-protein-based vaccine prototypes for further animal testing. Following
Phase I, this prototype will be tested in dog clinical trials, which will lead to a first commercial product for these
companion animals. Animal vaccine development will lead towards FDA IND submission for a human
leptospirosis vaccine, upon which strategic partnerships for leptospirosis vaccine development will be formed."
10914867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that meaningfully
affect disease progression once symptoms manifest. This has shifted the focus to early detection and
intervention, which is thought by many researchers to offer the best chance of slowing or stopping the
progression of AD. However, trials aimed at averting the underlying causes of disease have proven difficult
because pathological changes in AD happen well in advance of cognitive decline. A widely-available genetic
risk prediction mode (GRPM) for determining AD risk early in life, while prevention might still be possible,
would allow early treatment intervention, life planning, enrollment in clinical trials, and improved patient
stratification for testing treatment effectiveness. However, despite recent advancements, GRPMs for late-onset
AD lack sufficient discrimination ability to support such applications, especially in non-European populations.
Given the lack of effective treatments once symptoms have manifested and the socioeconomic consequences
at stake, there is a serious unmet need for a widely-available GRPM able to accurately assess a patient’s risk
in middle age or earlier, before neurodegeneration begins.
 To address this need, Parabon has developed a GRPM able to accurately predict an individual’s risk of
developing AD at various ages. This model will be commercialized as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic test
that can be used by individuals to learn about their future risk and by researchers to recruit and stratify subjects
for clinical trials. The Phase II model combines machine learning, a polygenic risk score, and deep learning
and achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with an AUC of 0.83 in cross-validation and 0.80 in an
independent replication set. However, this model, like most genetic risk scores, was built using only subjects of
European descent and thus has reduced accuracy in non-Europeans. The first Aim of this Phase IIB project is
to enhance our feature selection and predictive modeling pipeline to detect and utilize genetic variants both
across and within ancestral groups. We will implement a novel approach to encoding ancestry information and
searching for epistatic interactions between genetic variants on different ancestral backgrounds. The second
Aim is to determine how best to communicate the results of the risk prediction to a consumer in a manner that
is informative and culturally sensitive while also managing emotional impact, followed by a usability evaluation,
engagement with the community, prototyping of the service that will form the foundation of the service that will
be made available to customers, and a pilot study."

Title: Accelerating Gene Therapy and Editing with Advanced MS-Based Data Analysis for Nonstandard and
Hybrid Nucleotide Sequences
This project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing
oligonucleotide-based therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education
worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and
mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. Direct sequencing via high-resolution mass
spectrometry is an essential assay in the development and QA/ manufacturing of these therapeutics but
manual intervention in the data analysis pipeline due to inadequate software has caused a bottleneck in the
process of getting these life-saving therapeutics to those in need. Similarly, in-depth characterization of RNA
and their modifications needed for improving biomarker identification is hindered in the RNA research
community.
To address these challenges, semi-automated direct sequencing of oligonucleotides by mass spectrometry will
be implemented and delivered on MassMatrix’s high-throughput, enterprise cloud platform (mmCloud).
Enhancements to MassMatrix’s oligonucleotide sequencing engine will be made for characterizing nonstandard,
hybrid and conjugate oligonucleotides. A unified data repository on mmCloud will enable assay comparisons,
knowledge capture and management, and collaboration within and across research teams. Together, these
aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the
oligonucleotide characterization bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper
understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on
downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety, efficacy and availability of life-
saving and enhancing therapeutics."
10697493,"Gut mucosal injury occurs commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and critical surgical disorders such as trauma, massive thermal injuries, sepsis, and emergent
surgical operations. Effective therapies to preserve the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and
enhance recovery of damaged mucosa in patients with critical illnesses are limited; because of
poorly understood mechanisms underlying gut mucosal injury and repair. Achieving a better
understanding of the pathogenesis of mucosal injury/erosions and developing effective therapies
to protect the epithelium from injury and promote repair after wounding in patients with critical
illness are still urgent challenges. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate a variety of
biological functions and are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases.
Although emerging evidence increasingly points to the importance of lncRNAs in maintaining gut
epithelial integrity, their exact roles in the mechanisms regulating intestinal mucosal repair after
injury remain largely unknown.
 Recent studies also reveal that mitochondrial metabolism is essential for maintaining
intestinal epithelial integrity, while targeted deletion of mitochondrial prohibitin-1 and Hsp60
causes murine ileitis. By using genome-wide profile analysis, we identified hundreds of
lncRNAs, including uc.230 and growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5), which are differentially
expressed in the intestinal mucosa in response to pathological stress. Our preliminary studies
indicate that a) after wounding, ulcerative colitis (uc).230 is required for intestinal mucosal repair
whereas GAS5 induction delays epithelial recovery; and b) silencing uc.230 or overexpressing
GAS5 results in mitochondrial dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells. Based on our exciting
observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that uc.230 and GAS5 regulate intestinal mucosal repair after
injury by altering mitochondrial function. Three specific aims are designed to test this
hypothesis: 1) to define the exact roles of uc.230 and GAS5 in regulating intestinal mucosal
repair after injury in critical pathological conditions; 2) to determine whether uc.230 and GAS5
modulate injury-induced intestinal mucosal regeneration by altering mitochondrial metabolism;
and 3) to define the mechanisms whereby cellular levels of uc.230 and GAS5 are regulated in
response to pathological stress. Completion of these specific aims will provide a substantial
conceptual advance by linking lncRNA-mediated changes in mitochondrial metabolism with
injury-induced regeneration of the intestinal epithelium and will create a fundamental basis for
developing novel therapies to preserve intestinal epithelial integrity and enhance mucosal repair
in the clinical setting for Veterans with critical illnesses."
10906122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As a ubiquitous HSP90 paralog in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GRP94 plays important roles in protein quality
control in the secretory pathway by participating in both the unfolded protein response and the ER-associated
protein degradation pathway. My laboratory has demonstrated that GRP94 is a strategically important target for
cancer, because it controls multiple key molecular pathways in cell growth, migration, immune tolerance and
differentiation, including integrins, TLRs, IGF-II, Wnt co-receptor LRP6, and GARP (or LRRC32). GARP
(Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant) is responsible for surface docking and activation of latent TGFb and
a focus of this proposal We have made significant contributions to this area through immunological and
biochemical studies, including: 1) that GARP is an important molecule for cancer immune evasion via regulating
multiple cell types (e.g., cancer cells, platelets, regulatory T cells, B cells). 2) We discovered a novel mechanism
of TGFb activation from cell surface GARP-TGFb complex via proteolytic cleavage of GARP. 3) GARP has been
found to be aberrantly expressed in multiple human cancers to promote oncogenesis via both cancer cell-intrinsic
and -extrinsic mechanisms. 4) Preclinical studies suggest that GARP is a novel therapeutic target for cancer
immunotherapy. These accomplishments have deepened our conviction that the study of GRP94 and its client
network will lead to better understanding of this chaperone biology in cancer and to development of novel cancer
therapeutics, alone or in combination with approved immunotherapeutic agents. In the next phase of the study,
we will address the hypothesis that GRP94/GARP-targeted therapy applied to multiple vulnerable cancers will
overcome immune resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
First, we will determine the roles and molecular mechanism involved in GRP94 regulation of TGFb biogenesis,
activation and signaling. This aim will focus on structural analysis of the GRP94-GARP complex, and on resolving
mechanisms of GRP94 in folding two other molecules important in regulating TGFb signaling: LRRC33 and
LRG1. Second, we will develop novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies targeting GRP94 and GARP. The
goal is to advance the top first-in-class agent(s) among several pre-clinical leads through a milestone-driven
strategy. This includes agents to inhibit GARP cleavage, GARP-specific antibodies, drug-like GRP94-selective
inhibitors, antibodies against the cell surface GRP94 (ectoGRP94) preferentially expressed on cancer cells, and
T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) composed of a single-chain antibody against
ectoGRP94 fused with T cell signaling motifs (GRP94-CAR-T). Overall, the impact of this study lies in
fundamental understanding of GRP94 in regulating the TGFb pathway and in developing promising next
generation immunotherapeutic agents."

Urological Epidemiology (UCSF-KPNC UroEpi) K12 Program provides rigorous training, multidisciplinary
mentoring, and career support to junior faculty developing high-impact epidemiological research programs in
non-malignant urological conditions. Our institutions will continue to collaborate successfully to provide faculty
with the mentoring, skills, and experience they need to achieve success as epidemiologic investigators.
Scholars will continue to be based at UCSF and the KPNC Division of Research, both with robust scientific
infrastructures, where they will be able to access an unparalleled set of data resources, including data from the
entire KPNC patient population. The history of collaboration between our institutions and Program Directors will
perpetuate our superb track record of developing future leaders in urological epidemiology.
Training and Pipeline: This highly structured program includes comprehensive mentoring, rigorous didactic
training, career development activities, and hands-on research. Each Scholar benefits from an individually-
tailored, multidisciplinary training program, with available programs including a certificate program, masters or
PhD degree program in research methods and/or epidemiology, mentored work-in-progress and career
development seminar series, and diverse specialized courses. We have also identified over a dozen Research
Program Areas in non-malignant urology that leverage the UCSF-KPNC environments' diversity, direct access
to real-life clinicians and patients, and mentors' methodological and content area strengths. With UCSF's
diverse array of training programs, including multiple earlier-stage research training programs directed at the
resident and postgraduate fellow level, we have an excellent pipeline of future, diverse K12 scholar candidates.
Program Progress: Since this program was launched less than four years ago, it has already been successful
in identifying exceptional Scholars from diverse backgrounds and guiding them to success in epidemiology
research. Our past and current UCSF Scholars have not only been productive in publications and research
accolades, but have also competed successfully for NIH funding. Along with our recently appointed and
pending Scholars, they also contribute to diverse perspectives in urological epidemiology research.
Innovation and Impact: This program's innovative pairing of a top tier academic center with a learning and
integrated health care system represents an excellent investment of NIDDK resources to catalyze the growth
of urological epidemiology research in a uniquely fertile environment. We will continue to build upon our long
history of collaborative, multidisciplinary research that complements other large projects supported by NIDDK,
such as O'Brien, MAPP, and LURN Centers. Thus, our environment enables our UroEpi Scholars and their
mentors to make unique research discoveries with important implications for clinical practice and public health."

Jennifer Lam PhD, MPH is an infectious disease epidemiologist whose research focuses on improving the
health of the aging HIV population. Her prior research has explored the impact of chronic disease on persons
living with HIV. She has recently extended her work to the evaluation of dementia in the context of HIV
infection. Mounting evidence suggests that people aging with HIV experience a unique trajectory of cognitive
decline despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy. This may be due to the combined effects of HIV-mediated
inflammation and non-HIV factors such as substance use, psychiatric comorbidity, and cardiovascular disease.
As many people with HIV in the U.S. are now over 50 years old, age-associated dementias will become an
increasingly critical health concern. To date, few studies have characterized dementia in older individuals with
well-controlled HIV infection. The proposed research aims to: 1) quantify the contribution of sociodemographic,
behavioral, and comorbidity-related factors to risk of dementia in people aged 50+ years with HIV compared to
those without HIV, 2) develop and validate a model to predict incident dementia in people with HIV, using
electronic health record data and incorporating HIV-specific factors such as HIV infection severity and duration,
and 3) develop strategies to optimize the clinical utility of a dementia prediction model. A major strength of the
proposed research is that initial model development and validation will be conducted within a large healthcare
system with a well-characterized older population with HIV and stable, longitudinal follow-up. This will be
followed by validation in an external HIV cohort to assess generalizability, development of a prototype clinician-
facing risk stratification tool, and stakeholder interviews to obtain input on future clinical implementation. Novel
components of the research include characterization of dementia risk in a community-based sample of people
with HIV, comparison with HIV-uninfected individuals from the same setting, and use of advanced analytics to
evaluate multiple longitudinal predictors of dementia using primary care data in electronic health records. To
support the proposed research and Dr. Lam’s goal of future independent research in HIV and dementia, this
K01 proposal includes a formal, mentored training program to develop skills in: 1) the evaluation of risk factors
for neurocognitive disorders in people with HIV, 2) analytic modeling techniques for development and
validation of electronic health record data-based dementia prediction models, 3) translation and
implementation of research findings into clinical care settings, and 4) professional skills development. Trainings
will consist of coursework and tailored tutorials delivered by a mentorship team with combined expertise in HIV,
neurology, aging, biostatistics, and healthcare delivery science. The results of the proposed research will
inform strategies for dementia prevention in people with HIV and support plans to implement and test a
dementia risk stratification tool in clinical practice. It will also prepare Dr. Lam for a career as an independent
investigator conducting NIH-funded research on prevention and management of dementia in people with HIV."

(CSUF) and the University of California, Irvine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCI-CFCCC). The
specific aims are the same as the overall component, and include the following: to plan, implement and evaluate
a highly integrated and interactive cancer health disparities partnership between CSUF and UCI-CFCCC; to
conduct pilot cancer health disparities research projects involving at least one investigator at each institution that
advance knowledge regarding cancer health disparities, leading to the submission of competitive grant
applications by NIH/NCI and other federal/non-federal agencies; and to provide cancer research education to
underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to increase their understanding of cancer health
disparities, leading to a larger pool of highly talented future scientists from diverse backgrounds.
To accomplish this we will undertake a set of activities organized under four components. The Adminstrative
Core will be responsible for the overall administrative and fiscal aspects of all P20 activities, and will include the
Executive Committee and Internal Advisory Committee. Activities will be implemented in three stages: initial
planning, implementation, and evaluation. The evaluation effort will be spearheaded by an external evaluator
with expertise in multi-component center reviews. The long term goals of this collaborative partnership are to
diversity the cancer research workforce and ultimately increase our scientific impact to address the cancer health

The long-term goal of the Cancer-Related Education Program (CREP) is to increase the diversity of the cancer
research workforce by training undergraduate and master’s graduate students in cancer health disparities-
related research efforts, especially those from underrepresented groups. This objective will be accomplished
through providing education in the cancer health disparities field, including established facts as well as the
newest research exploring the interrelationships of biological components, socioeconomic factors, cultural
aspects, nutrition, stress, and the environment that result in certain groups bearing a disproportionate burden
of cancer. A profound understanding of the biological bases of cancer as well as of cancer disparities aspects
such as differences in incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality, quality of life while on treatment, length
of survivorship, and access to diagnosis will inspire students to pursue research career on these topics and
result in a highly diverse pool of highly talented future scientists from different backgrounds. The proposed
CSUF/UCI-CFCCC partnership is particularly suited for this goal because of our ethnically diverse student
populations and the high number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. CREP will consist of a 5-
term (undergraduates) or 3-term (graduates) path that will provide a comprehensive education. The specific
aims of the CREP are to: 1. Develop coursework paths and research experiences focused on cancer disparities
and other cancer topics; 2. Create synergistic educational components such as community building activities
and travel to research conferences; and 3. Establish outreach opportunities that help prepare CREP students
to succeed in transitioning to higher degree programs and inform faculty and students outside of the program
about the need to research and mitigate cancer health disparities. To accomplish these aims, we will undertake
a robust association between the two institutions. The educational paths will include instruction in basic
concepts and the newest research on cancer and cancer disparities. CREP scholars will also experience
summer research training in a laboratory of their choice within a rich list of opportunities at CSUF or UCI. In
addition to the documented benefits of supplemental coursework and research training, CREP students will
benefit from opportunities and experiences, offering them a variety of identity and community building activities
as well as travel to research conferences. Several outreach activities will be organized at CSUF and UCI to
disseminate information about the program and the importance of cancer research and cancer disparities. The
evaluation will capture the number of students progressing through these activities, monitor their progress and
relationships with faculty mentors, and track their future careers. CREP activities will increase the pool of
talented underrepresented students who enter the cancer-related research workforce in the future.

10925405,"Endometriosis Education Outreach
ABSTRACT
Dysmenorrhea, painful periods, is the most common cause of absenteeism in young women. Endometriosis is
the leading etiology; however, there is a median diagnostic delay of 8 years, with two thirds of patients noting
that their symptoms were initially dismissed by their provider. Though providers play a role in the lack of detection
and treatment of menstrual disorders and endometriosis, patients’ reactions to the menarche experience and
knowledge of menstrual health are equally critical. Adolescents receive minimal formal menstrual health
education, and thus are unprepared for menarche and the social stigmas that surround it. Our objective is to
enhance the understanding of menstrual health, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis and foster a more
constructive dysmenorrhea dialogue between reproductive age patients and their healthcare providers
in order to reduce the time between presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. We will achieve this goal using
a three-tiered approach for educational outreach. Educational Outreach 1 is implementation of a menstrual
health curriculum in local middle and high schools. Educational Outreach 2 is implementation of a training
program for university campus health providers in identifying and treating dysmenorrhea and endometriosis.
Educational Outreach 3 is engagement of community stakeholders by raising awareness of menstrual health
disorders and the need for formalized education programs. Informing patients, providers, and the public will
facilitate early intervention and prevention of long-term sequelae of dysmenorrhea and endometriosis."

10922712,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RESEARCH PROJECT 1 – Linking Research to Policy: Indigenous leaders’ and
individuals’ perspectives on research, governance, and data sharing in Arizona
Indigenous Peoples have specific and longstanding concerns regarding the collection, storage, and use of
specimens and data. Research on the perspectives of Indigenous individuals and communities on biobanking
in Aotearoa New Zealand, Canada, Alaska, and Hawaii has found many issues related to ethics, policy,
capacity, and a need for the recognition of Indigenous rights and interests for the governance of samples/data.
In a workshop with collaborators of a university-tribal partnership and a set of interviews of tribal health
professionals, policy experts, and tribal leaders, respondents themes included: importance of recognizing tribal
sovereignty; the use of tribal research review processes; the view among many tribes that knowledge and
intellectual property belong to the collective rather than to an individual; that scientific practices such as data
sharing may not be in a tribe’s best interest; and the ongoing need for richer and continued discussion of data
access, management, and sharing. Bolstering tribal data governance and enhancing other institutions
application of Indigenous data governance in their policies becomes increasingly important as biomedical and
genomics research moves toward broad data sharing policies. To address barriers that historically have
impeded ethical research practices, we need to better understand Indigenous norms for research, data, and
specimen governance. This research proposal connects the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona NARCH team with
researchers at the University of Arizona under the guidance of the NARCH CAB and an international expert-
practitioner Advisory Board. We apply an innovative Indigenous data governance framework to assess
individuals’ perceptions and to review tribal norms and practices. Our long-term goal is to enhance tribal data
governance in Arizona. Our research objective is to review tribal norms and practices for Indigenous specimen
and data governance, and to assess Indigenous leaders’ and individuals’ perspectives on research,
governance, and data sharing to inform the development of tribal data governance policies and practices in
Arizona. We hypothesize that respondents will identify the importance of recognizing tribes as sovereign
nations; that many will view knowledge and intellectual property as belonging to the collective group rather
than to discrete individuals; and that there is a need for policies, practices, and trainings on Indigenous data
governance topics such as data access, management, and sharing. We plan to accomplish our research
objective by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Analyze existing documents and research on
tribal specimen/data storage policies. Aim 2: Assess Indigenous individuals’ opinions on (i) research, (ii)
governance, and (iii) data sharing. Aim 3: Assess tribal leaders’ and program directors’ opinions on (i)
research, (ii) governance, and (iii) data sharing. Aim 4: Develop specimen and data policy recommendations
for tribes and other entities. All findings and outputs will be shared with tribal leaders, program directors,
scholars, and others stakeholders via meetings, conferences, policy briefs, and manuscripts."
10922715,"NARCH XI Capacity Building Project Abstract
The cultural differences of conducting research within the American Indian/Alaska Native communities is
becoming a greater concern of ethical and moral approach. A large number of researchers from institutions is
vastly increasing with greater interest. However, an ethical approach to research conducted on tribal land is
important from implementing a project, collecting the data and data sharing. The American Indian people are
culturally connected to with an Indigenous framework of one’s self as a whole especially during research. The
historical cases of mistrust of research from non-community members has promoted negative publications and
promote stereotypes of AI/AN. The Belmont Report created in 1974 prompted the Indian Health Service to
establish Institutional Review Board or other forms of research committees. Several Tribes have created IRBs;
smaller tribes do not have the resources nor opportunity. As each tribal government is organized differently,
the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (ITCA), goal is to serve as the Institutional Review Board for Member
Tribes ensuring the research purpose is appropriate for the protecting and benefit for the tribal members and
tribal communities. ITCA has developed a strong relationship with Member Tribes in addition to creating
partnerships with research institutions. The purpose of the capacity building project, “Developing the Arizona
ITCA Tribal Research Review Board” is to address the concern in creating a research review board to ensure
member tribal communities are assisted in providing protection and guidance with thought of benefits of all
research presented to the community.
Specific Aims. We will:
1. A consultation with ITCA Member Tribes and The University of Arizona partnership will develop a Tribal
 Research Coalition to review policies, and procedures, along with agreements, and protocols align with
 data sovereignty rights.
2. Establish a Tribal Institutional Review Board (IRB) consisting of members of Tribal leadership and
 voluntary committee members collaborating within research institutions providing guidance on research
 ethics to ensure tribal members and tribal community benefit from research projects in an ethical approach
 serving ITCA Member Tribes who do not have an institutionalized IRB process within the tribal government.
3. Collaborate with The University of Arizona to create training workshops for tribal and non-tribal members
 who acknowledge interest in conducting tribal research with any ITCA Member Tribe to increase culturally
 appropriate awareness and ethical research respecting tribal sovereignty."
10909139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, spread via aerosol transmission and inflict global public health and economic consequences.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 450 million people, led to over 6 million fatalities, and caused major economic
losses. The tuberculosis-causing bacterium and longstanding global health enemy, M. tuberculosis, led to an
estimated 1.3 million deaths and over 5 billion USD in global spending in 2020 alone. Both of these pathogens,
SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis, impose disproportionate burdens on healthcare workers, who are exposed to
airborne pathogens at higher rates than the general population. The current respiratory protection options
available to healthcare workers are generally limited to surgical masks and nonoil-95 percent collection (N95)
filter-based respirators. N95s are the current gold standard, but these respirators can only properly function when
a snug seal on the face of the user causes a pressure drop, which makes breathing more difficult and often leads
to compliance issues. These respirators are also not designed to inactivate the pathogens they collect, and their
disposable nature generates waste and leaves users susceptible to supply shortages. Thus, the widespread
threats of airborne pathogens and the significant limitations of existing protection options necessitate the
development of novel strategies to protect healthcare workers from airborne transmission of infectious diseases.
Henley Ion’s solution is a next-generation respirator based on a miniaturized form of an electrostatic precipitator
(mEP). Henley Ion is the first to leverage the mEP strategy to remove aerosol particles in the context of personal
respiratory protection. Rather than relying on a filter, this innovation allows Henley Ion to use mEP to capture
and remove aerosol particles as the wearer breathes, needing only the natural velocity of normal breathing. In
Aim 1, we will conduct benchtop testing to optimize device performance. We will demonstrate that the particle
removal performance of our device matches or exceeds that of an N95 at a range of physiological respiration
rates. In Aim 2, we will conduct biological testing to confirm optimized device performance that matches or
exceeds the N95 for particle removal of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis. We will measure particle removal at
differential air flow rates and using discrete particle size distributions, and we will assess any residual viable
pathogens in the device. Together, these steps will optimize the Henley mEP respirator and confirm its efficacy
against both viral and bacterial pathogens, supporting the commercialization of this novel protective strategy to
address the extreme need during the present pandemic and for infectious diseases more broadly."
10841697,"Administrative Core – Summary
The Administrative Core (Admin Core) for this program, “Preventing Infant Infection with Implementation
Science in Malawi” (PRI3SM), will play a central role in achieving our overall objective to identify successful
implementation strategies to eliminate MTCT (EMTCT) in Malawi and beyond. The Admin Core will oversee
the operation, coordination, management, and evaluation of the three projects focused on the EMTCT
cascade. We will join in crosscutting support with the implementation science core and data science and
analytical core to provide advanced support and coordination to each of these study projects. The Admin Core
will support the activities of the projects and cores to enhance the potential for cross protocol comparisons
through harmonized instruments, data systems, and procedures. The Admin Core will also support Ministry of
Health program evaluations and provide mechanisms for engagement of young investigators through existing
capacity building programs.
Through the existing infrastructure of UNC Project Malawi, the Admin Core will assist all core and project
directors with operational and budgetary oversight and management, including submission of progress reports,
communication between EMTCT clinical, research, policy and implementing partners and communication with
NICHD. The core will organize activities that enhance collaborations between both senior and junior
investigators based at UNC-CH, UNC Project Malawi, the Malawi Ministry of Health and PEPFAR
implementing partners. These synergistic and mature relationships have been developed over the past twenty
years of EMTCT activities in Malawi beginning with a collaboration with the Malawi MOH and the Elizabeth
Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) to implement HIVNET012 regimen in 2002; the establishment of
DAIDS network clinical trials including the IMPAACT network; numerous single site research activities through
CDC (the BAN study) and NICHD funding; and an increasing number of implementation science trials0. Most
importantly, policy and practice changes have led to well-established relationships with the Malawi Ministry of
Health and implementing partners. The Admin Core will also assemble and facilitate meetings of both an
External and Internal Advisory Board, and coordinate participation in annual local and global EMTCT meetings.
The Admin Core will ensure that overall goals for the program are accomplished as outlined below.
Aim 1. Enhance the program effort by optimizing communication, decision-making and sharing among the
research project teams, the support cores and the implementing partners.
Aim 2. Develop and maintain shared, dedicated administrative infrastructure to ensure timely and accurate
monitoring, reporting, and regulatory compliance of all EMTCT activities.
Aim 3. Provide administrative support to strengthen existing partnerships in Malawi, between UNC Project,
Malawi Ministry of Health, PEPFAR implementing partners and community partners."

Implementation science provides the necessary tools to ensure that interventions are implemented well and
their impact in real-world settings is realized. The goal of the implementation science core is to provide
scientific support to each of the PRI3SM implementation science research projects to ensure the latest
principles and approaches in implementation science are applied appropriately to maximize the impact of the
research projects through the following aims:
Aim 1. To provide support and resources to enable investigators at UNC Project Malawi to effectively
implement evidence-based EMTCT interventions. The implementation science core will provide assistance
with selection and application of implementation science study designs to guide protocol development;
identification, selection, and adaptation of implementation strategies to facilitate implementation of PRI3SM
projects; selection of appropriate implementation outcomes and assistance in the development and validation
of data collection tools for measuring implementation outcomes of the PRI3SM projects; implementation,
monitoring and evaluation of evidence-based PRI3SM interventions in real-world settings; identification of key
barriers and facilitators to implementing PRI3SM interventions; organizational readiness assessments for
implementation of the PRI3SM projects and supporting qualitative measurement of implementation science
outcomes and construct such as acceptability, feasibility, barriers and facilitators and organizational readiness.
Aim 2: To provide trainees and junior investigators from existing local IS training programs with
opportunities for real-world application of implementation science concepts. The Implementation
Science Core will provide internship and fellowship placements and mentored experiential training in
implementation science for junior investigators such as master’s and PhD students and graduates from
existing implementation science training programs. The Implementation Science Core will leverage the
capacity building program for PRI3SM to fully establish an Implementation Science Unit at UNC Project Malawi
for ongoing support with implementation science training and resources. The ongoing support will include
formal meetings and a seminar series with trainees to provide a platform for exchange of skills and

 Along with the many benefits of a global economy hides the ever-present risk for the world wide spread
of infectious disease. While significant outbreaks of the flu in the recent past involving millions of individuals
could be contained, the emergence and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed how vulnerable and
unprepared the world population was to combat a previously unknown human pathogen.
 To limit the loss of life and economic disruption resulting from a future global event, steps toward
pandemic preparedness are needed. A major component of being prepared is having the necessary tools
available to act quickly to protect human health. In the ongoing pandemic, vaccines emerged as the best way
to protect healthy populations and prevent hospitalization or death among those individuals who become
infected. However, vaccine availability and logistical constraints regarding their distribution has left a significant
proportion of the world’s population still waiting for their first dose. The ability to quickly discover and develop
vaccines which can be administered on a large scale is one solution towards solving this current problem.
 In support of this effort, it is the goal of this Phase I project to identify TLR4 agonists with
immunostimulatory activity suitable for the development of safe and effective vaccine adjuvants. To achieve
this goal, we will combine our years of expertise in medicinal chemistry and vaccine research and development
toward completing the following specific aims: 1) Establish efficient synthesis routes for pure tri-acylated
monophosphate derivatives of sucrose; 2) Identify TLR4 agonists using cell-based assays, determine their
cytokine production profiles, and compare them to the full TLR4 agonist mono-phospholipid A (MPLA); and 3)
Determine the immunogenic potency and safety profiles of selected sucrose based TLR4 agonists in mice and
compare them against an existing subunit protein vaccines targeting West Nile Virus. We expect the product
from this research to enable the development of novel adjuvants to support the preparation of new vaccines to
combat current and future disease threats."

The proposed program project aims to close research gaps in antiretroviral treatment for pregnant women and
infants living with HIV with four inter-related projects that will require data management and data sharing. The
Data Management and Distribution Core will build on its long experience managing clinical and laboratory data
at the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership to ensure successful support for all data aspects of this

collection and management. The Tsepamo Plus birth outcomes surveillance study (Project 1) will provide data
for the Methodology Project (Project 2) and for Point-of-Care HIV Testing and Infant Treatment (Project 3).
Project 3 will provide data for the Immune Control Study (Project 4). Projects 3 and 4 require systems for
receiving and storing laboratory data from the Botswana-Harvard HIV Reference Laboratory. The Data Core will
oversee an active and efficient system of cross-talk between projects to facilitate achievement of the P01

Finding a cure for HIV-1 infection is of particular importance for the growing number of HIV-1-infected infants,
children and teenagers who will have to take lifelong antiretroviral therapy if curative treatment options will not
be available. Recent advances suggest that achieving a functional cure of HIV-1 infection may not require
complete elimination of all intact HIV-1 proviruses; instead, it may be sufficient to target intact proviruses
integrated in permissive chromatin positions that support HIV-1 transcription and are more susceptible to viral
reactivation signals. This model for a cure of HIV-1 infection seems to be exemplified by elite controllers, in whom
we documented a highly distinct chromosomal integration site landscape characterized by location of intact
proviruses in heterochromatin regions. Notably, such a “blocked and locked” pattern of proviral integration sites
likely represents the consequence of cellular immune selection forces that have successfully eliminated
proviruses in accessible chromatin locations, while proviruses in heterochromatin positions can persist long term.
This concept raises the possibility that immune-mediated selection mechanisms can be intensified or accelerated
through therapeutic vaccination, and may be preferentially inducible in HIV-1-infected infants starting ART at
early stages of infection. Here, we propose to conduct a detailed analysis of viral reservoir dynamics in infants
undergoing dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART), with the ultimate aim of informing future clinical
trials designed to induce a “blocked and locked” viral reservoir structure through personalized therapeutic mRNA
vaccines incorporating autologous proviral sequences. In specific aim 1, we will investigate viral sequences
near birth and determine the frequency of intact proviruses in infants started on dolutegravir-containing ART,
relative to existing corresponding data from infants undergoing lopinavir/ritonavir-containing ART; these studies
will allow us to track the natural evolution of intact and defective proviruses, and generate an atlas of intact
proviruses that can be considered for inclusion into personalized therapeutic mRNA vaccines to be tested in
future proof-of-principle studies. In specific aim 2, we will longitudinally evaluate the chromosomal positioning
of intact proviruses during continuous ART in these infants; we hypothesize that immune-mediated selection
mechanisms can at least in some infants promote and facilitate a proviral integration site landscape that
approximates the “blocked and locked” proviral architecture observed in elite controllers; such selection
mechanisms may then be further intensified through planned personalized mRNA vaccination in future studies.
In specific aim 3, we will conduct pioneering studies to characterize the quantity and functionality of cellular and
humoral immune responses induced by the licensed SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine in HIV-1-infected pediatric
patients from Botswana; such studies will be highly informative for all future HIV-1-specific therapeutic
vaccination approaches on the mRNA platform."
10899482,"ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an increasingly prevalent chronic disease that affects more than 400 million
people worldwide. One of the major complications of T2DM is exacerbated atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Even when modern lipid and glucose control strategies are applied, T2DM is associated with a
two- to four-fold increase in CVD risk, suggesting the effect of additional pathologies, such as inflammation.
However, current tools to predict CVD outcomes for T2DM patients incorporate only clinical and demographic
variables into their models, and they thus attain only a moderate ability to discriminate the highest-risk patients
in need of targeted clinical intervention. Our lab recently discovered that monocyte-derived foam cells, which
are well-known to play a central role in atherosclerotic CVD, can undergo both homeostatic (non-inflammatory)
and pathogenic (inflammatory) foaming. Using a transcriptomic signature from pathogenic foam cells, our lab
developed a CVD prediction model called CR30 which outperformed existing tools. To address the critical
knowledge gap of identifying CVD risk specifically in T2DM patients, I analyzed monocyte transcriptomic data
from the Multi-Ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis (MESA). From this preliminary analysis, I identified a
transcriptomic signature unique to T2DM patients with CVD, containing a super-network downstream of the co-
regulator proteins SNW1, NCOR2, and CITED2. We hypothesize that this transcriptomic super-network
represents a unique molecular signature which can be used to improve prediction of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular events in individuals with T2DM. In this proposal, I will test this hypothesis by applying two
different strategies to develop predictive models. In Aim 1, I will apply supervised machine learning
approaches to select a set of genes from my preliminary analysis which are predictive of T2DM-CVD
outcomes. I will then test several modeling strategies in training and building a T2DM-CVD prediction model
incorporating this gene set combined with clinical data. In Aim 2, I will use another approach to incorporate
T2DM-CVD molecular signature into modeling by focusing on the transcriptomic super-network. I will generate
enrichment scores for the super-network, then incorporate the scores as variables into model development.
The long-term goal of this project is to identify biological risk factors for CVD in patients with T2DM. The
anticipated impacts are the identification of novel targets for mechanistic studies and the advancement of
biology-informed approaches to clinical outcomes prediction. The training goals of this proposal will provide
me with biologically-informed quantitative skills. This interdisciplinary, highly translational project will leverage
the innovative environment and unique opportunities in the sponsor’s lab and the University of Connecticut
School of Medicine. The expected outcomes from this project will promote my career goals of becoming a
next-generation physician-scientist capable of integrating biological knowledge and quantitative skills to solve
clinical problems for patients with chronic disease."
10837647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome instability (GIN) is a hallmark of cancer and a leading cause of therapeutic resistance. This is especially
true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where an estimated 95% of PDAC cells exhibit GIN. GIN is
characterized by both a failure to accurately repair DNA in interphase and high rates of chromosome mis-
segregation in mitosis. It is not fully understood how these pathways work in concert throughout the cell cycle to
defend against GIN. Our previous work has demonstrated a link between the DNA damage response (DDR)
protein ATR and the mitotic machinery in promoting faithful chromosome segregation. This observation has
prompted me to hypothesize that other components of the DDR promote faithful chromosome
segregation and genome stability.
My preliminary work has elucidated a novel mitotic function for Chk2, an important DDR kinase that is activated
following DNA double-stranded breaks. I have shown that Chk2 is active in a DNA damage-independent manner
in mitosis. Moreover, I have demonstrated that Chk2 promotes proper activity of the major mitotic kinase PLK1.
In this application, I propose to investigate the mechanism by which Chk2 promotes faithful chromosome
segregation (Aim 1), determine how Chk2 activity is regulated in mitosis (Aim 2), and use PLK1 inhibition to
specifically target Chk2-deficient cancer cells (Aim 3). My proposed studies will define the mitotic and DNA
damage-independent role for Chk2. This will further our understanding of how the DDR pathway and mitotic
machinery work in concert to promote faithful chromosome segregation and genome stability. Lastly,
experiments from this proposal may develop a targeted therapeutic strategy to specifically kill Chk2-deficient
cancers. This is critically important, as Chk2 loss-of-function mutations make up a significant portion of familial
PDAC cases, and Chk2 mutations render cells insensitive to current front-line treatments.
My career goal is to obtain a research faculty position at a leading institution where I will dissect the noncanonical
and understudied mechanisms by which DDR proteins promote genome stability. My scientific development will
be bolstered by successful completion of this project, including gaining expertise in cancer biology and mouse
models. I will use these acquired skills to investigate whether PLK1 inhibitors can be used to specifically target
Chk2-deficient cancer cells. Importantly, funding for this application will also enhance my training in science
communication, writing, teaching, mentoring, and career development, all of which will be essential for
successfully running my own laboratory. This project is supported by an outstanding network of sponsors and
collaborators that will ensure this project is successfully completed. Receipt of this award will allow me to expand
my research plan and establish myself as a primary investigator in the field of cancer biology and genome
stability."
10821334,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects 15-20% of children and 1-3%
of adults worldwide. The current standard-of-care for AD involves the use of calcineurin inhibitors,
corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibody therapies that curb inflammation through immunosuppression.
However, extensive genetic studies of AD patients suggest that AD is partly rooted in an epidermal differentiation
defect: loss-of-function variants of filaggrin (FLG), an epidermal-specific protein that accumulates in
membraneless organelles called keratohyalin granules (KGs). The role of KGs in epidermal differentiation has
long remained elusive, preventing progress toward addressing FLG-linked skin barrier defects. Recent live cell-
imaging of skin unearthed the assembly and pH-triggered disassembly of KGs as a crucial event in the process
of skin barrier formation. Specifically, these studies demonstrated that FLG condenses into droplet-like KGs
though a process of intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) — a key function that is impaired in
truncated FLG variants. At the granular-to-corneum interface, abrupt intracellular acidification triggers partial KG
disassembly to propel rapid enucleation in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes to corneocytes. The novel
finding that FLG-encoded LLPS dynamics drive terminal differentiation in the epidermis provides a new
framework to dissect skin barrier formation in health and disease.
 Advancing toward addressing FLG-rooted skin barrier disorders, the long-term goal of this project is to
program and rescue physiological KG dynamics. The central hypothesis is that dissecting the LLPS dynamics
and composition of KGs will inform biomolecular approaches to overcome pathological loss of KG functionality.
Crucially, still missing is a biomolecular catalog of KG components, and clues on their intracellular fate upon KG
disassembly. A key underlying challenge is the inability to isolate and purify KGs. Using human epidermal
equivalent models, this project will pursue biomolecular engineering approaches to (Aim 1) interrogate the
biomolecular composition of human KGs through proximity proteomics and (Aim 2) rescue KG dynamics and
functionality upon loss of FLG. The proposed research advances FLG variants integrated with biochemical tools
to map the identity, release, and intracellular destination of KG components. Harnessing these fundamental
insights and normal human genetic variation in FLG, this work will advance small FLG-like proteins (mini-FLG)
capable of recapitulating the LLPS dynamics and composition of human KGs. Further testing if optimal mini-
FLG-driven KGs functionally impact enucleation dynamics, these experiments will pioneer the direct
programming of functional KG dynamics. The resulting molecular-level map of KGs may expose druggable
targets to control KG dynamics and terminal differentiation, such as newly identified KG-residing proteins that
cooperate to actuate rapid enucleation. Overall, the proposed research will lay a foundation for future therapeutic
manipulation of epidermal LLPS dynamics in skin barrier disorders."

According to the CDC, Periodontitis affects 47.2% of individuals aged 30 and over. By the age of 65, the
number of people impacted by periodontitis jumps to 70.1%. Dysbiosis, shifts in biofilm composition leading to
imbalances in microbial composition are precursors of widespread human diseases such as tooth decay
(dental caries) and periodontitis. How shifts in biofilm spatial structure impact the progression from health to
disease is unknown. We have developed an in vitro dental plaque culture system in which plaque samples
obtained from healthy donors via flossing are used to seed complex communities. Quantitative analysis by
Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH), confocal microscopy, and spectral imaging demonstrated that model
biofilms are highly diverse, spatially structured, and unexpectedly heterogeneous in spatial structure. We
observed that the dental plaque inocula from healthy donors were composed of single cells and large
multispecies coaggregates. We hypothesize that early stochastic events mediated by these multispecies
coaggregates lead to highly spatially structured and heterogeneous biofilms depending on where these
interacting communities land on nascent surfaces. To test our hypothesis, we developed a protocol for
disrupting plaque coaggregates. We observed that biofilms derived from dental plaque inocula in which
aggregates were disrupted before seeding in vitro cultures resulted in biofilms with decreased diversity and
increased spatial homogeneity. Biofilms derived de-aggregated plaque inocula lacked many gram-negative,
obligate anaerobe community members. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown role multispecies
aggregates in structuring oral biofilms and may have clinical importance in the mouth."

Norovirus is the leading cause of severe childhood diarrhea around the world and a major cause of acute
gastroenteritis in all age groups. There are no currently approved vaccines or targeted therapeutics for norovirus
infection and very little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms underlying gastroenteritis symptoms. To gain
further understanding of this important virus, murine norovirus has been used as a model system for many years
and has led to significant advances in understanding norovirus biology. However, the absence of symptoms in
immunocompetent adult mice infected with murine norovirus limits the applicability of this model to delineation
of viral mechanisms of disease. We recently discovered that genetically wild-type neonatal mice develop acute,
self-resolving diarrhea when infected with murine norovirus, a disease course that mirrors human norovirus
infection. This novel small animal model of norovirus disease represents a major advance in the norovirus field
since it will enable a complete characterization of viral disease mechanisms and ultimately serve as a platform
to test the efficacy of antiviral compounds in vivo. Using this model, we have observed that murine norovirus
infects subepithelial immune cells in the intestine but not intestinal epithelial cells. The mechanisms by which
murine norovirus transcytoses the epithelial barrier to reach its immune cell targets during symptomatic infection
is unknown and is the focus on Specific Aim 1 of my proposal. Specifically, I will test the hypothesis that murine
norovirus uses two well-established routes for macromolecular transport across the intestinal epithelium,
microfold cells and CX3CR1+ antigen presenting cells that express transepithelial dendrites. Although we did
not observe viral replication in intestinal epithelial cells, there was abundant virus in these cells at the peak of
diarrhea. This finding was surprising given that these cells do not express the virus receptor, nor do they support
viral replication. In Specific Aim 2 of my proposal, I will test the hypothesis that progeny virus complexed with
bile acids are endocytosed by intestinal epithelial cells via engagement of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid
transporter. Overall, my research focuses on understanding norovirus interactions with the intestinal epithelium
because these are undoubtedly key to the induction of diarrhea."

 This proposal aims to improve the rigor and reproducibility of research on plasticity in human working memory
(WM), and related executive functions (EFs) in adolescent youth. We address a critical gap between research
and practice that is characterized by a growing commercial space marketing cognitive training approaches (with
WM being one of the most common targets), which are particularly catering to typically developing children and
those diagnosed with ADHD to improve mental health and scholastic performance. However, despite expansive
literature, there exists limited basic research on WM and EF training in adolescents, and both methods and
findings are mixed across studies. Here, we address these significant gaps that pose obstacles to understanding
interventions’ reliability and validity by collecting a large-scale open dataset that compares different training
approaches on a common set of outcome measures. This is addressed through 4 aims, all based upon a large-
scale study involving 720 adolescents, stratified across age, sex and ADHD status randomized across
interventions: Aim 1 – What ingredients of cognitive training mediate training outcomes? We compare training
conditions that represent some of the most common ingredients used across cognitive training studies
(gamification, multiple domain training, and coaching) in comparison to basic non-gamified n-back training, using
a common set of outcomes measures. Aim 2 – How do training ingredients differentially impact youth with
ADHD? With ADHD being one of the most common targets of cognitive training, we examine whether and how
youth with ADHD are differentially impacted by the training conditions. Aim 3 – What individual characteristics
moderate training outcomes? We examine how cognitive training outcomes may differ across individuals, and
whether this variability may explain differential effects across studies. Aim 4 - Promote open science through
sharing of software tools and data. We will develop and share a cross-platform training and assessment app and
a research portal that will promote data sharing, replication, and access to other groups using common individual
difference variables and outcome measures. As a renewal, targeting adolescents with and without ADHD is a
natural next step in this research program that started in typically functioning adults. This research is significant
and timely as it addresses the limited basic research of cognitive training in adolescents with and without ADHD,
whom are understudied, but at the same time, are common targets of commercial products in this space. This
will lead to a more robust and representative understanding of factors that moderate and mediate cognitive
training that will be impactful whether or not one hypothesizes near or far transfer from cognitive training. Further,
findings could inform future research to understand broader age groups (younger children and older adults) as
well as to address lifespan and developmental factors more broadly, mental health, disease, and brain damage,
that interact with cognitive training to give rise to individualized outcomes."

 Obesity poses as a serious and worsening public health issue in the United States and is the second
most common cause of preventable death behind smoking. Obesity is associated with the risk of developing
additional comorbidities, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes.
 Estrogens (primarily 17β-estradiol, referred to as E2) can ameliorate weight gain and multiple aspects
of metabolic dysfunction. The effects of estrogens are mediated through multiple estrogen receptors (ERs),
including the classical nuclear ERs (ERα and ERβ), which traditionally regulate gene expression, and the 7-
transmembrane G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which predominantly mediates rapid “non-
genomic” signaling. Our preliminary results suggest a potential intervention employing a highly selective GPER
agonist, with promising outcomes against multiple negative effects of obesity. With the opportunity to employ
the GPER-selective agonist G-1 as a novel therapeutic for obesity, understanding the direct effects of GPER in
adipocytes is critical. The long-term goal is to determine whether selective activators of GPER, such as G-1,
can improve lipid homeostasis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in adipocytes. The overall objective of this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms of E2-mediated effects via GPER in metabolic regulation,
specifically in adipocytes. The central hypothesis to be tested is whether GPER signaling directly improves lipid
homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in adipocytes. These findings will
inform drug development by making significant advancements in our knowledge regarding the role of GPER in
obesity and lipid metabolism, ultimately advancing the current insufficient therapeutic treatment options
available for obesity. The specific aims of this proposal are: Aim 1: Evaluate the roles of GPER in lipid
metabolism of adipocytes. The working hypothesis for this aim is that GPER’s effects on obesity are in part
mediated by direct actions on lipid metabolism on adipocytes. Aim 2: Determine the role of GPER in
oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in adipocytes. The working hypothesis for this
aim is that GPER plays a direct protective role against oxidative stress, inflammation, and improves
mitochondrial function in adipocytes.
 This proposal will investigate the direct effects of GPER in adipocytes pertaining to lipid homeostasis,
oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function, with the potential to significantly advance the study
of novel therapeutics protecting against obesity."

It is estimated that 5.8 million people are afflicted by dementia in the US, a number projected to increase to 14
million by 2050 unless effective therapies are available that prevent or significantly slow the disease process.
Sleep complaints are common throughout the AD continuum beginning with prodromal stages. In
observational studies, disturbed sleep has been linked to AD pathogenesis and subsequent development of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Co-investigator Dr. Bakker has studied pattern separation (PS;
a memory task involved with the earliest stages of encoding that is essential to formation of new memories) in
a task related functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm, determining that impaired PS is associated with increased
hippocampal activation in amnestic MCI (aMCI). Because poor sleep may be associated with increased
hippocampal activation, improving sleep is a potential target for positively affecting cognition and disease
progression in AD. Trazodone is a generic antidepressant widely used off-label to treat sleep disturbance,
particularly enhancing slow wave sleep (SWS) that is evidenced to be a critical sleep phase influencing
pathogenic mechanisms. While it has been demonstrated to improve sleep in AD and potentially mitigate the
risk of developing MCI, its effect on sleep has not been rigorously studied in MCI. Supported by its benign
safety profile, we propose a rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial of
trazodone in 100 subjects with prodromal AD/aMCI and sleep complaints. Each treatment phase will last
four weeks with a two-week washout between phases. Sleep will be measured by home sleep testing
including polysomnography, actigraphy, and self-report. Hippocampal function and excitability will be
assessed by task-related fMRI employing PS. The primary outcome will be to examine the association of
trazodone with sleep parameters. We hypothesize that trazodone will improve total sleep time and proportion
of time in SWS. Secondary outcomes include assessment of trazodone's effect on 1) PS and hippocampal
activation by task-related fMRI, with the hypothesis that trazodone will improve PS performance and decrease
hippocampal activation; 2) a broader range of cognitive domains, with the hypothesis that trazodone will
improve performance on other memory tasks, executive function, and processing speed; 3) neuropsychiatric
symptoms with the hypothesis that they will improve with trazodone treatment. We will also assess blood-
based biomarkers of amyloid and tau, as exploratory outcomes to assess their association with sleep and
cognitive responses to trazodone."

Therapies aimed at preventing development of cirrhosis-related complications are lacking. Statins have been
shown to improve liver function and attenuate portal hypertension although definitive studies are lacking. Our
investigative team has deep expertise in cirrhosis and portal hypertension including clinical, translational, and
laboratory aspects of disease. Our aims in this proposal are: Aim 1. To conduct a prospective, multicenter,
observational study of patients with compensated cirrhosis that will serve as the foundation for
discovery of novel mechanistic and therapeutic targets. We will consolidate a longitudinal database to (a)
provide unique information on the natural history and outcomes of cirrhosis and (b) support translational
research (proposed in Aim 3). This robust multicenter dataset will be used for the development and validation
of an artificial intelligence-derived algorithm for prediction of decompensation combining extensive clinical,
laboratory and radiographic data, including magnetic resonance elastography and electrocardiogram. Aim 2.
To perform a multicenter prospective randomized phase 3 clinical trial of simvastatin versus placebo
to improve outcomes in patients with compensated cirrhosis. This aim will test the hypothesis that
simvastatin is superior to placebo for reducing complications of cirrhosis and overall mortality. This phase 3
efficacy trial will randomize patients to Simvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily with median follow up of 36 months.
The primary endpoint will be development of varices, decompensating events or death analyzed as ordinal
outcomes based six prognostic stages. Secondary endpoints will include fibrosis regression, incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular complications. Aim 3. To identify novel pathogenic targets in
cirrhosis progression through 2 Sub-aims: Sub-Aim 3a. To investigate the rate of telomere attrition in
cirrhosis progression and decompensation. Telomere shortening has been observed in advanced cirrhosis
and preclinical studies have shown reduced fibrosis with telomere length restoration. However, the rate of
telomere attrition in cirrhosis and its association with disease progression remain unknown. Our proposal will
serve as the basis for future studies assessing new therapies aimed at telomere length preservation in
cirrhosis and effects of statins. Sub-Aim 3b. To measure circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs) and its correlation to development of hepatic decompensation. Anticoagulation has been
shown to reduce hepatic decompensation in a small trial of patients with cirrhosis. Our group has recently
shown that NETs drive intrahepatic thrombosis, and inhibition of NETs reduces portal pressure in preclinical
studies. Thus, the results of this sub-aim will serve as the foundation for future human studies investigating
novel therapies aimed at disrupting NETs in the liver. Our center and team have substantial expertise in clinical
trials and therapeutics for advanced liver disease and are thus well poised to conduct these studies."

available bronchodilator, corticosteroid and Th2-targeting therapy develop significant morbidity, which severely
impacts their quality of life owing to persistent symptoms, as well as frequent and life-threatening exacerbations.
Aspects of severe asthma currently not managed by available therapies may display a strong inflammatory
component driven by the innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly following viral exacerbations.
Development of new therapeutic strategies targeting a wide range of inflammatory mechanisms, not only Th2
and Th1/Th17 responses, is needed to control severe asthma. Raft Pharmaceuticals proposes a new target for
treatment of severe asthma – overabundant and clustered, pathological lipid rafts in bronchial epithelial and
immune cells in asthmatics. Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts provide ordered plasma membrane domains, where
receptors, ion channels and adaptor molecules can associate to form functional complexes. Large lipid rafts are
required as the landing pad for microbes on host cells and for initiation of many inflammatory processes in
bronchial epithelial and immune cells. We discovered apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) as a molecule that selectively
targets the cholesterol depletion machinery to pathologic lipid rafts in inflammatory cells, without affecting
homeostatic cellular function. The latter explains an exceptional safety profile of AIBP in mice and rats. In the
Phase I of this grant, using mouse models of asthma, we demonstrated that administration of a biologic derived
from the AIBP protein, was effective in an acute HDM model of asthma in mice, reducing airway
hyperresponsiveness, airway eosinophilia, and expression of Th2 cytokines and epithelial alarmins. In a model
of severe asthma, AIBP significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophilia. For Phase II proposal, a team of experts
in biologic drug development and in preclinical assessment and clinical trials of therapeutic agents in asthma
has been assembled to further the characterization of an improved AIBP sequence, RFT1124, as a development
candidate for severe asthma. Specifically, we plan to manufacture and release RFT1124 drug product for efficacy
and toxicology studies using cGMP-compatible processes and analytical assays. The efficacy of RFT1124 as
an add-on therapy to standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists (ICS+LABA) will be
tested in mouse models of asthma exacerbated by rhinovirus (RV) infection. In addition, we will use precision
cut lung slices from asthmatics and non-asthmatics postmortem lung tissue to test the efficacy of add-on
RFT1124 in ICS+LABA treatment in RV infected human airways. RNAseq studies will establish whether
RFT1124 inhibits corticosteroid insensitive anti-inflammatory pathways and/or enhances corticosteroid sensitive
pathways in RV infected human bronchial epithelial cells. Further, a non-GLP safety assessment of intranasal
delivery of RFT1124 will be conducted to establish an estimate of safety margin and target organs. These results
will be used to prepare for and conduct pre-IND (Type B) meeting with the FDA."
10867314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly referred to as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a leading cause of neonatal
meningitis and sepsis worldwide. GBS neonatal disease manifests as early onset invasive disease, defined as
disease between birth and 6 days of life, or late onset invasive disease, defined as disease occurring between
7 and 89 days. In some instances, early onset disease is preventable with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis;
however, this treatment strategy is not practical for low- and middle-income countries, which account for 95% of
all neonatal GBS infections, nor does it prevent late onset disease. Three GBS serotypes (type Ia, Ib, and III)
account for >60% of all early-onset and >90% of all late-onset invasive GBS infections. As such, a low-cost
vaccine strategy to prevent the majority of invasive GBS neonatal disease associated with these three serotypes
would be a valuable therapeutic intervention option. Conjugate vaccines, composed of polysaccharides
covalently linked to carrier proteins, are life-saving vaccines used to prevent disease from multiple bacterial
pathogens. Conjugate vaccines are conventionally manufactured using chemical conjugation, which is
notoriously complex, labor intensive, and costly, hindering the development of new conjugate vaccines. Aware
of these drawbacks, VaxNewMo has been advancing an alternative method for manufacturing conjugate
vaccines that utilizes prokaryotic glycosylation systems in a process termed bioconjugation. VaxNewMo’s
proprietary bioconjugation platform relies on a conjugating enzyme to transfer bacterial polysaccharides to
engineered carrier proteins using E. coli as a host. Moreover, since bioconjugation is an enzymatic process, the
conjugates produced are non-derivatized and the polysaccharides are structurally identical to those presented
to immune cells by the pathogen itself. In Phase I, we developed a prototype trivalent (serotypes Ia, Ib, and III)
bioconjugate vaccine and demonstrated that it was immunogenic, elicited functional antibody responses towards
all three GBS serotypes, and protected newborn mouse pups from invasive serotype III GBS disease. In Phase
II, we will produce type Ia-, Ib-, III-bioconjugates using an improved, di-glycosylated carrier protein design that
mimics the final formulation, establish bioprocessing capabilities and downstream purification processes, as well
as perform pre-IND enabling studies in mice. In Aim 1, we will optimize production of the GBS Ia, Ib and III
bioconjugate vaccines, moving from shake flasks to more industrial fed-batch bioreactor systems, remove
histidine tags from the bioconjugates (which are not acceptable in marketed vaccines for human use), and
establish downstream purification processes as well as characterize vaccine quality attributes. In Aim 2, we will
perform dose-escalation studies in mice using monovalent and trivalent formulations of GBS bioconjugate
vaccines produced on the improved, di-glycosylated carrier protein to assess immunogenicity via ELISA and
functional antibody responses using an opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPKA). Additionally, we will evaluate
vaccine efficacy by evaluating survival of newborn mouse pups challenged with a GBS strain (either type Ia, Ib,
or III) born to trivalent bioconjugate vaccinated mothers."
10902026,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel therapeutic lead compound for the treatment of
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Chemokines orchestrate the migration of inflammatory cells during normal immune
responses and are required for immune tissue development and homeostasis. When aberrant chemokine
function occurs, improper recruitment of immune cells can lead to a variety of inflammatory pathologies with
devastating effects on a patient’s quality of life. The chemokine CCL20 and its G protein-coupled receptor
CCR6 drive the development of psoriatic disease through the initiation and continuous recruitment of
inflammatory Th17-expressing cells into skin and connective tissue. Our published biochemical, cell-based and
in vivo studies prove that an engineered recombinant protein that mimics the dimeric version of the natural
CCL20 molecule completely reverses its normal pro-inflammatory functional profile. In a Phase I SBIR project,
the lead compound (CCL20LD) reduced the signs of established psoriatic dermatitis (PsD) in a preclinical
mouse model that faithfully recapitulates human psoriasis. Unexpectedly, CCL20LD treatment also alleviated
joint and tendon inflammation, demonstrating efficacy in a clinically relevant model of human psoriatic
arthritis. The same project also yielded a favorable preliminary safety profile with no indication of liver or
kidney toxicity and a validated manufacturing and quality control protocol. There is a significant need for new
treatments for psoriatic arthritis because current options carry the risk of immunosuppression and loss of
efficacy over time. This Direct-to-Phase II proposal builds on the completed Phase I milestones to complete
preclinical testing and optimization of CCL20LD and assemble the necessary efficacy, safety, and
manufacturing data for an IND application and clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis. XLock Biosciences, LLC (XL)
will manufacture the CCL20LD protein and direct the studies proposed in three specific aims. In Aim 1, XLock
will improve the in vivo stability of the first generation CCL20LD molecule with modifications known to extend
the circulating half-life of biologic drugs. In Aim 2 XL and its academic collaborators at UC Davis will establish
the therapeutic dose and schedule which produces the strongest anti-psoriatic effect in joint tissues in the
shortest time period. Lastly, in Aim 3, XL’s collaborators at the Medical College of Wisconsin will measure
CCL20LD’s immunomodulatory activity and its effect on rodent susceptibility to commensal fungal infection.
Altering CCR6 signaling through the engineering of its native ligand is an innovative paradigm shift in clinical
approaches for treating auto-inflammatory diseases. Development of engineered CCL20 variants as biological
therapeutics will have significant positive impact for psoriatic arthritis patients by reducing side effects and
providing a drug with extended therapeutic lifetimes. Moreover, the resultant method has the potential for
treating other Th17–mediated diseases."
10805476,"Cryptococcus species are a clinically important group of opportunistic fungal pathogens that can cause life
threatening disease, particularly in the immunocompromised patient population. Historically, this has involved
patients with advanced HIV, but is becoming more prevalent in other immunovulnerable populations. The primary
pathogens, C. neoformans and C. gattii, are ubiquitous in the environment which provides ample opportunity to
establish primary pulmonary infections upon inhalation of the corresponding spore or yeast. Unfortunately, many
cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis can progress and lead to deadly disseminated fungal infections. Of special
importance is the strong preference (~90%) for the pathogen to establish infection within the central nervous
system, especially through infection of the meninges leading to cryptococcal meningitis. This is the leading cause
of meningitis world-wide and is associated with a very high mortality rate (~80%). Treatment of cryptococcal
infections is difficult owing to the limited number of effective treatment options available. The difficulty of many
antifungal drugs to effectively traverse the blood-brain barrier and reach therapeutically relevant concentration
within the CNS limits current treatment options to just three agents: fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and amphotericin.
The evolution of substantial levels of resistance to fluconazole and 5-flucytosine in circulating strains of
Cryptococcus has significantly undermined these agents while the toxicities associates with amphotericin are a
well-known problem. Based on the limited options for treating these life-threatening infections, there is a
compelling need to develop more effective agents capable of reaching the CNS. QMD is developing antifungal
antifolates that inhibit the essential enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although DHFR is a clinically
validated target in several eukaryotic pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, the
efforts to exploit this target for antifungal drug development has lagged far behind. QMD has identified a novel
inhibitor against Cryptococcus that is characterized by high levels of antifungal activity while initial dose-tolerance
and pharmacokinetic studies suggest the compound has a favorable profile to demonstrate in vivo efficacy in
animal models of infection. In this Phase I application, we will work to advance this program for the treatment of
cryptococcal infections by (1) antimicrobial profiling, PK/PD studies and elucidation of mechanism(s) of
resistance, (2) exploring structural modifications to increase the selectivity index over the host enzyme, and (3)
evaluation of lead and back-up compounds in murine models of infection. Successful demonstration in proof-of-
concept in vivo efficacy will enable us to further advance these antifungal candidates toward clinical application."
10909905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly one million patients require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the
United States each year. Most of these patients will recover to the point of extubation, yet even those
who are extubated remain vulnerable to complications and poor outcomes. Multiple high-profile
randomized controlled trials have shown that two preventive post-extubation respiratory therapies—
noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC)—can prevent recurrent
respiratory failure, reintubation, and death in this population. Despite this evidence, however, these
therapies remain severely underutilized, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. To address this
implementation gap, we propose to conduct the Maximizing Extubation outcomes Through Educational
and Organizational Research (METEOR) Trial, a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge, type 2 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial of interprofessional education about preventive post-extubation NIV
and HFNC with and without clinical protocols. We designed the METEOR Trial based on extensive
preliminary studies, during which we identified barriers to adoption of preventive post-extubation
respiratory care and pilot tested interprofessional education as an implementation strategy in the ICU.
These studies revealed that a major barrier to implementation is the lack of a shared understanding
about the value of these therapies within the interprofessional ICU team; a theory-based
interprofessional education intervention designed to create a shared understanding and support
“transactive memory” among team members is both feasible and acceptable; and interprofessional
education can be strengthened by linking it with a clinical protocol. During the METEOR Trial, we will
randomize ICUs to one of four implementation strategies: an active control, protocol-directed care,
interprofessional education, or a combination of protocol-directed care and interprofessional education.
In parallel, we will randomize ICUs to one of two clinical strategies, one emphasizing either post-
extubation NIV or HFNC based on patient risk vs. one emphasizing post-extubation HFNC for all
patients. The specific aims of the trial are to (1) test the effectiveness of interprofessional education on
the implementation of preventive, post-extubation therapies, (2) compare the effectiveness of two
preventive, post-extubation therapies (NIV and HFNC) on patient-centered clinical outcomes, and (3)
perform a comprehensive qualitative evaluation of the trial processes and outcomes in order to better
understand mechanism, identify what worked and what didn’t, and set the stage for broader
dissemination of the study findings. Together these aims will provide critical insight into the role of
interprofessional education as an implementation strategy in hospital settings, leading to improved
outcomes for hundreds of thousands of patients with acute respiratory failure."
10907722,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (CORE A)
The Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor (DHART) SPORE was funded in 2015 with the goal of
implementing effective targeted molecular therapies for neoplasms and cancers characterized by NF1
mutations by conducting integrated, mechanistically based translational research. The studies proposed in our
renewal will continue to address the fundamental problem of hyperactive Ras signaling in cancer. The
program consists of three research projects and three core components. Innovative aspects of the DHART
SPORE include: (1) a focus on advancing the science and care of patients with orphan diseases; (2) a strong
emphasis on tumors arising in young children, adolescents, and young adults; (3) studies of diverse tumor
types that share a common driver mutation; and, (4) an investigative team drawn from leading research
centers across the nation to promote integration of preclinical and clinical trials expertise and patient access.
The goal of the Administrative Core is to provide scientific and administrative oversight for all the program
components of the DHART SPORE. This core serves as the central point for all administrative activities and
essential services, including being the organizing unit for the coordination, integration and communication for
all components. These coordinating components include: 1) providing the overall organizational framework by
which researchers communicate and interact/collaborate, 2) managing finances, 3) supporting the coordination
of the review of progress of the research projects, scientific cores and developmental programs (DRP and
CEP), 4) consulting with the members of the External and Internal Advisory boards, 5) coordinating the overall
data integration and analysis of the DHART SPORE, and 6) continuing to establish and refine the infrastructure
to support the meaningful sharing of data and information generated through our studies with other internal and
external NF-collaborative consortiums."
10907724,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OMICS CORE
The Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor (DHART) SPORE was designed to integrate multiple
research projects, all with the goal of identifying novel molecular therapeutic strategies for NF1-related
malignancies. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by mutations
in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin. Functional loss of neurofibromin, a Ras-GTPase activating
protein (GAP) leads to hyperactive Ras signaling and dysregulation of multiple cell signaling pathways
impacting cell proliferation and survival, such as Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. The overall goal of the
Omics Core (Core B) is to provide state-of-the-art support for research design consultation, performance of
genomics and kinomics experiments, and integrated data analysis to DHART investigators to elucidate
changes during NF1-related tumor development and in response to therapy. Built upon institutional genomics
cores (Center for Medical Genomics), a newly established kinome laboratory, and a bioinformatics research
center (Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics), Core B also interacts intensively with other cores
for supporting the DHART investigators. Upon receipt of tracked samples (including mouse and human
neurofibromas, JMML, GBM, and models of NF1-related subsequent neoplasms) from the
Biospecimen/Pathology Core C, the following technologies and informatics platforms will be employed: 1. Core
B will process samples for bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing, or
targeted exome sequencing. 2. The Omics Core will analyze and annotate all RNAseq and exome sequencing
data for transfer to Synapse, the Sage portal for data analysis 2. The Kinome Core will utilize established
chemical proteomics methodology to provide functional, activity-based, global kinome profiles of NF1-related
specimens, defining baseline kinome state, effects of specific genotype or genetic perturbations, and response
to targeted inhibitors. 3. In collaboration with the Administrative Core A and Sage Bionetworks, integrative
analyses will be performed to provide comprehensive molecular profiles of genotype-driven gene expression
and functional kinome profiles. The profiles will be studied for both putative response biomarkers and for
candidate therapeutic targets. Synapse, a web portal maintained by Sage will allow access by SPORE
investigators of all data obtained by the Omics and Biospecimen/Pathology Cores, where findings will be
annotated and made more broadly useful to all investigators involved in the SPORE. This data management
portal will provide a unique resource for accessing and interpreting data generated by the three projects,
Biospecimens and Pathology Core and Omics Core."
10702049,"Title: Mitochondrial Regulation of Brain Network Dynamics in Stress

Project Summary

Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), often exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria play a critical role in responding to environmental stressors and influencing brain health throughout an individual's life. However, the specific impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on brain network activity under stress conditions and its subsequent effect on cognitive and behavioral changes remain poorly understood. The proposed research will use a multi-method approach that combines molecular, cellular, and circuit-level analyses to understand how mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control mechanisms contribute to the synchronized brain network activity underlying cognition in normal and pathological states. The research strategy will focus on understanding basic mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial functions and how these processes impact brain networks in stress conditions. A comprehensive understanding of how key mitochondrial processes regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural activity will provide fundamental insights into how these critical cellular processes contribute to brain function. In the present proposal, Dr. Quigley will test the hypothesis that the properties of mitochondria in distinct brain regions confer vulnerability to cellular stress that can be detected at the network level, contributing to behavioral outcomes. To do so, Aim 1 aims to investigate region and cell type specific mitochondrial phenotypes throughout the brain associated with stress. The approach will use a combination of imaging techniques, biochemistry, and physiological assays to examine subcellular differences in mitochondrial dynamics and protein expression under conditions of stress. Aim 2 aims to identify joint molecular and electrophysiological markers for changes in allostatic load induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. This will be achieved by first examining the relationship between in vivo mitochondrial functions, brain circuit activity, and stress by characterizing a method of light-activated induction of oxidative stress, followed by measurements of electrical activity and the use of statistical methods to make comparisons to behavioral stress. Subsequently, candidate markers will be identified from proteomic experiments to inform the measuring of joint neurophysiological and molecular biomarkers associated with stress and the application of advanced statistical methods to identify associated patterns that correlate with behavioral states. The proposed research will pave the way for further independent studies and may aid in developing new therapeutic avenues that span diagnostic categories. Combined with the applicant’s prior graduate training in acquiring and analyzing in vivo electrophysiology data, this work will facilitate Dr. Quigley’s transition to an independent academic research career by incorporating the use of molecular genetic techniques, imaging, and advanced computational analyses."
10702052,"Project Summary

The locations where our life experiences unfold are remarkably potent and enduring cues to memory. For instance, stepping back into a familiar café can reignite the distant memory of a casual coffee chat with a colleague. What then, are the properties of a spatial context and its neural representation that enable it to become a trigger to episodic memory? As we age our memories of the encoding context in which events occur deteriorate and can dramatically worsen in diseases like Alzheimer’s. Therefore, developing an understanding of how spatial contexts influence our memory during encoding and retrieval of naturalistic events is fundamental towards developing treatments to memory impairment in diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Additionally, the enhanced accessibility, portability, and growing affordability of immersive virtual reality (VR) technology have made it an valuable asset for investigating how spatial contexts influence memory formation in more ecologically valid experiments. Thus, this proposal seeks to mechanistically understand how spatial contexts scaffold memories through an innovative research program that combines electroencephalography (EEG), VR, and functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI) in naturalistic tasks. A prevalent theory in Psychology posits that memories need to be both stable over time and distinct enough to prevent interference with other potentially similar memories. To what extent is this true for spatial context memories and how do these properties influence their role as the containers of subsequent memories that occur in them? In Aim 1, we will characterize the representational properties of a spatial context and how they transform across learning episodes. We hypothesize that across learning spatial context representations become increasingly more dissimilar to other contexts and that their stability (operationalized as increased pattern self-similarity across a delay) will converge to a stable state. In Aim 2, we will combine simultaneous VR and EEG in a real-time neurofeedback paradigm to directly distort the neural representations of spatial contexts to uncover their role as encoding contexts for subsequent memories. We predict that enhancing or reducing how distinct spatial contexts are from one another will improve or impair memory formation associated with events occurring in those spaces. In Aim 3, we will first identify what properties of image sequences make scenes more recallable over others, identify the neural correlates (in fMRI) that are involved in predicting their recallability, and then, develop a computational model that generates scenes along increasing or decreasing recallability. Taken together, the proposed project makes use of innovative, affordable, and accessible technology (i.e., VR-EEG) to study the fundamental nature of how spatial contexts influence memory for everyday events. In the long term, the findings and methodologies developed will support future work and lead to the further development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals and remedies for groups of people with learning difficulties."
10877971,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older Americans and severely
impacts the independence, quality of life, and healthcare costs for those afflicted and their families. Genetic
variation has a major influence on AMD, but only about half of the heritability is currently understood.
Understanding the genetic architecture of AMD is critical for developing better treatments for AMD. The
International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) has assembled 33 research groups and over the past four
years of this grant has enabled significant progress by extending the number of known risk loci and implicating
new biological pathways. This renewal extends these efforts to multiple genetic ancestries, study designs, and
more detailed phenotypic data. We propose the following aims:
 1) Continue to expand the IAMDGC resource with new datasets. We have added seven new
collaborators and now have access to data from >100,000 participants.
 2) Use universal hubs to process and share genomic, phenotypic, and biomarker data. Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals has agreed to conduct whole exome sequencing on approximately 40,000 participants at no
cost to the grant. By statistical imputation on the remaining GWASed samples, we will create an extremely large
dataset. We will continue to house the data in two analytic hubs (US and Europe) to simplify access and provide
computational and analytic support.
 3) Perform detailed analyses on the extensive resulting dataset. The dataset (87,542 cases/controls
and 13,766 related individuals in nearly 6,000 families) enables testing of numerous genetic hypotheses
underlying clinical subtypes, biomarkers, effects of rare variants, and variability in the genetic architecture across
ancestries. The initial processing and analysis of the combined genomic data will be overseen through this
application and results will be available to all members. We have an efficient process allowing members to
propose additional studies and the broader research community to access these data and computational and
analytical support through the appropriate analytic hub.
 4) Support the logistics and administration of the IAMDGC. Successful collaboration requires constant
communication and support. We will continue our yearly IAMDGC-specific face-to-face meeting, a second half-
day meeting for those attending the ARVO annual meeting, and regular teleconference calls.
 Our goal is to greatly advance the understanding of AMD pathophysiology (using genomics as our
foundational guide) and thus speed the development of better treatments and/or preventions of AMD."

While many studies will be performed in defined genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC, an important
theme of these studies is to test and demonstrate the relevance of our discoveries to human PDAC. With this
objective, this Core will 1) Systematically collect and bank human pancreatic cancer tissues and blood, and to
establish a registry of clinical and demographic information of these patients, 2) Systematically collect and bank
human pancreatic tissue and blood from patients with chronic pancreatitis and to establish a registry of clinical

by histology, immunohistochemistry, FACS, CyTOF, and single-cell RNASeq, and 4) Collaborate effectively with
Core C to use CODEX for studies on human tissues for all Projects. This Core will support Project 1 by providing
human pancreatic cancer tissue, pre-cancerous pancreatic lesions, and chronic pancreatitis (CP) samples for
evaluation of their genetic diversity in the KRAS oncogene, and tumor suppressor genes. This Core will support
Project 2, by providing pancreata from patients with PDAC, or inflammatory states like CP, to assess immune
and fibroblast subtypes, IL-22/ IL-22RA1 expression patterns and in the context of PDAC, their association with
cancer subtypes and `stemness' phenotypes. This Core will support Project 3, by validating earlier observations
in mouse PDAC models by analyzing immune cells and immunomodulatory factors and their association with
genetic subtypes of human PDAC. This Core will also work closely with Core C to enable appropriate human
tissue processing for the innovative CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX)-based multi-parameter imaging. Thus,
this research core will be highly integrated and supportive of the overall objectives of this Program Project Grant."
10914311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The broad, long-term goal of the Systems Biology Core (SBC) within the Nebraska Center for Integrated
Biomolecular Communication (CIBC) is to serve as a sustainable resource that enables CIBC, the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), and other academic and industrial researchers to investigate complex biological
systems. SBC provides a diverse set of OMICS (i.e., lipidomics, metabolomics, and proteomics), microscopy,
and structural biology services, which afford distinct and invaluable views of an entire system and, accordingly,
are critical to the needs of CIBC Project Leaders and other Center members. The successful application of
microscopy, OMICs, and structural biology techniques are highly dependent on the expertise and experience of
the investigator. Understanding the challenges these methods present to novice and new investigators has
informed the overarching vision of SBC. SBC eschews the typical sample-based service model of a common
facility and instead has adopted a personalized collaborative approach to enable the correct utilization of
microscopy, OMICs, and structural biology methods by new investigators. In this regard, SBC provides
assistance and training from project conception, experimental design, and sample preparation through
implementation and dissemination. An important goal of SBC is enabling the long-term adoption of SBC
technologies through personalized hands-on training and workshops—in other words, SBC personnel are
collaborators and instructors. During Phase 1, SBC established its service pipeline and is providing efficient and
high-quality data to CIBC personnel. SBC created the critical infrastructure for managing projects, samples, and
data and the rapid dissemination of information to investigators. Building on the momentum and successes from
Phase 1, the goal of SBC for Phase 2 is to grow and improve SBC service in response to the needs of CIBC
Project Leaders and other Center members and to support CIBC in achieving its overall goals and long-term
Center sustainability. This will be achieved by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) provide high-quality
OMICs, microscopy, and structural biology assistance to CIBC projects to ensure investigators have adequate
and timely access to core services, 2) enhance existing SBC OMICs techniques by expanding MS imaging,
lipidomics, proteomics, and targeted metabolomics capabilities and improving the efficiency and throughput of
the OMICS technology through automation, and 3) expand and enhance SBC scientific outreach services. The
anticipated outcomes of SBC in Phase 2 are improved and expanded services that addresses the evolving needs
of SBC clients while continuing to provide high quality and timely results. SBC will also strive to increase the
throughput and efficiency of the service pipeline, expand the SBC user-base, and provide additional training
opportunities that enables the adaption of OMICS, microscopy, and structural biology by non-experts."

This application seeks renewal for Years 21-25 of the Training Program in Translational Cardiovascular
Science (TPTCS) within the School of Medicine and Public Health Cardiovascular Research Center (CVRC) at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The CVRC is a campus-wide interdisciplinary research center with
faculty and research members from 31 departments in seven schools and colleges, providing a rich
environment targeting cardiovascular disease through basic research, clinical investigation, diagnosis and
therapy, and public education. The TPTCS training program uniquely creates basic research training for
postdoctoral MDs and PhDs (four positions) as well as predoctoral trainees (five positions) with the goal of
training scientists who will be capable of thinking and working “from molecule to bedside.” The practical
immediate objectives are to attract and train clinicians in basic research, and to attract and train graduate and
postdoctoral (PhD) students in clinically motivated basic science. The TPTCS aims to appoint physicians as
part of their resident and fellow training to half the postdoctoral positions. One of the long-standing strengths of
the program emerging from annual program evaluation is its integration of training among predoctoral students,
basic science postdoctoral trainees, and clinical fellows who work side-by-side in journal clubs, in seminar
series, and at the bench in laboratories. This blending and sharing of different trainee perspectives is
foundational to the goals of the program and creates esprit de corps. The 27 trainers of the TPTCS have been
selected from members of the CVRC for the clinical relevance of their science in the focus areas (heart
failure/regenerative medicine, arrhythmias/ion channel research, and atherosclerosis/vascular biology), their
training records, and the overall robustness and activity of their peer-reviewed research programs. Training
takes place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and exploits the strong institutional support and
environment for such training, as well as the established working relationships between clinical and basic
science departments and faculty both within the School of Medicine and Public Health and the University at
large. Trainers and trainees all participate in core activities that define the program as a cohesive entity.
Several innovations are introduced in this renewal, including enhanced clinical integration for the basic science
trainees and greater professional development opportunities to prepare all trainees for the next stages in their
careers. Appointees to the program to date are extremely strong and program outcomes have been excellent.
The scientists and physician-scientists trained in this translational cardiovascular science program are in
unique positions to apply basic scientific knowledge to benefit patients with cardiovascular disease, the
foremost cause of mortality among Americans."
10904606,"Abstract – Pediatric Rheumatology Tissue Repository (PRTR)
A robust and rigorous infrastructure for biospecimen collection is essential for accelerate innovative translational
research projects in pediatric rheumatology. The Pediatric Rheumatology Tissue Repository (PRTR) was
established in 1996 and has been continuously supported by NIAMS funding to maximize the value of sample
collections for translational research. Since 2017, the PRTR has served as the US biobank for the Childhood
Arthritis Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Research Registry, the largest longitudinal study of pediatric
rheumatic diseases in North America. The overall objective of the proposed PRTR is to accelerate transformative
discovery in pediatric rheumatology by facilitating access to valuable and high quality biospecimens for
innovative translational research projects. The following aims are proposed to achieve this objective. In the first
aim, the PRTR will collect, process and maintain high quality biological specimens from patients with pediatric
rheumatologic and related musculoskeletal conditions to support and grow the local research community. This
includes facilitating the design and management of large-scale sample collections specific to investigator-
initiated translational research. This also includes ongoing collection of high value biospecimens (new-onset
disease and leftover fluid and tissue), and support for pilot biosample collections by early-stage investigators
with innovative research directions but who lack laboratory infrastructure. In Aim 2, the PRTR will expand the
scope of biospecimen collection for pediatric rheumatic disease research nationally. The PRTR will support
development and implementation of advanced biospecimen collections suitable for emerging genomic
approaches, particularly from non-blood tissues including ultrasound-guided synovial and kidney biopsy, bone
marrow, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung tissue. In parallel, the partnership between the PRTR and
CARRA will be leveraged to support protocol development, study design assistance, site training, and
infrastructure development for advanced processing at individual CARRA Registry sites. Finally in Aim 3, the
PRTR will optimize availability, access to and use of biosample collections. This includes near-real-time, aliquot-
level, de-identified specimen data to authenticated, and fully integrated phenotypic and biobanking information

biobanking tracking system for both local and CARRA collections to industry-leading LabVantage LIMS. Taken
together, the PRTR will provide a centralized, high quality, valuable resource for biospecimen collection,
processing, and storage to support the Research Community at CCHMC and nationally. These resources will
accelerate translational research initiatives to further the overall goal of the CRDRC to advance the
understanding of pediatric rheumatic diseases and lead to new therapies for these diseases."
10889171,"Project Summary
Cell-free DNA in the blood provides a non-invasive diagnostic avenue for patients with cancer. Our groups
have pioneered liquid biopsy approaches for detection and characterization of cancer. Recently we have
developed a genome-wide approach for analysis of cfDNA fragmentation profiles called DELFI, DNA
evaluation of fragments for early interception. We demonstrated that fragmentation profiles of healthy
individuals from low coverage whole genome sequencing reflect nucleosomal patterns of white blood cells,
whereas patients with cancer had altered fragmentation profiles. Through the analysis of cell-free DNA
fragmentation patterns, we identified patients with localized cancer and this tool of early detection could result
in better patient outcomes. Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer in the world, and its incidence continues to
increase worldwide. There is an urgent, unmet clinical need for development of noninvasive approaches to
improve cancer screening for high-risk individuals and ultimately the general population. A clear
understanding of molecular changes along the pathway of lung tumorigenesis is critical for identifying
biomarkers related to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Biomarker development for early detection of
lung cancer has broad clinical applications in screening as well as for distinguishing malignant from benign
pulmonary nodules. Tools to better predict the fate of early lesions non-invasively would be invaluable for
early detection of lung cancer, when curative approaches are more likely to succeed. Unlike targeted deep
sequencing approaches that would be cost prohibitive for broad use in a screening population, our approach
is affordable, highly scalable, and may lead to more effective strategies for clinical intervention. The recent
intersection of cancer genomics with novel noninvasive blood tests could revolutionize cancer screening.
The purpose of our proposed research is to study the origins and molecular characteristics of cell-free DNA
fragments along the progression of Lung Cancer, profiling these alterations in preneoplastic lung lesions
likely to progress to invasive cancer, and in treatable lung tumors, as well as in normal controls and in benign
lesions. We aim to implement new features to further optimize our DELFI molecular test in plasma. The
proposed plan is to test and validate our approach in both accrued samples and a prospective lung cancer
screening population. Ultimately, this approach already shows great promise as a pan-cancer early detection
strategy and we intend to expand our research in this direction in collaboration with other EDRN centers. We
envision that these analyses will be rapidly translated into the clinical setting, providing new noninvasive
approaches for early cancer detection."
10839389,"Post-COVID cognitive impairment is common after SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of acute disease
severity. Mechanisms are poorly understood, limiting our ability to prevent cognitive decline for a growing
number of veterans. Identifying markers of risk for cognitive decline in post-COVID-19 syndrome is crucial for
effective prevention and treatment strategies. Silent brain infarctions (SBIs), covert cerebrovascular events
associated with risk of cognitive impairment, are prevalent in COVID-19 survivors. Although mechanisms are
unclear, it is plausible that they are ischemic manifestations of platelet hyperreactivity in COVID-19. Coated-
platelets, a strongly procoagulant subset of platelets produced after co-activation with collagen and thrombin,
are associated with ischemic stroke risk and the presence and number of SBIs on brain imaging from patients
with vascular risk factors. Preliminary work from VA funded research in veterans with COVID-19 showed that
increased coated-platelet levels predicted death at 90 days. In survivors, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly
altered platelet procoagulant potential, with a sharp and sustained increase in coated-platelet levels noted
during convalescence. RNA sequencing in platelets obtained during acute infection identified an association
between pannexins and coated-platelet levels. In the same cohort, 39.4% reported brain fog symptoms a year
after infection, and 58.6% screened positive for cognitive impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) at 14 months. Importantly, mean coated-platelet levels measured during acute infection were
significantly inversely associated with future MoCA score. Lastly, in a separate cohort of veterans with mild
cognitive impairment, SARS-CoV-2 infection and age were significant predictors of progression to dementia at
18 months. Comparison of brain imaging before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed accumulation of new
SBIs following infection in those who progressed. Our central hypothesis, supported by our preliminary
findings, is that cognitive dysfunction in veterans with post-COVID-19 syndrome is mediated by accumulation
of SBIs, which is accelerated among those whose coated-platelet levels are elevated during and after SARS-
CoV-2 infection. Our long-range objective is to develop strategies for preventing cognitive decline after
recovery from COVID-19. The objective of the current application is to determine the role of coated-platelets as
predictors of cognitive dysfunction and SBI after recovery from COVID-19. Three specific aims will test our
hypotheses. Aim 1 will confirm and extend our preliminary findings showing an association between coated-
platelet levels and cognitive dysfunction after recovery from COVID-19. Coated-platelet levels will be assayed
in veterans with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the association between 1) cognitive impairment on
formal neuropsychological testing and 2) the presence of SBI on MRI determined. Aim 2 will characterize the
longitudinal relationship between coated-platelet levels measured every 6 months after enrollment in Aim 1,
and 1) the rate of cognitive decline on repeat neuropsychological testing and 2) the incidence of SBI on repeat
MRI at 18 months. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that platelet pannexins are associated with coated-platelet
levels in veterans with cognitive manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Platelet pannexin-1 and
pannexin-2 mRNA and protein levels will be measured using RT-qPCR and ELISA in blood from subjects
enrolled in Aim 1 and compared with coated-platelet levels. Concurrent non-infected controls and historical
(pre-pandemic) controls will be used for comparison purposes. Considering the older age and vascular risk
burden among veterans, and the substantial impact of soaring cognitive impairment rates after the SARS-CoV-
2 pandemic, risk stratification and intervention strategies to prevent post-COVID cognitive decline have the
potential for enormous benefit. This project utilizes a new paradigm of prothrombotic platelet reactivity to
develop an innovative blood biomarker approach that will also yield novel treatment targets if successful."
10932172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Postoperative pain is a prevalent source of pain requiring appropriate management to reduce its impact upon
quality of life. Even with the availability of several analgesics, postoperative pain is often undermedicated
because of concern related to the adverse consequence of the available therapeutics (e.g., NSAIDs and opiates),
including addiction and decreased survival of cancer patients. To this end we have undertaken development of
RFT1124, a modified apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP), which exerts its action through specific targeting
of membrane lipid rafts by altering local membrane cholesterol dynamics in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons
and macrophages and in spinal microglia that express TLR4 (TLR4-rafts) and are known to be engaged in
processing acute and chronic pain secondary to nerve and tissue injury. We have discovered that TLR4-rafts
are heavily expressed on macrophages and exclusively on nociceptive DRG neurons. We have shown that it is
possible to specifically target these TLR4-rafts through the actions of RFT1124 (AIBP), which binds to TLR4 and
specifically disrupts the associated lipid rafts. In vitro, AIBP blocks the ectopic activity of human DRG nociceptors
isolated from painful dermatomes. In vivo, intravenous injection of AIBP prior to paw incision prevented the
development of tactile allodynia in rats. These exciting new data, together with our published studies showing
AIBP efficacy and mechanism of action in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, suggest the potential
of AIBP (RFT1124) in treatment of postoperative pain. In Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR proposal, we will
define the efficacy of intravenous RFT1124 delivery on postoperative pain in rats, including: (i) dose response;
(ii) dependence on the time of pre or post incision administration; (iii) sex differences. In Phase II, we plan to
manufacture and release RFT1124 drug product for expanded efficacy and toxicology studies using cGMP-
compatible processes and analytical assays. Further, a pharmacokinetics of RFT1124 in blood and DRG and a
non-GLP safety assessment of intravenous delivery of RFT1124 will be conducted to establish an estimate of
safety margin and target organs. As an independent biomarker of activity, we will characterize the effects of
RFT1124 on hyperactivity in rat DRG neurons otherwise produced by surgical incision in male and female rats.
The efficacy studies will be extended to human DRG nociceptive neurons in culture, with the DRG obtained from
donors of both sexes. Target engagement will be tested with an AIBP variant, which like RFT1124 alters lipid
rafts but does not bind TLR4. We anticipate significant suppression of allodynic behavior and ectopic activity
induced by surgical injury after incision by RFT1124 but not the AIBP variant lacking the TLR4-binding domain.
These studies will provide the enabling data set to initiate a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in anticipation of
moving RFT1124 into first-in-human clinical trials.

10919788,"Life Course Methodology Core
 The overall goal of the Life Course Methodology Core (LCMC) of the New York Regional Center for
Diabetes Translation Research is to support high quality type 2 translational research in diabetes prevention
and control across the life span. The life course perspective focuses on the biopsychosocial and behavioral
processes that individuals experience during particular periods in their life, and examines the interplay between
these exposures in shaping disease risk. Currently, there is strong evidence from observational studies that the
processes that lead to the development of diabetes start early in life and continue throughout the lifespan. This
life course approach also can enhance the translation of efficacious interventions by ensuring that intervention
strategies are appropriate for the age group targeted and address associated individual or environmental
barriers. Following this line of thought, we propose a two pronged approach that identifies the most relevant
modifiable risk factors and the most appropriate interventions taking into account the life stage targeted. The
LCMC will leverage existing multidisciplinary expertise and infrastructure to facilitate application of a life course
perspective to new translational diabetes research. Einstein investigators and their collaborators have
accumulated decades of expertise in diabetes research across the life span and are well positioned to
contribute to the acceleration of translational research. The LCMC will provide conceptual and instrumental
support regarding the design, and implementation of new translational diabetes research across the life span
with the ultimate goal of decreasing the burden of diabetes and alleviating diabetes health disparities. The
LCMC specific aims are: 1) To build capacity in using the life course approach to the design of new
translational diabetes research; 2) To facilitate the implementation of new translational diabetes research; 3)
To provide consultation and mentorship on biological factors underlying diabetes health disparities across the

The Latino population is the largest ethnic/racial minority group in the U.S. and is projected to continue to
grow, as the U.S. transitions to a “majority-minority nation.” Latinos clearly bear a disproportionate burden
of diabetes, as compared to non-Hispanic whites. The landmark Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
Latinos (HCHS/SOL) of 16,415 Latino adults from four U.S. field centers showed an overall diabetes
prevalence of 16.9% with more than 41% undiagnosed, and low levels of diabetes control. The causes of
Latino diabetes disparities include social determinants with their roots in structural racism, as well as
psychosocial, lifestyle, biological and genetic pathways. To combat diabetes disparities and improve quality of
life in US Latinos, innovative, culturally appropriate approaches are needed that address multi-level targets,
partner with community entities, and apply state of science technologies. In the proposed renewal of the New
York Regional Center for Diabetes Translation Research (NY-CDTR), we will build on our successful Latino
Network for Diabetes Translation Research – a National Resource Core (“Latino Network Core”) supporting
type 2 to 4 translational research that focuses on cutting-edge diabetes prevention and management
approaches with emphasis on sociocultural adaptation for U.S. Latinos. We will continue to leverage resources
and expertise of the HCHS/SOL which now includes six years of longitudinal follow-up (with a third, 12-year
follow-up in process) and rich phenotypic and genetic data from multiple ancillary studies relevant to diabetes
translational research across the life course. In addition, we expand the Latino Network Core’s investigator
expertise in culturally appropriate interventions targeting diabetes prevention, management, and healthcare
services. Expertise in cultural tailoring, community engaged research, eHealth approaches, and the use of
pragmatic interventions in real-world healthcare contexts will help guide maximally effective, sustainable, and
innovative translational research in Latinos. In this cycle, we seek to: 1) Further develop the Latino Network
Core, building national capacity for diabetes translational research among Latinos, by engaging new members
(with special emphasis on early stage investigators and those who are underrepresented in medicine), leading
research dissemination and training activities, and convening scientific interest group discussions and themed
meetings; 2) Foster novel research focused on understanding Latino diabetes health and disparities and
identifying modifiable targets for intervention, by facilitating access to the richly characterized HCHS/SOL
datasets and other resources; and 3) Provide consultation and mentorship on study conceptualization, design,
assessment, and evaluation for type 2 to 4 translational research on diabetes prevention, management, and
healthcare services in Latinos. By capitalizing on HCHS/SOL resources and our specialized expertise in
culturally informed interventions to improve health and healthcare among Latinos with or at risk for diabetes,
the evolved Latino Network Core will significantly extend the reach and impact of the NY-CDTR in promoting

10905005,"Abstract/Project Summary
 While prognosis for early stage breast cancer (BC) has improved dramatically, 20-30% of patients recur at
distant sites and ultimately succumb to their disease. To date, the spatial and temporal patterns of BC relapse
have been difficult to predict. Moreover, when and how metastatic potential is determined is largely
unknown. To address these questions, we have developed spatial computational and mathematical models of
tumor progression to infer the ‘time’ of metastatic seeding. Application of these techniques to paired primary
breast cancers with matched metastases, yielded quantitative evidence for early metastatic seeding, often 2-
4 years before the primary lesion is detectable (Nat Gen 2020), consistent with experimental and clinical data
indicating that BC cells can disseminate early and persist.
 In parallel, we defined the rates and routes of relapse across 11 Integrative Clusters (ICs) in an
analysis of 2,000 early-stage BCs with long-term follow-up (METABRIC cohort: Nature 2019; 2012). These
include two triple negative BC subgroups with distinct relapse trajectories and four ER+/HER2- ICs (1, 2, 6 and
9) with high and persistent risk of relapse up to 20 years after diagnosis. Collectively, these high-risk
subgroups account for 26% of all ER+/HER2- tumors and the majority of BC relapses. The pattern of copy
number amplification (CNA) and overexpression in these high-risk ICs echoes that seen for HER2+ BC, each
harboring druggable clonal genomic drivers. This breakthrough discovery led to a biomarker-driven clinical
trial evaluating new targeted therapies in early-stage high-risk BC patients. However, the definitive drivers and
mechanisms of progression in these subgroups have yet to be characterized. Moreover, how the local tissue
microenvironment (TME) varies across the ICs and contributes to immune suppression, dissemination,
dormancy and relapse is unknown
 We hypothesize that the oncogenic drivers of the high-risk ICs drive tumor progression and relapse by
dictating immune contexture and remodeling the cell surface glycoproteome, potentiating tolerogenic cell states–
as further functionally evaluated in Projects 2 and 3 in collaboration with Michael Angelo and Michael
Bassik. Additionally, we hypothesize that these amplicons confer intrinsic endocrine resistance, necessitating
new therapeutic strategies. We test these hypotheses in the following Specific Aims: Aim 1- Characterizes the
TME in longitudinal BC cohorts and evaluate the association between IC, glycosyltransferase expression,
response to therapy and relapse. Aim 2 - Quantifies the dynamics of BC relapse and the response to clinical
therapies across the ICs. Aim 3 - Measures clonal dynamics and identify mechanisms of resistance to targeted
and endocrine therapies in high-risk ER+ BC patient-derived organoids from primary and metastatic lesions."
10905008,"Abstract/Project Summary
Breast cancer (BC) metastasis is an emergent feature that occurs when the tumor’s ability to recruit metabolic
resources, avoid immune activation, and disseminate to distant sites exceeds the capacity of surrounding normal
tissue to prevent these processes. In line with this, work over the last decade has demonstrated the crucial role
played by the tumor microenvironment (TME) in promoting or deterring BC progression. Tumor cell migration
and immune recruitment have both been shown to be heavily influenced by fibroblasts and the surrounding
extracellular matrix (ECM) they produce. Additionally, protein glycosylation has been shown to modulate these
interactions. To understand how tumor glycosylation and ECM remodeling interact to potentiate BC metastasis,
we will use spatial transcriptomics and two complementary mass spectrometry methods, MIBI-TOF and MALDI,
to identify glycan-dependent, cell-cell, and cell-ECM interactions that shift the TME toward tumor permissive
states. All three analyses will be performed on spatially-coregistered serial sections from the same tissue blocks.
In doing so, comprehensive single-cell maps of each tissue sample constructed by MIBI-TOF can be directly
superimposed with de novo proteomic and transcriptomic data. We will map and enumerate the lineage and
major functional subsets of tumor and stromal cells with respect to relevant therapeutic and molecular
parameters to understand how the BC TME evolves with disease progression. These features will be overlaid
with de novo imaging of tissue glycans to identify potential mechanisms of immune evasion that involve tumor
sialoglycans and macrophage-bound SIGLECs. The frequency and spatial enrichment of these features will be
correlated with spatial transcriptomics data to identify regulatory glycosyltransferases promoting these
interactions. Next, ECM-MALDI and MIBI-TOF data will be used to identify how collagen type, hydroxylation, and
crosslinking shift in coordination with the collagen structure and function of neighboring cell populations. In
particular, we will focus on understanding how the activity of two families of enzymes, prolyl and lysyl
hydroxylases, drive structural changes in the ECM that promote BC metastasis. The clinical significance of these
extracted cellular and molecular definitions of ECM remodeling will be assessed with respect to metastatic risk,
stage, and IC subtype. Taken together, this work will provide an unprecedented view into how TME structure
and cell-cell interactions between tumor and stroma relate to specific facets of the tumor ECM and glycome."
10905012,"Abstract/Project Summary
Metastatic breast cancer and relapse following therapy are dependent on (1) resistance to recognition and
destruction of cancer cells by the immune system, and (2) development of intrinsic resistance to targeted and
endocrine therapies. The study of these processes using in vitro cancer models have been limited in scale and
often lack key properties of the tumor microenvironment. We recently developed a scalable cancer spheroid
system that enabled the first genome-wide CRISPR screens in 3D culture; phenotypes in this system much
better reflect in vivo tumors (Nature, 2020). In addition, we developed a magnetic separation strategy to rapidly
identify regulators of phagocytosis by macrophages (Nature Genetics, 2018) and have successfully extended
this strategy to study macrophage-tumor cell interactions. Here we will use these systems to identify
regulators of therapeutic relapse and immune evasion in metastatic breast cancer.
 To investigate mechanisms of relapse after therapy, we will focus on four ER+ breast cancer subgroups with
high relapse risk previously identified by the Curtis Lab (Project 1). This has formed the basis of a biomarker-
driven clinical trial targeting the presumed candidate drivers in these high-risk subgroups. Since the amplicons
defining these subgroups each contain multiple genes, we will use functional CRISPR perturbations to test which
genes (or combinations thereof) are the true drivers. Further, we will build on the comprehensive characterization
of these tumors from transcriptomics (Project 1) and spatial proteomics (Project 2), adding functional
measurements of the requirement for each altered factor in growth and resistance to therapy using high-
throughput CRISPR screens. Together these studies will dramatically enhance our understanding of which
genes are critical targets for improved therapies in high-relapse risk breast cancers.
 To investigate how metastatic tumors evade the immune system, we will focus on macrophage-tumor
interactions. Surprisingly, although macrophages comprise 50% of the cell mass of some tumors, breast
cancer cells appear resistant to macrophage killing. This is largely due to anti-phagocytic signals expressed by
cancer cells, including CD47; however, accumulating evidence points to the existence of additional,
unidentified anti-phagocytic signals in breast cancer. In addition, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are
re-wired to support tumor development and have reduced phagocytosis. It remains unclear, however, which
genes mediate resistance to phagocytosis in high-risk IC subtypes, and which macrophage genes underlie
immunosuppression by metastatic breast cancers. Here, we will systematically identify genes limiting anti-cancer
activity by macrophages by conducting CRISPR screens in both macrophages and cancer cells, making use of
sophisticated ALI patient-derived organoid models to validate hits. These complementary approaches will
functionally define breast cancer driver genes and therapeutic targets that control therapeutic response and
immune evasion, informing the next generation of clinical trials."
10905015,"Project Summary/Abstract
In order to investigate the processes of breast cancer metastatic relapse, longitudinal cohorts of breast tumor
tissue with detailed clinical information are needed. Thus, an integral function of the Stanford Breast Metastasis
Center (SBMC) will be the acquisiton, processing, clinical annotation, and curation of hundreds of breast tumors
collected across multiple sites and stages of disease progression. To this end, this project describes the aims
and functions of the SBMC Biospecimen and Pathology Core. The Core will be led by experienced breast
pathologist Dr Gregory Bean, who will implement and iteratively improve standard operating procedure protocols
for processing, pathologic review, and generation of tissue microarrays for the Core samples. The lab of principal
investigator Dr Christina Curtis will assist in sample collection and processing to enable numerous downstream
multi-omic protocols, in which they have extensive expertise, as well as breast organoid generation. Breast
medical oncologist Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin and breast surgeon Dr Irene Wapnir will recruit participants to
prospective tissue acquisition protocols and will design and review clinical annotation procedures. The Core will
draw samples from six established efforts, including two completed clinical trials (TRIO B07 and TONIC), two
prospectively recruiting clinical trials (NCT04504331 and TERPSICHORE), an existing Institutional Review
Board (IRB)-approved protocol whereby archival tumor specimens are collected retrospectively, and an existing
IRB-approved protocol whereby prospective serial tumor and blood samples are collected from consented
patients with breast cancer undergoing routine care. In Aim 1, longitudinal tumor samples throughout treatment
and metastasis will be collected from these sources. Prospectively collected samples will be subjected to rapid
processing to include formalin fixation, cryopreservation, and preservation of viable cells for organoids; H&E
slides will be scanned and reviewed for tumor cellularity and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; standardized
immunohistochemistry will be performed; and detailed information about location and orientation will be
recorded. In Aim 2, a highly integrated database will be constructed to provide linkage of these collected
biospecimens with high quality demographic, clinical, pathologic, and treatment data. This secure Research and
Electronic Data Capture database will include detailed clinical information and will link biospecimens via
barcodes to the Laboratory Information Management System, where information on all downstream assays
performed on samples is stored. In Aim 3, a framework for sharing high quality, de-identified biospecimens and
clinical data within the SBMC will be established. Summaries of de-identified clinical metadata that can be shared
with investigators across the SBMC will be generated, and rapid identification of project-specific cohorts enabled.
Successful completion of these Aims will result in an annotated, longitudinal breast cancer biospecimen cohort
with unprecedented molecular and clinical annotation and the potential to reveal new insight into the metastatic
niche and breast cancer evolution."

Breast cancer research is substantially hampered by lack of experimental models that efficiently reflect
physiological disease necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of metastatic disease. Conventional
cell lines and PDX models have contributed greatly to our understanding of breast cancer biology, but are
inefficiently derived, do not fully capture the heterogeneity across breast cancer subtypes and rarely mimic
clinical observations. Advancements in 3D organoid models from our lab and others have shown that patient-
derived organoids (PDOs) can be generated efficiently, retain histologic and genetic features of originating tumor,
closely mimic patient drug response and are amendable to scale for genomic functional screens. Recently, the
Kuo lab developed next generation PDOs by developing an Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) culture system that enables
culture of tumor epithelium en bloc with endogenous immune stroma (Cell, 2018). The advent of ALI organoid
culture provides critical experimental models for studying the tumor microenvironment. Here, the Organoid Core
provides essential patient derived organoid models for identifying the evolutionary dynamics and
microenvironmental determinants of metastatic breast cancer for Stanford Breast Metastasis Center
investigators.
 Co-led by breast cancer genomics expert Dr. Christina Curtis and organoid pioneer Dr. Calvin Kuo,
the Stanford Breast Metastasis Center Organoid Core is uniquely positioned and qualified to address the
unmet needs highlighted in this RFA: Metastasis Research Network, by providing novel experimental models to
study metastatic dissemination patterns, cellular microenvironment crosstalk, and drug response. Here, the
organoid core will provide patient-derived breast cancer submerged organoids from primary and metastatic
tissue to study targeted drug resistance and to define specific metastatic patterns of breast cancer sub-clones
in Project 1, along with genomic functional screens using CRISPR/CAS9 and macrophage-mediated
phagocytosis in Project 3. Novel human breast cancer ALI organoid models will be extensively characterized
as compared to originating tissue in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2. Further, ALI culture conditions will be
optimized for functional tumor-immune crosstalk studies with Project 3. Upon successful completion, novel
organoid models will provide critical experimental tools for defining metastatic driver genes and identifying
therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance and immune evasion."

10702059,"β2-glycoprotein I (β2-Gp1) is a cardiolipin-binding protein first identified in 1961. It is a 50
 kDa glycoprotein with a plasma concentration of 1−4 µM. The physiological function of β2-Gp1
 is not known even though it is conserved evolutionarily from invertebrates to humans.
 Anticardiolipin antibodies are associated with arterial, venous, microvascular thrombosis or
with recurrent midtrimester abortion due to placental vascular insufficiency. These antibodies are
not specific towards cardiolipin, but to conformational epitopes on proteins bound to cardiolipin.
The most common protein antigen is β2-Gp1. High titers of these antibodies are associated with
thrombosis and recurrent midtrimester abortion due to placental thrombosis. While a large number
of hypotheses have been put forward, the precise mechanism of thrombosis is not known because
the physiological function of β2-Gp1 is not known.
Mitochondria are organelles that maintain energy supply in cells. Cardiolipin is a universal
component of mitochondrial membrane. Its unique physicochemical properties play an important
role in the structural organization and function. Recent investigations have shown mitochondria
are released during tissue injury and are also present in the extracellular space as an intact
organelle or enclosed in vesicle. Extracellular mitochondrial DNA resembles bacterial DNA and
present as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), which provoke a proinflammatory
response.
Our studies propose a novel function for evolutionarily conserved β2-Gp1 as a regulator of
extracellular mitochondria levels in circulation and how antiβ2-Gp1 antibodies may lead to a
procoagulant state. We show that β2-Gp1 binds to circulating cardiolipin-expressing extracellular
mitochondria in a concentration-dependent manner. In vitro, β2-Gp1 promotes mitochondrial
uptake and clearance by macrophages and endothelial cells. In vivo, β2-Gp1-deficient mice have
increased circulating extracellular mitochondria. We also demonstrate defective clearance due to
impaired phagocytosis of infused mitochondria from the circulation in β2-Gp1-deficient mice. We
posit that the evolutionarily conserved β2-Gp1 mediates the clearance of circulating
cardiolipin-expressing extracellular mitochondria. Our goals in the current proposal are to
expand these studies, delving further into the role of β2-Gp1 in the clearance of circulating
mitochondria, and to investigate how β2-Gp1 antibodies predispose to thrombosis. These specific
aims of this proposal are (1) To further define the role of β2-Gp1 in the clearance of
extracellular mitochondria. We will test the hypothesis that β2-Gp1 promotes clearance of
cardiolipin-expressing mitochondria by macrophages and/or endothelial cells. (2) To
determine the effect of engulfed exogenous mitochondria on macrophage and endothelial
functions. (3) To determine the role of antiβ2-Gp1 antibodies in thrombosis seen in
antiphospholipid syndrome. We will test the hypothesis that the uptake of antiβ2-Gp1
antibodies bound mitochondria enhance the procoagulant response in monocytes and
endothelial cells following their uptake."
10864798,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The current proposal seeks to study implementation of integrated substance use and mental health services
for justice-involved young (JIY) women in Brazil. Despite a significant rise in rates of substance use disorders
among JIY women (age 18-24) globally the past decade, implementation of evidence-based substance use
services remains critically low in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and the global health field has
made minimal progress in rigorously examining factors governing their implementation. Co-occurrence of
substance use and psychiatric disorders among JIY women is the norm worldwide, with exposure to trauma
theorized as a mechanism underlying the onset and mutual maintenance of co-occurring symptoms. In LMIC
like Brazil, substance use services are delivered in isolated and minimally funded healthcare systems by
providers with low capacity to address simultaneous psychiatric symptoms and exposure to trauma that may
generate and maintain substance use. Contextually appropriate integration of substance use and mental health
services (i.e., concurrent provision of substance use and mental health services by one or a set of providers)
may be a viable means of increasing implementation of substance use services for JIY women in LMIC
settings. The proposed study leverages advances in substance use services research, implementation
science, juvenile justice, and global health to guide integration of Contingency Management (CM), a gold
standard substance use intervention, with brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) services for JIY women re-
entering community from juvenile detention in Brazil. JIY women released from detention (age 18-22 years) are
a high-risk population with elevated rates of substance use relapse and high rates of co-occurring psychiatric
disorders and trauma exposure. Mixed-methods data will be used to explore individual- and provider-level
barriers and facilitators to integration of CM/CBT services for this population. An understanding of multi-level
implementation factors will inform development of a provider implementation plan in integrated CM/CBT
services delivery. A mixed-method open trial will examine preliminary feasibility and acceptability of integrated
services. The provider implementation plan will include trauma-informed considerations to enhance
implementation of substance use services. Study findings can be used to inform best practices for delivering
integrated substance use and mental health services for JIY adult populations in LMIC, as well as high-income
countries where implementation of integrated interventions significantly lags. Findings may also serve as an
important demonstration project in LMIC settings as they tackle the significant burden of young adult substance
use. The study benefits from well-established community collaborations in Brazil, a strong mentorship team,
and the F32 applicant’s prior global mental health research training to fulfill its aims."

 Memory of a single event can last a lifetime. Certain experiences can guide behavior minutes, months,
and years after the event has transpired. For this to happen, the brain must encode the relevant information
from the event, retain it for an indeterminate amount of time, then retrieve that memory when given appropriate
cues. Previous work has shown that retrieval of a fearful experience is behaviorally similar across recent and
remote retrieval times of a memory, yet the neural circuits mediating that memory are importantly different
across the memory timeline. In short, behavior remains stable while neural activity is dynamic. Evidence
suggests that memories are reorganized across time – increasingly involve a distributed cortical network.
Although we have identified several independent cortical regions that participate in remote memory, our
understanding of how they interact at the and the nature of these changes is lacking My preliminary data
indicates that an uninvestigated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) projection coordinates remote but not recent
memory via projections to association cortex. Further exploration is needed to determine the specific activity
patterns in these circuits during memory retrieval over time. These discoveries would reveal fundamental
principles by which the brain organizes and retrieves salient experiences across time.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the cell-type specific changes that occur in
mPFC ensembles as fear memories reorganize from recent to remote and to determine the nature of
this reorganization. Based on published work from my mentor and my preliminary findings, my project will
focus on the connection between mPFC and auditory association areas. To address these questions, I will use
circuit-specific, optogenetic approaches to establish necessity and sufficiency of a mPFC–cortical association
circuit for remote memory. This will address the functional role of these mPFC projection neurons. I will then
use freely-moving calcium imaging to record the activity of these cells at both recent and remote memory
timepoints in order to examine how these mPFC neurons encode and behavior and task variables across
memory timepoints. Finally, with a combined viral-genetic approach, I will label activity-dependent ensembles
while employing whole-brain circuit mapping to understand the anatomical relationship between recent and
remote ensembles and their downstream connections. Together, these aims will reveal novel insights into the
time-dependent changes in memory organization and enhance our understanding of mPFC function in
organizing cortical networks, potentially identifying improved circuits to target for treatment of fear disorders
(e.g. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)."
10881740,"Project Summary/Abstract
This application seeks renewal of funding for a Research Program for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) in vivo testing as part of the NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP). Recent US
Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer
compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at
maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials.
The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or
drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art
preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular
characterization and authentication.
 The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune-
deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs
develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary
disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the
proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a
reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs
are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals.
 The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the
disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of
response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in
order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in
the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6-
10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in
combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new
agents per year.
 By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to
improve the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would
otherwise succumb to their disease."
10904693,"Cancer Relevance and Scientific Rationale: Childhood cancer survivors are at a life-long risk of chronic health
conditions; by age 50, the cumulative incidence of life-threatening/fatal chronic health conditions is 53%. The
two leading causes of premature mortality in childhood cancer survivors are radiation-related subsequent
neoplasms (SNs) and anthracycline-related cardiac dysfunction (CD). Radiation and anthracyclines are both
used in >60% of children with cancer, and there are no plans in the foreseeable future to eliminate these agents.
Although there is a dose-response relation between radiation and SN and between anthracyclines and CD
(regardless of the underlying primary cancer), there is significant inter-patient variability in the risk, suggesting
the moderating role of genetic predisposition. The high burden of morbidity coupled with the inter-individual
variability in risk, suggests a need and an opportunity to identify patients at highest risk for treatment-related
morbidity, such that targeted interventions can be instituted. Broad Plan: This application harnesses and merges
novel concepts from the field of molecular biology, pharmacogenomics and cancer survivorship to identify cancer
patients by their personal risk of SN or CD. This award also attempts to understand the molecular pathogenesis
of these complications to inform future development of targeted prevention/therapeutic strategies. The necessary
infrastructure for the proposed research, including banked, annotated biospecimens (n=13,450) and pre-existing
collaborations with the necessary expertise will be leveraged in this application. The goals are to: i) develop a
risk prediction model for radiation-related SN and anthracycline-related CD in childhood cancer survivors; ii)
replicate the optimized model in an independent cohort of childhood cancer survivors; iii) apply the optimized
model to newly-diagnosed children with cancer to predict the risk of incident SN/CD; iv) determine the functional
relevance of the genetic signatures. Qualifications: I am the founding Director of the Institute for Cancer
Outcomes and Survivorship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I have over 20y of experience
conducting cancer outcomes research that bridges the fields of oncology, epidemiology and genetics. Since
2000, I have been charged with shaping the pediatric oncology survivorship research agenda within the
Children's Oncology Group – an NCI-supported clinical trials group, devoted exclusively to pediatric cancer
research across 220 centers. I am currently serving as chair-elect for the ASCO survivorship committee. I am a
Leukemia Lymphoma Scholar, a recipient of the Frank H Oski award, and am an elected member of the American
Society of Clinical Investigation, and the Association for American Physicians. I have been continuously funded
by NCI since 2000. With over 235 peer-reviewed publications and 15,220 citations (9,300 since 2012), my
Google Scholar H-INDEX is 66 (54 since 2012) and my i10-index is 182 (167 since 2012). I am fully committed
to improving the long-term health of our childhood cancer survivors, and I strongly believe that findings from this
application will accelerate the pace to reduce the burden of morbidity in this population."

Although RCC is typically classified as an immunogenic tumor, recent profiling studies instead suggest that
presence of CD8+ TIL in this form of cancer is an indicator of poor prognosis. These findings emphasize the
importance of appreciating immune context/immune cell networking in the tumor microenvironment when
interpreting the operational status of tumor immunity and its likely impact on disease progression and response
to interventional therapy. Indeed, if one instead considers organized clusters of CD8+ T cells and mature DC-
LAMP+ dendritic cells (DC) within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in tumors, these lymphoid “organs” are
positive prognostic indicators for overall survival/PFS in RCC patients. Tumor-associated TLS have been
suggested to serve as an immune “oasis” for infiltrating lymphocytes exhibiting less-exhausted phenotypes, and
as sites for in situ DC-mediated cross-priming of a diversified therapeutic CD8+ T cell repertoire. We have
recently shown that vaccination against tumor-associated blood vessel antigens (TBVA) results in vascular
normalization (VN; i.e. vascular trimming, reduced vascular leak/hypoxia/interstitial fluid pressure) and the de
novo development of TLS within tumors in mice and humans responding to interventional vaccine-based
immunotherapy. Remarkably, we have also observed that the anti-tumor efficacy of these vaccines exhibits
profound gender/sexual dimorphism, with higher response rates in females (or castrated males) vs. intact males,
suggesting a regulatory role for sex steroids and their receptors. Our central hypotheses are that: i.)
combination immunotherapy promoting VN in RCC will enhance TLS development and the generation of a
broadly-reactive therapeutic CD8+ T cell repertoire exhibiting superior “fitness” and anti-tumor efficacy, and ii.)
gender dimorphic response to vaccination can be circumvented by co-administration of androgen synthesis/AR
antagonists. Given a 2:1 male:female incidence of ccRCC, these latter studies are expected to dramatically
expand the therapeutic utility of TBVA-targeted vaccines against RCC. We will initially perform an exploratory
clinical trial to determine the impact of an autologous αDC1/peptide vaccine targeting TBVA + oral low-dose
cabozantinib on VN, TLS formation and tumor-infiltrating T cell fitness in patients with recently-diagnosed primary
ccRCC prior to planned surgical resection (Aim 1), before then pursuing animal models to test the hypotheses
that i.) agents capable of promoting VN in murine RCC (RENCA, RENCA.VHL-/-) tumors will synergize with
vaccines targeting RCC and/or TBVA antigens +/- checkpoint blockade in promoting the development of TLS,
improved tumor-infiltrating T cell (TIL) fitness, an expanded TIL repertoire and superior therapeutic benefit (Aim
2) and ii.) agents capable of interrupting androgen synthesis/androgen receptor-signaling will improve
therapeutic efficacy of VN-inducing immunotherapies in male/female BALB/c mice bearing RCC tumors (Aim 3)."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication that is routinely detected as part of standard
prenatal care. After delivery, women with GDM are 7 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those
without GDM. National clinical guidelines thus urge completion of a 75-gram, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), given its superior sensitivity to detect diabetes, by 12 weeks postpartum. Clinical guidelines also
advise participation in an evidence-based lifestyle program for diabetes prevention. Yet uptake of this
recommended care remains low, and evidence from randomized trials on interventions to increase uptake
remains scarce. Here, we propose to test a novel, multi-component outreach intervention that explicitly targets
as-yet neglected, patient-level motivational and logistical barriers to engaging in preventive care during the
demanding postpartum period. We will leverage the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to identify, in a
randomized factorial trial, which of four theory-driven components increase actual completion of postpartum
screening and enrollment in lifestyle programs for diabetes prevention: 1) a streamlined values affirmation, 2)
personalized information about diabetes risk, 3) an interactive motivational interviewing-based module, and 4)
an interactive action planning module. Each component is designed to be self-directed and delivered securely
online via existing infrastructure in a health system setting, increasing its future potential for large-scale reach.
In a racially and ethnically diverse sample of women with GDM within the Kaiser Permanente Northern
California (KPNC) health system, our specific aims are as follows. Aim 1: Identify which of four components of
the outreach intervention increase completion of a) a 75-gram, 2-hour OGTT within 4-12 weeks postpartum,
aligned with national clinical guidelines (primary outcome), and b) any postpartum diabetes screening test
(OGTT, fasting plasma glucose, or hemoglobin A1c) by 52 weeks postpartum (secondary outcome). Aim 2:
Identify which of four components of the outreach intervention increase enrollment in a health system- or
community-based lifestyle program for diabetes prevention by 52 weeks postpartum (secondary outcome). Aim
3: Determine whether each intervention component impacts its target mediator, as predicted by its respective
theory. We will efficiently and objectively assess screening outcomes via electronic health records. Results will
yield an optimized intervention ready to be tested in a future pragmatic trial to accelerate uptake of guideline-
recommended postpartum care for women with GDM, with the long-term goal of preventing diabetes in a
diverse and high-risk clinical population."
10907537,"Project Summary
Our long-term goal is to determine how age-related breast cancer can be prevented; aging is the leading risk
for breast cancer and the aging population in the US is steadily expanding. This is an unanswered question
largely because the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the age-related increase in breast cancer
incidence are poorly understood. We recently published that the percentage of CD49fhi mammary stem cells
(MaSCs), which can form basal-like mammospheres in vitro and regenerate mammary ducts in vivo, increased
steadily during aging. The age-related increase of CD49fhi basal-like cells occurs in both luminal and basal
layers, and is associated with increased percentage of mammary ducts with pre-/early-neoplastic lesions in
mammary glands of older (25- to 32-month-old) mice. Recent studies showed that MaSC-enriched CD49fhi
human mammary epithelial cells are much more prone to be transformed by oncogenes than luminal
progenitor cells and mature luminal cells. Indeed, mammary glands regenerated in vivo by older mouse
CD49fhi MaSCs showed significantly more hyperplastic and dysplastic lesions than those regenerated by
CD49fhi MaSCs from young (2- to 6-month-old) mice. Whole genome RNA sequencing and gene ontology
analysis revealed a significantly elevated senescence-associated inflammatory response in older mouse
mammary gland cells. Senescent cells are known to have increased mTORC1 activity, which in turn can
promote a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Significantly, in our clinical trial, short-term low-dose
rapamycin treatment significantly reduced CD49fhi MaSC frequency and biomarkers associated with cellular
senescence, inflammation, and proliferation in breast tissue from postmenopausal patients. These novel
observations led us to hypothesize that a positive feedback loop between cellular senescence and increased
mTORC1 activity in aging mammary gland promotes the transformation of, and tumorigenesis by, CD49fhi
stem-like cells, which can be abrogated by pharmacological interventions. In this proposal, we will test various
mouse models of aging and primary organoid cultures of human mammary epithelial cells from pre- and post-
menopausal women to identify mechanisms that generate the aging-associated CD49fhi MaSCs and their
lineage origin. We will also determine whether long-term intermittent treatment with rapamycin and/or fisetin, a
senolytic agent, can abrogate the aberrant CD49fhi MaSCs and prevent mammary tumorigenesis. If successful,
our research will reveal the lineage of the aberrant CD49fhi MaSCs, how they were generated, and whether
they can be abrogated for long-term by pharmacologic interventions. This work will provide essential
information for future clinical studies of using rapamycin-like senolytics for the prevention of breast cancer,
particularly the triple negative breast cancer, for which there is no preventive strategy."
10844362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia characterized by progressive cognitive decline.
The underlying causes remain poorly understood after decades of efforts, and the disease still cannot be cured,
prevented, or significantly delayed. Myelin impairment can disrupt axonal transport, integrity, and plasticity,
leading to a massive reduction in signal transduction. Given its essential role in development and maintenance
of higher cognitive functions, loss of myelin could play a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. A non-invasive MR
imaging technique that can accurately evaluate myelin could therefore be of critical importance for precise
diagnosis of AD. Synthetic MRI (SyMRI) has been proposed to indirectly map myelin by assessing brain
parenchymal fraction (BPF) and myelin parenchymal fraction (MyPF). However, myelin has a very short T2 (<<1
ms) and is invisible with conventional sequences such as those used with SyMRI. As a result, SyMRI only
indirectly evaluates myelin via measuring water signals, and cannot evaluate myelin quality using the T1 and T2*
relaxation times. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) sequences with echo times (TEs) of ~8µs, which are 100-1000
times shorter than the TEs of conventional sequences, make it possible to directly detect signal from myelin
protons and so circumvent problems associated with SyMRI. The major challenge with UTE approach is the
concurrent detection of high signal from various water components. The 3D short TR adiabatic inversion recovery
UTE (STAIR-UTE) sequence employs an adiabatic inversion pulse for uniform inversion of long-T2 tissues, which
together with a short TR and a high flip angle allow robust suppression of all water components with a wide
range of T1 values, thereby selective myelin mapping. The first aim of this study is to validate and compare 3D
STAIR-UTE and SyMRI sequences for myelin imaging in phantoms and brain specimens from donors without
(n=20), and with AD (n=20) using histology as reference standard. The second aim is to evaluate STAIR-UTE
and SyMRI sequences for myelin mapping in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=40) and AD (n=40)
as well as healthy controls (n=40). The participants are part of Dr. Du’s newly funded R01 grant. We will correlate
SyMRI metrics (BPF, MyPF) and STAIR-UTE metrics (myelin PD, T1, T2*) with cognitive assessments including
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Consortium to Establish a Registry of Dementia (CERAD), and Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) scales. Our central hypothesis is that 3D STAIR-UTE sequence will robustly detect
changes in myelin, and that mapping of myelin quantity with myelin PD and quality with myelin T1 and T2* will
provide more specific evaluation of myelin damage and correlate better with disability and disease progression
in AD than metrics derived from the SyMRI approach. Dr. Athertya and her mentor, Dr Du, have designed a
detailed training plan and assembled a strong research team to guide Dr. Athertya through her fellowship period
towards preparing her for a productive career in translational research for AD."
10825432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus
disease (COVID-19), has spurred an unprecedented global pandemic. Infection surges necessitate new
therapeutic agents that are effective against a rapidly changing virus. Antivirals that inhibit viral entry into host
cells have proven effective against other viruses with similar mechanisms of pathogenesis.
 The long-term objective of this highly collaborative proposed research is to develop potent peptides
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection that operate by blocking structural rearrangements of the spike protein
required for viral entry into host cells. For SARS-CoV-2 infection to occur, the viral surface spike (S) protein, a
homotrimer, rearranges to form an energetically favored postfusion state. In this postfusion conformation, two
helical domains, the N-terminal (HRN) and C-terminal (HRC) heptad repeats, associate to form a 6-helix bundle
(6HB). Peptides derived from the HRC can inhibit formation of the 6HB, and thus SARS-CoV-2 infection.
However, conventional peptides, composed entirely of α-amino acid residues, are highly susceptible to
proteolytic degradation, which necessitates frequent and high dosing. The Gellman lab, in collaboration with
virologists Prof. Anne Moscona and Prof. Matteo Porotto at Columbia University, has demonstrated that site-
selective incorporation of backbone modifications, in combination with cholesterol conjugation, can decrease
proteolytic sensitivity while maintaining high antiviral potency. Our team recently found that such lipopeptides
can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in biological assays and animal models, and that these inhibitors are effective
against SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. Building on this foundation, my proposed project seeks
to develop lipopeptides containing backbone modifications that display high antiviral potency and resist
proteolysis. Aim 1 will produce potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (and other coronaviruses) that contain backbone
modifications and resist proteolysis. Aim 2 will evaluate the stability of 6HB formation between inhibitor
candidates and the native SARS-CoV-2 HRN. Aim 3 will elucidate critical structural interactions between the
HRC mimics and the native HRN.
 My hypothesis is that site-selective incorporation of backbone modifications into HRC-based designs will
increase both antiviral activity and half-life in vivo, improving therapeutic efficacy. The proposed research, which
will be conducted under the guidance of Prof. Sam Gellman at the University of Wisconsin, will provide me with
experience in macromolecular X-ray crystallography, molecular design, protein engineering & expression, and
virology. Through structure-guided engineering and sophisticated and multi-pronged assay
implementation, these efforts could generate effective pan-variant therapeutics for COVID-19."
10894626,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among kidney transplant (KT) recipients with a
functioning allograft. KT patients face a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of CVD morbidity and mortality than the general
population, and within three years of kidney transplantation, 11% of these patients will have had a myocardial
infarction. Evidence suggests that this increased risk is driven by multiple intersecting pathways contributing to
CVD, including the metabolic side-effects of immunosuppression medications, a history of chronic kidney
disease and volume overload, current allograft function, chronic and acute inflammation, and socioeconomic
factors such as housing and income. Despite this, a KT-specific CVD-risk prediction model incorporating known
risk factors has not been developed. Existing datasets lack the ability to capture granular CVD events, fully
characterize contributions of longitudinal biomarkers, or incorporate traditional, transplant-specific, and
socioeconomic factors in their risk estimation. Furthermore, current studies predict disparate composite CVD
outcomes confusing the interpretation of predicted risk and highlighting the lack of a standard CVD outcome to
assess burden in this population. Finally, beyond potential risk miscalculation, existing models remain largely
unused in the clinical setting as they require manual input of data into an online calculator. To address this, we
have leveraged a unique health records platform within our institution to identify a cohort of KT patients and
retrospectively capture their highly granular longitudinal data to assess CVD risk. We have successfully used
this platform to build risk prediction models for two other patient populations and embedded clinical tools into the
health record for use in real time. Thus, my proposed research strategy is to 1) quantify the cumulative incidence
of CVD events in our KT population and define the optimal compositive outcome to assess meaningful risk, 2)
identify and characterize risk factors associated with CVD after KT accounting for time-varying disease states,
longitudinal biomarker trajectories, and socioeconomic factors, and 3) implement and pilot-test an individualized
CVD-risk prediction tool embedded in our health record. The proposed work will generate a comprehensive and
transportable risk-prediction tool specific to the KT population with implications for dissemination across multiple
institutions. Our findings will allow patients and providers to engage in shared decision-making and identify
targets of intervention that will ultimately improve outcomes in this unique population. This work will be
immediately applicable to KT patients burdened with excessive CVD risk and their physicians who must optimize
the balance between maintaining allograft health and minimizing cardiovascular disease."

Background. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN)
communities, with even greater burden on under-resourced urban AI/AN communities. Past research has
shown that nutrition is deeply important for prevention of T2D, yet achieving proper nutrition requires a healthy
mental relationship with eating, something that may be difficult to achieve for many AI/ANs who experience a
disproportionate burden of mental illness. A promising intervention for improving holistic wellbeing is Intuitive
Eating (IE), an adaptive eating style that utilizes aspects of positive psychology to promote connection to
internal physiological cues to hunger and satiety. IE is a promising intervention for improving psychological
relationships with food, eating behaviors, and mental health but to date there have been no efforts to assess
IE’s compatibility with AI/AN cultural food values
or
the acceptability of IE to AI/AN communities.
Study Goals and Aims. The candidate will collaborate with two urban AI/AN communities in Minneapolis and
Baltimore to conduct an Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Community-Based Participatory Research
(CBPR) study. Specific aims are to: 1) qualitatively explore AI/AN cultural eating values and perceptions of IE;
2) Culturally adapt the Intuitive Eating Scale 2 (IES-2) for urban AI/AN cultural and social contexts using
community engaged participatory methods; and 3) Examine
construct
validity of the adapted IES-2 through
factor analysis and its associations with health outcome data.
Approach. Aim 1 of the study will utilize in-depth interviews with 30-40 urban AI/ANs to explore cultural eating
values, eating behaviors, and perceptions of IE. This qualitative data will be analyzed using an inductive
approach to gain a nuanced understanding of cultural eating values and eating behaviors within urban AI/AN
communities. Aim 2 will utilize CBPR methods to engage community research councils (CRCs) in the
integration of Aim 1 findings into the IES-2. Aim 3 will involve pilot testing the adapted measure alongside
relevant health data with
250
AI/AN adults. Confirmatory Factor Analysis will be used to examine the
construct
validity of the adapted IES-2. Secondarily, multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to assess
relationships between intuitive/cultural eating values and health outcome data (mental health, cultural
connectedness, fruit/vegetable intake, physical activity).
Fellowship Information. The proposed NRSA research will serve as the doctoral dissertation of Ms. Maudrie,
an American Indian PhD student at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, her research and
training are supported by a mentorship team of AI/AN health experts. This NRSA research builds upon the
candidate’s previous CBPR research with urban AI/AN communities and is aligned with the NIDDK’s mission to
improve the prevention of T2D & advance health equity for a high priority population (Urban AI/ANs)."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and death, representing 1 in 3 deaths in the United
States, and 18.6 million deaths globally annually. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) play a key role in managing heart disease by enabling non-invasive assessment of
myocardial perfusion, infarction, and viability. Cardiac imaging is the fastest growing segment of the MRI market,
with recent landmark trials such as MR-INFORM demonstrating equivalence of contrast enhanced MRI to life
saving invasive catheterization procedures, and SCD-HeFT demonstrating prognostic value in predicting
cardiovascular adverse events. Unfortunately, both iodinated CT radiocontrast and gadolinium-based MRI
contrast agents pose safety risks to patients with renal impairment. Iodinated contrast media can cause acute
and irreversible kidney injury to renally impaired patients. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) can trigger
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renally impaired patients and all deposit Gd in brain and bone. Cardiac
and renal output are inextricably linked and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suffer cardiovascular co-
morbidities at a rate disproportionately high compared to the general population (~25% of ischemic heart disease
population). When imaging heart disease patients with CKD, clinicians must choose between limited radiologic
information or placing the patient at higher risk for complications by using a GBCA.
 Reveal Pharmaceuticals is addressing this challenge by developing RVP-001, a gadolinium-free extracellular
fluid MRI contrast agent. RVP-001 is a stable manganese chelate with relaxivity and pharmacokinetics similar to
GBCAs resulting in equivalent imaging properties. RVP-001 recently completed the in clinic portion of an NIH-
funded Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT05413668). Our ultimate goal is to develop RVP-001 for multiple indications
(CNS, cardiac, angiography, breast) for both renally impaired subjects and the general patient population.
 The objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to perform non-clinical imaging and late phase enabling
toxicology experiments in support of a cardiac indication. This work builds upon our recently completed NHLBI-
funded Phase I project (R43HL156713), which demonstrated that RVP-001 is diagnostically equivalent to GBCA
to characterize acute myocardial infarction (MI) in pigs. Here, we will evaluate RVP-001 in the contexts of chronic
myocardial infarction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis that recapitulate human heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), respectively. We posit that an equal
dose of RVP-001 will perform similarly to GBCA given at the indicated dose, that superior cardiac imaging can
be achieved through a larger dose of RVP-001, and that regulatory bodies would be receptive to a RVP-001
dose indication that is larger than GBCAs. The late phase enabling component comprises cGLP repeat dose
toxicology and toxicokinetics in rats."
10896419,"Project Summary/Abstract
Insufficient sleep doubles the risk of obesity among youth and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in adulthood. Over 75% of US high school students do not meet national sleep recommendations. Given
these alarming trends, a better understanding of the environmental determinants of sleep in adolescents is
needed in order to identify targets for interventions and public health strategies to promote healthy sleep. While
research increasingly suggests that home and neighborhood context impact sleep, key methodological issues
limit understanding of the environmental determinants of adolescent sleep. Research on the influence of
neighborhood-level factors (e.g. crime, disorder) on sleep typically focuses on the area surrounding
adolescents' homes. This approach does not account for mobility and the accumulation of exposures across
multiple contexts (e.g. home, school, in transit) during daily activities, leading to exposure misclassification.
The home sleep environment (e.g. light, noise) may also vary by night, but is typically assessed at a single
timepoint. Mobile health methods including smartphone GPS tracking and ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) offer an innovative opportunity to overcome the limitations of past studies by developing person-
centered measures of environmental exposures that account for variation over space and time. With this
career development award, I will develop critical skills in environmental exposure assessment and health
behavior science necessary to pursue a novel independent research program that identifies modifiable
environmental determinants of sleep and other CVD-related outcomes and their mechanisms of effect using
advanced, cutting-edge methods. In the proposed research study, I will enroll a diverse cohort of 160
adolescents aged 15-18 through a large urban pediatric primary care research network. I will use smartphone
GPS tracking, EMA, geographic information systems (GIS), and actigraphy to collect high-resolution
longitudinal data on adolescents' exposures to the home and neighborhood context and sleep outcomes over a
14-day period. The research aims include 1) quantifying adolescents' exposure during daily activities to
neighborhood factors hypothesized to influence sleep, 2) determining the extent to which adolescents'
exposure to adverse sleep environments varies across nights and by housing conditions, and 3) determining
the extent to which daily measures of home and neighborhood exposures are associated with adolescent sleep
outcomes. With guidance from an expert, interdisciplinary mentorship team at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, I will obtain training in 1) space-time data collection and
analysis, 2) ecological momentary assessment, and 3) sleep research. Completion of the K01 research and
training plan will prepare me to compete successfully for R01-level research funding and will uniquely position
me as an independent investigator who conducts large-scale epidemiologic investigations on spatiotemporal,
environmental determinants of child and adolescent health behaviors related to cardiovascular health."
10908732,"African American and low-income populations bear a disproportionate burden of dementia and have been underrepresented in trials of cognitive impairment. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that an intensive blood pressure (BP) intervention (target systolic BP <120 mmHg) lowered the risk of cognitive impairment compared to a standard BP intervention (systolic BP target <140 mmHg). The next important step is to determine how the successful SPRINT intensive blood pressure intervention can be implemented in a real-world clinic setting to prevent cognitive decline. The overall objective of the proposed study is to test a multifaceted strategy for implementing an intensive BP intervention protocol adapted from SPRINT targeting systolic BP <120 mmHg on cognitive decline in racial minority and low-income hypertensive patients in resource-constrained primary care practices in Louisiana and Mississippi. The RE-AIM (Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance) framework has been used to guide the development and evaluation of the multifaceted implementation strategy, including protocol-based treatment that employs the SPRINT stepped-care intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, shared- decision making, team-based collaborative care, BP audit and feedback, home BP monitoring, and patient health coaching. Building on the ongoing Implementation of Multifaceted Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control (IMPACTS-BP) trial, we will cost-effectively conduct a cluster- randomized trial in 36 Federally Qualified Health Center clinics that serve low-income populations in Louisiana and Mississippi. The primary outcome in the proposed trial is the net difference in mean change of global cognitive composite z-score over an average of 42 months between the intervention and enhanced usual care groups. Secondary outcomes include net difference in mean change of executive function and memory composite z-scores, systolic and diastolic BP, adverse effects, and quality of life. Implementation outcomes, including acceptability, adaptation, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetrance, and cost-effectiveness, will also be collected and used to improve intervention delivery during the trial. The proposed trial, with a sample size of 36 clinics (35 patients/clinic), has 85% statistical power to detect a 0.30 or higher difference in the global cognitive composite z-score at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 assuming 20% loss to follow-up and an intra-cluster correlation of 0.05. In a meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials, the pooled effect size was 0.35 (95% CI 0.32, 0.38) for the global cognitive composite z-score. This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, adoptable, and equitable intervention strategies to reduce blood pressure-related cognitive decline in low-income and minority populations. If proven effective, the implementation strategy for intensive blood pressure reduction could be adapted and scaled up in diverse primary care settings to prevent cognitive decline and clinical dementia."
10903810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder of the myocardium that is characterized by
unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocyte disarray, and fibrosis. It is the most prevalent genetic
heart disorder, affecting ~1 in 500 people. HCM has been the focus of intense clinical and basic science study
for decades. These efforts have provided remarkable insights into the molecular basis and clinical course of
disease-- defining sarcomere mutations as the most common genetic etiology and characterizing the
phenotypic spectrum. Additionally, prior studies have underscored the great heterogeneity of HCM. Although
many patients have serious outcomes, including arrhythmias, advanced heart failure, and sudden cardiac
death, many others experience mild disease with low symptom burden and normal longevity. Moreover, there
is striking diversity in cardiac morphology and function, even amongst patients with identical underlying
sarcomere mutations. The factors that drive such marked heterogeneity are poorly understood, highlighting the
critical need to better characterize determinants of disease expression and clinical outcomes.
 This proposal seeks to identify genotypic and phenotypic features that account for the highly diverse
manifestations of HCM. These goals will be addressed by leveraging the recently established Sarcomeric
Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), containing data on over 9000 HCM patients, and applying state-of-
the-art genetic, imaging, and statistical analyses. Our aims are: (1) To identify common genetic variation that
impacts disease expression in HCM patients both with and without a driving sarcomere mutation (sarcomeric
and non-sarcomeric HCM). These analyses will interrogate background genetic variation to examine how an
individual’s genetic make-up influences their susceptibility or resistance to disease. We will also develop
polygenic risk scores to assess the cumulative effect of common genetic variants on disease expression. (2)
To characterize phenotypic factors that influence disease expression by utilizing machine-learning techniques
to identify novel, quantitative high-dimensional imaging features from routinely-performed cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) studies. We will then incorporate these features into rigorous prediction models to improve
clinical risk stratification. This approach will allow us to look more deeply into the structure and function of the
heart by using the full array of digital data available from CMR imaging, thereby drawing new correlations
between phenotype, disease manifestations, and clinical outcomes. Successful completion of these aims will
advance our understanding of why disease experience can be so different from patient to patient, provide new
insights into mechanism and therapeutic targets, and identify novel biomarkers of disease severity. These
results will impact clinical management of patients with HCM by improving the precision and accuracy of
diagnosis and risk stratification. Finally, insights gained will likely inform more common forms of heart disease,
such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with similarly highly heterogeneous manifestations."
10931419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hydrocephalus is a devastating condition characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain.
The most utilized treatment for hydrocephalus is the CSF shunt in which a catheter diverts excess CSF from the
ventricles of the brain through a one-way valve to an area in the body that can reabsorb the fluid (most commonly
the peritoneal cavity). Despite technological advances in the 6 decades since the shunt was first introduced,
nearly 40% of all shunts fail within one year of placement, and most fail within 3 years, requiring multiple revision
surgeries per patient. This translates to recurring debilitating symptoms for the patient, unnecessary
hospitalizations and surgery, and death, ultimately costing the healthcare system well over $2 billion annually.
Although many shunts that exist on the market today have attempted to control for gravity and other variables
researched, none of the current shunt systems works reliably enough to prevent shunt failure. We are developing
a “smart shunt”, a comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic shunt system that aims to maintain optimal ICP by
monitoring and draining optimal amounts of CSF for each given patient, thus eliminating
underdrainage/overdrainage, to eventually decrease the risk of shunt obstruction and long-term complications
related to erratic drainage. The device is a multi-system technology composed of an ICP sensor, communication
modules, and a valve. The sensor transmits instantaneous pressures inside the brain to a microcontroller, which
transforms incoming pressures into a moving average. The moving average, in turn, excludes transient
instantaneous ICP changes related to position (gravity) or activities of daily living (coughing, straining, etc.) When
the average ICP exceeds a threshold, the microcontroller sends a signal to open the valve. As opposed to
commercial valves, which open during any instance of elevated ICP (e.g., from a cough or sudden standing),
our smart valve would open in a controlled fashion, eliminating erratic drainage.
Our team has prototyped and shown proof-of-concept of each individual component of the shunt system. While
some components need one more level of development to advance the readiness of the technology, a few key
subsystems hold higher technical risk, which if overcome, would enable the integration and success of the overall
shunt system to function safely and effectively. The completion of this device would mark the first-in-class “smart”
shunt that effectively monitors ICP and appropriately drains CSF."

Cancer cells have metabolic requirements that differ from most normal, non-proliferating cells. To proliferate,
cancer cells must transform available nutrients into the varied array of macromolecules that are needed to
build a new cell. Each cancer type is unique and will run a metabolic program that depends on the tissue-of-
origin, genetic factors, and the local environment. How specific cancers integrate these cancer cell-intrinsic and
extrinsic factors to rewire metabolism and support cancer progression is a major unanswered question.
My laboratory's long-term goal is to understand how cancer cell metabolism is adapted to support tumor
initiation and progression. The metabolic phenotypes of proliferating cells are typically interpreted with an
emphasis on either energy generation or the crosstalk between signaling events and cell metabolism. This has
led many to focus on how cancer genetics influences metabolic pathway use. We take a different approach
that identifies limiting metabolic processes, considers how these are constrained by the extracellular
environment, and defines how metabolic limitations are overcome within a physiological tissue context.
Our work has provided insight into understanding how glucose metabolism affects cell proliferation. We found
that production of nucleotides and oxidized biomass can be metabolic limitations of cell proliferation and tumor
growth, and that both cancer cell-intrinsic and environmental factors determine how cells overcome these
limitations. We have developed novel tools to study metabolism in various physiological contexts and
uncovered metabolic differences between tumors and cancer cells in culture. We have demonstrated how
environmental nutrients and cancer lineage can dictate how metabolism is used to support proliferation and
determine sensitivity and resistance to drugs used in patients. Our work has charted new research directions
for the field and contributed new ideas to exploit altered metabolism to help cancer patients.
Using mass spectrometry to trace nutrient fate in cancer models, my laboratory generates hypotheses for how
different cancers use metabolism to support cell proliferation and tumor growth. We test these hypotheses
using a variety of biochemical and genetic approaches to define how nutrient availability, metabolic pathway
regulation, and tissue context constrain how cells use available materials to proliferate. Our current interests
include identifying which metabolic processes create bottlenecks for cell proliferation, determining how
metabolism is different in different cancers, examining in detail the influence of tissue type, tumor genetics, and
tumor microenvironment, and understanding how diet and whole body metabolism influence tumor metabolism
and cancer progression. We aim to advance understanding of metabolic pathway biochemistry, its relationship
to cancer and mammalian physiology, and identify how best to target metabolism for therapy."
10903735,"Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex, debilitating condition leading to permanent life-long neurological
deficits. In addition to neurological dysfunction, individuals with SCI experience neurogenic muscle loss due to
immobility. Amelioration of neurological deficits and prevention of skeletal muscle loss are intricately related to
recovery of function following SCI. Molecular mechanisms causing neuronal impairment and skeletal muscle
loss resulting from SCI, remain incompletely understood. Our laboratory is among the first to demonstrate steroid
hormone estrogen (E2) driven neuroprotection in experimental SCI in rats, suggesting E2 warrants clinical
evaluation in individuals with neurotrauma. The beneficial effect in SCI was found at a low dose of 10μg/kg E2,
but the dose remains at a non-physiologic for human use, and thereby poses a safety concern for clinical use.
The emergence of smart drug delivery techniques, such as nanoparticles, may allow for increased drug safety
and improved efficacy. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to examine the effects of novel fast and slow release
E2-loaded nanoparticles (NP) on neuronal dysfunction and skeletal muscle loss in a rat contusion model of SCI.
Since muscle loss may occur as a result of damage to motoneurons in the spinal cord, focal delivery of E2 may
reverse denervation and promote nerve sprouting in partially denervated muscle fibers. Preliminary studies
suggest that a single administration of a combined fast-release (FNP-E2) and slow-release (SNP-E2) formulation
to the contused spinal cord attenuates inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, gliosis, glial scarring, and neurogenic
muscle loss. The focal delivery of E2 promotes microglial and astroglial differentiation to subpopulations of anti-
inflammatory microglia/astrocytes which inhibit inflammation, axonal damage, and neuronal loss. Preliminary
studies also suggest that NP-mediated delivery of E2 gel patch therapy reduces insult-induced muscle RING
finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) proteins in vitro in myoblast cells and in vivo following mild
to moderate SCI (40g/cm injury) in rats. However, whether NP-E2 gel patch therapy alters neuronal impairment
and skeletal muscle loss in severe SCI (60g/cm injury) remains unknown. Thus, using a novel combined FNP-
E2 and SNP-E2, may allow for suppression of acute inflammation by FNP-E2 and modulation of the inflammatory
response by SNP-E2 thereafter. We hypothesize that focal delivery of combined FNP-E2 and SNP-E2 will
minimize plasma E2 levels and increase local spinal cord concentrations - thereby reducing acute and subacute
inflammation to promote recovery from neurogenic muscle loss in severe SCI. To test the hypothesis, three
specific aims are proposed: (Aim 1) Determine the delivery of a combined FNP-E2 and SNP-E2 gel patch
therapy and evaluate its kinetics, bio-distribution, toxicity, and effects in severe SCI model in rats; (Aim 2)
Investigate the effects of a combined FNP-E2 and SNP-E2 therapy on neuronal impairment, glial scarring, and
bladder/locomotor function in severe SCI; and (Aim 3) Examine the effects of a combined FNP-E2 and SNP-
E2 therapy on skeletal muscle loss, neuroinflammation, and functional outcomes in severe SCI. Overall, the
proposed combination strategy in a severe SCI model may provide insights into the mechanisms of estrogenic-
driven neuroprotection and prevention of neurogenic muscle loss in severe SCI in combat veterans. Completion
of this project should provide sufficient evidence to support the translation of E2 into clinical trials, with the
ultimate goal of providing a safe and effective therapy to treat both veterans and the general population suffering
from SCI."

Gene complementation and pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT Therapy) is a promising potential
therapy of hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP) – a disorder of progressive of alveolar surfactant
accumulation and respiratory failure – for which no pharmacotherapy therapy exists. We defined the patho-
genesis, presentation, diagnosis, and management of hPAP, showed it is caused by the loss of GM-CSF re-
ceptor signaling and disruption of alveolar macrophage (AM) functions including the removal of surfactant from
alveoli. We demonstrated lentiviral vector-mediated complementation of function-disrupting CSF2RA mutations
restored GM-CSF receptor signaling in human AMs including rescue of surfactant clearance. Despite outstand-
ing progress, including demonstration of the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and durability of PMT Therapy in two
validated hPAP animal models, lack of clinical studies of PMT Therapy in humans is a critical barrier to its fur-
ther therapeutic development. Our long-term goal is to develop PMT Therapy as the an effective, disease-
specific therapy of hPAP (and possibly other diseases). The objective here is to complete preparations for, and
then to conduct, a Phase I trial to establish the safety of PMT in human patients with hPAP and also identify
useful clinical and biological outcome measures informing the design of a future Phase II efficacy trial.
The central Hypothesis is that after PMT of autologous CD34+ cell-derived CSF2RA gene-corrected macro-
phages without myeloablation, the transplanted cells will survive, engraft, adopt the phenotype and function of
normal AMs, replace endogenous AMs, reestablish a normal-sized AM population that remains in the lungs
and results in a safe, well-tolerated, effective, and durable treatment benefit. The rationale for the proposed
research is that a ‘first-in-human’ study establishing the safety of PMT Therapy in humans will unblock further
clinical development of PMT Therapy including preparation for conduct of a future phase 2 clinical efficacy trial.
We plan to address our hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims in the R61 phase and three aims in the R33
phase: 1) finalize stability testing of CSF2RA gene-corrected macrophages; complete 2) trial-related and 3)
IND-related documents; 4) obtain regulatory approvals (Institutional Review Board and Biosafety Committee,
Data, Safety, and Monitoring Board, FDA); 5) assess the safety, 6) measure the pharmacokinetics and phar-
macodynamics, and 7) identify useful measures of the clinical outcomes and biological signature of PMT Ther-
apy in hPAP patients. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a marked departure from the
current treatment approach, whole lung lavage (an invasive, inefficient, procedure to physically remove surfac-
tant) by establishing, in hPAP patients, the feasibility of a new approach to restore a GM-CSF-responsive,
functional AM population. The proposed research is significant because establishing the safety, pharmacoki-
netics and pharmacodynamics, and identifying useful clinical outcome measures of PMT Therapy in humans is
the next step in our clinical research program to develop PMT as the first specific therapy of hPAP."

Hypertension (HTN) is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among U.S.
adults. There are well-established guidelines for managing HTN, yet HTN remains undertreated. There are a
number of reasons for inadequate adoption of HTN care guidelines, including skepticism about guideline
recommendations, perceptions that patients are non-adherent to medications, and lack of systems to facilitate
best practices in HTN management. Team based care (TBC) has the potential to overcome these barriers.
TBC is the provision of health services by at least two health providers who work collaboratively to improve
chronic disease management through enhancements in quality improvement (QI) infrastructure to support care
coordination, population management, self-management support, medication adherence and continuity of care.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that TBC is an evidence-based strategy for improving blood pressure
(BP) management and control. Despite the effectiveness of TBC, primary care practices experience significant
barriers to implementing TBC care processes. This is particularly true for small-medium size independent
primary care practices (SIPs), an understudied group of practices that represent the majority of outpatient care
delivery but which often lack the resources and local expertise to implement care processes consistent with
TBC.
External practice facilitation (PF), a strategy to support implementation of evidence-based models of care into
routine practice, may mitigate barriers to adoption of TBC in SIPs. Yet, there is a dearth of literature on the
effect of PF on adoption of TBC in general and specifically in SIPs. The objective of this study is to compare
the effectiveness of PF on the adoption of core TBC components, centered on improving BP management and
outcomes in SIPs, to usual care. In this study, a PF implementation strategy will be developed through mixed
methods formative assessment and input from a representative stakeholder advisory committee. This PF
strategy will then be evaluated in a stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial in 90 independent primary
care practices in New York City where the effect of PF on adoption of TBC (primary outcome) and blood
pressure control (secondary outcome) will be compared against usual care.
Given the public health burden that elevated BP presents, implementation of TBC as an evidence-based
practice to improve BP control has great potential to improve CVD outcomes. This study will provide much-
needed guidance on how to optimize adoption and sustainability of TBC in independent primary care setting to
realize the potential of improved HTN management and addresses current gaps in prior research."
10842360,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Inhibitory synapses are crucial for maintaining correct neuronal excitability, which is important for efficient
circuitry and proper brain function. Shifts in neuronal excitability have been implicated in a variety of neurological
disorders, including ischemia. Based on cell-type specific vulnerabilities, the oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD) observed in various brain regions including the hippocampus leads to differential effects that may alter
neuronal long-term function. The hippocampus is particularly a vulnerable brain region that experiences
either delayed cell-death in the CA1 region or resistance to delayed-cell death and shifts in long-term excitability
in the CA3 region. Cell-type specific synaptic alterations to neuronal populations may contribute to these
ischemic-induced changes. Even though alterations at excitatory synapses are well defined, our knowledge of
alterations at the inhibitory synapse remain elusive.
 Inhibitory GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. The
number of postsynaptic GABAARs influences inhibitory strength; therefore, GABAAR trafficking to and from
synaptic sites or the neuronal surface is an important regulator of overall inhibitory synaptic strength. During
OGD, GABAARs are downregulated from the neuronal surface in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, GABAAR
phosphorylation status influences the synaptic declustering or removal of receptors from the neuronal surface
during OGD in hippocampal neurons. However, mechanisms that regulate these differences in either synaptic
clustering or surface GABAAR expression following an ischemic insult in brain regions with varying susceptibilities
remain undefined.
 In this project, I propose that GABAAR declustering and endocytosis mechanisms are differentially regulated
in distinct neuronal populations during OGD to influence GABAAR downregulation based on region-specific
vulnerability. Moreover, I hypothesize that these cell-type specific mechanisms drive increased neuronal
excitability during OGD due to increase synaptic declustering and decreased surface expression of
GABAARs in vulnerable neuronal populations. Based on this, I plan to investigate (i) mechanisms of synaptic
GABAAR declustering and surface downregulation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons following OGD (ii) probe
the temporal regulation to determine the sequential flow of events promoting GABAAR loss and (iii) use an in
vivo model of cerebral ischemia to compare cell-type specific mechanisms in CA1 and CA3 hippocampus that
may be differentially regulated based on neuronal susceptibility to OGD. Specifically, I plan to investigate the
role of phosphatases in regulating GABAAR phosphorylation state to promote GABAAR declustering and
endocytosis during OGD in both vulnerable neuronal populations. The results of this project will establish
mechanisms that are specific to GABAAR downregulation in vulnerable populations during OGD, providing novel
targets for future therapeutic intervention."

During salient events, there are two main motivational drives that guide our behaviors. One is appetitive motivation, or the desire to approach and seek rewarding stimuli, and the other is aversive motivation, the instinct to avoid risks for punishment. Commonly, individuals will encounter scenarios in which associated signals to both appetitive and aversive stimuli are encountered together. This means that depending on which motivational drive governs their behavioral response individuals will either risk missing a reward or risk facing some type of threat. To optimize this decision-making process – particularly during conflicting situations – carefully coordinated neural circuits must integrate cognitive and emotional information into adaptive behavioral actions. Some individuals are naturally riskier than others, whereas others may be more risk-averse, and this individual variation is expected. Nonetheless, certain neuropsychiatric disorders like addiction and depression may implicate drastic motivational shifts that can result in maladaptive behaviors whereby individuals engage in excessive and even detrimental levels of reward-seeking or avoidance responses. To better understand vulnerability to these disorders and optimize treatment strategies, we must identify the neurocircuitry responsible for coordinating opposing motivational drives during conflict. I will be using a modified platform-mediated avoidance task in which mice must make the decision between mounting a platform that will ensure their safety from a signaled foot-shock or risking getting shocked for the opportunity to obtain a sucrose reward. This paradigm generates both appetitive and aversive motivational drives allowing us to measure motivational conflict in real time and probe the neurocircuits that mediate these responses. The ventral pallidum (VP) is the main output structure of the ventral striatum, and it contains a heterogeneous neuronal population capable of encoding both appetitive and aversive stimuli. How VP neurons coordinate approach and avoidance in sync during motivational conflict remains unclear. The research goals of this proposal are to 1) characterize the role of VP GABAergic (VPGABA) and glutamatergic (VPGlut) neurons in reward approach and punishment avoidance conflict, 2) identify the main target regions of VPGABA and VPGlut neurons and their neuronal markers, and 3) characterize a new neural pathway from VP responsible for driving opposing motivational responses during conflict. Altogether, this proposal will shed light on the neuronal substrates of motivational conflict and how they relate to poor-decision making in neuropsychiatric disorders."

Previous studies have shown that the renin angiotensin system (RAS) modulates the outcome of HIV-kidney
diseases. However, a unique feature of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the lack of hypertension during
its early stages. This is an intriguing finding considering that the RAS appears to be activated, and people of
African ancestry frequently develop hypertensive chronic kidney diseases (CKD). During the last six years we
have followed the outcome of ~ 190 children and adolescents living with HIV (CALWH) on antiretroviral therapy
(ART), and found that despite the presence of major risk factors for hypertension the prevalence of hypertension
was not increased until the late stages of HIV-CKD. Therefore, a critical question that needs to be answered is
why CALWH undergoing the early stages of HIV-CKD do not develop hypertension despite having an activated
RAS. Our preliminary data in young HIV-Tg26 mice suggest that the renal RAS is activated mainly to counteract
the hypotensive effects of the HIV-cytokine milieu, as well as the presence of salt wasting disorders associated
with the development of proteinuria and tubulo-interstitial lesions. In addition, we found that transmembrane (tm)-
TNF-α HIV-Tat, and FGF-2 play a critical role in this process. Our data highlight the need to understand how the
RAS interacts with the HIV-cytokine milieu, since RAS inhibitors are used routinely in CALWH with proteinuria
and they can lower the blood pressure and impair the renal perfusion. Here, we hypothesize that the HIV-
cytokine milieu disrupts the ability of the renal RAS to mount a proper response to conditions
representing a physiological threat to maintain homeostasis and/or renal perfusion in infancy. A second
corollary of this hypothesis is that these events affect the plasticity of renin producing cells, and may
have long-term consequences for developing chronic kidney diseases or hypertension in adulthood.
Using time and cell specific conditional deletion approaches, and single cell transcriptomic analysis, we will test
this hypothesis in three aims. In aim 1 we will define how the HIV-cytokine milieu modulates the activity of the
renal RAS under conditions in which homeostasis is threatened in childhood by dietary Na+ or K+ depletion. In
aim 2 we will determine how the RAS modulates the infection of CD4+ T cells / macrophages, podocytes and
renal tubular epithelial cells cultured from CALWH, and determine how HIV-Tat affects the renal RAS activity in
HIV-Tg26 mice. In aim 3, we will determine how the HIV-cytokine milieu affects the structure of renal arterioles
and tubules, as well as the transcriptome profile of renin producing cells, under conditions in which the renal
RAS is suppressed long term by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) during infancy. Positive results
will be validated in CALWH on ART treated with ACEI for hypertension and/or proteinuria. These studies will
elucidate new mechanisms whereby the HIV-cytokine milieu “programs” the response of renal arterioles and
tubules to changes in dietary electrolytes as well as the long-term use of ACEI, discover new biomarkers of silent
renal ischemia, and generate new knowledge to prevent the progression of CKD in CALWH."
10930862,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodegenerative disorders remain a public health burden and lack effective treatments. Rare genetic
disorders can cause neurodegeneration in children, which is particularly devastating. Regardless of whether
rare or common, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain incompletely understood. For
instance, why neurons may be more susceptible to cell death when a genetic mutation is present throughout
the body? Such is the case in TBCK encephalopathy (TBCKE), a rare autosomal recessive disorder that
causes developmental delay and neurodegeneration in children. We previously characterized the neurologic
phenotype of Puerto Rican children with a homozygous null mutation (p.R126X) in TBCK, and later found
mitochondrial respiratory defects and evidence for abnormal mitochondrial quality control (i.e. mitophagy) in
patient-derived fibroblasts. Nevertheless, the (1) physiologic role of TBCK and (2) how TBCK-deficiency leads
to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration, remain unclear. Our data support that Tbck protein may
be part of a novel mRNA transport complex (Five-subunit Endosomal Rab5 and RNA/ribosome intermediary-
FERRY). This complex may attach to early endosomes to deliver RNA transcripts, and therefore contribute to
newly synthesized proteins, to cellular compartments distant from the nucleus, such as axons. Deficits in RNA
transport and local protein translation, particularly to distant axonal mitochondria, have been recently proposed
as a novel mechanism underlying a common neurodegenerative disorder (ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
Hence, our central hypothesis is that neuronal vulnerability in TBCK-deficiency stems from impaired transport
of mRNA and/or local protein translation disrupting mitochondrial function. We predict this leads to
compartment-specific mitochondrial deficits, with distal axonal mitochondria being more susceptible to TBCK-
deficiency than those in the neuronal soma. In Aim 1 we will test how TBCK-deficiency impacts mitochondrial
function and mitophagy, using human iPSC-derived neurons (iNeu). Then in Aim 2, we will test how TBCK-
deficiency may affect the function of the FERRY complex, by examining effects in the RNA transcriptome in a
compartment-specific fashion (neuronal soma vs axons). We will also directly assay local protein synthesis to
test if TBCK is leading to mitochondrial dysfunction because of impaired protein translation in axonal
compartments. These experiments will address a gap in knowledge regarding the role of neuronal RNA
transport defects in mediating neurodegeneration, how these defects may particularly impact mitochondria and
the role that Tbck protein may play in the novel FERRY complex. Support from this R01 award will be
instrumental in growing my independent research program as a physician-scientist in a superb institutional
environment. It will also contribute to my long-term goal of untangling disease mechanisms of pediatric
neurodegenerative disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction; in order to, ultimately, identify novel
therapeutic targets."
10701341,"ABSTRACT: Despite advances in treatment and prevention, millions of Americans still suffer from heart failure
(HF), and acute HF(AHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in the veteran population. Although
hemodynamic, immune, and mechanical stress are associated with HF, how the heart responds to these
stresses and how they together drive HF remain largely unknown. Extracellular purinergic catabolism is an
evolutionarily conserved system that regulates both vascular and immune stress responses. In the heart,
stressed cardiomyocytes (CM) release purines (including adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) to the extracellular
environment as part of a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) response. CD39 is a surface
ectonucleotidase that catabolizes ATP. Our analysis of genetic variants in the UK Biobank suggests that CD 39
deficiency is associated with incident HF. Mechanistically, our preliminary data indicate that stressed CM release
ATP in response to a variety of cardiac stresses, and that CD39 is expressed on macrophages (Mϕ). In clinical
AHF, we have found that blood inflammatory markers are increased on admission and that CD39 is expressed
in circulating monocytes from AHF patients. Furthermore, our laboratory has found that mice deficient in CD39
only in macrophages have increased fibrosis in a model of pressure-overload HF, revealing a novel mechanism
through which macrophage CD39 shapes pathologic cardiac remodeling. The requirement for CM-macrophage
cooperation to dissipate extracellular ATP suggests that the extracellular breakdown of ATP could be a critical
integrator of stress responses in HF. The objective of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms
through which the extracellular ATP catabolism orchestrates inflammation and pathologic cardiac remodeling
and to define the functional properties of CD39+ monocytes in murine models and patients with AHF. Specifically,
this project will (1) delineate the mechanisms through which the catabolism of extracellular ATP modulates CM
and macrophage hemodynamic, immune, and mechanical stress responses; (2) define how macrophage
catabolism of ATP regulates cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in two murine models; and (3) elucidate how
hypervolemia associated with AHF modulates the levels of circulating DAMPs/immune mediators and CD39+
monocytes and how these immunotypes evolve during the treatment of AHF. The experiments proposed here
will test the hypothesis that extracellular ATP catabolism by Mϕ CD39 coordinates cardiac stress responses and
that the inability to breakdown extracellular ATP promotes inflammation and pathologic cardiac remodeling, a
vicious cycle that accelerates HF. This proposal leverages the power of novel macrophage-specific transgenic
murine models, targeted proteomics/transcriptomics, and mass cytometry to define the ATP-mediated cell-cell
interactions that govern cardiac remodeling and inflammation in cell/murine models and patients with AHF."
10873707,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss driven by
deposits of pathological tau. Therefore, identifying and targeting potent regulators of tau is crucial in developing
effective therapeutic strategies. My exciting preliminary data show DnaJB6 overexpression decreases tau
levels in HEK293T cells more than 50%, and in parallel, knockdown of DnaJB6 results in a 2-fold increase of
tau. This suggests that DnaJB6 may regulate tau levels, however, the nature of this relationship has not yet
been investigated. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that DnaJB6 can prevent tau accumulation through
direct and indirect mechanisms. In Aim 1, I will test this through assessing protein-protein interaction dynamics
between DnaJB6 and tau with recombinant in vitro assays, including Thioflavin T fluorescence and Surface
Plasmon Resonance. A targeted proteomic approach will be used to identify direct and proximal connections
between DnaJB6 and tau in primary neurons. In Aim 2, we will use PS19 and non-transgenic mice to assess
the associated behavioral and molecular changes that result from DnaJB6 overexpression in the brain.
Successful completion of these studies will provide crucial information regarding DnaJB6 biology, direct and
indirect effects of DnaJB6 on tau, and how regulation of DnaJB6 affects behavioral and molecular changes in
the tauopathic brain."
10701244,"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, with much evidence tracing the initial human spillover to a market with
extensive human-animal contact. As the coronavirus spread in its new host species, multiple variants of
concern representing distinct genetic lineages appeared and propagated globally. Ongoing viral evolution has
increased transmission, and also evasion of neutralizing antibodies (adaptive arm of the immune system).
Hence, many important studies have deservedly focused on dissecting consequences of Spike protein
mutations in different emerged variants. However, mutations have also been detected in viral genes other than
Spike, and several of these genes are linked to antagonism of innate immune responses. We provide detailed
evidence that compared to ancestral or early SARS-CoV-2 isolates, the five major variants of concern so far
(alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron) have become more resistant to multiple human interferons that
included the 12 IFNα subtypes, IFNβ, IFNω and 3 IFNλ subtypes1. The underlying mechanisms for these IFN
resistance phenotypes are unclear and, paralleling the four decades it has taken to understand innate immune
evasions mediated by the proteins encoded by the nine genes of HIV-1, a full picture for SARS-CoV-2 will
require sustained investigation over time. However, in both the short and long terms, the scientific and medical
impacts of characterizing resistance of this newly emerged coronavirus mechanistically can be highly
significant, for not only the current pandemic but potentially also for future sarbecovirus spillover events. We
thus propose to build on our ample published1 and unpublished preliminary data and accumulated experience
to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 IFN resistance during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and to
determine virus mutations and effector mechanisms involved. As interferon responses can regulate virus
levels during the critical acute phase of infection, these studies will have implications for understanding
SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis that may inform therapeutic strategies not only against SARS-
CoV-2 but also future emerging viruses."

The Planning and Evaluation (P&E) Core of the University of Massachusetts, Boston (UMass Boston) and
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Partnership enables cutting-edge cancer and cancer
disparities research through the solicitation, evaluation and selection of new research projects. The P&E Core
brings senior faculty, early stage investigators, and trainees together to design and pursue significant research
projects. This process is vetted by a robust Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) comprising senior faculty,
institutional leaders, core leaders, and current and former project investigators. The P&E Core utilizes a logic
model framework and outcomes database to carefully monitor, assess, and report the progress of research
projects, programs and cores. Key assessment metrics used by the core include impact, dissemination,
training opportunities, and sustainability. The P&E Core engages key institutional leaders and faculty at UMass
Boston and DF/HCC to provide effective and well-integrated programmatic and scientific management that is
mutually beneficial. These efforts are focused on bridging the gaps between scientific inquiry and societal
implementation to treat cancer and reduce cancer disparities.
The specific aims of the Planning and Evaluation Core are to: 1) Facilitate and promote cutting-edge research;
2) Build and maintain a robust IAC and utilize this expertise and that of the Program Steering Committee (PSC)
to monitor Partnership progress and inform decision making; 3) Evaluate and track research projects and
cores; 4) Document Partnership activity and oversee reporting to the NCI; 5) Identify grant opportunities and
support proposal development; and 6) Expand the Partnership into areas of high potential impact through
collaboration and development of synergies with other institutional activities and initiatives."
10898678,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The UMass Boston Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Partnership’s Research Education Core (REC) aims
to bridge the divide that exists in the biomedical workforce by increasing the number of UMass Boston
students, particularly those from underrepresented populations, to pursue graduate degrees and cancer/cancer
health disparities research careers. Utilizing evidence-based training that fosters the growth and persistence of
underrepresented students in the sciences, the REC provides trainees with science enrichment education and
mentored research experiences which emphasize professional development, inclusive support, and team
science across multiple disciplines. The framework of the REC focuses on three areas that are critical to the
development of research scientists: (1) acquisition of scientific knowledge; (2) development of communication
skills; and (3) individualized career development. The Core will provide four research education programs:
undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, graduate, and post-doctoral. Over the course of the grant cycle the REC
seeks to support 60 undergraduates (15-20 per year, minimum one semester or summer, 90% multi-
semester), 30 graduate students (6-8 per year, most multi-semester), 15 post-baccalaureate students (3 per
year for 1-2 years), and 2 nursing post-doctoral scientists (1 per two-year fellowship) in innovative research
education programming. Partnership faculty will mentor trainees and fellows at all levels. Recognizing that the
needs of individuals vary and that they change at each educational level, the REC will provide individualized
and developmentally appropriate experiences aimed at preparing students/trainees for the next phase of their
academic and research careers. The REC will continue to provide research opportunities for students at the
intersection between the natural/physical sciences and social/behavioral sciences. Over the past 15 years, the
Research Education Core (REC) has provided 347 trainees/fellows across the scientific preparation levels with
mentored research experiences and scholarly, scientific, and professional development that prepares them to
pursue advanced degrees & fellowships, and then to become cancer, health disparities, and/or biomedical
science researchers. The REC will continue to use innovative methods to assess the extent to which the
Partnership research education program is preparing trainees and fellows to successfully pursue a productive
cancer/cancer health disparities research career. The REC will also advance scientific knowledge on effective
research education programs through the submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed publications regarding
the impact of Partnership activities on the diversity of the biomedical workforce and effective strategies for
developing research scientists from underrepresented backgrounds."
10898685,"Summary. Background: Use of existing cancer prevention strategies could have prevented over half of the
roughly 1.7 million new cases of cancer expected in the US in 2019. It is critical to intervene with adolescents
and young adults (AYAs) around key behaviors, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, maintaining
healthy weight, and receiving the human papillomavirus vaccine given a) their potential to shift cancer
trajectories and b) the establishment of these behaviors during AYA developmental stages. However, AYAs
are not engaging in these behaviors at desired levels. For racial and ethnic minorities and low-income
individuals, periods of adolescence (ages 10-19) and emerging adulthood (ages 20-25) are often marked by
inconsistent healthcare access and structural factors that place them at greater risk for cancer.
Goal: The Outreach Core connects implementation science, outreach, and community engagement to address
two key divides that hinder cancer prevention among underserved AYAs: (1) the research-practice divide,
which limits the impact of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for underserved communities and (2) the cancer
workforce divide, in which the communities most impacted by cancer inequities are least represented in the
cancer research workforce. To address these divides, we will use participatory approaches to conduct the
project in collaboration with a Community Advisory Board, thus increasing the impact and relevance of
proposed solutions.
Methods: The study is organized around four aims. With Aim 1, we will build on the existing board, which
includes representatives from the Black and Brazilian communities of Greater Boston and the Latino
community of Greater Lawrence, MA (communities experiencing cancer inequities) and add AYAs and experts
in AYA health and youth-engaged research. With Aim 2, we will support community organizations to adapt and
deliver EBIs focusing on alcohol and tobacco use, maintaining healthy weight, and HPV vaccination among
underserved AYAs. With Aim 3, we will train the next generation of Black, Latino, Brazilian, and Native
scholars in the theory and practice of community-engaged research and community-centered interventions.
With Aim 4, we will co-create products and services with the Community Advisory Board to disseminate
findings and integrate community and equity considerations into Partnership activities.
Innovations and impact: We link outreach, engagement, and implementation science to develop a platform to
shape research conducted at UMB and the seven partner institutions of the DF/HCC, serving as a model
infrastructure for cancer prevention and control in partnership with populations experiencing cancer inequities."

A critical gap often exists at institutions serving underserved health disparity populations and underrepresented
students (ISUPS) between access to Genomics technologies and the high costs associated with the required
instrumentation, technical proficiency, and analytical expertise. The Genomics Core (GC) addresses this gap
by providing expert and affordable access to high-throughput genomics technologies on a reduced fee basis
for all Partnership investigators. The GC benefits the entire Partnership by providing innovative approaches to
explore early project ideas, and by working with Partnership investigators and their trainees to facilitate the use
of genomics technologies to build sustainable cancer biology and cancer disparities research. To accomplish
these goals, the GC (through the auspices of the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, CPCT) provides
front-line genomics-related technologies, as well as bioinformatics support for data analysis, to Partnership
investigators through an affordable reimbursement model. The GC proposes to accomplish these goals
through the pursuit of four specific aims designed to build capacity for biomedical and cancer research and
training at UMass Boston by bridging a gap in the availability of cutting-edge genomics-based tools; support
Partnership investigators who wish to pursue early project ideas, especially those that require innovative
and/or technically challenging genomics approaches; bridge a training gap between students and high-level
genomics-based technologies, and provide bioinformatics analysis of data generated in the core. In this
application, the GC specifically supports FP2: Targeting androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer in men
with African Ancestry – Steven Balk (DF/HCC - BIDMC) and Changmeng Cai (UMass Boston) and PP2: High
frequency of CHD1 loss in BRCA2-deficient African American prostate tumors drives treatment resistance –

10898699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To address the critical gap in cancer disparities research created by a lack of access, particularly by early-
stage investigators, to high level methods expertise, the Research Design and Analysis Core (RDAC) will
provide methodologists and statisticians to meet the needs of Partnership investigators and trainees. By
bridging this gap in qualitative and mixed methods, the RDAC will maximize its impact on practice and reduce
disparities within new lines of cancer research. Reaching across institutional and disciplinary divides, the
RDAC will provide population and basic science studies with the methodologic expertise for proper study
design and data acquisition/analysis, and infrastructure for inclusive data collection at individual-,
organizational-, and community-levels with a focus to minimize bias due to data chauvinism and absenteeism,
foster cross-institutional relationships, and provide URM students with novel educational opportunities. In
addition, the RDAC will offer a broad spectrum of educational experiences to enhance the field of cancer
disparities research. We will provide mentorship and training in the design, implementation, and analysis of
population science research to meet the diverse needs of the Partnership research community and to facilitate
sound clinical and basic science research.
The aims of the RDAC are to: 1) Address the gap/shortage of methodologists, the RDAC will provide
methodological consultation, operational support, and mentorship for quantitative and qualitative cancer
research projects; 2) Address problems with data absenteeism and data chauvinism by providing investigators
with cutting-edge, innovative experimental design and statistical methods; 3) Build methodological and
statistical capability and expertise among all Partnership faculty, trainees and staff, as well as the broader
community; and 4) Provide support to the other Partnership Cores for administrative activities, through
program evaluation, educational programming, and data management/analysis.
In addition to future incubator projects, project applications, and additional research projects, the RDAC will
support the following funded research projects in this renewal application: Full Project 1: Testing Home-based
Exercise Strategies to Improve Exercise Participation and Cardiovascular Health in Underserved Minority
Patients with Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy (Yan and Dieli-Conwright) and Pilot Project 1: Impact of
Changing Restaurant Advertising on Obesity Risk and Disparities (Francis, Horn and Bleich)"
10831850,"Rationale: Obesity affects ≥30% of the U.S. population, including Veterans, with related costs estimated at
$190B/yr. Researchers use vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a number of conditions, including obesity.
Sensory afferents in the vagus nerves innervate the stomach and relay information about the state of the
stomach, particularly the degree of stomach wall stretch associated with increased stomach volume. Desired
outcomes are maximized when VNS is applied bilaterally and off-target effects are minimized when VNS is
applied at the subdiaphragmatic level. However, VNS parameters vary widely and it is unknown how changes
in stimulus parameters alter outcomes. Until the parameter-to-outcome relationship is mapped, developing
optimal stimulus waveforms is impossible. Experiments in rats could facilitate development of these maps, but
bilateral subdiaphragmatic VNS (sVNS) is difficult/impossible in rats with currently available cuffs, which carry
an inherent risk of esophageal stenosis.
Objective: The primary objective of this study is to map the relationship between sVNS parameters, nerve
recruitment, and brain activation with a novel helical cuff that eliminates the risk of esophageal stenosis. The
secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the novel helical cuff is effective and safe for use in
both acute and survival experiments, including experiments that use strong magnetic fields for MRI.
Hypotheses will be tested through a series of animal experiments over a period of 2 years.
Research Plan and Methodology: During Aim 1, the relationship between sVNS parameters and axon
recruitment will be mapped to generate recruitment surfaces. Comparisons will include unilateral vs. bilateral
sVNS; sVNS delivered through a traditional cuff vs. sVNS delivered through the novel helical cuff; sVNS at the
time of surgery vs. sVNS at long-term follow-up. The effect of a chronic high glucose diet will be determined.
During Aim 2, the relationship between sVNS parameters and brain activation/inhibition in key regions of the
brain associated with satiety and food-based reward will be mapped using an 11.1 T fMRI. During Aim 3, the
mechanical effects of a chronically-implanted novel cuff will be determined by examining the pressure required
to distend the esophagus and through microscopic analysis of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves.
Expected Outcomes: This proof-of-concept study is a critical first step in developing a new interface that
addresses several limitations with currently-available technology. We expect that the novel cuff will 1) be easy
to implant; 2) bilaterally recruit most of the target axons innervating the stomach without apparent off-target
effects; 3) cause no or minimal damage to the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves; 4) cause no or minimal risk of
esophageal stenosis; 5) show no signs of heating during fMRI; 6) not introduce artefacts into the fMRI data.
This study will generate data to facilitate understanding how unilateral and bilateral sVNS effects the system at
two levels by generating a map that links sVNS parameters to: 1) axon recruitment and 2) brain
activation. These maps, which are currently unknown, are critical for sVNS parameter optimization, which,
itself, is critical for successful clinical deployment. We anticipate that this SPiRE will generate one publication
and one patent. It is our long-term goal to translate optimal stimulus parameters and possibly the novel
interface to individuals who have failed to lose weight under traditional weight loss regimens.
Benefit to Veterans: With regard to obesity, 72% of Veterans are overweight or obese. Obesity has several
comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. There is a strong link between obesity and
depression. Although this study is entirely preclinical, it is a critical first step in developing optimal stimulus
waveforms. If the study is successful, then the chance of successful optimization of sVNS parameters is
dramatically increased and, as such, the chance of translating this technology to the clinic."

T cells play a central role in the immune response, detecting antigenic peptides cradled within MHC molecules
(pMHCs) displayed on the surface of diseased cells via specific interactions with cell-surface T cell receptors
(TCRs). This recognition triggers downstream T cell activation and cytotoxic killing. In vivo, T cells are
exquisitely sensitive and specific, able to be activated by a single antigenic peptide displayed by a diseased
cell. Immunotherapies attempt to harness this sensitivity and specificity to eliminate cancerous cells by either
transfusing patients with T cells engineered to display TCRs specific for tumor-associated antigens
(neoantigens) or injecting peptide ‘vaccines’ to stimulate expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones.
Predicting which neoantigen/TCR combinations will activate a potent T cell response in a patient remains a
formidable challenge. There are a vast number of potential pMHC/TCR complexes: MHC molecules are
encoded by 23,000 HLA alleles, each MHC displays a ~9 amino acid peptide (209 possibilities), and each
patient can express >1020 possible TCRs. While many techniques leverage next-generation sequencing to
screen millions of pMHC/TCR combinations for high-affinity binders, these screens can test only a small
fraction of possible combinations.
Moreover, the strength of pMHC/TCR binding does not predict activation:
many high-affinity peptides do not activate T cells, and many potent agonists bind with only moderate affinities.
T cells generate pN to nN forces on pMHC/TCR complexes as they crawl over antigen-presenting cells, and
emerging evidence has established that these biomechanical forces are essential for sensitive and specific
TCR-pMHC recognition: pMHC/TCR complexes that drive potent activation form ‘catch’ bonds that strengthen
under force, while those that do not form ‘slip’ bonds more likely to break. Thus, developing improved
immunotherapies requires new technologies capable of testing large numbers of candidate pMHC/TCR
interactions for their ability to form catch bonds and activate T cells under physiological forces.
My lab is uniquely qualified to address this critical need. In prior work, we developed a microfluidic platform that
enables recombinant cell-free expression, purification, and quantitative in vitro characterization of >1,500
proteins in hours and at low cost. Here, we will apply this powerful technology to systematically investigate
which pMHC/TCR combinations form ‘catch’ bonds that predict activation (Platform 1) and which neoantigens
are efficiently displayed by 1000s of different MHC sequences encoded by variable HLA alleles (Platform 2).
To further test candidate pMHC/TCR combinations in their cellular context, we will apply a novel droplet-based
technology we invented to co-encapsulate 10s of millions of T cell/APC pairs and sort them based on activation
(Platform 3)."
10851754,"Abstract/ project summary
 Among the two million Americans who have lost a limb, including 96,519 Veterans, 60-90% have a
sensation of pain in the amputated limb– called phantom limb pain (PLP). PLP can last for years and lead to
drug dependence, job loss, and poor quality of life. Limb amputation leads to abnormal sensory and motor
cortex reorganization, which is associated with PLP. Restoration of more normal cortical organization is
associated with reduced PLP. Current therapies have aimed to restore organization in the motor cortex with
little focus on sensory processing, which is also crucial in effective movement. These have shown success, but
their efficacy remains unclear. We hypothesize that restoring somatosensory cortex organization will be vital in
reducing PLP. Sensory loss correlates with a small or delayed evoked potential in brain signals recorded from
the scalp. We will develop and test a novel noninvasive non-pharmacological therapy which works by training a
person to increase their somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). This targeted neuroplasticity protocol is
based on operant conditioning, and was developed by our research group, over the past 40 years, to target
plasticity to specific sites in the nervous system. We have shown, and others have confirmed, that these
targeted neuroplasticity protocols can enhance recovery of function in people and animals with spinal cord
injury, stroke, and other disorders. SEPs can also be conditioned, and affect function, as has been shown in
few studies.
 We aim to develop a protocol for up-conditioning SEPs, with our targeted conditioning approach, in people
with phantom limb pain, with the expectation that it will improve the cortical organization of the sensory cortex
and help reduce the pain, with longer lasting effects. We will first optimize the conditioning protocol and test it
in 10 healthy Veterans, and then apply it in 20 Veterans with PLP. The SEPs for the phantom limb will be
elicited for non-painful tactile stimuli, with the well-known mirror effect–i.e. the stimuli is applied to the intact
limb and its reflection is viewed in the mirror, evoking an electrical evoked response in the somatosensory
cortex contralateral to the phantom limb. Our preliminary tests in person with intact arms and a person with
amputated arm, shows that this is possible. The study will assess the feasibility of the intervention in Veterans
with PLP, across 26 one-hr sessions, over 9-weeks (3 sess/week). They will be randomly assigned to a
Conditioning or a Control group, 10 people per group; where Control group will receive equal amount of
stimulation as the conditioning group, but no conditioning feedback. This intervention will be performed with our
well established Evoked Potential Operant Conditioning System (EPOCS), that has been developed and used
successfully, by us and others, over the past decade, for similar conditioning studies.
 We will assess the impact of SEP conditioning on function–pain, quality of life, tactile acuity,
attention/cognition, and physiology–sensory and motor cortical organization, excitability and functional
connectivity. We expect that SEP conditioning will reduce pain, and improve the sensory-motor cortical
organization, excitability and sensorimotor functional connectivity for the phantom limb. It may also improve
tactile acuity, QoL and attention –assessed as exploratory outcomes. These improvements will persist for at
least 6 months. These effects will be larger for the Conditioning group, relative to the Control group.
 We expect that these initial results will provide support for subsequent larger studies that enable us to
further assess the therapeutic efficacy of SEP up-conditioning for reducing PLP, improving cortical
organization, reducing medication dependence, and enhancing QoL in Veterans with amputations. This would
also advance method development for pain research for other CNS disorders that affect many Veterans (e.g.,
stroke, spinal cord injury, chronic central pain, back pain)."
10873170,"Aberrant activation of the innate immune response is hypothesized to contribute to leukemogenesis in
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with MDS were described with
mutations that constitutively activated such pathways. Our studies suggested that mutations which impair
termination of emergency (stress) granulopoiesis (EG) are also a possible mechanism. EG is the process for
rapid, episodic granulocyte (PMN) production during infectious challenge and a key component of the innate
immune response. We previously determined that Triad1, an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, was essential for EG-
termination. Consistent with a role for a sustained EG response in leukemogenesis, we found Triad1 functioned
as a leukemia suppressor for AML with increased expression of homeodomain transcription factors. An adverse
prognosis subset of clonal myeloid malignancies, including MDS/AML with MLL1/KMT2A rearrangements, is
characterized by overexpression of a group of these proteins (e.g HoxB3, B4, A9-11, Cdx1 and 2, Meis1).
 Mice transplanted with bone marrow expressing leukemia-associated Mll1-fusion proteins develop AML after
a lag time of months; suggesting leukemogenesis requires accumulation of mutations in addition to those
involving MLL1/KMT2A-rearrangement. We found Triad1 expression decreased during leukemogenesis in a
mice with expression of an Mll1-fusion protein in the bone marrow. We also found that either Triad1 knockdown
or EG episodes accelerated AML development in such mice. We demonstrated HoxA10 enhanced, but HoxA9
repressed, Triad1 gene transcription. And, Triad1 re-expression rescued EG termination in Hoxa10-/- mice.
 We performed a screen to identify proteins with Triad1-dependent Ub. In addition to inflammatory mediators
and RTKs, we identified proteins involved in the integrated stress response (ISR; Gcn1, eIF2B4 and eIF4G1).
The ISR prevents metabolic exhaustion and cell death during sustained inflammation by modulating translation
to correct metabolic defects and enhance proliferation once defects are corrected. Gcn1 functions as a primary
regulator of this process by activating Gcn2/eIF2B4. We found Triad1-knockdown in myeloid cells altered the
profile of mRNAs undergoing translation. However, combined knockdown of Triad1 and Gcn1 in these cells
reversed abnormalities in translation of mRNAs involved in cellular response to stress, cellular response to DNA
damage, cell cycle progression, translation, protein metabolism and ISR termination with Triad1 knockdown
alone. We found Gcn1 knockdown delayed AML development in mice transplanted with bone marrow expressing
an Mll1-fusion oncoprotein, and reversed the effect of Triad1-knockdown on accelerating leukemogenesis.
 We hypothesize that inhibition of the ISR by Triad1 facilitates emergency granulopoiesis (EG)-termination
and suppresses leukemogenesis in disorders with increased Hox expression. This will be pursued by 3 Aims.
 Aim 1: Define the role of ISR inhibition by HoxA10/Triad1 in terminating emergency granulopoiesis.
Murine models of emergency granulopoiesis (EG) will be studied for the role of HoxA10/Triad1-mediated Ub of
Gcn1 in EG termination, the modulation of the translatome, and downstream pathways relevant to this process.
 Aim 2: Identify the influence of ISR regulation by Hox/Triad1 on mutagenesis and leukemogenesis.
Using the murine models of MLL1/KMT2A rearranged, adverse prognosis AML, we will study the impact of
HoxA10/Triad1-mediated Ub of Gcn1 on the translatome and accumulation of mutations during leukemogenesis.
 Aim 3: Determine the impact of Hox/Triad1 on inflammatory pathways and leukemogenesis in human
MDS/AML. Bone marrow and peripheral blood CD34+ cells from human subjects with MDS/AML will be studied
for association of Hox/Triad1 expression with inflammatory pathway activation and adverse outcomes. Molecular
mechanisms will be investigated by RNA-Seq, whole exome sequencing and in murine xenografts.
 The goal is to identify a molecular subset of human MDS/AML with Triad1/ISR related events as molecular

 Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible vision loss in Americans. Effective treatment requires
the patient to take visual field tests over time, to monitor for progression of visual field loss. In many patients
there is no progression, but when it occurs it must be detected as quickly as possible in order to save vision
by using a more aggressive treatment. Patients whose vision is actually stable don’t know it, so they worry
unnecessarily.
 Conventional tests to measure visual fields are too difficult to take. They are fatiguing and the equipment
they use is expensive and bulky A skilled perimetrist is still required to train the patient how to take the test and
to monitor for eye movements and patient fatigue. As a result, glaucoma patients typically have a visual field
test only one to three times a year. And unfortunately, the results of these tests have high variability due to the
necessarily short duration of the test. Thus, there is large error when estimating the rate of disease progression
from visual fields in a patient with glaucoma, and an urgent need to do additional testing at home to overcome
the data limitation.
 We developed a test, called Vivid Vision Perimetry (VVP-10), that substantially increases the quantity of
visual field data a patient can collect. Patients take VVP-10 at home on a low-cost virtual reality (VR) headset.
We have made the test much more user-friendly, using a novel task. VVP-10 allows the patient to freely move
their eyes and to know exactly when stimuli will appear. It gives feedback to the patient after every stimulus ,
and makes the test more like a video game. Patients have the option of guessing or not, because guessing
does not affect the test outcome. During Phase I of this project, we demonstrated feasibility by showing that
elderly glaucoma patients can perform the test at home without in-person training. The results agreed well with
conventional tests, and our mathematical models suggest that taking a cluster of 10 tests four times a year
could reduce by more than half the number of months needed to detect rapid progression. In this Direct to
Phase II Project, we will make the test still easier to perform, optimize the quality of the data collected, and
verify that VVP-10 can reduce by half the number of months needed to detect rapid progression.
 The new test is being developed by Vivid Vision, Inc., a seven-year-old company based in San Francisco,
CA. The company sells a binocular vision treatment product used by 350 clinics worldwide. It has expertise in
psychophysics, software engineering for VR games, HIPAA-compliant telemedicine, IP protection, marketing,
and sales. Leading glaucoma specialists at the UCSF School of Medicine and the NYU School of Medicine
have joined the team to carry out a one-year, multi-site study of VVP-10 in 65 patients with glaucoma."
10912509,"Symptomatic gallstone disease affects nearly 5 million people in the United States and consumes over
$6.3B annually. Complications occur when gallstones move from the wide body of the gallbladder and enter the
narrow system of ducts connecting the gallbladder to the small intestine. The incidence of gallstones increases
with age and is higher in women and obese people. Other risk factors include pregnancy, hormone replacement
therapy, rapid weight loss, diabetes, Crohn's disease, family history, older age, and prolonged fasting. As
Western-style diets gain traction across the globe, the worldwide rate of gallstone disease is rising quickly in
areas where surgical treatment is not always available.
 The most common and effective treatment for gallstone disease today is surgical removal of the
gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. Unfortunately, surgery is not always an option. Patients may be unable to
tolerate surgery due to comorbidities such as uncontrolled heart or lung diseases which make general anesthesia
impossible or they have temporary conditions which delay surgery, for example a recent heart attack, stroke, or
sepsis. The risk of a recurrent gallstone-related complication increases with waiting time and patients with a
surgical contraindication or scheduling delays are subject to increasing risk of developing gallstone-related
complications. Acute cholecystitis can force a decision to perform emergency surgery in these patients with very
high mortality and morbidity risks.
 Kōli has developed a non-surgical alternative to treat gallstone disease. A small implantable filter is
deployed in the gallbladder to prevent complications associated with gallstones obstructing the outlet of the
organ. Kōli replaces surgery with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure designed to be safe in high risk
patients, including the elderly, pregnant women, and patients with recent MI, stroke, or surgery. Kōli fits into
existing referral and reimbursement patterns, would utilize conventional ultrasound and fluoroscopic techniques,
and will be performed by interventional radiology, gastroenterology, or general surgery.
 The company’s technology was developed with support from an NSF SBIR award (#1248295) and private
investment. Over the past 5 years, Kōli has advanced their novel gallstone filtering system from proof-of-concept
bench testing, GLP-like large animal studies, and recently completed a successful first-in-human clinical
feasibility study in the Philippines.
 The current iteration of the Kōli system relies on sharp barbed anchors to penetrate the luminal wall of
the gallbladder and hold the self-expanding filter in place. Penetrating anchors carry risks associated with
perforation, scarring, and mechanical failure. Once deployed, the anchored device cannot be removed without
surgery. To address these risks, Kōli has partnered with Hoowaki, LLC to integrate a novel anti-migration micro
surface into our filtering system in place of barbed anchors. This approach will eliminate risks associated with
the current anchors and the filtering system will be easier to manufacture, easier to deploy, and completely
removable up to months after placement. This project represents the first time a micro surfaced implant will be
used in the biliary system and a starting point for a number of innovative applications in gastroenterology.
 This Direct to Phase II award will fund advanced development of the filtering system, including
incorporation of an innovative micro surface textured coating to replace the current barbed metal anchors,
integration of radiopaque tantalum markers, and validation of the updated system in bench and large animal
studies Completion of these activities will allow the company to begin pre-submission discussions with FDA for
an early feasibility study that will form the basis of a Phase IIB application."
10843760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs) are the leading cause of death in the United States and
worldwide. Atherosclerosis of the arteries underlies these conditions and is characterized by chronic
inflammation and inappropriate proliferation of disease contributing cells. Current medications available for the
treatment of atherosclerosis merely target risk factors, not the disease-causing cells themselves. Additionally,
invasive procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treat arterial stenosis but can have
adverse effects such as thrombosis. Therefore, despite progress in the field, site-specific and cell-selective
therapies that target the cells that form atherosclerotic plaques while sparing the vascular endothelium are not
available. Thus, the main objective of this research proposal is to test the feasibility of a novel messenger RNA
(mRNA) therapeutic that is site-specific in targeting regions of atherosclerotic plaques only, while specifically
targeting disease causing cells, reducing inflammation, and sparing the vascular endothelium. This research is
highly significant to public health as ASCVDs represent a major public health issue and place an enormous
burden on our Nation. I hypothesize that a combination of microRNA (miRNA) switch and small interfering RNA
(siRNA) technology into a single mRNA construct will allow for a first of its kind RNA therapeutic strategy to
cause atherosclerotic plaque regression and resolution. In order to test the efficacy of this new therapeutic, I
will employ a series of rigorous experiments using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models. Importantly, my ex vivo
model uses freshly isolated coronary arteries from human hearts, giving more clinical relevance to my work
and allowing me to test my therapeutic on human arteries burdened with atherosclerotic plaques. We aim to
make a positive impact on the field by not only designing a novel mRNA therapeutic to treat atherosclerosis,
but also, by providing evidence for the effectiveness of this unique therapeutic strategy that can be modified in
order to treat other diseases. I will work towards this goal under the mentorship of my sponsor, Dr. Hana
Totary-Jain, an expert in the field of CVD as well as RNA therapeutic research, at the supportive research
environment of USF Health’s Morsani College of Medicine. My mentor, committee, additional advisors, and
department will provide me with all the necessary training and resources needed to complete this very
impactful research while also preparing me for my next career stage as a post-doctoral scholar and eventually
a principal investigator."

The proposed F31 NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research project aims
to develop new MR detector hardware and acquisition & analysis methods to enable a major improvement in the
clinical management of prostate cancer. This is of relevance to all prostate cancer patients, but also especially
for under-represented minorities. African-American men have the world's highest incidence of prostate cancer
and a more than two-fold higher mortality rate compared with whites. Also, African-American men have twice
the risk of non-Hispanic whites for presenting with advanced-stage prostate cancer. This means that it is
important to identify and stage aggressive, advanced prostate cancer accurately in this under-represented
population. Prior studies by our group have been focused on improved MR molecular imaging of primary, organ-
confined prostate-cancer and detecting response to therapy in bone and liver (distant) metastases. The PI, an
African-American graduate student, has designed the proposed research training in this diversity fellowship
project to focus on developing novel 13C/1H RF detector hardware and methods for increased HP [1-13C]pyruvate
& 1H mpMRI sensitivity and coverage to detect aggressive cancers within the prostate and local spread to the
prostatic bed & adjacent lymph-nodes. This is important for newly diagnosed patients and of particular relevance
for African-American patients who more often present with advanced stage disease that has extra-capsular
spread beyond the prostate and to nearby lymph nodes.
As shown in his attached biosketch and through his outstanding initial research, the candidate is a highly
motivated, successful trainee who meets the eligibility criteria as an African-American graduate student and will
benefit greatly from this fellowship in terms of his research, education, and efforts to promote diversity in
biomedical research. This project was designed by the PI applicant (with sponsor input & guidance) to fit his
career goal of becoming a professor leading advanced MRI technology development to improve the clinical care
of prostate cancer patients specifically, and patients with other deadly diseases in general. This award will also
enable the PI candidate to promote diversity within the joint Bioengineering program at UC Berkeley and UCSF
and ultimately science nationally to expand the number and input of under-represented minority scientists
especially in the field of Bioengineering. He has been highly active in promoting diversity currently as a UC BioE
graduate student and a member of Black Graduate Engineering and Science Students (BGESS). The diversity
fellowship career development plan is designed to expand the scientific knowledge and independent research
capabilities of the candidate. The goals are to: 1) Improve knowledge and research skills in MR hardware and
acquisition methods; 2) Learn research study design and conduct; 3) Statistical and clinical study considerations;
and 4) the conduct of first-rate research designed to ultimately improve prostate cancer imaging of newly
diagnosed patients presenting with advanced disease."
10896433,"Hypertension remains a major public health challenge worldwide despite the abundance of available therapeutic
options. Inappropriate therapy and patient non-compliance are the main factors accounting for poor blood
pressure (BP) control. Identification of the mechanisms responsible for elevation of BP in specific patient cohorts
is critical to effectively combat hypertension and related diseases. Excessive sodium retention via the Epithelial
Na• Channel (ENaC) hampers the ability of the kidney to make precise adjustments to sodium balance and is a
common pathogenic determinant of hypertension. Cumulative evidence suggests that biological sex is a
pivotal covariate affecting the development and pathophysiology of hypertension in the human population and
animal models. Our proposal introduces a novel concept that regulation of Na• reabsorption in the kidney and
renal BP control rely on sex-specific mechanisms governing ENaC activity in the aldosterone-sensitive distal
nephron. We and others have previously shown that aldosterone antagonism with mineralocorticoid receptor
(MR) inhibitors is insufficient to reduce excessive renal ENaC activity and fails to effectively attenuate BP in male
rodents with angiotensin II (Angil) dependent hypertension. Our pilot experiments reveal that hypertensive
female rats with salt-sensitive and Angil-dependent hypertension benefit from MR antagonism and exhibit a
stronger BP reduction, when compared to males. MR blockade is also much more potent at decreasing renal
ENaC activity in Ang II-infused female rats than in males. Our findings strongly suggest that sensitivity of renal
ENaC to aldosterone is an unrecognized sex-specific mechanism of chronic BP regulation. The proposal is
built around the central hypothesis that hypersensitivity of ENaC to aldosterone accounts for a prevalent
contribution of aldosterone to renal BP control in hypertensive female rats, when compared to males. We propose
to test the hypothesis with two complementary specific aims addressing a clinically relevant problem of adequate
blood pressure control at the molecular, cellular {Aim 1) and integrative {Aim 2) levels. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that sensitivity of renal ENaC to aldosterone is greater in hypertensive female rats than in males. Our
hypothesis predicts that female sex steroids positively modulate MR-dependent signaling in the kidney to
augment the response of ENaC to aldosterone in hypertensive females. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
aldosterone dominates renal BP control in hypertensive female, but not in male, rats. Our hypothesis predicts
that aldosterone-MR axis is the primary driver of hypertension and renal damage in females and MR antagonism
will be dramatically more effective at reducing BP and renal injury in hypertensive females than in males.
Successful completion of this proposal will differentiate the pathophysiological mechanisms governing Na•
retention in hypertensive males and females and provide the missing pre-clinical evidence to optimize the
use of MR antagonists in hypertensive patients of both sexes."
10842250,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)—a fatal inherited muscular dystrophy—is caused by loss of Dystrophin,
a protein that maintains muscle integrity. Corticosteroids slow DMD progression but cause side effects.
Addressing the root cause of DMD may improve patient health without needing corticosteroids. Many DMD-
causing mutations disrupt the dystrophin mRNA reading frame, resulting in non-functional protein. Strategies
that skip the out-of-frame exon to restore the reading frame and produce semi-functional protein for improved
muscle function could correct 64% of DMD mutations. FDA-approved antisense oligonucleotide drugs can skip
select exons in dystrophin mRNA, but require lifelong infusions and only work in a small group of patients. Using
CRISPR to edit dystrophin would require just one treatment. CRISPR-mediated ablation of splice sites to cause
exon skipping can increase Dystrophin in DMD models. Yet, editing in unintended tissues is a safety concern for
Cas9 therapies. An ideal platform for DMD would restrict editing to muscle tissue to maximize therapeutic benefit.
Efforts to achieve tissue-specific editing often rely on delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) with tissue
tropism; yet, it is rarely absolute. Tissue-specific editing was recently achieved using tissue-specific miRNAs to
regulate expression of Cas9 inhibitors [anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins] via miRNA target sites (TS) in the 3’ UTR of
Acr mRNA. When the platform is systemically delivered to mice via AAV, Acr-TS targeted by liver-specific miRNA
allows editing only in the liver. Unlike tissue-specific promoters, this Acr-TS strategy could be adapted to one or
multiple muscle tissues affected in DMD, as long as muscle-specific (myo)-miRNA can repress an Acr.
With support from Erik Sontheimer (CRISPR, Acr), Eric Olson (DMD), Wen Xue (in vivo CRISPR delivery), Phillip
Zamore (miRNA), Guangping Gao (AAV), and Zhiping Weng (bioinformatics), this proposal seeks to develop a
muscle-specific editing platform to treat DMD. The myo-miRNA, miR-1, can repress an Acr in muscle cell lines
to achieve muscle-specific editing. To fine-tune specificity of editing in muscle tissues for DMD, Aim 1 will test
the ability of myo-miRs varying in abundance and muscle-type specificity to repress Acr and drive muscle-specific
editing in mouse cell lines. The myo-miR construct supporting highest muscle-specific editing will be delivered
to a DMD mouse model, and in vivo muscle function as well as dystrophin exon skipping, Dystrophin protein,
and miRNA level in muscle tissues and liver will be measured. Aim 2 will test the compatibility of additional Cas9
orthologs in the Acr-TS system to enable targeting of more sequences, and develop a single AAV delivery system
for improved safety. An Acr inhibiting the Cas9s to be tested has been identified. The ability of miR-1 to repress
this Acr and drive muscle specific editing by each Cas9 will be tested in cells. A single vector encoding the Acr-
TS system will be designed and packaged into AAV, and muscle-specific editing will be compared to a dual AAV
system in mice. This work will develop a flexible, safe, muscle-specific CRISPR platform with the potential to be
used for any combination of muscle tissues to treat patients with DMD, or other genetic muscle disorders."

This proposal addresses a novel way in which microglia functional states are regulated by the transcription factor
PU.1 in the context of amyloid pathology and its potential contribution to neuroprotection against Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). The expression level of PU.1 is crucial for instructing commitment to myeloid versus lymphoid
lineages and is enriched in microglia. PU.1 also determines the inflammatory activation state of macrophages
by priming cis-regulatory regions to elicit appropriate gene expression upon stimulation. Recently, genome wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified a variant in Spi1 (encoding PU.1) that modulates AD risk. Unlike
other variants, the Spi1 variant is unique in that it leads to a reduction in PU.1 expression and has a protective
effect against AD risk. In a 5xFAD amyloid mouse model of AD, I observed heterogeneous protein expression
of PU.1 in microglia. Recent work supports the idea that specific microglia activation states have unique impacts
on AD pathogenesis. The Disease Associated Microglia (DAMs) are thought to serve a protective role in AD by
robustly responding to amyloid plaques whereas inflammatory populations potentially play a harmful role in
disease. I hypothesize that low PU.1 expression in microglia induces neuroprotective functional states in
microglia against AD. We generated genetic mouse models that increase (Spi1cOE) or decrease (Spi1cKD)
PU.1 expression specifically in microglia and crossed them to the 5xFAD amyloid disease model. Ribosomal
profiling of these microglia revealed significant bulk transcriptional changes. To understand how PU.1 expression
level regulates microglia activation states during amyloid pathology, I performed single nuclei RNA-sequencing.
These new data reveal that Spi1cKD in 5xFAD favors microglia states associated with neuroprotection (DAM)
while attenuating the proportion of cells in toxic states (inflammatory). Knowing the location of these microglia in
relation to amyloid plaques will enhance our understanding of where engagement of such states occur and where
these microglia may be exerting protective or harmful effects. In my first aim, I will use multiplexed error-robust
in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to spatially identify microglia in DAM and inflammatory activation states with
Spi1cKD or Spi1cOE in 5xFAD. In addition to these transcriptional changes, we showed a reduction in the
complement protein C1qa in Spi1cKD 5xFAD animals. We further found that Spi1cKD microglia prevented
synapse loss that is characteristic in human AD and recapitulated in the 5xFAD model. It has been shown that
pathological activation of complement occurs with inflammatory activation and contributes to synapse loss in AD.
Therefore, I propose to assess the production of C1qa by microglia with differential PU.1 expression level in vitro
and synaptic co-localization of C1qa in 5xFAD mice with Spi1cKD and Spi1cOE microglia."

In the nervous system, G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) serve to detect the precise spatial and temporal
pattern of neurotransmitter release to modulate synaptic transmission. The metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluRs) are family C GPCRs that sense the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. mGluRs are constitutive
dimers with a large extracellular ligand binding domain which is connected to a seven-helix transmembrane
domain via an intermediate cysteine-rich linker. There are eight mGluR subtypes, which are expressed in
overlapping regions of the brain and play distinct roles at the synapse. Additionally, mGluRs readily form
heterodimers, increasing the molecular diversity and functional complexity of this system. Recent breakthroughs
in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have led to full-length structures of mGluRs, providing an improved
understanding of the overall architecture of this receptor. However, these structures raise further questions
regarding the dynamic rearrangements that occur upon activation. While the extracellular domain is known to
undergo glutamate-induced rearrangements, how these conformational changes are coupled to yield activation
and G protein recruitment at the TMD remains to be defined. Additionally, how this coupling is tuned across
mGluR homo- and heterodimer subtypes to produce the observed differences in activation properties is
unknown. The group II mGluRs are ideal candidates for addressing these questions and are the focus of this
proposal. Group II mGluRs consist of mGluR2 and mGluR3, which have the highest sequence homology of all
mGluRs, yet still show distinct glutamate affinity, kinetics, and basal activity. Furthermore, mGluR2 and mGluR3
readily heterodimerize in the brain. In this proposal, I will use a combination of cryo-EM structural analysis and
functional assays in addition to subtype specific pharmacological compounds. Using these tools, I will probe the
conformational dynamics of group II mGluRs, with a focus on the allosteric mechanisms that couple ligand
binding to transmembrane domain activation. Together, this work will provide a high-resolution picture of
activation for mGluR homo- and heterodimers."

This F31-diversity proposal investigates the role of PDL1 in early melanoma progression using our novel cancer
cell-of-origin autochthonous mouse model. Our overarching hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic PDL1 signals
promote early tumor progression by both immune and non-immune mechanisms. Our proposal will define
novel cell-intrinsic PDL1 signals in the melanoma cell-of-origin and established melanomas providing the first
model distinguishing bona-fide biologic tumor-intrinsic PDL1 signaling in the absence of potentially confounding
mechanisms due to genetic PDL1KO of a previously PDL1-replete tumor cell. We will address this hypothesis
with the following aims:
Aim 1 Test the hypothesis that melanocyte-intrinsic PDL1 signals promote early melanoma progression
and treatment sensitivities. We will investigate melanocyte-intrinsic PDL1 signals, downstream effectors, and
contributions of UV exposure facilitating early tumor progression using the PDL1KO TNQ61R mouse model we
created, and littermate controls, in which PDL1 is specifically deleted in melanocytes. Transcriptomic (RNA-seq)
and proteomic (Luminex, RPPA) dynamics will be assessed as melanocytes progress from PDL1-null benign
nevi to malignant melanomas defining when PDL1 emerges during carcinogenesis and determining the genetic
and proteomic milieu governing PDL1 expression in vivo and in vitro and its consequences. PDL1 regulation of
oncogenic signals (e.g., NRAS, BRAF, MEK, ERK, mTORC1) will be tested using small molecule inhibitors and
in vitro CRISPR replacement of mutant NrasQ61R for WT Nras or BRAFV600E. PDL1 suppression of immunogenic
STING signals following skin UV exposure will be explored in parallel and as immunogenicity mechanisms are
defined, their contributions to de novo tumor growth and treatment sensitivities will be tested in Aim 2.
Aim 2 Define TME factors in melanocyte-intrinsic PDL1-drive progression and treatment vulnerabilities.
We will test melanocyte PDL1-dependent TME immune dynamics using our PDL1KO TNQ61R model by harvesting
non-malignant skin and induced tumor over time, assessing immune populations as tumors progress with flow
cytometry. Immunoblots, Luminex, and qRT-PCR will test immunogenic STING signals and chemokine
production ex vivo and immune cell co-localization with tumor will be assessed by confocal imaging. Alternative
immunogenic pathways known to affect treatment efficacy (e.g., pyroptosis, RIG-I/MAVS) will be studied in
similar fashion. Studies of PDL1KO TNQ61R mice and derived cell lines with ICB, immune cell depletion, and
immune deficient mice test PDL1-driven immune-dependent targetable treatment vulnerabilities. Immune
outcomes of PDL1/Nras cross talk will be defined complementary to signaling studies in Aim 1."

Collagens are essential components of the extra-cellular matrix and basement membranes, where they serve to
bolster tissue integrity, mediate cell migration, and organize signaling. Collagen proteins have three domains:
the C-terminal trimerization domain (CTD/NC1), the collagen domain and the 7S N-terminal domain. Collagens
undergo folding followed by trimerization and collagen triple helix formation in the ER prior to secretion to the
extra-cellular environment. Trimerization of the NC1 domain is the first step in collagen folding and is required
for formation of the collagen triple helix. Mutations in collagens result in severe diseases, such as Osteogenesis
Imperfecta, Alport’s Disease and Cerebral Small Vessel Disease which impair the integrity of bones, kidneys
and blood vessels in the brain and eye respectively. Although many disease-causing mutations in collagens
have been identified, there still is an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis. The goal
of this proposal is to understand how perturbing the initial trimerization effects the maturation and
biosynthesis of collagen IV. In my first aim, I will develop new cell-based assays to quantify the effect of NC1
domain perturbation on collagen assembly. Specifically, I have developed a split luciferase assay that measures
NC1 domain interactions in isolation and have begun to quantify the effect of pathogenic mutations. Additionally,
I will develop complementary cell lines that express full-length collagen IV, including the most interesting mutants
identified in the split luciferase assays, to better understand the functional consequences of these perturbations.
In my second aim, I have designed point mutations at the NC1 interface, and identified those that increase or
decrease trimer stability. Excitingly, one of these mutations significantly increased NC1 association and
secretion. Together, these studies will reveal the mechanisms of collagen-associated disease and suggest ways
of circumventing them. The major innovation is the application of cutting-edge computational approaches to
design point mutations that probe specific questions about collagen assembly and stability. Together, we expect
these studies to suggest new avenues for the treatment of collagen associated disorders. Finally, these
experiments serve as an exciting training opportunity, providing me with a mentored research experience in inter-
disciplinary, translational studies."

In 2020, an estimated 5.2 million Americans reported using cocaine, with 1.3 million meeting criteria for Cocaine
Use Disorder (CUD). Despite the increasing need, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CUD. One variable
that is often overlooked in CUD research is the resulting disruption of circadian (24-hour) and diurnal (night/day)
rhythms. Disrupted rhythms have been shown to prolong the cycle of cocaine abuse and increase the risk of
relapse. CUD can be modeled with cocaine self-administration (SA) using three different patterns of cocaine
intake: short continuous access (ShA), long continuous access (LgA), and intermittent access (IntA). Though our
lab has established diurnal variation in rhythms of dopamine (DA) dynamics, including cholinergic interneuron
(CIN) modulation and DA reuptake in naïve animals, it is not yet understood how adapting the type of cocaine
SA intake pattern differentially affects these rhythms and the mechanistic pathways involved following long-term
cocaine intake. The mesolimbic DA system in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) is an important mediator of
motivated and reward-associated behaviors that are maladapted in CUD. CINs are critical modulators of
mesolimbic DA release in the NAc via their activation of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on DA terminals. While
the effects of chronic cocaine on DA signals and CIN/ACh activity have been studied extensively at single time
points, a major obstacle in the field is that cocaine-induced changes in DA signaling rhythms and potential
mechanisms for rhythmic disruptions, such as alterations in CIN signaling, have not been investigated. Thus,
my central hypothesis is twofold: 1) to discover the effect of long-term, voluntary cocaine intake on time-
of-day rhythms in DA and ACh NAc signaling, and 2) outline a mechanistic link between rhythms of ACh
and DA signaling. The proposed research plan will examine the role of rhythms in DA release and CIN activity
under various patterns of cocaine access with the following aims: (1) Assess the cocaine history and pattern of
intake on diurnal variation in NAc DA release, (2) Examine a mechanism for disrupted diurnal rhythms in DA
release in cocaine-exposed animals, and (3) Define the temporal architecture of CIN modulation of DA release
magnitude in cocaine-exposed animals. These studies will highlight the importance of endogenous diurnal
rhythms in NAc neurochemistry following chronic cocaine intake patterns to provide greater mechanistic insight
into the role of rhythms in CUD. Understanding the influence of rhythms underlying CUD neurochemistry will
provide novel treatment targets and propose times throughout the day in which to target them most effectively."

 Our overarching goal is to provide reliable and efficient tools that can be used in structure
based drug discovery (SBDD). One crucial component of SBDD is to predict the structure of a
drug molecule that binds to a protein involved in a certain disease. This is usually achieved using
computer tools and the process consists of two steps, namely hit identification and lead
optimization. The latter step requires high accuracy and is presently achieved by computing
relative binding free energies (RBFE) using alchemical methods and molecular mechanics (MM)
forcefields. Unfortunately, due to deficiencies in MM forcefields, predicted drug candidates using
the SBDD process are sometimes unreliable, which is only realized at the later stages of the drug
discovery process involving experimental studies or even clinical trials. To address this issue, we
will create a novel, flexible and user-friendly computational infrastructure named Automated Force
Field Developer and Optimizer (AFFDO) that will allow scientists to quickly generate high-quality
training datasets through high-throughput ab initio calculations and transform them into fast and
accurate models which can then be used for RBFE calculations. We will engineer a commercial
quality code and deploy it on an existing web-based, user-friendly, drug development platform
that is widely popular among the industrial community (OpenEye’s Orion platform)."

 Between birth and adulthood, cardiomyocytes (CMs) undergo profound changes in size, ultrastructure,
metabolism, and gene expression, a process collectively referred to as CM maturation. Although highly
coordinated, the transcriptional network that governs this process is not understood. This lack of understanding
is a barrier to cardiac regenerative medicine, where our current inability to mature CMs differentiated from non-
myocytes limits their use for disease modeling or replacement therapy. In addition, disruption of maturation by
abnormal hemodynamic loads in neonates who have undergone surgery to correct congenital heart defects
likely contributes to their high incidence of heart failure in adulthood. A sound understanding of the regulatory
network governing CM maturation will inspire hypothesis driven attempts to surmount these challenges.
 In mice, a key hallmark of CM maturation is sarcomere isoform switching, including the well documented
neonatal switch from Myosin Heavy Chain 7 (Myh7) to Myosin Heavy Chain 6 (Myh6). We have conducted and
validated an in vivo high throughput CRISPR screen for transcriptional regulators of CM maturation, using the
Myh7/6 isoform switch as the readout. Two top candidates from this screen, Rnf20 and Rnf40, form a complex
which governs deposition of the poorly understood chromatin modification histone-2B mono-ubiquitination
(H2Bub1). H2Bub1 function is unexplored in the heart, and associated with congenital heart disease mutations
in human patients. Therefore, In Aim 1 we will perform a detailed characterization of the impact of Rnf20/40 on
genetic regulation of CM maturation.
 A major reason why the transcriptional networks controlling CM maturation are poorly understood is
that appropriate tools were previously unavailable. In this proposal we will utilize a suite of novel in vivo tools to
begin mapping the transcriptional regulatory networks that govern CM maturation. In Aim 2 we will seek to
accomplish this goal by dissecting two Myh7 cis-regulatory elements. Furthermore, we will contrast the genetic
regulation of CM maturation with pathological hypertrophy by discovering and describing the key regulatory
mechanisms of Myh7, which is deactivated during maturation and re-activated in response to pathological
stress. These experiments will yield mechanistic clues as to how gene expression is coordinately controlled
during maturation and disease, thus enabling improved CM production protocols and targeted therapies.
Collectively these experiments will begin to map the transcriptional regulatory network that governs maturation
by defining the functions of select trans-acting regulators and cis-regulatory elements."
10884876,"CivaTech Oncology’s mission is to provide improved radiation therapy directly to diseased tissues while
sparing healthy tissues. With NIH/NCI SBIR support, the Company has eliminated local recurrence of disease
in pancreatic cancer patients – a huge success. Pancreatic cancer is predicted to soon become the most
commonly diagnosed cancer in the US and there are no significant, impactful therapies making a difference.
However, CivaTech has developed a novel, polymer-encapsulated, membrane-like radiation source that emits
radiation on only one side of the device – CivaSheet®. This directional source is compatible with open and
minimally invasive surgical techniques and has FDA clearance to be used as primary or combined cancer
therapy. CivaSheet is a bio-absorbable, implantable planar device that can be applied at the time of the initial
surgery. CivaSheet decreases the time between surgery and radiation therapy, which is a benefit to the
outcomes for many indications, in particular, for pancreatic cancer. Additionally, CivaSheet can shield healthy
tissues while irradiating the diseased tissue or tumor margin. This shielding enables CivaSheet to be implanted
close to radiosensitive structures without overdosing them – a huge advantage for cancers in the abdomen.
In clinical trials, patients are recovering from their surgical procedures without negative effects from the device.
CivaTech Oncology has confirmed no radiation related adverse events, no device-related toxicity. CivaSheet
delivers substantially less radiation to adjacent duodenum, stomach, liver, and kidneys compared to other
forms of radiation delivery and has targeted dosimetry for pancreatic cancer. CivaSheet greatly benefits these
patients by delivering localized radiation therapy at the time of initial surgery to protect against local
recurrence. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease that progresses quickly and has about 30% local
recurrence rates. Over the course of the SBIR Fast Track Grant, CivaTech has collected clinical evidence that
the CivaSheet is highly effective and has a 100% local control rate for pancreatic cancer patients.
These data will be compiled and compared to hospital-based outcomes for SOC patients to complete a
healthcare economic analysis. Preventing local recurrence while maintaining quality of life is highly impactful
for patients and for the healthcare system.
This Phase IIB proposal requests funds for the healthcare economic analysis and compiling a dossier that will
be presented to hospitals’ value analysis committees, private payors, and CMS. Additionally, this proposal
aims to provide engineering support to increase manufacturability and improve our ability to supply products to
meet the projected demand following the publication of our clinical trial data. CivaSheet is a truly unique
brachytherapy device that has the potential to become the first line of defense for localized cancer and has
data to demonstrate it can substantially reduce recurrence rates after a surgical tumor removal. CivaTech
Oncology is committed to making CivaSheet available to improve outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients."
10833654,"Abstract. The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Today,
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, impacting over
half-a-million Americans each year. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention
of tick bites and early tick bite treatment is the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector
surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial
distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in
areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector
surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to
collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource
required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance
practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick
encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist
misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this
approach. To date, no automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to advance
Phase I work that successfully achieved an imaging and automated identification system capable of
instantaneously and accurately identifying twelve adult tick species with 98% accuracy. This proposal
will first improve the Phase I optical design for scalability to accommodate imaging of additional
intra-specific tick species variability as nymphs, adult males, and unfed or engorged adult females. In
parallel, we develop methods to optimize quality of guided user imaging of ticks in a mobile app
approach for the general public. This will enable the development of a representative image database with
partners including TickSpotters, TickCheck, the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU), and others. The
resulting database will be used to train, validate, test and deploy high-accuracy computer vision models in
two tick identification products for professional public health and the general public. Ultimately the
approaches developed here will enable vector management organizations to leverage image recognition in
a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equip the general
public with improved tools to identify ticks during a human-tick encounter."

Dr. Annesa Flentje is Associate Professor in Community Health Systems and Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. She mentors early career researchers in
sexual and gender minority (SGM, non-heterosexual and transgender or gender non-binary people, respectively)
health, focusing on substance use, minority stress, and epigenomic markers of substance use. SGM people
have greater substance use when compared to their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts. The greater rates of
substance use are attributed to minority stress exposure (unique stress burden due to discrimination and stigma
among SGM people), and substance use increases in the presence of minority stress. Further, unique molecular
profiles of both substance use and minority stress have been observed in sexual minority men living with HIV,
suggesting that alterations in the epigenome may serve as biological markers for substance use. Unfortunately,
research to date is limited because these models have not explicitly compared people living with HIV (PLWH)
and people living without HIV (PLWoH). Further, SGM people have unique hormonal exposures that have been
unaccounted for in research investigating substance use and potential epigenetic biomarkers for substance use
and these hormonal exposures may also be related to alterations in the epigenome. This project will expand Dr.
Flentje’s research program to integrate hormonal exposures and HIV status, to be able to identify epigenomic
markers of substance use in the presence of endogenous and exogenous hormone exposures comparing PLWH
to PLWoH. To support expansion of her research, Dr. Flentje will receive additional training in HIV, hormone
exposures, dominance analysis, and epigenetic bioinformatics analysis. This K24 will support Dr. Flentje in
mentoring patient-oriented researchers in SGM health who will leverage survey and epigenetic data from existing
cohort studies: The PRIDE Study, the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study, and the All of Us Research Program
to 1) understand key minority stress predictors of substance use among SGM people and compare the relative
strength of these predictors between PLWH and PLWoH; 2) identify endogenous and exogenous hormonal
predictors of substance use among SGM people and determine differences in the relative strength of these
predictors among PLWH and PLWoH; and 3) derive minority stress, substance use, and hormonal phenotypes
among SGM people, identify epigenetic markers of these phenotypes, and identify differences in these
epigenetic markers between PLWH and PLWoH. This K24 will support mentorship of early career researchers
in SGM health focusing on substance use, HIV, hormonal biology, epigenomics, and minority stress. It will also
expand Dr. Flentje’s mentorship skills to integrate structures to support mentees in navigating financial
challenges, loan repayment applications, family building, and emotional hardships. As substance use research
among SGM people is an emerging area of study, a national approach to mentorship to promote innovation in
patient-centered research is critical."

Type 1 diabetes, a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects millions of Americans is characterized by
the progressive destruction of the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas, resulting in life-long
dependency on insulin therapy. Many people with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed with life-threatening
diabetic ketoacidosis and develop a panoply of perilous complications affecting every organ over their
shortened life spans. Testing for the presence of anti-islet autoantibody biomarkers in blood accurately
predicts whether individuals are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Autoantibody screening programs
have been shown to support interventions that reduce the rates of diabetic ketoacidosis and they help
identify eligible candidates for new interventions that may delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes.
However, no current testing method exists that combines accuracy, speed, scalability, and the ability to
collect samples at home.

This F31 proposal aims to evaluate pregnant and postpartum women’s preferences for different pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) methods and identify early process indicators for implementing these options in maternal and
child health (MCH) systems. HIV incidence remains unacceptability high among adolescent girls and young
women (AGYW) in East and Southern Africa and evidence suggests a two-fold higher risk of HIV acquisition
during pregnancy. Daily oral PrEP is scaling up for pregnant/postpartum women in Kenya but despite appreciable
uptake of oral PrEP by pregnant/postpartum women, >50% discontinue within 30 days of initiation. Unique
attributes of pregnancy and postpartum may influence discontinuation, including co-occurring side effects (e.g.,
nausea) and demands of motherhood. New long-acting (LA)-PrEP methods (e.g., vaginal rings and injectables)
have recently been approved and may address some barriers to PrEP persistence during pregnancy/postpartum,
though no systemic evaluation has been conducted to date. Early implementation studies for LA-PrEP can
accelerate its integration into maternal and child health (MCH) systems. Kenya, as one of the first countries to
implement PrEP at scale, is an ideal setting to study expanding access and uptake among pregnant women.
This proposal leverages data collected in an ongoing RCT (MR01NR019220, MPI: Pintye, Kinuthia) among 600
Kenyan women who initiate daily oral PrEP during pregnancy and are followed through nine months postpartum.
The study includes longitudinal assessments of preferences for PrEP methods (pills, vaginal rings, injectables).
Interviews and focus-groups are also conducted among PrEP users, providers, and PrEP stakeholders to
ascertain implementation outcomes. In Aim 1, we will determine pregnant and postpartum women’s preferred
PrEP attributes for HIV prevention-effective use applying discrete choice experiment analysis methods to identify
preferred PrEP method. In Aim 2, we will identify profiles of pregnant/postpartum women who would prefer novel
PrEP methods using latent class models to identify distinct profiles of study participants with different preferences
for several PrEP methods (daily oral, vaginal ring, injectable) and the driving predictors of preference within these
classes. In Aim 3, we will evaluate implementation determinants for integration of LA-PrEP formulations into
MCH systems using qualitative research informed by an implementation science process framework. The
proposed research plan will provide the F31 candidate rigorous predoctoral training in 1) analytic techniques in
discrete choice experiments and latent class modeling, 2) measurement of social and structural determinants of
HIV risk for pregnant/postpartum women, and 3) application of a process framework for implementation of LA-
PrEP. This study will be the first evaluation of user-preferences for new PrEP methods among pregnant and
postpartum women and findings will help inform messaging and introduction of novel PrEP agents tailored to
this important population. This F31 will provide rigorous implementation science training, expertise in maternal
HIV prevention, and opportunities for future implementation research in this unique and understudied population."
10919868,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Virus-associated lymphomas cause significant morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals – indeed, the
oral pathogen Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to up to 90% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and
40% of Burkitt lymphomas (BL). Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and chemotherapy have
improved outcomes for AIDS lymphomas, challenges remain particularly with virus-associated AIDS lymphomas,
prompting efforts to better understand virus-associated factors and pathways. In particular, EBV-driven cellular
genome replication which is essential to lymphoma proliferation remains underexplored.
 Upon infection of B cells, EBV drives host DNA replication which is essential for establishment of viral latency
as well as proliferation of cancer cells. However, such viral oncoprotein-driven DNA replication is plagued with
physical and functional obstacles, resulting in replication stress. Such replication stress is a barrier to cancer.
And yet, how EBV-cancer cells overcome such stress at replication forks to successfully proliferate is not well
understood. In addressing this knowledge gap, we combined isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) and
mass spectrometry to discover novel fork proteins. This revealed a critical role for ZC3H18 (or ZC3) as a
replication dependency factor that EBV upregulates to ensure host genome replication and lymphoma cell
proliferation; notably, ZC3 had not been previously linked to DNA replication. Indeed, EBV+ DLBCL from AIDS
patients have elevated ZC3 expression compared to EBV- lymphomas. An intrinsically disordered protein, ZC3
has the potential to concentrate a variety of proteins at replication forks. We find a direct interaction between
ZC3 and MCM7 (a core component of the replicative helicase complex), further pointing to ZC3’s influential role
in proliferation of EBV transformed cells. Importantly, ZC3’s partnership with other replication dependency factors
exposes EBV-lymphoma cells to synthetic lethality – such therapies exploit the property that cancer cells tolerate
perturbation of a single gene but succumb to co-disruption of multiple genetic events.
 In this application, we will test the hypothesis that EBV modulates the DNA replication machinery, ensuring
proliferation of transformed cells in the face of replication stress and enhancing the potential for susceptibility to
synthetic lethality. We will perform the following aims using ex vivo models and translate our results to patient-
derived EBV+ AIDS lymphomas obtained from the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR).
Aim 1. Investigate how novel dependency factors unmask synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in EBV-
transformed cells & Aim 2. Investigate mechanisms of ZC3 upregulation, replication machinery rewiring,
and contribution of replication dependency factors to EBV+ AIDS lymphomas.
 These studies will identify mechanisms and generate new paradigms that reveal how an opportunistic virus
modulates the host replication machinery to maintain the transformed state. Our long-term goal is to identify
novel druggable targets that demonstrate synthetic lethality against EBV+ lymphomas in persons with HIV/AIDS."
10764326,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The use of autologous gene modified cells that are resistant to HIV infection to reduce
viral reservoir size and delay or prevent HIV recrudescence is on the forefront of HIV curative science. However,
many current gene modification approaches focus solely on reducing CCR5 expression on hematopoietic stem
cells or mature CD4 T cells. These approaches may have limited impact in people with HIV (PWH) that have
virus able to use other coreceptors for entry, and only provide a single layer of protection against infection in
vivo. As a result, the AMC #097 study, “A Phase I Study of Stem Cell Gene Therapy for HIV Mediated by
Lentivector Transduced, Pre-Selected CD34+ Cells: A Trial of the AIDS Malignancy Consortium,” was
implemented to combine multiple anti-HIV genes into a single lentiviral vector that is designed to block HIV-1
infection at different stages of the HIV-1 life cycle providing strong pre-integration inhibition of HIV-1 infection
using a lentiviral vector that including a CCR5 shRNA, a chimeric human-macaqueTRIM5α restriction factor, and
a HIV TAR decoy. This strategy has been shown to prevent infection in vitro and in vivo, and 12 PWH requiring
autologous SCT for lymphoma have already received gene modified stem cells through AMC097. One participant
stopped ART outside study protocol following SCT and experienced post-treatment control. Whereas the primary
endpoints of the study are to evaluate the safety of such an approach, support is urgently needed to perform in-
depth HIV reservoir analyses and to implement assays to determine if gene modified cells become infected
following transplantation with or without analytical treatment interruption. We will: (1) test the hypothesis that
autologous SCT with gene modified stem cells simultaneously targeting different stages of the HIV-1 replication
cycle will lead to blood and gut tissue expansion and maintenance of a transduced CD4+ T and other immune
cells resistant to HIV-1 infection; (2) test the hypothesis that SCT with gene modified stem cells will reduce the
size of the HIV-1 reservoir and residual HIV-1 transcriptional activity, and lead to post-treatment HIV control
following withdrawal of ART, and (3) determine if gene modified cells become infected prior to and following
cessation of ART a novel duplexed single-cell-droplet (scdPCR) assay with the ability to simultaneously detect
cellular HIV-1 DNA or RNA and the integrated lentiviral vector or chimeric TRIM5α transcriptional activity."
10764940,"ABSTRACT
Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) slows disease progression, ART is a life-long therapy. Significantly, ART
is not curative. It does not eliminate reservoirs of replication-competent virus. Thus, when ART is discontinued,
HIV emerges from reservoirs and rapidly spreads, leading to disease progression towards AIDS. One strategy
for clearing these reservoirs of latently infected cells, the principal if not sole source of continued infection, is to
use a kick and kill approach, in which latent cells are “kicked” or activated from latency, allowing their subsequent
“killing” or clearance by viral cytopathic effects, immune effector cells or additional therapies targeted at HIV-
infected cells. To this end, we show proof-of-concept that a kick and kill strategy with uniquely effective latency
reversing agents (LRA) and NK cells remarkably targets the HIV reservoir in a humanized mouse model, leading
to a milestone of treatment interruption. Our next goal is to further enhance our kick and kill components to
eradicate all replication-competent reservoirs of virus present during ART. We will design, synthesize, and
investigate promising new compounds, the best kick components uncovered thus far, with the overall goal of
producing superior LRAs and synergistic strategies that efficiently and safely purge the latent HIV in vivo. LRAs
have been used to induce HIV expression from latent cells, but thus far have been limited by suboptimal efficacy,
tolerability issues, and/or biodistribution concerns. Here, we address these problems using new LRA concepts
and structures to improve efficacy, tolerability and control biodistribution. We investigate protein kinase C (PKC)
modulators, which are the most potent and efficacious LRAs reported thus far. Within this family we have
identified the best performers yet reported, inspired by bryostatin-1, prostratin and ingenol esters and new LRA
scaffolds of the ingenane, tigliane, and epoxy-tigliane families. We have found that the chemical conversion of
bryostatin-1 into a prodrug (slow-release) version results in a novel LRA with superior activity (60% v. 98%) and
significantly improved tolerability (20-fold increase in therapeutic window). Thus, our goal is to advance this study
of these new LRAs and chemically synthesized prodrugs using a highly collaborative team with expertise in novel
computer-based design, synthesis, medicinal chemistry, state-of-the-art in vitro assays, and sophisticated in vivo
animal modeling. To move this program toward clinical entry, optimal LRAs and prodrugs will be used in
conjunction with a “kill” approach (natural killer cells) in humanized mice latently infected with HIV to assess the
efficacy of the kick and kill strategy. We will accomplish our goals through the following Specific Aims: 1)
Evaluate in vitro and in vivo new generation latency reversal agents based on new LRA scaffolds and their
prodrugs, representing the most effective and best tolerated LRAs reported thus far, 2) Define and selectively
activate PKC isoforms that enhance HIV latency reversal and improve tolerability, and 3) Develop new
synergistic strategies to deplete the HIV reservoir. Collectively these studies will advance our unique and
superior preclinical LRAs towards clinical testing."
10894151,"Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most versatile nuclear medicine imaging modality.
In principle, it can image any radionuclide whose decay leads to photon emissions. There are more than 200
photon emitters with physics properties (half-life, photon energy and yield) appropriate for medical imaging using
SPECT. In large part due to instrumentation constraints, only 12 or so are used in medicine. We propose to
develop a SPECT system that will vastly expand the number of radionuclides that could be candidates for
medical imaging. Our CZT-based system will double the range of imageable photon energies; improve the
photon energy resolution and also the spatial resolution more than two-fold (1.5% vs 10% at 140 keV and 4 to 7
vs 10 to 15 mm respectively). The sensitivity will be increased more than 10-fold. Current SPECT imaging
technology does not meet the clinical demands of recent and potentially transformative advances in
radiopharmaceutical therapy, theranostics and precision medicine. These clinical advances require imaging that
is rigorously quantitative, has a high spatial resolution and can simultaneously image more than one radionuclide.
These capabilities must be offered at a fraction of current imaging times. We have chosen design specifications
for the device to meet the highly demanding imaging needs of radiopharmaceutical therapy with alpha-particle
emitters (αRPT). Alpha-emitters decay via a complex scheme that includes multiple daughters; the agents are
incredibly potent such that treatment is effective at sub GBq administered activity levels. Dosimetry and,
therefore quantitative accuracy at high spatial resolution is essential. We will build and characterize the “alpha-
SPECT” camera via the following specific aims: 1. Develop a large area 3-D CZT imaging-spectrometer that is
capable of providing an unprecedented energy resolution; this detector platform will be the basic building block
for alpha-SPECT. 2. Combine the CZT-based detection system with a synthetic compound-eye gamma camera
design to achieve a compact detection system with ultrahigh resolution over a wide field of view in a 45 cm
diameter ring. 3. Develop quantitative multi-isotope reconstruction methods that are tailored to the high
performance capability of Alpha-SPECT. 4. Evaluate system performance in phantoms and in large animal
preclinical studies. 5. Use the system for lesion and normal tissue dosimetry in metastatic prostate cancer
patients treated with Radium-223 (Xofigo). The proposal is founded on a partnership of unparalleled
instrumentation development capability (Dr. Meng), coupled with cutting-edge capability in implementing
advanced algorithms for multi-dimensional image generation (Drs. Frey and Du) that will be applied to the
dosimetry demands (Dr. Sgouros) of a new and promising treatment that delivers highly potent radiation to
disseminated cancer cells. Beyond the specific clinical scenario that is driving the proposed application, the
imaging instrumentation technology that will be implemented is a significant first step to building imaging
instrumentation that will serve much broader clinical needs in oncology and also in cardiology and neurology."

This proposal is to support the career development of Joseph Palatinus, MD, PhD, to become an
independent physician scientist with a focus on basic/translational research by targeting
protein trafficking as a means to prevent and treat arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
(SCD). The PI will have as a primary mentor Professor Robin Shaw, MD PhD, who is world
renowned expert in protein trafficking and cardiomyocyte biology. The comprehensive training
program is composed of laboratory-based research, coursework, workshops, grantsmanship
seminars, scientific conferences (local and international), and career guidance by a mentoring
committee. The committee includes the mentors and leverages the combined experience and
technical knowledge of 5 leading independent cardiovascular investigators at the Eccles
Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute at the University of Utah as well as Dr. Jeffery
Saffitz at Harvard Medical School, a world expert on Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The
research proposed will apply the alternatively translated isoform of Connexin 43 (Cx43),
dubbed GJA1-20k (and an established actin stabilizing protein), to the Desmoglein 2 (DSG2)
mutant model of ACM. Preliminary data has demonstrated disrupted actin organization in both
cellular and animal models of a DSG2 mutation which, in the heart is associated with a loss of
gap junction trafficking to the intercalated disk and downstream cardiac dysfunction. It is
hypothesized that GJA1-20k will lead to recovery of gap junction localization, suppression of
arrhythmias and prevention of SCD in the DSG2 mutant model of ACM by directly interacting
with and stabilizing cellular actin. Two specific aims are proposed: 1) Is actin dysregulation
responsible for the trafficking defects observed in the DSG2 mutant model? And 2) Does GJA1-
20k rescue the cardiomyopathic and arrhythmogenic phenotype of ACM and prevent SCD? High
resolution confocal microscopy, proximity ligation immunolabeling, electron microscopy, co-
immunoprecipitation, echocardiography, and in vivo telemetry monitoring are some of the
advanced techniques which will be used to develop a mechanistic understanding of actin
dependent trafficking mediated by GJA1-20k. The results from this study are expected to
develop a novel paradigm to treat and prevent arrhythmogenic SCD by targeting protein
trafficking."
10701417,"Arsenic is a widespread environmental toxicant contaminating the drinking water of over 100 million
individuals globally. Importantly, veterans experience additional exposures from their service, including
historical chemical weapons use, contaminated military bases, ordinance disposal, burn pits, oil fires, and the
extensive use of arsenic-based pesticides (Agent Blue) in Vietnam. Arsenic is associated with multiple
conditions enriched in the veteran population, including neurocognitive disorders like anxiety,
depression, and PTSD; however, the full impact of arsenic exposure on veterans’ health remains grossly
underappreciated. Thus, understanding the links between arsenic and veterans’ health as well as the
mechanisms by which arsenic promotes disease development may illuminate novel therapeutic approaches to
reduce the considerable burden of mental health disorders among America’s veterans. Our data indicate that
one mechanism of arsenic-induced neurocognitive dysfunction is via depletion of brain
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential fatty acid critical for normal brain development and function.
Indeed, arsenic exposure and low DHA consumption are both independently associated with
neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, mechanistic studies show that arsenic and DHA exert opposing
actions on multiple pathways regulating neurocognitive function. Because of DHA’s central role in neuronal
health, approaches for enhancing brain DHA levels are needed; however, traditional DHA supplements fail
to deliver DHA across the blood brain barrier (BBB). In contrast, our novel DHA delivery approach using
lysophosphatidylcholine-linked DHA (LPC-DHA) exploits a unique transporter at the BBB (Mfsd2a),
allowing for brain DHA enrichment and improvements in neurocognition. Whether LPC-DHA can address
arsenic neurotoxicity arising from military service is unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a mouse model to
characterize the impact of military-associated arsenic exposure on neurocognitive function across domains
of learning/memory and anxiety/depression, with a focus on behaviors regulated by the amygdala,
hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. We will also examine critical mechanisms of arsenic neurotoxicity.
Finally, we will assess the capacity of LPC-DHA to rescue arsenic-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.
Evidence for such rescue would suggest that LPC-DHA may be a novel treatment for mitigating historical
arsenic exposure, such as among Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Blue. Better than treatment, however,
would be prevention. Since serving in combat areas increases exposures to multiple environmental toxicants
that induce oxidative stress and may adversely affect mental health through brain DHA depletion, it is critical to
know whether service members can be protected from the adverse effects of these exposures. In Specific
Aim 2, we will interrogate the supposition that LPC-DHA supplementation during exposure prevents arsenic-
induced neurocognitive dysfunction, while characterizing the mechanistic pathways amenable to protection.
Evidence of such protection would suggest that LPC-DHA may be a nutraceutical with neuroprotectant effects
worth deploying with troops to protect their long-term neurological health. Collectively, these studies will
illuminate the neurocognitive consequences of arsenic exposure, clarify arsenic’s underlying
mechanisms of neurotoxicity, and provide new insights into intervention strategies to reduce the
devastating impact of this common environmental toxicant on veterans’ health."
10701419,"The broad objective of this proposal is to investigate the brain-region-specific role of the neuronal gap-
junction protein, connexin 36 (Cx36), in the regulation of sleep-wake behavioral state- and stimulus-specific
cortical oscillations. Gap junction coupling leads to the formation of electrical synapses which promote
neuronal synchronization; influencing network-wide oscillations which are likely involved in sensory and
cognitive functions. Aberrant oscillatory activity and network connectivity underlie a wide range of sleep
disorders, and neurological/neuropsychiatric disorders. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a key
component of cortico-thalamic circuitry and is critical for regulation of cortical oscillatory activity associated with
sleep/wake state and sensory processing. GABAergic neurons of the TRN work in concert to control the
activity of thalamic relay neurons, influencing cortical oscillatory activity. A key feature of the TRN is that local
inter-neuronal communication occurs exclusively via Cx36 containing electrical synapses. While the functional
contributions of various receptors and ion channels in TRN have been widely studied in association with its role
in thalamocortical activity, the role of electrical synapses and gap junction proteins is underexplored. Our
preliminary findings along with prior studies have shown that disruption of Cx36 globally can impair the
synchronization of neural rhythms. However, the role of Cx36 electrical synapses specifically in the TRN has
yet to be examined. The TRN regulates cortical oscillatory activity in delta (0.5-4 Hz), sigma (10-15 Hz; sleep
spindles) range during sleep, and gamma (30-80 Hz) during wakefulness and wake-associated sensory
processes. Therefore, investigating the importance of Cx36 within TRN is key towards understanding how the
TRN neurons communicate locally to coordinate modulation of distal cortical oscillatory activity. Here we
propose to test the hypothesis that the TRN electrical synapses containing Cx36 are essential for modulation
of cortical network dynamics. Towards this goal, we propose to use the state-of-the-art, highly efficient gene
editing technique, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) - and its associated
protein - Cas9, to knockdown the Cx36 protein, in vivo, specifically in parvalbumin positive neurons of the TRN.
Utilizing this model, we will examine the role of the TRN-specific Cx36 expression on 1) cortical oscillatory
activity associated with sleep and wakefulness, and 2) regulation of sensory processing via alteration of
functional connectivity between first order and higher order regions of the cortex. 3) Finally, we will rescue the
deficits caused by Cx36KO by reintroducing Cx36 gene in parvalbumin neurons of the TRN. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the TRN- a uniquely composed brain structure and
GABAergic nucleus where gap-junction proteins are predominantly responsible for inter-neuronal
communications, and its overall influence in sleep- wake and the homeostatic sleep-associated as well as task-
evoked cortical oscillations."
10911260,"Project Summary/Abstract
What produces individual differences in behavior? This fundamental question has classically been given two
answers: nature and nurture. Here, we suggest that those two answers, while both critical and correct, are
insufficient to fully explain individual variability. Instead, we propose that the vast differences in behavior
between individuals arise in part from different individuals forming different reward associations within the
same environment. This results from the fact that the world is complex and high-dimensional, in that there are
almost always multiple possible actions or events that could be attributed to reward. Given the key role of
dopamine neurons as the brain’s positive feedback system for behavioral control, the specific hypothesis is that
small differences across individuals in initial conditions ultimately produce large differences in which features of
the environment that the individual attributes to reward. This hypothesis is inspired in part by complex systems
theory, which emphasizes the role of positive feedback in generating and amplifying small differences, creating
outcomes that seem stochastic. To address this hypothesis, we will leverage our recent finding that different
dopamine neurons calculate reward prediction error across different dimensions of the environment.
Specifically, we will use dopamine neuron recordings to infer the time-varying features of the environment that
each animal uses to predict reward, and then build reinforcement learning models of each individual based on
these features. Ultimately, this testable framework aims to explain both normal variation across individuals, as
well as the ubiquitous contribution of dopamine in mediating a disparate range of neuropsychiatric diseases."
10813056,"The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is largely unknown. Preclinical and epidemiological studies provide a
strong link between old age, prior exposure to pesticides and the increased risk of developing Parkinson's
disease. This is of particular relevance to the VA because military personnel are often exposed to environmental
toxins, including pesticides, during deployment. Moreover, the veteran population is older than the U.S.
population and thus at increased risk. Recent evidence supports a role for elevated biogenic aldehydes in PD.
The work proposed will not only help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, but it will
determine whether agents that lower biogenic aldehydes may be neuroprotective in Parkinson's disease. The
test agent and potential alternatives are FDA-approved drugs for which there is abundant information on their
safety and efficacy. Therefore, if these preclinical studies show efficacy in models of PD, then they may be more
easily tested clinically."
10702105,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors; however,
the mechanisms by which these factors mediate disease risk remain incompletely defined. We recently
elucidated a putative molecular mechanism for one of the few SLE risk loci that confers risk across all ancestral
population groups examined. We fine-mapped the putative casual variant, rs2431697 and applied genome-
editing approaches to demonstrate that this locus encodes an enhancer of MIR146A gene expression. Initial
data suggested that this enhancer mediates SLE risk through its effects on type I interferon signaling, a pathway
known to be dysregulated in SLE. However, follow up data reveal that despite in vitro effects on type I interferon
production in myeloid cells, this risk variant does not impact serum type I Interferon activity in vivo in several
large SLE cohorts. Interim observations suggest a plausible mechanism. First, rs2431697 is an expression
quantitative trait locus eQTL for MIR146A in B cells. Second, the transcription factor, BHLHE40, exhibits allele-
dependent physical interaction with the SLE risk variant in B cells. Third, our data highlight a role for both genes
in B cell anergy, the usual mechanism of autoreactive B-cell tolerance to self-antigens. Together, these
observations prompt our hypothesis. We hypothesize that the SLE risk enhancer at the MIR146A locus confers
risk in SLE by modulating the development of B cell anergy. This hypothesis links the genetics of SLE with
ongoing work by Dr. Harley during his rheumatology fellowship to develop novel tools to understand human B-
cell anergy. Thus, we propose the following Aims.
 Aim 1) define the cellular locus of MIR146A dysregulation in vivo. To do this we will define whether
the molecular correlates of our hypothesized model are present in diverse immune cell populations from healthy
individuals and those with SLE analyzed immediately ex vivo or whether alternative models better explain how
variation at this locus impacts SLE risk. We will apply a combination of RNA-Flow cytometry and spectral flow
cytometric peripheral blood immunophenotyping with genetic analysis to determine whether the molecular
correlates of our hypothesized model are present in B-cells ex vivo as predicted.
 Aim 2) [define the functional relationship between BHLHE40 and MIR146A in B cell anergy. We
will determine whether MIR146A expression regulates autoreactive B-cell tolerance ex vivo in primary cells (Aim
2a), in vitro in cell lines (Aim 2b) and in vivo in mice (Aim 2c).]
 Aim 3) define whether global down regulation of microRNA metabolism occurs in anergic B cells.
Experiments in T-cells indicate that most microRNAs undergo decay downstream of acute T-cell antigen receptor
stimulus. Since chronic B-cell antigen receptor signaling is a major mechanism of autoreactive B-cell tolerance,
global microRNA decay may enforce tolerance. To interpret our MIR146A results in this broader context, we
must determine whether this is true. Doing so will also advance training goals for Dr. Harley’s career.
 The concept that the MIR146A SLE risk enhancer might impact SLE risk through regulation of B cell
anergy and the other aspects of our model are highly innovative and have never before been experimentally
demonstrated. Results from this proposal would provide strong rationale and inform planned efforts to develop
MIR146A directed therapies, offering the prospect of improving outcomes for patients with SLE. SLE is a disease
that both more commonly and more severely afflicts individuals within several demographic groups (women,
African American & Hispanic individuals) that are projected by the VetPop 2018 project to increase as a
proportion of the VA population in the coming decades. Since current SLE therapies inappropriately balance
immunosuppression and immunopathology, they result in substantial morbidity & mortality. By understanding
the mechanisms of SLE genetic risk factors and developing therapeutic approaches informed by this mechanistic
understanding, we aim to improve care for this growing population of Veterans."
10807079,"In South Africa (SA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is managed within primary care clinics (PCCs), where
nurses treat drug-susceptible TB and TB/HIV coinfection with treatment outcomes rivaling the best in the world.
A PCC management strategy offers a more convenient, patient-centered, differentiated model of care that
integrates TB and HIV treatment within the same setting. A diagnosis of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB),
however, upends this model, requiring referral to a hospital-based, physician-led outpatient treatment center.
Hospital-based, physician-led models add significant patient-associated costs, with estimates suggesting 81% of
RR-TB patients experience catastrophic costs even in a decentralized outpatient model. There is hope, however,
to move RR-TB care into PCCs and in many settings this involves nurse-led management. The BringBPaL2Me
Trial is a multi-principal investigator, multi-site, cluster randomized, non-inferiority trial (CR-NIT), to compare
nurse-led RR-TB treatment in PCCs to standard of care physician-led RR-TB treatment at district hospitals in
the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Gauteng (GP) and Eastern Cape (EC), SA. Clusters include 10 PCCs
affiliated with 5 decentralized outpatient programs at RR-TB district hospitals (n=50 clusters). We estimate the
need to screen 3,800 RR-TB positive patients to enroll 2,944, or 64 RR-TB participants per PCC cluster. We
estimate 60-70% will be HIV co-infected. The interclass correlation is 0.024 based on our prior CRT enrolling
3,000 patients in KZN and EC. The non-inferiority margin is set at 5% with the assumption of 90% treatment
success in the physician-led arm. Treatment will include either a 6-month RR-TB regimen (i.e., bedaquiline,
pretomanid, linezolid and moxifloxacin, or BPaLM) or fluroquinolone-resistant TB (i.e., BPaL) regimen. The
BringBPaL2Me primary aim is to conduct a 5-year, analyst and clinical safety review committee blinded, multi-
site, CR-NIT to evaluate 1) treatment outcome; 2) safety; and 3) patient associated catastrophic costs with the
following hypotheses: 1) Outpatient nurse-led treatment in PCCs will be non-inferior to outpatient physician-led
treatment at hospital-based outpatient sites among RR-TB patients, regardless of HIV co-infection, as
determined by a successful treatment outcome [H1]; 2) The proportion of severe adverse events (SAEs) identified
will not significantly differ by blinded, independent review [H2]; 3) Patient associated catastrophic costs (i.e.,
costs 20% or more of household income) will be lower in nurse-led treatment [H3]. Our secondary aims include:
1) time to event analysis for a) RR-TB treatment initiation; b) smear/culture conversion; and, as applicable, c)
HIV treatment initiation; d) HIV viral suppression; and e) AE and SAE symptom resolution; 2) characterization
of provider adherence to guidelines for: a) dosing requirements; b) RR-TB dosing changes based on AE and SAE
events; and c) AE and SAE adjuvant medication management strategy; 3) programmatic cost-effectiveness
evaluation of PCC management. Bring BPaL2Me has strong multi-PI collaborations with support from the
national/provincial department of health teams and a rigorous design to evaluate effectiveness, safety and costs."

10832685,"ABSTRACT
Florida has the highest incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections in the US, with marked
social and racial disparities. About 40% of people with HIV in Florida do not reach undetectable viral load, and
Black African Americans are the most affected. Besides well-known sociodemographic factors contributing to
unfavorable outcomes and disparities, part of such remains unexplained and cannot be actioned upon. Advances
in artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing availability of large real-world data (RWD) databases, e.g., electronic
health records (EHRs) and administrative claims data, are ideal for developing models for precision health.
However, the full capabilities of AI are still hampered by the fact that EHRs are not well integrated with other
relevant data sources, containing information on social and behavioral determinants of health (SDoH), especially
important for HIV care access and outcomes. Further, a strong determinant of HIV outcomes is stigma, which is
not captured in structured fields of EHRs, but can be identified in clinical notes via natural language processing.
In fact, many other contextual- and individual-level SDoH can be extracted from clinical narratives in EHRs.
Another critical problem with AI built on RWD is that, due to inherent bias in observational data like EHRs, the
AI models might identify wrong effects for interventions. Thus, alternative predictions (i.e., counterfactuals) of
naïve AI systems might be mistaken, potentially leading to harm. Causal inference methods are being
increasingly coupled with AI to address such bias. The overarching goal of this project is to develop “AI-CARE-
HIV,” an actionable counterfactual RWD AI framework to improve HIV outcomes in Florida, in particular
reducing disparity through addressing SDoH. We hypothesize that a portion of the unexplained systemic
disparity can be elucidated by combining causal inference and AI models that exploit complex interactions
between individual- and contextual-level SDoH. This framework can then be used to develop an unbiased (under
certain assumptions), actionable model usable for planning and implementing clinical and public health
interventions. We will develop the project through the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium, which collates
RWD data from >16.8M Floridians, and specifically the OneFlorida+ HIV cohort (now N=71,363). Our project
aims to: (1) Enhance the cohort by incorporating large-scale SDoH (9,000+) and prospectively validate new
SDoH, including stigma, using NLP; (2) Create polysocial risk scores from SDoH, identify population-level causal
effects of SDOH-conditioned interventions on to HIV outcomes, and develop individualized counterfactual AI
models for HIV outcomes, calibrated to reduce disparity; (3) Plan –with healthcare providers, State officials,
citizen scientists– targeted clinical and public health interventions anchored on our counterfactual AI models,
using implementation science, standardized protocols (e.g., CONSORT-AI). Our team includes multidisciplinary
(methodological, clinical, qualitative) expertise supported by OneFlorida+, Fl Dept of Health, and minority-
serving entities. We expect impact at multiple levels, from infrastructure enhancement to public health benefit."
10821495,"ABSTRACT
The life expectancy of people with HIV (PWH) in the U.S is increasing. HIV, together with normal aging,
imposes additional challenges to an extended healthspan (i.e., the length of time that the person is
healthy and not just alive) in this population. This includes an earlier occurrence of geriatric conditions
such as sarcopenia, a musculoskeletal disease that can lead to falls, morbidity, loss of independence,
disability, and mortality. Sarcopenia poses a significant economic burden, generating higher healthcare costs
and more extended hospital stays for the sarcopenic population. Sarcopenia is highly prevalent (24%) among
PWH, and we recently demonstrated that PWH are six times more likely to develop sarcopenia than people
without HIV. Despite being prevalent among this population, few observational studies in PWH have
included sarcopenia as a primary outcome, and we lack interventional studies targeting sarcopenia
among PWH. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial, and despite being recognized as a debilitating
disease, it has no effective pharmacological treatment. In the general population, physical inactivity and
malnutrition are recognized contributors to sarcopenia, and exercise and diet interventions are the best ways
to prevent and treat it. Among PWH, the causes of sarcopenia can include different HIV-associated factors.
Lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, and malnutrition are prevalent
among PWH and can potentially contribute to sarcopenia in this population. However, these
associations in HIV remain poorly explored, and whether these are the primary contributors to sarcopenia
among PWH is unknown. This proposed study is uniquely positioned to address such gaps in the science by
leveraging the ongoing multi-site PROSPER-HIV study (R01-NR-018391) focused on the association
between physical activity, diet, and HIV symptoms in PWH by adding a whole-body dual-energy X‐ray
absorptiometry scan. This will provide data on the amount of lean body mass and allow us to rigorously
determine the presence of sarcopenia among PWH. The PROSPER-HIV study provides an ideal opportunity
to explore the importance of these modifiable lifestyle behaviors on the healthspan of PWH and to answer
how physical activity and diet can help in the multifactorial development and management of sarcopenia.
Specifically, in 130 PWH ≥50 years of age, we will: 1) Examine the cross-sectional relationship between
modifiable lifestyle factors (i.e., habitual physical activity levels and diet quality) and the presence of
sarcopenia; and 2) Investigate to what extent current or prior exposures (i.e., symptom burden; medication
adherence; smoking, alcohol, and drug use; the presence of depression and anxiety; clinical and
demographic characteristics) predicts sarcopenia. Our scientific premise is that, on top of other factors
leading to HIV-associated sarcopenia, lifestyle factors play an essential role and can be harnesseed as a
non-pharmacologic strategy to reduce the prevalence of this debilitating comorbidity among PWH."
10909966,"Abstract/Project Summary
Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus, which causes Kaposi
sarcoma (KS) as well as B cell lymphoproliferative disorders in the absence of adequate immune control. KSHV-
associated tumors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant patients and individuals with HIV-
disease. The oral cavity is an important site for KSHV biology because saliva is believed to be the primary mode of
person-to-person transmission for the virus. The tonsil and other oral lymphoid tissues represent a logical
anatomical site for early infection events because they are in contact with saliva and are rich in target cell types for
KSHV infection including endothelial cells and B lymphocytes. Despite this, the biology of KSHV in the human tonsil
remains poorly understood. We have developed an extensive library of human tonsil specimens and a robust ex
vivo infection model KSHV in tonsil-derived lymphocytes. Using these tools, we have recently discovered that
mature plasma cells are highly targeted early in KSHV infection and that KSHV-infected plasma cells display a
mixture of latent and lytic infection cycles. The current proposal will test several hypotheses: (1) plasma cell infection
serves as an amplification step which is important for the overall establishment of infection in tonsil lymphocytes,
(2) the KSHV-encoded cytokine vIL-6 is critical for establishment of KSHV infection in lymphocytes via manipulation
of plasma cell biology and (3) the T cell-derived cellular cytokine IL-21 supports KSHV dissemination by driving
differentiation of plasma cells, and can partially replace the function of vIL-6 in early infection. The results of this
research will provide critical mechanistic details that will enhance our understanding of early events in KSHV
transmission and the establishment of KSHV infection in the lymphocyte compartment."
10887587,"The Cellular Networks in Cancer (CNC) Program is a scientifically rich, collaborative, and productive research
program co-led by Melanie Cobb, PhD, and Ralph DeBerardinis, MD, PhD. The vision of the CNC Program is
to advance the fundamental knowledge of both intercellular and intracellular networks that contribute to cancer
initiation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis, then to translate these findings into novel approaches to cancer
prevention and therapy. CNC’s overarching scientific goal is to promote discoveries in how perturbation in these
cellular networks contribute to altered tissue physiology and promote cancer. The CNC Program provides a
highly interactive research environment that capitalizes on the UT Southwestern Medical Center’s (UTSW)
longstanding tradition of basic science discoveries and fosters translation of these discoveries into the
development of new biomarkers, diagnostic technologies, and therapeutic interventions in clinical oncology-
especially malignancies relevant to the SCCC catchment area (e.g., cancer of the lung and kidney). The
program’s structure is purposefully designed to stimulate interdisciplinary intra- and interprogrammatic
collaborations with the objective of delivering transformative discoveries. To accomplish this, the Co-Leaders
established four vibrant and synergistic subprograms that deliberately align with the strengths of program
members and specifically relate to states of perturbed tissue homeostasis in cancer: (1) Signaling and Cell
Biology, (2) Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, (3) Immunobiology, and (4) Metabolism. Each subprogram is
directed by an investigator who is highly respected for his or her science, mentoring, and collaborative spirit. The
subprogram structure and activities have directly contributed to exciting new collaborative projects such as the
SPORE in Kidney Cancer. The CNC Program is composed of 59 basic, computational, and physician-scientists
from 19 departments and centers at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Seven members of the CNC are Howard
Hughes Medical Institute investigators. Annual direct peer-reviewed funding to the CNC Program was $19.3M
in 2019. This represents an increase of $3.8M as compared with 2014 data, which were adjusted to conform to
revised NCI guidelines. NCI funding has likewise increased from $3M in 2014 to $3.9M in 2019. Program
members have authored 750 publications since 2014: 14% represent intraprogrammatic work, 34% are
interprogrammatic collaborations, 32% are inter-institutional, and 37% are in journals with an impact factor ≥ 10.
CNC Program members are heavily reliant upon all six CCSG Shared Resources—especially Live Cell Imaging
and Tissue Management—in furtherance of their scientific goals. The CNC Program’s success is supported by
SCCC’s strong infrastructure and grounded in the program’s solid interactions among CNC members and the
subprograms, as well as with other SCCC Research Program members and external collaborators."
10887590,"The interdisciplinary Chemistry and Cancer (CC) Program is uniquely situated in Simmons Comprehensive 
Cancer Center (SCCC) to bridge fundamental biology research with the discovery of novel therapies for the 
treatment of cancer. CC has facilitated numerous intraprogrammatic and interprogrammatic collaborations, 
which have resulted in new insights into cancer biology and drug discovery of high clinical applicability. CC 
combines the expertise of synthetic and medicinal chemists, molecular and structural biologists, biochemists, 
chemical biologists, pharmacologists, and clinician scientists to discover, design, and optimize drug-like small 
molecules that regulate biological pathways deregulated in cancer. CC’s discovery platform is guided by the 
hypothesis that an interdisciplinary and chemically focused approach to cancer biology will provide new avenues 
for discovery in cancer prevention and treatment. The CC Program is co-led by Jef De Brabander, PhD, and 
Uttam Tambar, PhD, and is composed of 22 members who are drawn from seven departments on campus. The 
CC Scientific Program is defined by three specific aims: (1) Identification of Molecular Targets of Novel Anti- 
Cancer Agents, (2) Biochemical Dissection of Regulatory Pathways Relevant to Human Cancer, and (3) 
Structure-Based Design of Chemicals that Perturb Cancer-Relevant Signaling Pathways. 
The CC Program focuses on acceleration of the continued translation of chemical discoveries made at the UT 
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and SCCC to the clinic, the initiation of early-stage translational studies, 
and the licensing of mid- to late-stage preclinical studies. The CC Program will continue to prioritize research 
programs that impact cancers that are prevalent in the SCCC catchment area, such as colorectal, lung, kidney, 
and liver cancers. In addition, the CC Program will promote interprogrammatic and intraprogrammatic 
collaborations and explore new projects in the three specific aims. 
Total direct peer-reviewed funding to the CC Program is $5.2M, with $2.6M (51%) from the NCI. CC Program

40% interprogrammatic, and 36% were in journals with impact factors ≥ 10."
10887594,"The Development and Cancer (DC) Program at Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) is a
multidisciplinary program co-led by Joshua Mendell, MD, PhD, and Stephen Skapek, MD. The DC Program
includes 41 basic, computational, and physician scientists from 18 departments and centers at UT Southwestern
Medical Center (UTSW). The DC Program is unique among SCCC programs in that its members investigate the
developmentally and evolutionarily conserved processes that are fundamental to cancer cell growth, division,
and differentiation. DC investigators also study the organ and organism growth and developmental processes
that are derailed in human cancer. DC Program members pursue four major aims to cover the diversity at the
developmental and cancer biology interface: (1) Systematic analyses of stem cell biology and regeneration, (2)
Exploring gene expression and cell fate, (3) Studies of cell differentiation and organogenesis, and (4) Analyzing
cell–cell and cell–stroma interactions. DC Program Leaders promote utilization of the complete spectrum of
resources from SCCC and the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) to provide a research environment that
stimulates scientific interactions between laboratory-based investigators and translational and clinical
researchers. As a result, DC Program members have fully participated in Kidney and Liver SPORE projects, NCI
and CPRIT multi-investigator research awards, and exploration of topics with high potential for clinical translation.
Many of these efforts are beginning to reach cancer patients, including those with lung and liver cancer and other
malignancies that are particularly prevalent in the SCCC catchment area. Total direct peer-reviewed funding to
the DC Program is $16.5M, with 29% from NCI. This represents an increase of $4.5M in peer-reviewed funding
compared with 2014 data, which were adjusted to conform to new NCI guidelines. Since 2014, DC Program
members have authored 552 publications: 16% represent intraprogrammatic work, 47% are interprogrammatic
collaborations, and 30% are in journals with an impact factor >10. DC Program members benefit from the use of
all six of the Cancer Center Shared Resources, especially Live Cell Imaging, Small Animal Imaging, and Tissue
Management. To foster collaborations, the DC Program holds a large annual retreat, leads relevant campuswide
seminar series, and organizes theme-focused research retreats. In addition, DC Program members received
$1.5M in pilot project funding during the last grant cycle; those funds have helped to catalyze collaborations and
research at the development and cancer biology interface. The program is highly invested in unraveling the
fundamental elements of cancer biology in a manner that can ultimately improve the care provided to patients
with cancer."

The Administrative Core (AC) led by MPIs Dong and Wu, with more than 10 years of successful collaboration,
will play a central role in organizing, integrating, and managing multi-institution resources to maximize the overall
productivity of our proposed Rutgers-NYU Center for Asian Health Promotion and Equity (CAHPE). This AC
includes: Recognized experts and leaders in health disparity, intervention, prevention, cardiometabolic, and
mental health research across Asian populations with strong records in productivity, leadership, and mentorship;
2) Significant resources through Rutgers/NYU/Hunter CUNY; 3) A well-designed team science infrastructure to
support Pilot and Center Research Project investigators; 4) Strong and broad connections to practice and policy
and the community, state, and national levels. The AC leaders Drs. Dong and Wu, along with the assembled co-
investigators, executive committee, external advisory committee, and community advisory board have extensive
experience successfully conducting health equity translational research on prevention, treatment, and
management of cardiometabolic and mental health disease outcomes among Asian populations through a
cultural lens, as do other members of the center faculty. Resources and support will come from substantial
institution-wide infrastructure that will provide steadfast support in accomplishing our CAHPE mission.
 The AC will establish mechanisms and infrastructure that promote community, interaction, and integration
to allow Pilot and Center Research Project investigators to work synergistically on their projects. The AC will also
ensure that Pilot and Center Research Project investigators have full access to the time and experience of the
transdisciplinary core faculty, both individually and in group settings across Rutgers/NYU. The AC will collaborate
with the Executive Committee, External Advisory Committee, and Community Steering Committee to integrate
the interdisciplinary research through the perspective of academic, community, state, and national leadership.
The AC will provide strong leadership along with the infrastructure and administrative support needed to
orchestrate the Investigator Development Core, Community Engagement Core, and 3 Research Projects into an
integrated center and take advantage of the rich environments at Rutgers and NYU. AC specific aims are: 1)
Oversee all Center for Asian Health Promotion and Equity activities, ensure effective implementation and fiscal
administration and create and sustain mechanisms; 2) Maximize and coordinate use of resources and provide
mechanisms for interactions and data harmonization between Pilot and Center Research Project investigators,
researchers, and colleagues across Rutgers, NYU, the P50 Coordinating Center, and NIMHD Centers; 3)
Provide oversight and support to enhance the success of the Pilot program and track and evaluate investigators;
and 4) Provide systematic, objective, and formal evaluation of each core and the Center as a whole using
established benchmarks and regular feedback about Center activities in order to iteratively improve the Rutgers-
NYU Center for Asian Health Promotion and Equity."
10887602,"The Population Science and Cancer Control (PS) Program seeks to generate research discoveries addressing
cancer burden and disparities in the Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center’s (SCCC) North Texas catchment

departments in the Dallas Regional Campus of the UT School of Public Health. Investigators recruited and
appointed to the faculty since 2014 include experts in biostatistics, data science, epidemiology, geospatial
science, health services research, social psychology, and tobacco control. The PS Program’s funding base is
on an upward trend, with a current total funding base of $5.9M, which is predicted to accelerate due to key new
recruitments into the program. Of the total amount, 98% ($5.8M) is peer-reviewed, with $3.1M from the NCI. The
PS Program’s total research funding base represents an increase of 9% compared with 2014 data, which have
been adjusted to conform with the revised Cancer Center Support Grant guidelines. Not included in the 2019

sophisticated data collection infrastructure is essential in supporting the projects associated with PROSPR and
the thrust of its cooperative effort to increase our understanding of healthcare system, provider, and individual-
level factors that affect the quality of cancer screening and SCCC’s focus on underserved populations. The PS
Program has become adept at conducting hypothesis-driven research, often through large pragmatic trial
designs, to advance care delivery in cancer prevention and control. Since 2014, PS Program members have

10915538,"Investigator Development Core – Abstract
The goal of the Rutgers-NYU CAHPE Investigator Development Core (IDC) (MPI: Dong & Simon, with 20 years
of successful collaboration), is to support and increase the expertise of interdisciplinary scientists, including those
from underrepresented backgrounds, to prepare them to conduct innovative and impactful health equity
intervention, prevention, and management research on cardiometabolic and mental health outcomes among
Asian Americans. The Center in conduction with the IDC will provide an enriched environment that develops pilot
projects, strategies, and investigators who: 1) understand multi-level and multi-domain determinants of comorbid
cardiometabolic and mental health outcomes among US Asians; 2) integrate community partners and
perspectives utilizing principles of Community-Partnered Participatory Research into study design and
implementation; and 3) conduct translational research to improve health and wellbeing among Asian adults and
optimize cardiometabolic and mental health and disease prevention, treatment and management.
 To achieve this goal, the IDC will be fully coordinated with the Administrative Core and Community
Engagement Core to accomplish these aims: 1) Build research and mentorship capacity of a diverse group of
P50 Pilot Investigators focused on intervention research regarding cardiometabolic and mental health among
US Asians and expand collaborative efforts with established research scientists, with emphasis on content,
methods, and relevant supporting theoretical frameworks; 2) Support our Pilot Investigators in a nurturing,
interdisciplinary environment that encourages scholarly development, including presentations, publications, and
larger grant applications to leverage their pilot project experience and further develop pathways for
interdisciplinary implementation of effective strategies to address cardiometabolic and mental health outcomes;
3) Create a pilot funding mechanism to solicit, review and select 6 Pilot Projects per year to conduct
cardiometabolic and mental health translational research; and 4) Track and evaluate success of Pilot
Investigators using an iterative, user friendly, and longitudinal evaluation process designed to continuously
improve the Rutgers-NYU CAHPE infrastructure and support; foster development of a strong pipeline of new
pilots and successful pilot investigators throughout the funding period. Leveraging decades of collaboration
between MPIs Dong and Simon on building research infrastructure, we will utilize a lessons-learned approach
to synergistically facilitate the IDC with existing infrastructures for pilot investigator development. In this
application, we (PIs Dong and Simon) aim to support interdisciplinary research infrastructure and research
pipeline, harmonize resources to further translational research to improve cardiometabolic and mental health
outcomes among Asian adults, and promote adoption of research findings into practice in large, community-
based, and clinical settings serving Asian populations."

large geographic area (~9,300 sq. miles) that is mainly urban, with only 50 of 1,324 census tracts being rural.
DFW is a majority-minority population (29% Hispanic, 43% Non-Hispanic [NH] White, 17% NH Black, 7% NH

2018 under the leadership of Associate Director Jasmin Tiro, PhD, MPH. Tiro coordinates and cultivates
transdisciplinary research and outreach initiatives that facilitate bidirectional communication and promote cancer
equity in SCCC’s catchment. Based on review of its catchment area cancer burden, SCCC has prioritized and
facilitated research focused on lung, hepatocellular, colorectal, and kidney cancers, as these either have the
highest prevalence, increasing incidence, and/or documented disparities in outcomes. The SCCC catchment
area also has one of the highest uninsured rates (21% vs. 10%) in the U.S.; thus, the COEE has built their
outreach programs around providing access to and patient navigation for evidence-based screening and
diagnostic services (breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers) and cancer prevention behaviors (HPV
vaccination, tobacco cessation, and hepatitis C screening/treatment). Through bidirectional engagement with
stakeholders via a Community Advisory Board and a Patient/Family Advisory Council, the COEE gathers input
from patients, caregivers, safety-net healthcare systems, community organizations, and public health agencies
on needs and priorities for research and works with SCCC research programs and local partners to design
community initiatives. SCCC’s COEE Specific Aims are to: (1) assess cancer burden in the catchment area to

relevant research via internal and external stakeholder engagement, (3) implement outreach programs guided
by stakeholder input and aligned with guidelines for cancer prevention and control, and (4) monitor impact of
research and outreach programs. In addition, synergistic Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas
(CPRIT)-funded community partnerships have enhanced COEE’s reach beyond the SCCC’s 13-county
catchment. Moving forward, COEE has led strategic planning around: (1) enhancing research initiatives in breast
and prostate cancer, (2) improving minority accrual to clinical trials via Parkland Health, a safety-net system
partner, and (3) expanding the reach of a redesigned tobacco counseling and lung screening program. Through
a systematic approach and clear evaluation model, SCCC will ensure that research discoveries address
catchment needs and are designed for implementation and dissemination by community providers and
healthcare systems, thus creating sustainable positive impact on the SCCC catchment area and beyond."
10915544,"Community Engagement Core – Abstract
Infusing principles of Community-Partnered Participatory Research, the primary goals of the Rutgers-NYU
Center for Asian Health Promotion and Equity Community Engagement Core (CEC) are to: 1) organize and
nurture academic-community partnerships focusing on Asian Adults; 2) facilitate the recruitment and retention of
diverse Asian adults into intervention research on cardiometabolic and mental health research; 3) and build a
reciprocal and sustainable community-partnered infrastructure in order to bridge knowledge gaps and
disseminate evidence-based best practices at community, state and national levels to inform practice and policy.
New Jersey and New York are the ideal setting for an Asian-focused center on health equity intervention
research, as it has one of the most diverse and densely populated Asian Populations in the US. Our P50 Center
and the CEC led by MPIs Gaur (Rutgers), Ea (NYU), and Chan (Hunter) are founded on decades of our
assembled investigators’ deep engagement and research with a wide range of Asian populations and will create
the essential infrastructure to catalyze an increase in the much-needed research and scientific workforce
development necessary to reduce disparities among and improve the health of Asian populations.
 To accomplish this, we propose a multi-level strategy that optimizes recruitment, retention, and
dissemination through the following specific aims: 1) Leveraging Community-Partnered Participatory Research
(CPPR) and communication theories to systematically prepare Rutgers-NYU CAHPE to engage and
communicate effectively; 2) Build a sustainable and collaborative community steering committee (CSC)
connecting community and academic institutions for community-partnered, action-oriented health promotion
research in Asian adult populations; 3) Expand community-partnered research capacity amongst faculty and
Asian community members through culturally appropriate, community-tailored, reciprocal education and training
in biomedical and behavioral research to fully understand the health needs and barriers, challenges, socio-
cultural context of conducting research in and with Asian communities; 4) Facilitate the recruitment and retention
of Asian adults, through culturally and linguistically appropriate research literacy support tool; and 5) Translate
the research findings of the pilot and center projects at community, state, regional and national levels to inform
practice and policy in coordination with other CAHPE cores and with National NIH Centers and other Asian
population research centers. Through these systematic approaches and based on our deep community and
ethnographic experiences over the last decade, our Rutgers-NYU CAHPE will begin to fill the dire gap in
translational research, implementation and dissemination focused on chronic comorbid conditions amongst U.S.
Asians."

developmental funds to invest in specific efforts that support the research goals of the Center’s overall strategic
plan. During the current project period, a total of $590,000 of CCSG developmental funds was distributed for
pilot funding in support of 23 research projects, and to date these investments have already yielded a $16M
return on investment. More importantly, the SCCC Senior Leadership leveraged the CCSG developmental funds
with other Center resources during the project period. In total, SCCC invested $5.3M in pilot awards since 2014,
which can be directly linked to the successful award of $48.7M in extramural, multi-year grant funding. This is
over a nine-fold yield from the combined investment. In the next project period, SCCC is requesting $410,000
annually in developmental funds, representing 11% of the total CCSG budget request. SCCC Senior Leadership
will continue to support pilot projects, but in addition it also will be supporting up to 20% effort for one early-stage
clinical investigator annually who will be charged with developing and launching an innovative investigator-

SCCC’s provision and support for clinical trials within its affiliate Parkland Health and Hospital System—the
safety-net provider for Dallas County. The CRO also partners with the SCCC Office of Community
Outreach, Engagement, and Equity to implement tailored strategies to support enrollment of
underrepresented minorities. Inclusion of individuals across the lifespan is demonstrated most poignantly
by the CRO’s activities at Children’s Medical Center, the largest pediatric oncology program in North
Texas, as well as SCCC’s special attention to minimizing age restrictions in all clinical trials. In the current
Cancer Center Support Grant funding period, SCCC has made notable clinical research progress.
Highlights include (1) a 28% increase in interventional treatment accruals since 2014 (48% increase for
SCCC-led investigator-initiated treatment trials), (2) a 17% reduction in time to study activation, (3)
consistent enrollment of racial/ethnic minorities to trials proportional to SCCC catchment demographics

10915547,"Research Project 1 – HomeStyles – Abstract
Individuals of Chinese heritage now are the largest and fastest growing segment of the US Asian population. US
Chinese have sociodemographic characteristics and culture that differ substantially from other US Asians, and
therefore, differ in social determinants of health, health status, and disease risk. US Chinese adults are at
increased risk for cardiometabolic disease, related conditions (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension),
and systemic inflammation that promotes disease onset and progression. Immigration to a new country can
substantially impact the gut microbiome which may promote systemic inflammation.
 Our pilot interventions indicate a high-fiber diet rich in whole grains reduced inflammation and
improved obesity. Additionally, our USDA supported, evidence based HomeStyles intervention has
demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in improving lifestyle behaviors and home
environments associated with obesity risk in families. A lack of linguistically, culturally tailored interventions
to their specific health needs makes it difficult for US Chinese to implement healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce
health risks. We are not aware of any intervention tailored for US Chinese that could attenuate modifiable
cardiometabolic risk factors, understand physiological sequelae, and bridge health equity.
 Thus, the overall goal of this R01 proposal is to test the efficacy of HomeStyles in improving health
outcomes in US Chinese in NY/NJ. Proposal aims are to: A) Culturally adapt the HomeStyles intervention
through community-engaged approaches. B) Conduct a 10-week, 2-armed RCT to test HomeStyles intervention
efficacy on health outcomes (dietary intake, physical activity, self-efficacy, HbA1C, waist circumference, and
BMI), hypothesizing that participants randomized to the treatment condition will have greater improvements in
health outcomes than control comparators. C) Examine associations between intervention participation and gut
microbiota/systemic inflammation and test hypotheses that a whole-grain rich diet adopted by those in the
intervention group will increase anti-inflammatory gut bacteria, reduce inflammatory gut bacteria, and lower
systemic inflammation.
 This proposal’s aims parallel NIMHD’s specific interests, as well as RFA MD-21-007. This includes
interventions, like HomeStyles, that aim to ameliorate health inequities in minority populations and reduce
multiple common risk factors (e.g., obesity, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, insufficient sleep, systemic
inflammation) for multiple chronic diseases as well as address multi-generational chronic disease risk and
protective factors. A culturally adapted HomeStyles intervention holds great potential for improving our
knowledge about health disparity in the US Chinese population, understanding translational
mechanisms toward comorbidities, informing family and community-oriented interventions through
sustainable engagement, and serving as a model for health interventions for this audience."

independent peer review for scientific merit, prioritization, and monitoring for all cancer-related clinical and 
population science studies conducted at the UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and its affiliated

accomplished by a rigorous review in a two-stage process conducted by: 1) SCCC Disease-Oriented Teams 
(DOTs), where initial assessment of value, fit, and prioritization within the existing portfolio of studies is 
performed, as well as an assessment of each study’s operational and accrual feasibility; and 2) the Protocol 
Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), which is the definitive independent authority for determining which 
studies proceed to activation. The PRMC ensures that all SCCC-aligned cancer research studies involving 
human subjects are (1) scientifically sound, (2) effectively designed, (3) appropriately prioritized within DOT 
research portfolios, (4) aligned with SCCC institutional clinical research priorities, (5) feasible for completion, (6) 
inclusive of appropriate data and safety monitoring plans, and (7) monitored regularly for accrual and scientific

implementing parallel review with the Institutional Review Board (IRB) while still requiring PRMC approval before 
IRB approval, increasing PRMC meeting frequency, expanding PRMC membership, and transitioning to a fully 
electronic review process, all of which have contributed to decreased review timelines while maintaining the 
highest scientific standards. In 2019, the SCCC DOTs vetted 197 studies for potential submission and forwarded 
162 studies for PRMC review. Of these, 50 had undergone an appropriate external scientific peer review and 
therefore received an expedited review by the PRMC Chair and/or Vice Chair. The remaining 112 studies, 
primarily representing SCCC investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored trials, were forwarded for full PRMC 
review. More than 70% of the studies reviewed by PRMC required modifications prior to being approved. No

The physical and emotional demands of dementia caregiving can have enormous negative effects on caregivers’
physical and mental health. Dementia caregivers have increased risk of hypertension and diabetes, compared
to non-caregivers, especially in minority populations. This study will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled
trial to test the efficacy of a culturally tailored version of the NYU Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) plus enhanced
support (ES) through online chat groups (the NYUCI plus WeChat/Kakaotalk [population social media app for
Chinese/Korean] peer support which we call the NYUCI-ES in reducing health risks for cardiometabolic disease
among older Chinese and Korean-American adults caring for relatives with ADRD. The NYUCI has proven
efficacy in reducing psychological outcomes among largely White samples of caregivers of persons with ADRD
and has been widely replicated and translated in the USA and elsewhere. This study will provide the first large-
scale test of the potential effects of the NYUCI-ES, a multicomponent intervention that includes individual and
family counseling and ongoing support via support group and online chat groups and ad hoc (on demand)
counseling.
 In collaboration with community organizations across the New York and northern New Jersey
metropolitan area, we will enroll 300 caregivers of people with ADRD (150 Chinese and 150 Korean) in this
study. Aim 1: Develop culturally adapted informational and educational materials about dementia and caregiving
issues for social service providers of the intervention and for family caregivers. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis, H1:
A counseling and support intervention (the NYUCI-ES) will significantly improve psychosocial factors such as
depression, stress self-rated health and chronic disease management among Chinese and Korean-American
ADRD caregivers and these changes will be mediated by improvement in social support. H1a: By the first (6-
month) follow-up, the mediators (increases in social support, stress reaction) will improve significantly in the
intervention group compared to baseline values and the control group. H1b: These improvements will be
maintained, and lead to reduction in depressive symptoms, and improvement in self-reported health and chronic
disease self-management by the 12-month follow-up compared to the control group. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis,
H2: the NYUCI-ES will reduce biologic risk factors, including metabolic health (glycosylated hemoglobin) and
inflammation (Oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, etc.) within 6 months of enrollment compared to baseline and
a control group; these changes will be mediated through increases in social support and decreases in depressive
symptoms and will be maintained at the 12-month follow-up.
 The public health significance of these findings will likely have an impact on health care policy for CGs
from diverse underserved ethnic and cultural backgrounds, potentially reducing morbidity, and improving their
quality of life."
10914042,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Falls are the leading traumatic cause of both injury and death among older adults. American emergency
departments (EDs) see over 3 million fall victims yearly, yet they play little role in primary or secondary fall
prevention. The ED is an ideal site to identify patients at risk of future falls, however in this setting preventive
care cannot be implemented at the expense of the primary mission of the ED: the provision of emergency care
in a time-pressured environment. As the population ages, and the ED continues to expand its role as the primary
site for delivery of acute unscheduled care, there is an urgent need to create a scalable intervention to assess
older adults for fall risk and link them to appropriate risk reduction interventions after discharge without adding
additional workload for nurses or physicians.
Through an AHRQ K08, our study team has developed and validated an innovative automated screening and
referral intervention for fall risk. This intervention harnesses existing data to select and connect patients to
appropriate primary and secondary prevention services after ED visits without adding burden to nurse or
physician workloads. This intervention features smart use of automation for screening and referral tasks
maintaining physician decision autonomy, as well as the unique ability to adjust referral rates based on clinic
availability. This intervention features smart use of automation for screening and referral tasks maintaining
physician decision autonomy, as well as the unique ability to adjust referral rates based on clinic availability.
Based on our work, UW Health is currently piloting the intervention, and has committed to implementing it at
three diverse ED sites. This study will adapt the intervention for implementation at additional sites, and
investigates the implementation and effectiveness of the automated screening and referral process in all three
EDs through three specific aims: 1) Adapt the design of an automated screening and referral intervention for
implementation in three diverse ED settings, using a human factors approach. 2) Test the effectiveness of the
automated screening and referral intervention on both completed referrals to a multidisciplinary fall prevention
clinic and rates of injurious falls using EHR data generated during implementation. 3) Evaluate implementation
of the automated screening and referral intervention in three diverse ED sites using a mixed methods approach.
This grant proposal builds upon our previous innovative work developing both CDS and risk-
stratification algorithms to improve the quality and safety of care delivered to older adult ED patients. We will
address the urgent and growing need for a scalable strategy for fall risk reduction from the ED by demonstrating
the effectiveness of our novel approach in a study spanning diverse hospital types and patient populations.
Furthermore, knowledge gained from this work will inform other use cases which could benefit from automated
risk-stratification and care coordination in the ED and beyond."
10853061,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Structurally complex loci (SCLs) are hotspots of genome dynamism whose relationship to human phenotypic
variation is unknown. SCLs have multiple segments of duplicated DNA sequence which can contain or flank
genes, exons, or regulatory elements; these repeated sequences recombine with one another to generate new
alleles by non-allelic homologous recombination and gene conversion, creating many functionally distinct
alleles with different gene dosages and/or protein structures.
Human genetics does not yet know the alleles that are present at most SCLs, nor their relationship to human
phenotypic variation. Genetic variation at SCLs tends to arise from many alleles, to be hard to assemble, and to
have complex relationships to nearby SNPs and SNP haplotypes. Yet SCLs provide a real opportunity to relate
phenotypes to allelic series of functional alleles with interpretable effects on gene dosage or protein domain
structure.
In this work, we will develop ways to ascertain how SCLs at loci across the genome are comprised of allelic
series and relate to a diverse set of human phenotypes. To do this, we will combine data from many forms of
genome analysis – definitive long-read data (n ~102 and growing), whole-genome and whole-exome sequence
data (104-105) and SNP array data (105-107) with companion phenotype data.
In Aim 1, we will develop methods to reveal the full spectrum of variation at SCLs. We will (a) identify variable
DNA features and the ways in which these features vary and co-distribute across thousands of people of
diverse ancestries, and (b) find the underlying alleles and allele frequencies that explain this population-scale
variation.
In Aim 2, we will enable powerful genotype-phenotype analyses that leverage vast existing SNP data sets; we
will do this by creating large panels of reference haplotypes of SCL alleles and surrounding SNPs, and
advancing methods for imputing SCL alleles into SNP data.
In Aim 3, we will advance approaches for genetic association analysis and fine-mapping at SCLs, and explore
the functional consequences of SCLs on quantitative traits and disease risk.
We aspire to make and enable many more discoveries about how allelic series at structurally complex loci shape
human phenotypes."

This is a proposal for the competing continuation of the University of Minnesota T32 Cancer Health Disparities
Training Program, funded by NCI since 2011. Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, screening, treatment
and survivorship are persistent, with persons from socioeconomically under-resourced and disadvantaged
populations and racial/ethnic minorities disproportionately burdened. This program meets the essential need to
train a diverse cadre of investigators to address cancer health disparities through innovative, multi-level and
multi-domain interventions and community-engaged research. The primary goal of our T32 Program is to
prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to
conduct cancer related intervention research with populations experiencing health disparities. Our 3 Training
Aims are to: 1) to increase the number of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees committed to intervention and
translational research addressing cancer disparities by leveraging the strengths of the current training program,
including curricular, mentored research, and career development components; 2) each year, prepare three
predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees to reduce cancer related health disparities; and 3) enhance the
diversity of the research workforce in cancer related health disparities by committing to recruiting at least 50%
of trainees from backgrounds underrepresented in research. We seek to educate researchers who are well
prepared to design, implement, and disseminate innovative community-engaged interventions to reduce
cancer related disparities. With this renewal, we also will pursue three initiatives that are responsive to trainee
feedback and innovations in health equity research. First, our leadership, mentorship, and curriculum have
been aligned with scientific approaches to health disparities research focused on multiple levels and domains
of influence along the cancer continuum. Second, the role of our Community Mentors has been transformed to
facilitate increased opportunities for trainees to acquire skills and experiences in community-engaged
research. Finally, we will expand the focus on intervention development to address trainee recommendations
for education in intervention implementation. Our training program is designed to prepare investigators skilled
in intervention and translational research to reduce cancer health disparities with a focus on community
engaged research. We will achieve our goals through an enriching mentored experience, didactic training, and
collaborative research training and projects. Overall, our proposal is highly aligned with the NCI priorities for

understand brain functions and disorders. Recent developments in tissue transformation
techniques, such as CLARITY, SHIELD, MAP, ExM, CUBIC, and DISCO-based methods, have
made significant progress towards whole-organ molecular labeling and microscopic imaging by
rendering intact tissue chemically permeable and optically transparent. Alternative approaches
to generate 3D whole brain datasets are based on integration of block-face imaging and
mechanical tissue sectioning, such as the STP, FAST, and WVT methods. Though these
approaches have successfully enabled volumetric imaging of the mouse brain and contributed
substantially to neuroscience research, they are not realistically applicable to larger scale
mammalian brains. Currently, the only way to image large intact mammalian brain samples is to
dissect the sample into small blocks, followed by the processing and imaging of each block
individually. Not only is this process laborious and low-throughput but it causes excessive tissue
damage, making it nearly impossible to piece together a complete picture of a large sample
without information loss. Furthermore, large-scale studies that require using considerable
amounts of rodent brains are extremely laborious and time consuming based on current
technologies. As a high-throughput solution is urgently needed, LifeCanvas Technologies
proposes to pioneer new developments for efficient, automated processing and high-resolution
microscopic imaging of large scale mammalian brains. Specifically, our new technological
developments will focus on 1) an advanced vibrating microtome for automatic precision slicing
of samples as large as an intact human brain hemisphere. The vibrating microtome will be
optimized for slicing highly complex samples with minimal tissue damage, uniform thickness and
extremely even surface profile; and 2) an integrated volumetric imaging system consisting of the
vibrating microtome and a custom-developed, high-resolution light sheet microscope. The
system will perform serial tissue sectioning and imaging at unprecedented speed for a wide
range of samples, including rodent brains, expanded rodent brains, intact non-human primate
brains, and whole human brain coronal slabs. In this phase, we will build prototypes of the
instruments and demonstrate the functionality on expanded, intact mouse brains and a large
array of mouse brains. In the next phase, we will build user-friendly, ready-to-commercialize
instruments tested on human and non-human primate brains. We anticipate the new
developments will expand LifeCanvas’ current tissue clearing, labeling, imaging and quantitative
analysis pipeline, and offer the neuroscience community a complete solution for mammalian
brain high-throughput processing and volumetric imaging."
10896193,"Affinity Gradient-Based Transport of HIV Capsid Cores Through the Nuclear Pore Complex:
Project Summary
Lentiviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have evolved strategies to enter the nucleus
of non-dividing cells and integrate their reverse transcribed DNA into host genomes. There are several reports
on the transport of HIV-1 complexes to, and import through, the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), a massive
channel in the nuclear envelope composed of multiple copies of ~30 nucleoporins (NUPs). Recent data
suggests that the supramolecular fullerene cone-shaped viral capsid (CA) core (~120x50 nm) that
encapsulates the viral genome can penetrate the central channel (diameter of ~60 nm) of the NPC, at least
partially, intact. It is widely accepted that at least a subset of NUPs interacts with the HIV-1 CA proteins of the
viral core through their phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs. However, the molecular mechanisms by which a
largely intact HIV-1 capsid passes through the NPC – a defining feature of lentiviruses – remains to be
elucidated.
Mechanistic studies of HIV-1 nuclear entry have been stymied primarily by the inherent complexity of the system.
The NPC is one of the largest assemblies in the Eukaryotic cell (~120 MDa) and HIV-1 capsid core is one of the
largest cargoes delivered to the cell nucleus. Based on analysis of state-of-the-art published data and pilot
results, we propose a paradigm-shifting hypothesis that addresses the mechanism of transport of HIV-1
capsid core through the NPC and challenges the generalized view on nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. We
propose that HIV-1 capsid core is a complex transport receptor that is translocated via an opportunistic affinity
gradient within the NPC. The affinity gradient consists of various “signatures” on specific nucleoporins
that are naturally distributed along the nucleo-cytoplasmic axis of the NPC. The subset of such
“signatures” involves various flavors of FG motifs that are segregated in the NPC to distinct zones. We will use
our multidisciplinary expertise, armamentarium of techniques, and preliminary data, to address the following
specific aims: 1. Determine the structures of complexes of CA proteins with peptides of different FG motifs. 2.
Biochemically and biophysically characterize the interactions between CA and various FG peptides. 3.
Discriminate between various flavors of FG motif interactions with mutant capsid cores using nuclear import
experiments. The scientific premise is that combined structural, biochemical, biophysical and imaging
approaches will provide important mechanistic insight into interactions of HIV-1 capsid core complexes with
NPC constituents and reveal the capsid core – NPC structural intermediates of translocation. Knowledge of
the molecular interactions during HIV-1 nuclear import will shed light on the strategy HIV-1 deploys to deliver
its genome to the nucleus; our fundamental understanding of NPC function; provide a framework for studies of
the nuclear import of other viruses; and potential approaches to novel antiviral therapies."
10922676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) occurs predominantly among young people (aged 15-24
years old) and within micro-epidemics (high HIV prevalence areas). Among adolescents, girls account for 80%
of all adolescent HIV infections (15-19 years old) and adolescent mothers (AMs) are at higher HIV risk than
non-parenting girls. However, as AMs have been largely overlooked in HIV prevention research, gaps in
knowledge regarding where micro-epidemics occur among AMs and how structural (e.g., urbanization) and
relational HIV risk factors impact adolescent mothers’ HIV risk remain. Further, despite differences in AMs’
relationship configurations, no studies have examined how the co-occurrence of relational factors impact AMs’
vulnerability to HIV and unprotected sex using a typological approach. Moreover, most HIV studies on AMs in
SSA use a single-level approach to describe HIV risk as opposed to a multilevel framework that incorporates
spatial (i.e., structural factors) and non-spatial (i.e., relationship typologies, individual and familial factors) risk
factors. This exploratory study will use a modified social ecological framework to identify micro-epidemics, and
to characterize relationship typologies and multilevel factors that impact AMs’ HIV risk. The specific aims are
to: 1) characterize HIV micro-epidemics among AMs in SSA, 2) identify typologies of AMs’ sexual relationships,
and 3) assess whether multilevel factors are associated with HIV risk and unprotected sex among AMs. To
address these aims, this study will use (1) secondary data from the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment
(PHIA), which includes 2,879 AMs (aged 15-19 years old); and (2) publicly available structural-level data, from
various sources which will be linked to PHIA cluster-level data. Multiple quantitative analytic approaches will be
used to execute aims, including spatial and machine learning techniques (Aim 1), latent class analysis (Aim 2),
and mixed effects modeling (Aim 3). Study findings may inform targeted HIV prevention interventions for AMs.
This study aligns with the NICHD’s research priorities by examining structural risk factors of HIV in a high-risk
setting and the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goal. The training plan developed by the PI, sponsor Dr. Félice Lê-
Scherban, and co-sponsors Drs. Allison Groves and Alex Ezeh, supports the proposed research and the PI’s
training goals, which are to: 1) gain expertise in theoretical frameworks of social epidemiological and
adolescent health research, 2) develop methodological skills in machine learning and latent class analysis, and
3) refine research dissemination, communication, and scholarly writing skills. The PI will leverage resources at
Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health, a collaborative and multidisciplinary institution that
prioritizes health disparities and global research. The proposed research, training, institution, and mentorship
team will support the PI’s pursuit of becoming an independent social epidemiologist focusing on advancing

10890024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women who use drugs (WWUD), specifically heroin, shoulder a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic
in Tanzania. Despite advances in HIV prevention biomedical interventions, including pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), PrEP uptake has been slow in Tanzania. Mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and post-
traumatic stress disorder, are high among WWUD and are known barriers to HIV prevention behaviors,
including PrEP engagement. Inattention to the high prevalence of mental health problems in WWUD, is likely
to undermine efforts to increase the use of HIV prevention strategies, including PrEP, among this highly
vulnerable, yet understudied population. Motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT) are evidence-based interventions that have been successfully delivered by paraprofessionals, both
globally and in Tanzania, for a range of health conditions, including substance use disorders and mental
disorders, and to improve uptake and adherence of HIV prevention strategies. The Common Elements
Treatment Approach (CETA) is a transdiagnostic, CBT-based intervention developed for use in low- and
middle-income countries for delivery by lay counselors with no or limited previous mental health training. The
goal of this study is to adapt MI for PrEP engagement (MI-PrEP) and a combined CETA and MI-PrEP
interventions (CETA+MI-PrEP) for delivery by paraprofessionals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to optimize PrEP
engagement among WWUD. The specific aims of this study are to: (1) identify barriers and motivators to PrEP
engagement, and the types of paraprofessionals who could most effectively deliver the MI-PrEP and CETA+MI-
PrEP interventions using in-depth interviews and focus groups with WWUD, peer- and non-peer community
health workers, lay counselors, and mental health specialists, (2) systematically adapt MI-PrEP and CETA for
WWUD with co-occurring mental disorders in Tanzania using the ADAPT-ITT model, and (3) assess the
feasibility, fidelity, and preliminary efficacy of the MI-PrEP and CETA+MI-PrEP interventions in a three-arm
pilot feasibility trial with 120 WWUD with co-occurring symptoms of mental disorders. A combination of
interviews, structured surveys, and supervision will be used to assess for intervention feasibility and fidelity.
The preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be estimated for the primary outcomes of PrEP engagement
and secondary outcomes of opioid use, symptoms of depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, and PrEP
motivation and barriers. This pilot feasibility study will: (1) advance our understanding of the unique factors
that contribute to the PrEP engagement among WWUD, (2) address the HIV prevention needs of an
understudied, yet extremely high-risk population, and (3) result in culturally appropriate and locally adapted
MI-PrEP and CETA+MI-PrEP interventions that can be formally tested in a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-
Implementation randomized controlled trial."
10916548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV remains the leading cause of death among adults in South Africa despite the availability of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) due to failure to initiate ART and failure to remain on ART. Gaps in HIV care are especially
prominent among key populations at high risk for both HIV and reduced use of HIV services. One population
with an HIV prevalence double the age and sex-matched general population (23%) and with low engagement
in HIV care is individuals recently released from incarceration. During incarceration >90% initiate ART;
following reentry into the community only 34% remain in care. The transition from the controlled carceral
environment and its restricted autonomy to life in the community requires reestablishing planning skills, self-
efficacy, and social support and overcoming bureaucratic barriers to accessing community clinics. We have
demonstrated that an intervention that circumvents clinic barriers by directly providing ART and builds
behavioral skills through peer-facilitator led group sessions improves care continuity following release from
incarceration. In a pilot study of this intervention supported by NIMH, termed SPARCS, among 176
participants, 36% of those in the care as usual compared to 61% of those in the intervention arm were in-care
6 months after corrections release. These results raise important questions regarding possibility of
programmatic scale-up. Scale-up requires achieving a balance between effectiveness, feasibility, and cost.
Notably, the tension between effectiveness and feasibility may require reducing overall effectiveness – such as
by eliminating a component of SPARCS – to increase feasibility. To explore each of these questions, we are
proposing a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study structed with the RE-AIM framework (Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). First, we are proposing a 2x2 factorial design to
maximize power of a randomized controlled trial of the Full-SPARCS intervention and the two distinct
components termed “ART-SPARCS” and “Group-SPARCS” and usual care, to test for a difference in viral load
suppression 6 months from correctional facility release. Second, we propose characterize implementation in
terms of reach, adoption or adoption potential, acceptability, and fidelity. Finally, will use findings from the RCT
to inform costing and cost-effectiveness to inform policy makers regarding cost of SPARCS and components
and cost-effectiveness of each component and the full SPARCS to inform implementation cost and potential
long-term sustainability or maintenance. This project has the potential to generate considerable new
knowledge on interventions that can improve care continuity for this population and key findings for potential
scale-up relevant to policy makers. This proposed study has the potential to generate actionable knowledge to
improve outcomes for community reentrants and contribute to overall goals of HIV epidemic control."
10813052,"This proposal seeks to renew Research Career Scientist Award held by Dr. Subhra
Mohapatra, at the James A. Haley VA Hospital in Tampa, Florida since 2018. She is also a tenured-
full professor (part-time) at the VA-affiliated academic center- the University of South Florida. She
is the recipient of several international/national awards and recognitions including as a Fellow of
the National Academy of Inventors and a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological
Engineering. Dr. Mohapatra has been a research investigator at the VA Hospital (Medicine) since
2007 and has been continuously funded with the Merit Review Award focused on cancer, traumatic
brain injury (TBI), and COVID since 2016. She has been studying the basic molecular and
translational mechanisms underlying the inflammation in diverse acute/chronic diseases including
COVID-19, cancers, and TBI, all of which afflict VA population and contribute significantly to the
overall health of the Veterans. The main premise of her research program has been to
understand the mechanisms involved in the disease pathogenesis toward developing novel
diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic approaches to treat them. Current and ongoing research
activities to be supported by this RCS Award focus on three areas. The first program centers on
the characterization of novel virus-neutralizing nanoparticles that may serve as prophylactic and/or
treatment for COVID-19 patients. In this proposal, these particles will be investigated for their potential
and validated in relevant human cellular and mouse models. She is collaborating with other VA
investigators in developing an additional project to develop novel siRNA-based prophylactic and
therapeutic approaches targeting viral replication and cytokine storm that follows acute SARS-
CoV-2 infection. The second research program focuses on the investigation of a novel
combinatorial therapeutic approach in a mouse model of moderate TBI that includes an intranasal
dendrimer-based nano-formulated siRNA treatment against a recently discovered target, CCL20 to
reduce inflammation, and a parallel treatment to promote neuroregeneration by therapy with
mesenchymal stem cells. In the third research program Dr. Mohapatra’s lab aims to investigate
and test a novel targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy for lung cancer using the mesenchymal stem
cells infected by a respiratory syncytial virus infection, which is harmless for immunocompetent
individuals. This project uses a 3D multicell tumoroid in vitro and biopsy-derived cultures ex vivo,
which her lab has pioneered. Further, this project uses in vivo mouse models of lung cancer to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of oncolytic viro-cell therapy. The project to date has attracted
industry collaboration, which might lead to clinical trials. Overall, these highly innovative
approaches taken together are expected to lead to high-impact clinical diagnostics and therapies
for diverse diseases of Veterans and other Americans in need. Veterans have been
proportionately affected by the pandemic and are increasingly affected by the incidence of lung
cancers and TBI compared to the general population. With ~100 publications, 20 patents, an h-
index of 36 and an i-index of 85, Dr. Subhra Mohapatra is recognized nationally and
internationally for her contributions to the fields of research on cancer, neurodegenerative disease,
and viral infections. She has received substantial extramural research support including awards
from the NIH, ONR, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Florida Department of Health. It is
anticipated that the development of these effective therapeutics will greatly improve the quality of
Veteran’s healthcare."
10915696,"Project Summary/Abstract
This UG3/UH3 proposal is in response to RFA-TR-20-031-Basket Clinical Trials of Drugs targeting Shared
Molecular Etiologies in Multiple Rare Diseases. The proposed studies focus on two ultra-rare maternally
inherited mitochondrial diseases MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes)
and LHON-Plus (Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy-Plus). Both diseases are among those studied by the
Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. Patients do not have access to effective therapeutic intervention,
resulting in significant disability, morbidity, and premature death. The devastation wrought by these diseases
underscores the urgency to address this unmet medical need and develop novel therapeutic candidates.
However, their ultra-rare prevalence makes it challenging to recruit an accrued number of MELAS and LHON-
Plus patients to clinical trials. Thus, the proposed basket clinical trial design will combine these two ultra-rare
populations to provide proof-of-concept of its feasibility for divergent patient populations.
MELAS and LHON-Plus patients exhibit divergent and overlapping clinical neurological and non-neurological
symptoms. They are caused by a maternally inherited pathogenic variant that results in a defective oxidative
phosphorylation pathway responsible for mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Both diseases share the molecular
etiology of Complex I deficiency, causing ATP deficiency and chronic energy deficit.
We designed a novel two-pronged pharmaco-epigenomic strategy to increase ATP output in MELAS and
LHON-Plus patients. Our pre-clinical studies using ex-vivo patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrate the
feasibility of our lead compound to promote mitochondrial recovery in MELAS and LHON-Plus patient’s
fibroblasts. The proposed multi-PI studies combines the cross-disciplinary strengths of the George Washington
University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and Children’s National Medical Center, a referring site for
the North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium. This partnership is funded by an NIH Clinical and
Translational Science Award UL1 Program providing a robust infrastructure for the proposed studies.
Aim 1 (UG3 phase) focuses on translational MELAS and LHON-Plus studies and submission of an IND
protocol to the FDA. Aim 2 (UH3 phase)focuses on a basket clinical trial with MELAS and LHON-Plus to: 1)
provide proof-of-concept that the basket design can be applied to divergent ultra-rare diseases; 2) advance the
dataset for safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of our lead compound for a larger number of
patients than in a conventional clinical trial setting; and 3) gather outcomes and practical information for
optimizing the design of future basket clinical trial.
Our innovative design lies in applying the concept of basket clinical trial not only to multiple diseases with a
common molecular target, but also to groups with similar ex-vivo fibroblasts response to butyrate across these
diseases to improve our ability to evaluate our therapeutic drug in ultra-rare disease populations."
10914836,"Abstract. The goal of this R61/R33 proposal is to carry out a phase IA/IB clinical study of
AAVrh.10hFXN (a serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus coding for human frataxin) to treat
cardiac manifestations of Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), the most common inherited ataxia. FA is a fatal,
presently, untreatable disorder. Most cases result from intron variants in the frataxin (FXN) gene; when
inherited from both parents, there is resulting haploinsufficiency of FXN gene expression. While
progressive neurologic disease limits mobility, cardiomyopathy is responsible for substantial morbidity and
60% of deaths secondary to progressive heart failure and arrhythmias. Cardiac MRI (CMR) data from our
group and others demonstrate that FA-associated cardiomyopathy initially manifests with increased left
ventricular (LV) myocardial mass (a potentially reversible phenotype) prior to development of myocardial
fibrosis (irreversible damage). AAVrh.10hFXN, the therapeutic gene transfer vector to be used in the
proposed human study, is a nonhuman primate-derived serotype rh.10 capsid with a constitutive promoter
driving the normal human frataxin cDNA. AAVrh.10hFXN will be administered intravenously, a vector and
route which in experimental animal models effectively delivers genes to the heart. Based on our preclinical
efficacy data in two murine models in which intravenous AAVrh.10hFXN reverses the consequences of FA
cardiomyopathy, together with extensive safety data, we are ready to initiate a phase IA/IB clinical trial
with the following aims. R61 aim 1. Prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug package and gain
approval from the FDA and other regulatory groups (Institutional Review Board, Biosafety) to initiate a
phase IA/IB clinical trial. Milestone. Full regulatory approval to initiate parts A and B of the clinical trial,
enroll the 1st subject in part A. R61 aim 2 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for
the part A (safety/dose-ranging) clinical trial. R33 aim 3. Carry out the part A (safety/dose-ranging) trial to
determine the maximum tolerable dose of AAVrh.10hFXN therapy for the cardiac manifestations of FA.
Milestone. Initiate and complete assessment of n=9 individuals (3 doses, 3 each), with an audited final
report. R33 aim 4 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for part B (safety/preliminary
efficacy) clinical trial. R33 aim 5. Carry out the part B safety/preliminary efficacy study at the highest
tolerable dose from part A. Milestone. Complete assessment of n=15 individuals, with an audited final
report. Given that genetic variance is responsible for many forms of cardiomyopathy and that existing
treatments are limited, this study offers a potential therapeutic paradigm shift to reverse cardiac phenotype
and thus improve clinical outcomes for a broad range of patients with genetically mediated
cardiomyopathies at risk adverse LV remodeling and its devastating clinical consequences."
10928811,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are a class of progressive neurodegeneration disorders, often caused by minor genetic abnormalities to which motor neurons are particularly vulnerable. Because each of these diseases is rare and the molecular pathologies so diverse and unresolved, it is hard to envision a therapeutic intervention tailored to each individually, or a single treatment to effectively treat them all. Current genome editing tools are easily programmable to target discrete genomic loci and affected tissues of MNDs are largely similar. Thus, a general genome editing therapeutic strategy for MNDs fitted to each mutation could meet this urgent need.  Base editing tools can theoretically correct any C:G>T:A and A:T>G:C transition, yet the factors that determine efficiency and precision of base editing are not fully understood, and editing outcomes at a given locus are frequently unpredictable. For the development of base editing correction strategies at a great number of loci, screening through a multitude of base editor variants – currently any permutation of >10 deaminase enzymes and >15 Cas proteins, and counting – and sgRNA combinations for every target is prohibitive. A clear understanding of Cas protein, deaminase, and sequence determinants of editing outcomes is needed to facilitate the design of base editing strategies. We intend to develop a general workflow to design effective base editing strategies for causal MND SNPs and deliver these tools to MND affected tissues.  SMA is a monogenic MND with a well-defined genetic cause, and animal models harboring the human causal gene that faithfully recapitulate disease phenotypes of SMA patients. Successful development of an effective and safe SMA genome editing treatment will assist the development of similar genome editing therapeutics for other genetic MNDs, including some forms of familial ALS.  In this project we will (1) create a computational predictive model of base editing to facilitate the design of effective base editing strategies; (2) develop protocols to efficiently deliver base editing therapeutics to disease relevant tissues in mice to enable genome editing; and (3) use this pipeline to optimize a base editing therapeutic to rescue SMA in mice, and develop genome editing therapeutics for other causal MND mutations, focusing first on the most common single point mutation causal to ALS in North America, SOD1A4V.  I will take advantage of the world-class genomics environment of the Broad Institute and the expertise in AAV-delivery at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research to realize these goals and develop skills that will help me to continue this work as an independent investigator. Through mentorship meetings and courses on grant-writing and data visualization I will improve my science-communication skills so that I may compete successfully for additional NIH R01 and R21 funding as a faculty member. By attending conferences and publishing my work I intend to establish myself as leader in the field of therapeutic genome editing for MND."
10901950,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, and resulting problems with health and cognition are increasingly common
in the United States. Many sleep disorders may be associated with abnormal sleep homeostasis: an innate
regulatory process that balances sleep need, sleep intensity, and sleep amount as a function of prior time
spent awake. Sleep homeostasis requires a feedback circuit to maintain the system within defined limits.
However, the cellular components and protein signaling pathways of this feedback circuit remain incompletely
defined. Our understanding of sleep homeostasis thus far is primarily based on the study of neurons, but I
showed that non-neuronal cells (i.e. astrocytes) also play a role. I posit that the homeostatic feedback circuit
includes a neuronal waking signal that reflects sleep need and an astroglial integrator of the neuronal waking
signal. I propose that the wake-promoting neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) is a candidate for the neuronal
waking signal that interacts with astrocytes. I further propose that calcium (Ca2+) is the astroglial integrator of
sleep need because 1) NA increases astroglial Ca2+ activity and 2) I showed that astroglial Ca2+ plays a role in
sleep homeostasis. My overall hypothesis is that wake-promoting neurons increase astroglial Ca2+ signaling
during elevated sleep need. I will test this hypothesis in two AIMS: 1) Determine how NA impacts astroglial
Ca2+ dynamics before, during, and after sleep deprivation (SD); 2) Determine how sleep loss impacts astroglial
protein signaling. For AIM 1, I will use a multifaceted approach to optogenetically inhibit or stimulate NA
neurons while imaging Ca2+ dynamics in adjacent astrocytes and recording electroencephalographic brain
state activity in freely behaving mice. Optogenetics, Ca2+ imaging, and electroencephalographic recordings will
occur simultaneously under baseline conditions and during SD & recovery. Using this multimodal approach, I
can temporally register cell-type specific neuronal activity and astroglial Ca2+ dynamics within distinct arousal
states in freely behaving mice. For AIM 2, I will determine which astroglial proteins respond to changes in sleep
need. I will use ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to quantify astroglial
proteins from rested and SD mice using targeted and untargeted proteomics. Targeted proteomics will include
NA- & Ca2+-related signaling proteins as well as synaptic, metabolic, and gap junction proteins because these
proteins are implicated in sleep homeostasis. I will also determine the phosphorylation status of these proteins
because phosphorylation status changes with sleep need and is an important post-translational modification in
astrocytes. Astrocytes will be isolated from brains of wild type mice and mutant mice with reduced astroglial
Ca2+ signaling. In this way, I can determine which astroglial proteins are 1) responsive to changes in sleep
need and 2) Ca2+-dependent. The proposed studies use innovative methods to define biological substrates of
sleep homeostasis. These findings, in turn, will further characterize the contribution of non-neuronal cells in the
regulation of sleep-wake behavior and will expand our understanding of physiological and disordered sleep."

The United States has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the developed world, and
is one of few countries where this rate is increasing. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)
remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. While improvement in myocardial
function occurs within the first 12 months postpartum in more than half of women with PPCM,
those who do not recover are left with chronic heart failure and 5-10% of women die or require
cardiac transplantation during the first-year post-partum. Inhibition of prolactin with the
dopamine agonist bromocriptine appears to improve outcomes in three previous clinical studies
of PPCM. Recent recommendations from a European working group suggest the addition of
bromocriptine to standard heart failure therapy; however, no randomized trial comparing
standard therapy to standard therapy plus bromocriptine has been performed in a multi-racial
North American cohort. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate whether the addition of
bromocriptine to standard heart failure therapy improves outcomes in women with PPCM in a
randomized controlled trial.
The University of Pittsburgh Center for Clinical Trials & Data Coordination (CCDC) proposes to
serve as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the proposed Randomized Evaluation of
Bromocriptine Therapy for Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (REBIRTH) study. We currently serve
as the DCC for numerous single- and multi-center clinical trials in which we support many
complex aspects of the study including project management, protocol development, data
management, regulatory support, statistical analyses, and data dissemination. The CCDC will
collaborate with study investigators to design, conduct, coordinate, and analyze the proposed
REBIRTH clinical trial. Specifically, we propose to 1) provide program coordination and
administrative support throughout all phases (UG3 and UH3) of REBIRTH; 2) coordinate
protocol development during the UG3 phase, provide regulatory management throughout the
study, and establish collaborations with key core facilities; 3) adapt and maintain an existing
web-based data management and tracking system to enhance the integrity and rigor of
REBIRTH; and 4) provide comprehensive expertise for the design and statistical analysis of
REBIRTH."
10701168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is approaching an epidemic state in the United States and is strongly associated with a higher risk of
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a major cause of morbidity and mortality in obese
individuals. In the VA population, HFpEF accounts for approximately 7% of all mortalities, and its prevalence in
the VA Healthcare system is expected to increase exponentially over the coming decade with the aging Veterans
population. Despite significant advances in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, few
advances have been made in the management of HFpEF which carries a dismal survival rate of 50% in two
years after diagnosis. Therefore, HFpEF represents an unmet need in modern clinical practice. Obesity induces
systemic inflammation contributing to HFpEF, however, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are
not fully understood. In fact, therapeutics that nonspecifically target inflammation failed in multiple HF trials,
highlighting the knowledge gap in the field. We identified a critical role for the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic
acid (LPA) in cardiac-BM signaling, cardiac inflammation, and adverse cardiac remodeling. Our preliminary data
and published reports demonstrate increased plasma levels of autotaxin (ATX) and LPA in obese patients and
animal models of diet-induced obesity (DIO), related to the increased mRNA expression of ATX in adipocytes,
which hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into LPA. However, the role of ATX/LPA signaling in obesity-
induced cardiac inflammation and HFpEF, as well as related therapeutic targets, have not been explored. This
project is clinically relevant as targeting this pathway, using clinically available therapeutics, can improve the
outcomes of millions of patients with HFpEF who have limited therapeutic options. Our long-term goal is to
identify the immune mechanisms regulating pathological heart remodeling in obesity. Our central hypothesis
is that LPA plays an important role in obesity-related cardiac inflammation and fibrosis and that inhibiting
ATX/LPA signaling is therapeutically beneficial. We collected extensive pilot data using unbiased
approaches, including mass cytometry (CyTOF) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), to characterize the immune
landscape during DIO-related pathological cardiac remodeling. This data highlights the critical role of ATX/LPA
signaling and macrophages in obesity-induced HFpEF and support the following specific aims: 1) Aim 1.
Identify the mechanistic role of ATX/LPA nexus in macrophage signaling during obesity-induced HFpEF,
2) Determine how adipose-derived ATX signaling mediates obesity-induced HFpEF, and 3) Investigate
the association between LPA levels, heritable genetic variability in LPA metabolism, and the
development of HFpEF in humans. These aims will be conducted by a team with extensive clinical, basic and
translational research experience in studying heart/BM signaling, immunomodulation of cardiac inflammation,
and ATX/LPA signaling; and utilize state-of-the-art approaches to untangle the role of ATX/LPA signaling in
obesity-induced cardiac remodeling and the development of HFpEF. The impact of these studies derives from
our innovative focus on the targetable ATX/LPA signaling nexus to reduce the pathological inflammation and
subsequent development of heart failure in millions of overweight/obese patients."

Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are effectively treated with vertebral augmentation (VA), which rapidly
reduces pain and restores function. The most significant opportunities to advance VA as an efficacious treatment
option for (cancer) patients in acute pain are to 1) considerably reduce radiation dose to patient and staff; 2)
improve the safety of VA; and 3) increase its efficacy by establishing superior but more complex techniques
using curved instruments. Introducing robotic systems for VA will address these three significant challenges.
However, existing robotic solutions are bulky, expensive to acquire and maintain, and disrupt workflows. These
drawbacks make current systems inadequate for VA, a quick procedure that is often performed in outpatient
settings. To capitalize on the benefits of robotics for VA – reduced radiation dose and complication rates, and increased
efficacy – novel, alternative robotic platforms and corresponding algorithms are needed that seamlessly integrate with
the VA workflow, enable robot planning from interventional X-ray images, and are more affordable.
 Our long-term goal is to advance surgical robotics technology for X-ray-guided VA by developing 1) a
novel class of tool-mounted robots, 2) a suite of powerful image-based algorithms for automated intra-operative
surgical planning, verification, and closed loop control, and 3) mixed reality interfaces for remote actuation
and assurance. Because our robotic solution augments the conventional VA workflow and its tools, and is
of considerably lower cost than existing robotic solutions, our developments will contribute to unlocking the
known benefits of surgical robotics for the surgical treatment of the tens of thousands of VAs that are performed
across a wide variety of providers every year in the US. Our specific aims are: 1) Develop and test a cannula-
mounted piezo robot for image-guided VA: We will create a cannula-mounted piezo robot, supported by a passive
positioning arm, that meets the clinical requirements of VA. The robot will combine high accuracy and force
with a low-profile design to not interfere with X-ray image-guidance. 2) Develop imaging and planning algorithms,
and user feedback to guide delivery: We will develop algorithms for a camera-augmented C-arm X-ray system
to acquire and interpret X-ray and RGB-D images to achieve automated planning and guidance. Via mixed
reality, they will guide providers through the semi-automated workflow to ensure safe and accurate execution.
3) Demonstrate integrated system performance ex vivo: We will confirm the functional performance, reliability, and
overall system accuracy of our robotic approach through a series of cadaver studies.
 Our multi-disciplinary team will be the first to investigate tool-mounted robots for hard-tissue surgery,
paving the way for a new family of robots that are compact and exert sufficient force for bone surgery. Combin-
ing innovative robotic actuators with powerful algorithms for automated planning and remote-actuation will
provide alternative robotic solutions that will contribute to a more widespread adoption of robotic surgery."

 Anti-factor VIII (FVIII) alloantibodies, known as inhibitors, develop in 20-30% of patients with severe
hemophilia A following therapy with FVIII infusion. This, in turn, makes bleeding difficult to control and prevent,
resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, increased cost of care and decreased quality of life. Despite the
negative consequences of inhibitor formation, no prophylactic therapy is currently available to predict or prevent
inhibitor development. This largely stems from a fundamental lack of understanding regarding key pathways that
initiate this process. In order to effectively understand risk factors that may predict the likelihood of inhibitor
development and then prevent this process in at-risk patients, our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms
that initiate and then orchestrate inhibitor formation, in order to predict and then prevent the development of anti-
FVIII alloantibodies in patients with hemophilia A. This is in line with a key priority identified by the NHLBI to
identify key immune targets that may be used to prevent inhibitor formation.
 Addressing these pertinent clinical problems, recent data in a pre-clinical model shows that both depletion
of marginal zone (MZ) B cells and genetic deletion of type I IFN receptors (IFNRs) significantly reduces
alloantibody formation following FVIII exposure. Thus, MZ B cells and type I IFNs represent key initiating
pathways for inhibitor development. The hypothesis moving forward is that type I interferons (IFNs) directly
enhance the ability of FVIII-specific MZ B cells to generate anti-FVIII antibodies, traffic antigen to the B cell
follicle, and directly activate CD4 T cells following FVIII exposure and that patients with inhibitors display an
enhanced type I IFN gene signature. Using both a clinical and pre-clinical model, the first aim is to define the
role of type I IFNs on MZ B cell-mediated antibody formation following FVIII exposure and determine the type I
IFN signature in patients with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors. The second aim focuses on defining the
role of type I IFNs on MZ B cell antigen trafficking and activation of CD4 T cells. These studies possess the
capacity to not only provide new insight into key aspects of inhibitor formation, but may also provide an important
framework to develop rational approaches to prophylactically predict and prevent inhibitor development in
patients with hemophilia A.
 In addition to the important research aims outlined above, this proposal will allow for advanced instruction
in immunology relevant to the field of hematology as well as training in novel research techniques including RNA
sequencing and human sample processing. This will take place in the environment of a prestigious academic
institution with many opportunities for collaboration and mentorship. Completion of the outlined research and
career development goals will facilitate successful advancement to a career as an independent physician
scientist, combining the care of pediatric hematology patients with continued advancements in the field."

D43 Project Title: “Research Training: Chronic Non-communicable CVDs and Comorbidities in Peru”
Project start / end: 9/1/2021-8/31/2026
Chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of M&M worldwide and in Peru. In addition to the
usual CVD risk factors, social factors such a low socioeconomic status and environmental exposure further
contribute to chronic CVD burden. Among non-communicable diseases (NCDs), high prevalence of hypertension
with low rates of awareness, treatment and control represent an important health care gap that contributes to
CVD burden in Peru. This application for D43 Training Grant represents a collaboration between US
investigators (Washington University in St. Louis and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore) and
Peruvian investigators (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Universidad Nacional del
Altiplano de Puno, AB PRISMA in Lima and Puno). The D43 training program will leverage existing research
projects and infrastructure in Peru to train Peruvian scientists and health professionals in chronic NCDs/CVD.
Our group has been successful in securing grant support (i.e., NIH, Gates Foundation); however, the limited
number of Peruvian investigators conducting and leading NCD/CVD studies represents a significant barrier to
implementing an effective and sustainable NCD/CVD research program. The proposed training program will
provide support (tuition, stipend, research funds) for 14 trainees over five years: 8 master’s, 4 PhD, and 2
postdoctoral Peruvian trainees and/or junior faculty. The objectives of this structured program are to develop
the research careers of trainees in the areas of chronic CVD, stroke, implementation science, and environmental
exposure; to provide mentoring and support by an internationally renowned faculty with multidisciplinary
expertise; and to provide opportunities for career advancement and engagement in research projects. The
program will provide intensive training opportunities and build capacity in a range of scientific disciplines and
skills relevant to achieving research independence. The long-term goal of this program is to build a sustainable
and collaborative research-training infrastructure to develop Peruvian research scientists capable of designing
and executing interventions addressing unmet healthcare needs, including the translation of evidence-based
interventions and the implementation and dissemination of effective policies to improve public health in Peru.
This application is responsive to partnering institutions of PAR-18-901 including the NHLBI (HTN/CVD), Fogarty
International Center (global health and LMIC), National Institute of Aging (NCDs including CVD/HTN), National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (stroke), and National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences
(environmental exposure as risk factors for NCDs/CVD). The ultimate goals of this D43 training program are
twofold: 1) to equip outstanding junior investigators with the necessary expertise to solve challenging
problems presented by the burden of chronic NCDs/CVD in Peru; and 2) to complete a full transition of
program administration and leadership from the US to Peruvian MPIs, faculty, and institutions by D43 Year 5."

Helminth infections, which affect a billion people worldwide, especially in underprivileged counties, lead to the
induction of type 2 immune response to promote clearance of the pathogens. Interestingly, this type of immune
response is also induced in response to allergens and has been strongly linked to the development of allergic
disorders, such as asthma. Thus, type 2 immunity can play a protective or pathogenic role. The formation of
CD4+ helper type 2 (Th2) cells is a central feature of adaptive type 2 response, therefore understanding the
transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms that govern the formation and function of these cells has the potential
to facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions to promote their protective functions and/or inhibit
pathogenic responses with which they are associated. There is growing evidence that lipid metabolism plays a
crucial role in Th2 cells, but the exact mechanisms are still poorly understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, we
propose to assess the role of fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), which possesses acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS)
activity that promotes the activation of free fatty acids for fatty acid oxidation and complex lipid synthesis. Our
preliminary data indicate that FATP4 is a novel regulator of Th2 cells as deletion of this protein in T cells resulted
in an increase in the basal number of Th2 cells in the mesenteric adipose tissue and colon. Most strikingly,
deletion of FATP4 in T cells or IL-5-secreting cells led to increased resistance to a helminth infection, thus
establishing FATP4 as a novel regulator of Th2 cells. We hypothesize that the failure to promote fatty acid
activation in FATP4-deficient Th2 cells leads to an increase of free fatty acids that can promote the activity of
ligand-activated transcription factors, such as PPAR-g to restrain Th2 responses. To test our hypothesis and to
fully understand the role of FATP4 in tissue-resident Th2 cells, in Aim 1, we will examine the phenotypic and
functional consequences of deleting this enzyme in response to helminth infection and in a food allergy model.
This approach will allow us to examine the role of this enzyme in a both protective and pathogenic setting. In
Aim 2, we will utilize lipidomics and genome-wide sequencing assays to assess the changes in the intracellular
lipid content, transcription, and chromatin accessibility. The interactive analysis of the collected data will allow
us to define the molecular mechanism by which FATP4 regulates Th2 cells. Collectively, the result of this work
will provide us with an insight into the role of fatty acid metabolism in Th2 cells and has the potential to contribute
to the development of novel treatments for illnesses mediated by type 2 immunity."
10840291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this fellowship is to prepare applicant, Heidi Westerman, for an independent research career
focused on the biopsychosocial determinants of antisocial behavior (AB). The proposed fellowship consists of:
1) a research project that will further our understanding of the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on brain
structure and function and AB, and 2) a training plan comprised of formal training, mentorship, manuscript
publications, and professional development activities. The applicant will be supported by a strong mentorship
team with primary sponsors at the University of Michigan and consultants at Harvard, Northwestern, and
University of Pittsburgh. Together, the mentorship team will provide expertise in socioeconomic adversity,
neuroimaging, stress, reward processing, longitudinal data analysis, and the development of AB. The training
plan will help the applicant: a) develop expertise in associations between socioeconomic disadvantage, neural
reward-processing, and AB, b) develop strong, advanced quantitative methodological skills, and c) disseminate
research findings and network with the developmental, clinical, and neuroscientific research communities.
AB, including the psychiatric diagnosis of Conduct Disorder, leads to severe consequences for perpetrators,
victims, and society. Socioeconomic disadvantage has been identified as a risk factor for engagement in AB.
Though neural research related to poverty has mostly focused on affective and cognitive control, recent studies
suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage may be associated with alterations in the reward-related
corticostriatal circuit. Moreover, recent neuroimaging research has uncovered reward-related neural correlates
of AB, offering a potential mechanism through which socioeconomic disadvantage may shape reward
processing and increase risk for AB-related disorders. The proposed project will examine: 1) whether AB is
associated with altered reactivity to reward anticipation and receipt in the corticostriatal system, as well as
decreased grey matter volume in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex; 2) whether socioeconomic
disadvantage is associated with altered reward-related activity in the ventral striatum and decreased grey
matter volume in the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex; 3) whether reactivity to reward or differences
in grey matter volume provide a mechanism through which socioeconomic disadvantage increases risk for AB.
All aims will be investigated in the Study of Adolescent to Adult Neural Development (a sub-sample of the
larger Fragile Families and Child-Wellbeing Study), a large longitudinal neuroimaging study of mostly low-
income individuals who are currently entering young adulthood (R01-MH121079; R01 MH103761).
The proposed research addresses long-standing questions of the neural mechanisms linking adversity with
AB. Our findings will shed light on reward-related neural contributions to the development of AB and lay the
groundwork for investigating prevention and intervention for those at risk for detrimental outcomes."
10813045,"Mouse models reflecting human cancers are important tools towards the translation of basic science
discoveries to clinical therapies. However, rapidly evolving technologies within the last few years require
further refining current approaches that enable models to be more suitable in robust translational
applications to provide consistent information to meet patients’ needs. The focus of my first VA Merit award
was on the contributions of altered metabolisms to melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Results from these
earlier studies have provided understanding and knowledge in the rational conceived strategy of our
working hypothesis for our current VA Merit. In recent years, much has been learned about the molecular
pathology of melanoma and significant progress has been made towards its treatment, yet late-stage
melanoma still remains one of the least curable cancers with high metastatic propensity. The unique
mouse models established by our group where the ectopic expression of a normal neuronal receptor,
metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM1), in normal melanocytes leads to consistent, wide-spread
development of melanocytic lesions and metastasis to various organs including the lung and brain, two
common metastatic sites for human melanoma. Our focus is to take advantage of the innovative model
that mimic human melanoma with brain metastases to expand, improve, and transform the utility of
mammalian tumor models for translational research. Completion of our proposed investigation is an essential
step towards establishing fundamentally important and relevant animal models of human cancer that will
improve and save cancer patient lives."

Project Name: Helping Doctors Doctor: Using AI to Automate Documentation and “De-Autonomate” Health
Care
Project Summary
Clinical encounter documentation is one of the most time-consuming tasks of the ambulatory encounter,
taking approximately two hours for every hour spent with patients. Clinical note lengths in the US are longer
than those in other countries due to requirements to justify billing and complete quality care metrics. Not
surprisingly, clinical encounter documentation has become a major source of clinician burnout over the past
two decades. Although companies are selling technologies to transcribe what was discussed during the
encounter, these costly solutions reproduce what is already suboptimal about how we create and use EHR
information. There is a desperate need to reimagine the process of documenting as well as the content of
documenting a clinical encounter. In this application I propose to develop a new generation of automated
documentation algorithms—algorithms that can listen to the dialog between a patient and clinician, collect
quantitative data about these observations, combine those with existing electronic health record (EHR) data
and create relevant encounter summary information. These documentation algorithms will leverage the
remarkable progress we have made in computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning to
support image labeling, and other advances using EHR data. These novel computational approaches have yet
to be explored as alternative approaches to summarizing medical data collected in real time. As a pediatrician
and biomedical informatician who has acquired considerable expertise in real-world systems design,
implementation and medical data analytics, this project leverages many of my skills, though it is a departure
from my previous human-computer interface work. Rather, the goal of this project is to remove the burden of
documentation from clinicians to the extent possible. To achieve this goal, I will work with a multidisciplinary
group of collaborators, including computer scientists, technology engineers, and clinical domain experts.
Specifically, I will: (1) collect and analyze exam room video and annotations of the encounters to identify
salient characteristics of patients and their interaction with the clinician that led to specific diagnoses; (2)
apply natural language processing, deep learning, and computer vision methods to learn and characterize
patterns from vast streams of data using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Combining these
techniques to directly impact what is documented and how it is generated is a new area of investigation for
me and an approach that promises to support innumerable other projects including identifying implicit bias in
clinical encounters, enabling a new class of real-time decision making and improving the usefulness of
encounter summaries."
10907617,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Due to the inability of the dermis to regenerate on its own, large full thickness skin loss cannot be restored
naturally. The current gold standard treatment involves autologous tissue transfer in which the patient serves as
their own donor, which may be challenging due to limited availability of full thickness skin donor sites and donor-
site morbidity. Dermal Replacement Scaffolds (DRS) aim to recreate dermis, thereby preventing wound
contraction. Being cell-free products, these serve as a scaffold for the infiltration of cells from the wound bed that
organize to a functional, vascularized neodermis tissue, able to support a skin graft which is implanted as a
second step procedure, resulting in a healed wound with normal skin dermal/epidermal architecture. However,
because currently available DRS lack unique cues to guide such cell infiltration, they may fail to vascularize
sufficiently. The critical barrier to progress in this field is to create a scaffold that 1) promotes rapid cellular
infiltration and angiogenesis as required for neodermal formation in full thickness wounds, and 2) increases the
incidence and quality of healing in both typical/healthy wounds and difficult to heal sites.
To address this significant clinical gap, Fesarius Therapeutics, Inc. is developing DermiSphere™, an innovative
DRS product that will regenerate dermis in full thickness skin loss wounds much faster (≤7 days, i.e. >75% faster)
than the regeneration achieved using the market-leading DRS product, Integra®. Once dermis has regenerated
it can be covered with a thin epidermal skin autograft, yielding skin that is more flexible, functional, and resilient
than wounds healed with split thickness skin grafts alone. The commercialization of DermiSphereTM is expected
to improve clinical practice in the surgical fields where full thickness skin loss is common including, but not limited
to, trauma, burns, infection and post oncologic reconstructive surgery, by significantly decreasing the time
required to achieve a healed wound in a scenario of large full thickness skin loss, which will directly result in
decreased patient suffering as well as lower expenditure of valuable health care resources.
The objective of this Commercial Readiness Pilot (CRP) is to complete late-stage development and enable
Fesarius to achieve 510(k) clearance. Development of scaled manufacturing capabilities of the DermiSphereTM
product represents one of the most important obstacles that must be surmounted in order to achieve broad-scale
clinical impact of this promising technology. The Specific Aims for this proposed project are to (1) Establish and
validate a cGMP-compatible manufacturing process which will prepare the DermiSphereTM product for
commercial release (2) Design and validate packaging and validate sterilization of the DermiSphereTM product;
(3) Complete real-time and accelerated stability validation for DermiSphereTM and its barrier packaging; and (4)
Submit the 510(k) application and obtain clearance from the FDA."
10900446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People and other animals learn many of their complex and socially oriented behaviors by imitating more
experienced individuals in their environment. Vocal imitation is one of the more striking and readily
quantifiable examples of this type of learning, but the genetic basis of this complex trait is still poorly
understood. The goal of this research is to determine the genetic basis of vocal imitation abilities by
establishing the first mutagenesis screen in a vocal learning species and the genetic tools for independently
testing the function of the identified genes by developing novel transgenic models using germline gene
targeting technologies. Humans are the only primate and one of only a handful of mammalian species to
have evolved the facility for vocal imitation. Aside from humans, songbirds, and in particular zebra finches,
are the best studied vocal learning species and they provide the only practical platform for systematically
identifying the genes involved in this important social behavior. Like speech, zebra finch song is a culturally
transmitted behavior learned via imitation. Moreover, functional, genetic and molecular parallels underscore
the use of zebra finch for identifying genes essential for vocal imitation. We hypothesize that a forward
genetic dominant screen, followed by the detailed genetic mapping and manipulations developed through
this proposal, will identify convergent and divergent genetic signatures for this polygenic trait. Establishing
a forward genetic screen and the genetic tools for verifying gene function in zebra finches will provide a
novel, comprehensive, and broadly impactful approach for trying to understand the genetic basis of vocal
and social communication."
10887406,"It is estimated that roughly 10 million people fall ill with TB annually. Even when successfully cured with
antibiotics, TB patients often suffer from permanently impaired lung function resulting from infection associated
inflammation. Host directed therapies that limit nonproductive inflammation represent a promising tool to improve
disease outcomes. Development of these therapies has been hindered by the extent of heterogeneity observed
in individual responses to Mtb infection. To overcome this limitation, novel approaches must be utilized to
understand the pathways underlying these variable outcomes. The applicant proposes the use of the genetically
diverse collaborative cross (CC) panel of inbred recombinant mouse strains to characterize the features
underlying variable responses to infection. Preliminary studies leveraging the diversity of the CC founder strains
revealed that variability in unfolded protein response (UPR) activity may underlie the heterogeneity in immune
responses to Mtb infection. The UPR is a mechanism for ensuring endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and
consists of three distinct signaling pathways that initiate complementary responses. The activity of these
pathways is influenced by a variety of cell stress, homeostatic, and pathogen sensing pathways, emphasizing
the UPRs identity as a convergence point downstream of many potential sources of host variation. This proposal
aims to detail the contribution of UPR activity to myeloid responses to Mtb and to determine the feasibility of
targeting the individual UPR pathways for therapeutic intervention. The experiments proposed in aim 1 will
identify downstream correlates of UPR activity during infection and assess the contribution of the UPR pathways
to transcriptional response heterogeneity using single cell RNAseq technology. The studies described in aim 2
will characterize the consequences of chemical and genetic inhibition of UPR pathways on macrophage functions
during Mtb infection. Aim 3 will assess the impact of myeloid UPR pathway activity on disease progression
following pulmonary Mtb infection using a combination of genetics- and inhibitor- based approaches. Together,
these studies will provide insights regarding immune response heterogeneity and the contribution of the UPR
pathways to Mtb infection outcomes. The applicant will carry out the proposed studies as part of the Sassetti
research group at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. This environment will provide them
with the facilities necessary to complete their studies, and input from a collaborative group of scientists with
expertise in relevant fields including immunology and bacteriology. By completing the proposed studies, the
applicant will gain experience in a variety of experimental techniques, including single cell RNAseq, and flow
cytometry. Additionally, through the training detailed in the proposal, the applicant will develop the professional
and communication skills necessary for success as an independent researcher. Together, the studies and
training proposed within this application will provide the applicant with the skills and experience to run an
independent research program."
10699483,"Project Summary
African American (AA) youth between the ages of 10 to 17 are more likely to be obese than their Hispanic, White
and Asian counterparts2. Further impacting these disparities and their corresponding health risks, adherence to
physical activity guidelines is suboptimal, especially among AA families with adolescents3,4. Despite the
prevalence of obesity among AA adolescents, access to intensive behavioral interventions is a challenge,
especially for those living in rural areas who face limited healthcare options32 specializing in these
 interventions 33. In addition, transportation may not be feasible depending on travel distance, 33,34 and the types
of interventions do not address the motivational factors for AAs that interfere with adherence to evidence-based
recommendations. FIT Families, the intervention on which our proposal is based, addresses access issues
through an at-home evidence-based intervention. This proposal aims to expand the FIT Families intervention
through our innovation the Digital Wellness Nurse (DWN)-FIT that utilizes mobile technology and automation to
increase access, adherence and engagement in healthy behaviors using human-in-the-loop automation, web,
and mobile technology to deliver evidence-based interventions.
Specifically, this proposal aims to develop and validate a prototype of the DWN-FIT platform; evaluate the
DWN-FIT intervention (delivered by 4 Community Healthcare Workers) with 16 obese AA adolescents and
their families; determine the degree to which social support, as an additional element of DWN-FIT, enhances
engagement and retention of families in the treatment; conducts user centered evaluations that determine if
DWN-FIT met the needs of the families and Community Healthcare Workers during the treatment
In Phase 2 we will expand our randomized trial by increasing the number of participants and length of the
intervention, and evaluate the differences between the DWN-FIT and a standard treatment based on access,
adherence, weight-loss outcomes, and cost benefits. To further evaluate the commercial feasibility of the
DWN, in Phase 2 we will prove scalability of the intervention by evaluating the amount of automation needed
for the CHWs to increase the number of clients they can treat without reducing the effectiveness of the
intervention."

 The overall goals of this K24 renewal application are to continue to provide Maryam Asgari MD, MPH with
protected time to serve as a mentor to junior clinical investigators, and to support new scientific aims that will
build upon Dr. Asgari's established work on patient-oriented research in skin diseases. Dr. Asgari is a
nationally recognized dermatoepidemiologist and Mohs surgeon and the Director of the Patient-Oriented
Research in the Epidemiology of Skin Diseases (PORES) unit at Harvard Medical School. She is the principal
investigator of several large patient-oriented research studies, including two NIH-funded R01s examining
genetic and environmental factors impacting the development of skin cancer. The parent K24 award has
allowed Dr. Asgari the protected time to successfully mentor over 30 trainees ranging from medical students to
junior faculty. This K24 renewal award would allow her to 1) continue mentoring junior investigators,
particularly NIH K23 awardees, 2) pursue new research in cutaneous carcinogenesis with a renewed focus on
epigenomic changes in carcinogenesis and the role of dietary supplements in keratinocyte carcinoma risk, and
3) establish a new research direction focused on shared decision making in skin cancer care.
 The research plan (Aim 1) builds on an ongoing NIAMS- and NCI-funded portfolio of projects led by Dr.
Asgari. The proposed new aims will take advantage of existing data from these R01 awards and allow mentees
the ability to use existing datasets to examine novel topics in keratinocyte carcinogenesis. This renewal will be
an important catalyst for Dr. Asgari’s professional growth by enabling her to learn and conduct innovative
patient-facing research involving shared decision making in keratinocyte carcinoma management.
 The mentoring plan (Aim 2) in this continuation period will allow for the implementation of a structured
mentoring program tailored at the individual level to engage mentees using a formal individual development
plan. Mentoring outcomes will be assessed using a validated tool for anonymous feedback from mentees, and
mentoring skills will be refined by utilizing a mentoring coach. Dr. Asgari will continue her successful trajectory
of providing direct mentorship to dermatology residents, research fellows, and junior faculty at her institution.
Her plan for the next 5 years is to leverage her efforts for career development of patient-oriented researchers
at the national level.
 This K24 renewal will be an important catalyst for Dr. Asgari’s professional growth by enabling her to
conduct innovative research and mentor new investigators on performing patient-oriented dermatologic
research. The mentoring and research activities in this plan will open new opportunities for a long-term
professional trajectory that would not be attainable without a renewal period. By supporting Dr. Asgari’s efforts
in mentoring, the award is an excellent investment in the junior investigators at her institution."
10923920,"Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs, vapes, ENDS) are the most widely used tobacco product among
adolescents, aged 12-18. Despite clear connections between e-cigarette use, nicotine addiction, and physical
and mental health outcomes, adolescents continue to harbor misperceptions about e-cigarettes, perpetuated
by exposure to marketing and flavors, and a lack of understanding about their harms and addictive properties.
While schools have historically provided a key venue in which to implement tobacco prevention programs,
most school-based tobacco prevention programs focus on conventional cigarette smoking only, have had
mixed results, and have several gaps in their educational content on e-cigarettes. Further, studies have rarely
determined if there are specific groups for whom e-cigarette prevention and cessation programs are, and are
not, helping. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we developed the “Be Vape-Free”
Curriculum, a free 5-session school-based education, prevention, and reduction (de-escalation) program for
middle and high school students. This curriculum is part of and includes the most effective components of the
Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, a free online comprehensive tobacco prevention program used by thousands of
schools and educators across the United States, having reached more than 1.7 million middle and high
schools students. Aligning with the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, we have
addressed 3 of the 6 stages needed to adequately develop, evaluate, refine, and fully implement and
disseminate our Be Vape-Free Curriculum. Thus, the Specific Aims of this project are to: (1) Determine
whether the Be Vape-Free Curriculum is effective in increasing middle and high school students’ knowledge of
e-cigarettes and resistance to using, and decreasing their positive attitudes towards and intentions to use e-
cigarettes; (2) Determine whether the Be Vape-Free Curriculum is effective in changing middle and high school
students’ actual use of e-cigarettes (including preventing initiation, continuation, escalation; encouraging
decreased use and cessation; and use of e-cigarettes with other tobacco and marijuana products); and (3)
Examine the heterogenous treatment effects (HTE) of the intervention, identifying both those who benefit the
most and those who do not benefit from the curriculum. We will employ a cluster-randomized trial, stepped-
wedge design, with 60 middle and 60 high schools in California (n=10,800 students). Schools will be
randomized to either the treatment (Be Vape-Free Curriculum) or delay-in-treatment arm (i.e., standard health
education first year and Be Vape-Free curriculum in second year), with all students followed for another 12
months. The timing of this proposed research is extremely important as we have outstanding momentum, have
established an extensive team of school and community partners and stakeholders, have numerous schools
already interested in using the Be Vape-Free Curriculum, and have garnered tremendous support from the
California Department of Education and schools."

serotype. Secondary infections by heterotypic serotypes can lead to severe shock syndrome and death.
Severe Dengue disease is caused in part by cross-reactive antibodies elicited during primary infection that
can bind heterologous DENV serotypes but cannot neutralize them. Instead, these non-neutralizing
antibodies facilitate entry and infection in Fcγ receptor-positive cells, thus causing ""antibody-dependent
enhancement"" (ADE) of infection. While a live-attenuated four-component chimeric vaccine was recently
deployed in 19 countries and Europe, this vaccine does not protect naïve individuals against symptomatic or
severe infection, and may even exacerbate disease in some cases. Furthermore, the global emergence of
Zika virus (ZIKV), and the potential for ADE between DENV and ZIKV, raises concerns for vaccine strategies
containing most or all epitopes in the E glycoprotein. Nonetheless, the isolation and characterization of
protective and, in some cases, broadly-neutralizing antibodies indicates that certain epitopes within the E
glycoprotein may have the capacity to elicit broadly protective responses. Here, we utilize innovative protein
engineering approaches to develop “immune-focused” antigens as potential vaccine candidates, in which
epitopes that induce non-neutralizing antibodies are masked by engineered mutations or glycosylation. Our
hypothesis is that masking of these unfavorable epitopes will skew the immune response toward a stronger
neutralizing, protective, and broad response. Aims 1 and 2 focus on critical epitopes in DENV and ZIKV E
domain III (EDIII), and Aim 3 explores glycan masking of the ZIKV E prefusion dimer to immune focus on the
E-dimer epitope (EDE). EDIII is attractive for subunit vaccine design because it is the target of potently
neutralizing and protective antibodies for both DENV and ZIKV. However, immunization with wild-type EDIII
protein results in induction of both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies that engage a variety of
epitopes. We have used phage display to mask unproductive epitopes of DENV and ZIKV EDIIIs by mutation,
while maintaining neutralizing epitopes. These “resurfaced EDIIIs” (rsDIIIs) will be conjugated to protein
nanoparticles and their capacity to induce neutralizing and protective antibody response in mice evaluated.
To immune focus the prefusion E dimer on the EDE, we have developed a mammalian display system that
allows for rapid evaluation of E dimer constructs for binding to EDE mAbs. We will utilize this system to
screen variants with multiple engineered glycosylation sites that mask the surface outside of the EDE. The
most promising candidates will be tested for their capacity to induce EDE-like mAbs in mice. This work will
provide a proof-of-concept for novel subunit vaccine candidates against DENV, ZIKV, and possibly other
flaviviruses of global concern."

 Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 10-15% of people age ≥65 in the U.S. and will be
increasingly common as the U.S. population lives longer with chronic disease. People with PAD have greater
walking impairment and faster functional decline than those without PAD. Yet few therapies have been
identified that improve walking impairment or prevent functional decline in people with PAD.
 In people with PAD, ischemia-reperfusion of calf muscle during walking activity causes pathophysiologic
changes in calf skeletal muscle, including increased oxidative stress, myofiber injury, and reduced
mitochondrial activity. These calf muscle abnormalities are associated with functional impairment and
functional decline in PAD. Cocoa flavanols, from the seeds of theobroma cacao, the “cocoa” tree, have
therapeutic properties that may improve calf muscle perfusion and reverse the calf muscle abnormalities in
PAD. Pre-clinical evidence shows that cocoa flavanols increase nitric oxide (NO), capillary density, and limb
perfusion and also reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial activity in skeletal muscle. Consistent
with this pre-clinical evidence, in our NIA-funded pilot clinical trial of 44 participants with PAD, cocoa flavanols
significantly improved 6-minute walk distance by 42.6 meters at six-month follow-up, compared to placebo
(P=0.005). Therefore, we now propose a Phase III double-blinded, multi-centered randomized trial in 190
participants with PAD, to definitively determine whether 6-months of cocoa flavanols significantly improves 6-
minute walk distance at six-month follow-up, compared to placebo. In this revised application (original score:
36, percentile: 17), we will also assess the effects of cocoa flavanols on measures of nitric oxide (measured by
brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, calf muscle endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and calf muscle
phosphorylated eNOS), calf muscle perfusion, whole body oxygen consumption, physical activity, maximal
treadmill walking distance, and additional calf muscle biopsy measures at six-month follow-up. In response to
reviewer comments, new analyses are proposed to delineate mechanisms and assess persistence of the
cocoa flavanols effect on improved walking performance in PAD. If results from our pilot study of cocoa
flavanols are confirmed in a definitive Phase III randomized trial, this inexpensive, safe, accessible, and well-
tolerated therapy has the potential to meaningfully improve mobility in the large and growing number of older
people disabled by PAD."

Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) lie in close proximity to blood vessels in brain stem cell
niches and after transplant to treat neurological conditions. This adjacency allows for
considerable interaction between NSPCs and the endothelial cells (ECs) that form blood
vessels, creating an interdependent and complex relationship between these cell types. Human
NSPC (hNSPC) and human EC (hEC) interactions have not been well studied, creating
knowledge gaps that hinder our understanding of human brain function and repair after injury.
We used a tissue engineering approach with a a 3D scaffold mimicking brain properties to study
hNSPC-hEC interactions. We found hEC contact with hNSPCs induced the formation of GFAP+/
SOX2+ cells, which could be type B adult neural stem cells. Type B cells are slowly dividing
NSPCs that prevent depletion of the NSPC pool and may be activated after injury to help
replace lost brain cells. We found hNSPCs stimulate hEC vessel formation (vasculogenesis)
and this effect is mediated by hNSPC secreted components rather than hNSPC contact with
hECs. These data lead to the hypothesis that hEC contact promotes a type B adult neural
stem cell phenotype while hNSPC secreted components stimulate human vessel
formation in 3D niches.
We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims: Aim 1 - determine how contact with hECs
affects hNSPCs; Aim 2 - determine how hNSPC secreted components impact human vessels;
Aim 3 - test whether hNSPCs and hECs promote type B adult neural stem cells and vessels in
vivo. By investigating the crucial interactions between hNSPCs and hECs in 3D tissue
engineered niches, we will better understand how their relationship impacts human brain
function. This knowledge could be used in the future to optimize co-transplants of hNSPCs and
hECs in scaffolds to recreate critical niche interactions leading to formation of type B cells and
vessels that stimulate brain repair."

10700464,"In the last 20 years more than 3 million United States military personnel have been deployed overseas and
emerging evidence suggests that deployed personnel have a much greater risk of developing respiratory
diseases such as asthma. Among Veterans Affairs patients who were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,
asthma prevalence nearly tripled. Studies conducted by the Department of Defense analyzing military
encounter data demonstrate increased encounters occur for respiratory symptoms, predominantly asthma,
after deployment. One potential explanation is that U.S. military personnel deployed in Southwest Asia and
Afghanistan experience elevated exposures to particulate matter (PM) and other inhalational exposures
including desert dust and burn pit combustion. In particular deployed troops are exposed to diesel fuel
which is extensively used in ground equipment and in many tracked and wheeled vehicles. Thus,
understanding how inhalational exposures trigger allergic airway inflammation (AAI), whether this is
exacerbation of existing disease or precipitation of de novo disease, is a critical need in military population.
Allergen sensitized TH2 cells are required but not sufficient for the development of the allergic asthma
phenotype. It is clear from the literature that not all allergic individuals develop asthma upon allergen
exposure, despite systemic sensitization to airborne allergen. In this application we present compelling
preliminary data that neutrophils promote pathogenic T cell response in the airway following inhalational
challenge.
Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cell-1 (TREM-1), exclusively expressed on human neutrophils
and monocytes, serves as a global regulator of immune responses. TREM-1 synergizes with Toll-like
receptors, Nod-like receptors, and damage-associated molecular patterns to increase inflammation in
response to inhalational exposures. We hypothesize that neutrophils modulate T cell responses to allergens
in the airspace in a TREM-1 dependent manner. This hypothesis is built upon a growing body of literature
that demonstrate that neutrophils have an important role in the pathogenesis of AAI and our strong
Preliminary Data in TH2 dominant AAI. We demonstrate that neutrophils are present in high numbers
immediately following allergen challenge in asthmatic subjects’ airways, that expression of neutrophil
receptor TREM-1 exacerbates TH2 dominant AAI in vivo, and that neutrophils modulate T cell cytokine
production in a TREM-1 dependent manner.
In our Preliminary Data, we identify a novel TREM-1 dependent interaction between neutrophils and T cells
that may shed light on the mechanism responsible for the large increase in AAI following exposure to
airborne hazards in military populations. Using a TH2 dominant AAI model, Cre recombinase systems, and
adoptive transfer, we will determine how TREM-1 promotes AAI severity as measured by airway
hyperreactivity, cellular quantification by flow cytometry, cytokine levels, and histopathologic changes. We
will then determine if TREM-1 pathways are responsible for diesel exhaust exacerbation of AAI in this
model. Finally, we will determine the effectiveness of TREM-1 blockade in abrogating AAI following allergen
challenge and diesel exhaust exposures. Using in vitro and vivo systems we will define the role of TREM-1
regulated super oxide in promoting pathogenic CD4 T cell responses using human and murine coculture
systems. The goal of these studies is to identify novel therapeutic targets to modulate or prevent allergic airway
inflammation associated with deployment related inhalational triggers."
10832058,"Abstract
From a developmental milestone, adolescence is a very critical phase since there are a plethora of changes
occurring on different tiers - physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral. Any negative experiences at
this critical developmental period can significantly impact the outcomes with serious ramifications that could
persist into adulthood. This problem is further aggravated in HIV+ adolescents due to the associated stigma,
negative attitudes, and prejudice in society. Social defeat (SD) employing a resident-intruder paradigm mimics
bullying in humans and is considered a relevant animal model of psychosocial stress in defeated individuals.
While previous literature has reported the experience of social stress to correlate with a higher incidence of
stress-related psychiatric and addictive disorders, molecular mechanisms contributing to these outcomes still
remain unclear. Our goal is on discerning molecular mechanisms and focuses on decoding the role of
extracellular vesicles (EV) in exacerbating synaptic function and precipitating prescription opioid use in HIV+
adolescents post SD. Our preliminary studies using a preclinical model: HIV transgenic rats have revealed
alterations in brain derived EV (BDEV) sizes with HIV infection. Based on this premise, our overarching central
hypothesis is SD in HIV+ adolescent rats further exacerbate BDEV dynamics that aggravate synaptic injury and
precipitates prescription opioid use. Under Aim 1, we seek to elucidate if SD in HIV+ adolescent rats dysregulate
dynamics of BDEV biogenesis and increases vulnerability to prescription opioid use. In Aim 2 we will delineate
mechanisms associated with adolescent HIV+ BDEVs post SD elicit higher inflammation and exacerbate
synaptic injury. Upon completion of these goals, we expect to significantly enhance our knowledge of the role of
BDEVs to regulate brain function post SD in HIV+ adolescents and identification of novel BDEV protein markers.
Such information gleaned will further fuel mechanistic studies and eventually help develop future strategies to
treat and improve neurological outcomes in this vulnerable population."
10814248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although antiretroviral therapy drugs (ART) have prevented HIV propagation and increased life expectancy of
people with HIV (PWH), the rate of sudden death in this population is 2-4-times higher than people without HIV.
Autopsies have revealed cardiac fibrosis in half of this HIV patient population, a likely etiology for sudden death.
The protease inhibitor class ART (PI-ART) is linked to cardiovascular risk in PWH, and it is plausible that ART
can exacerbate the risk by inducing cardiac fibrosis. Our long-term goals are to determine the mechanism and the
impact of ART-induced cardiac fibrosis in PWH, and to explore preventive strategies. Transforming growth factor β1
(TGFβ1) is a strong profibrotic cytokine and platelets contain ~100 times more TGFβ1 than other cells and are a
major source of plasma TGFβ1 contributing to organ fibrosis. Higher plasma TGFβ1 levels and cardiac fibrosis are
observed in HIV+ individuals, but whether ART further increases plasma TGFβ1 and cardiac fibrosis in PWH is
not clear. In pilot studies, we observed that newer ART regimens, including PI-boosted dose of ritonavir (RTV) and
tenofovir, activated platelets to release TGFβ1, which can be blocked by Ceefourin-1, a specific inhibitor of MRP4,
a membrane transporter highly expressed in platelets from HIV patients. Injection of a PI-boosted dose of RTV
in transgenic Tg26 HIV mice (which exhibit multiple HIV-associated comorbidities) increased cardiac fibrosis and
diastolic dysfunction associated with the accumulation of CD206+ cells expressing αSMA in the heart,
presumably macrophages. These results led to our central hypothesis that ART may activate platelets to release
TGFβ1 via MRP4, which stimulates macrophages to undergo mesenchymal transition, inducing cardiac fibrosis.
The objective of this application is to determine the mechanism by which different classes of ART induce platelet
TGFβ1 release and identify the cell types to which TGFβ1 signals, leading to cardiac fibrosis. The following Specific
Aims will address the objective: 1) Screen a panel of different classes of ART, alone and in combination, for
induction of platelet release of TGFβ1 and identify the mechanisms of this process; 2) Determine whether
contemporary ART-mediated TGFβ1 release via MRP4 induces cardiac fibrosis in vivo; 3) Determine whether
TGFβ1 signaling in macrophages leads to mesenchymal transition and cardiac fibrosis. Our studies will clarify
the mechanism of ART-induced TGFβ1 release from platelets and the cell types on which TGFβ1 signals, leading
to cardiac fibrosis. We will use innovative techniques to evaluate platelet activation, measure plasma TGFβ1
levels, and assess cellular signaling and cardiac fibrosis in two murine models of HIV. Furthermore, our research
will explore the translational potential for mitigating ART-induced cardiac fibrosis in HIV mice with anti-TGFβ1 and
anti-fibrotic agents, such as Galunisertib or Pirfenidone. Our studies may also elucidate whether TGFβ1 could
be a potential biomarker of underlying organ fibrosis in PWH. It may also lay the foundation for better mechanistic
understanding and novel strategies for preventing comorbidities in PWH and fibrosis in other infectious diseases."
10907747,"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience profound, sustained, and
severe impairments in academic functioning and long-term progress, making the identification and evaluation
of effective approaches critical. Therefore, it is surprising that such little empirical work has explored effective
intervention approaches related to learning.
 This proposal will investigate the efficacy of common academic accommodations (extra time, frequent
breaks, low-distraction environment, and adaptive furniture) provided for children with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as classroom behavior management positive supports and
medication. There has not yet been a rigorous trial that investigates these interventions alone and in
combination with one another for children with ADHD in standard educational settings. Thus, in this proposed
study, the efficacy of commonly employed academic accommodations, behavioral support interventions, and
medication will be rigorously evaluated in a within-subject design in a classroom setting conducted under well-
controlled conditions in a summer treatment program setting.
 Specific aims for the project include an evaluation of the single and combined effects of behavioral
supports, medication, and academic accommodations. Further, the moderating effect of child characteristics
using standard diagnostic procedures as well as baseline neurocognitive functioning will be explored.
 Participants will be 288 children (grades K-5; 72 per year for four years; 36 per site), diagnosed with
ADHD. At baseline, information on comorbidities (specific learning disability, disruptive behavior disorder) and
neurocognitive impairments (processing speed, working memory, reaction time variability, inhibitory control and
attention) will be measured and evaluated as moderators. Then, in a within-subject design, all children will
receive each level of the behavior modification accommodations (i.e., no positive behavioral supports, positive
behavioral supports), each level of medication (i.e., placebo, .3 mg/kg methylphenidate) and each level of the
academic accommodations (i.e., extended time, adaptive furniture, frequent breaks, preferential/low distraction
seating vs. a standard classroom environment).
 Measures of key outcome will include objective measures of behavioral and academic functioning.
These include observations of behavior in the classroom (i.e., on-task behavior) and academic productivity
(i.e., work completion) in independent seatwork and group instruction settings."
10922705,"Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two fatal
neurodegenerative conditions with no current treatment to prevent, decelerate or stop neuronal death in
patients. ALS and FTLD are clinically distinct but show an overlap in postmortem brain pathology and genetic
factors: nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 in affected central nervous system (CNS)
regions is observed in 98% of ALS and 50% of FTLD patients. While initial symptoms lead to the diagnosis of
either ALS or FTLD, up to 50% of ALS patients eventually develop symptoms of FTLD, with ~15% of patients
ultimately receiving both diagnoses (FTLD with motor neuron disease, FTLD/MND). Mutations in the gene
encoding TDP-43 (TARDBP) lead to rare cases of ALS, while TDP-43 pathology is observed in patients
carrying more prevalent mutations, such as a pathological C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion
(C9orf72+)—the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTLD identified thus far. TDP-43 therefore appears
to be a pivotal and convergent factor in the pathogenesis of both ALS and FTLD. Despite this, however, the
reasons for selective vulnerability of motor neurons, the mechanisms responsible for TDP-43 mislocalization,
and the impact on neuronal health of nuclear TDP-43 exclusion and aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation
underlying cytoplasmic demixing remain unknown. To address this challenge, in Aim 1, we systematically
profile the transcriptional and epigenomic alterations of ALS and FTLD/MND patients at single-cell resolution
using post-mortem CNS samples. In Aim 2, we integrate the resulting datasets to study the link between
genetic, epigenomic, transcriptional, and cellular signatures of ALS and FTLD/MND. We associate these links
with available clinical information, elucidate the genes and biological pathways altered in each, and predict new
therapeutic targets. In Aim 3, we validate the molecular and cellular effects of these targets by assessing their
impact on neuronal viability and TDP-43 functions/aggregation using high-throughput directed perturbation
experiments. We study both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of these perturbations in
human dura fibroblast-derived iPSC neurons and astroglia. In Aim 4, we perform neuropathological analyses
of TDP-43 modifiers in ALS and FTLD/MND postmortem tissues, and endeavor to rescue in vivo pathology and
phenotypes in a mouse model. The resulting datasets, analyses, and dura-derived iPSCs will provide an
invaluable resource to understand the mechanisms of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD/MND, and may
reveal putative therapeutic targets able to mitigate TDP-43 pathology through genetic manipulation."
10911978,"The premise of this work is anchored on the observation by our group and others that: a) prior to treatment the
HIV virus inflicts bone loss in persons living with HIV (PWH); b) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) inflicts additional
acute bone loss, but the magnitude of this loss varies widely from person to person, ranging from mild to
profound, and occurs within a defined window (~6 months) following ART initiation and; c) As PWH age,
HIV/ART-bone loss is compounded by natural aging bone loss. We contend that the acute ART-induced bone
loss is due to immune reconstitution and is driven by T cell activation in response to microbial antigens and
intensified by HIV-induced gut damage and microbial translocation. Importantly, as this acute bone loss is
driven by immune activation, even newer ART drugs cause severe bone loss in susceptible patients.
Of note, immune activation driving inflammation is antigen-dependent. T cells recognize antigens via a vast
repertoire of unique T cell receptors (TCRs). Although ART leads to partial T cell recovery, as the adult thymus
is atrophic, T cells repopulate mainly via homeostatic expansion of preexisting memory T cells rather than de
novo. ART, thus, likely expands T cell clones that have survived HIV as they are hyper-reactive to persistent
self- and foreign-antigens. Microbial translocation due to HIV-induced gut damage may intensify inflammation.
Another interesting feature of the gut-immune interaction is Th17 T cell expansion and translocation to the bone
marrow where they secrete the osteoclastogenic effector RANKL, as well as IL-17A and TNF𝛼, both potent
inducers of RANKL. Further, LPS, a marker of gut permeability, is an inflammatory product that promotes bone
loss through osteoclastogenic cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF𝛼, and/or direct osteoclast effects via Toll-like
receptors including TLR4. It is therefore likely that HIV-induced gut damages enhance inflammatory bone loss.
Gut-immune interaction may thus explain the inter-subject variability noted in immune reconstitution bone loss
(IRBL) as gut leakiness and microbiome profile vary widely among PWH.
In this application, we therefore propose a mechanistic animal study to establish a role for antigen presentation
and microbiota in a mice model of IRBL (Aim 1), and a complimentary human clinical study to validate the role
of microbiota, Th17 cells, and gut permeability in ART-induced IRBL in PWH (Aim 2). Upon completion, we
expect to establish strong relationships between gut leakiness, intestinal microbiota, immune activation and
IRBL and demonstrate that these relationships vary widely from person to person. Findings from this work will
contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at identifying PWH at risk for severe IRBL and provide strong rationale for
exploring targeted preventive interventions including probiotics and/or CD4+ Th17/IL-17A inhibitors."
10868563,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The neural mechanisms of regulation support socioemotional competence 63,74 and may operate as resilience
factors in the face of developmental risk for psychopathology 13,17. Investigating how these neural mechanisms
emerge and change during infancy may identify critical periods of intervention and individual and contextual
factors that condition neurodevelopmental trajectories. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) Neural
correlates of regulation are well established in the adult literature but have not been examined longitudinally
during infancy. 2) The effects of temperament risk, parental psychopathology, and parent-child transactions have
only been linked to cross-sectional studies of neural activity, rather than to neurodevelopmental trajectories. 3)
The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the socialization of regulation and psychopathology in parent-child
transactions are poorly understood. In this proposal, the first two gaps will be addressed by the dissertation
project, and a plan is presented to address the third gap with the postdoctoral research.
 In the F99 phase, four repeated measures of infant electroencephalogram (EEG) from 8 to 24 months
postpartum will be used to map infant trajectories of neural markers implicated in regulation during childhood
and adulthood. The EEG data will provide two neural correlates: delta-beta synchrony and network connectivity.
At each laboratory visit, infant resting-state EEG is collected, and mother-child interactions are videotaped during
a 5-minute free-play task. Additionally, primary caregivers report on their child’s temperament and their own
anxiety at each wave. These repeated measures design will enable the applicant to address three main
questions: 1) How local and global neural mechanisms underlying regulation emerge and change during infancy.
2) How these neural trajectories are influenced by infant negative affect and maternal anxiety. 3) How dyadic
patterns of positive affect and responsivity in the mother-infant relationship impact these neural trajectories. In
the K00 phase, the applicant will use novel techniques to assess dyadic neural and cognitive activity in mother-
child interactions in order to map specific regulation socialization strategies to neural synchrony, joint attention,
and risk for anxiety.
 The current proposal entails an integrated pre- and postdoctoral training plan to prepare the applicant as an
independent researcher in developmental neuroscience. There are four overarching training goals: 1) Gain
expertise in the study of infant brain development. 2) Learn and apply advanced quantitative methods and dyadic
analysis to the study of brain development. 3) Expand dyadic analysis of mother-child interactions to the neural
and cognitive systems and. 4) Develop strong scientific writing and teaching skills. These training goals will
effectively prepare the applicant to transition from the predoctoral to the postdoctoral training and build a career
program that can be taken into an independent, tenure-track position as a developmental neuroscientist."
10875479,"ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint
inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These
immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically
meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response.
Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub-
optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive
costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to
identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor
response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal
in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients
undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.
 Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that
assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture
patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300
patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC
patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders
(more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO
compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were
associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically,
these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.
 In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring
and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics
using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major
pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of
these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape
(from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients
treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool
validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that
radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO."
10930849,"Suppression of the immune system following damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is a common feature of neurological diseases as diverse as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and glioblastoma (GBM). This immunosuppression causes mortality and leads to the failure of immune-modulating therapies. The underlying mechanisms of systemic immunosuppression following neurological insults remain largely unknown. In this proposal, we focus on the thymus, the primary immune organ responsible for T cell development in children and adults. We tested thymic function following various neurological insults, including viral infections of the CNS, tumors, sterile inflammation, physical injury, and seizure activity. All insults resulted in significant thymic involution that was reversible upon clearance of the injury. Importantly, thymic involution did not occur following peripheral insults. Using parabiosis, we found that thymic involution was transferable from glioma- bearing to non-tumor-bearing parabionts demonstrating the crucial role of serum-derived soluble factors in mediating thymic involution. Specifically, serum-derived molecules with molecular weights (MW) larger than 300 kDa were deemed immunosuppressive. Interestingly, the thymus is heavily innervated by the CNS, yet the role of this innervation during neurological injuries and immunosuppression remains unknown. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the thymus is heavily innervated by both extrinsic neurons (cell bodies outside of the thymus), and intrinsic neurons (cell bodies within the thymus) using rabies virus neurotracers. In short, the multifaceted immunosuppression following neurological insults alters immune homeostasis in the thymus, bone marrow, and the spleen. The extents to which these alterations in the immune organs induce transient or long-lasting immunological defects remain understudied. Thymic involution, presence of immunosuppressive factors in serum, changes within the bone marrow niche, and long-lasting immunological defects together account, at least in part, for immune deficiencies observed following neurologic injuries. Based on these data, we hypothesized that following neurological insults the brain suppresses the immune system both systemically and locally through soluble factors and innervation. This in turn alters the immune repertoire and affects long-term immunity. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three aims: Aim1: To determine the molecular identity of serum-derived immunosuppressive factors during neurological insults; Aim 2: To determine the function of thymic innervation at baseline and during neurological insults; Aim 3: To determine transient and long-lasting functional consequences of immunosuppression on the immune system following neurological injuries. Successful completion of these aims will significantly impact understanding of immunosuppression and nervous control of the immune system during neurological injuries and will help us develop new therapeutics to combat immunosuppression in a large cohort of patients with acute and chronic neurological traumas."

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a continuous lifelong condition that is highly prevalent, socially disabling, and in some severe
cases, physically injurious. DBS has emerged as a promising treatment option for addressing uncontrollable tics in medically
resistant and severe cases of TS frequently involving self-injurious behavior. We have undertaken a major informatics
initiative by establishing the International TS DBS Registry and Database, a multi-country consortium that has captured long
term outcomes of 277 TS DBS patients representing 50-75% of all TS DBS cases worldwide. From these outcomes, two
deep brain targets have emerged as potentially effective: the centromedian nucleus region (CM) of the thalamus, and the
anterior globus pallidus internus (aGPi). However, our current understanding of tic generation is limited by many factors
including a lack of animal models for TS, apparently normal brain structure on structural imaging, and the impracticality of
studying involuntary motor tics with functional imaging. Next generation closed-loop DBS systems can record brain activity
in patients with TS and identify the neurophysiological correlates of tics. Moreover, these devices can deliver stimulation in
response to a patient's symptomatic state. Our overall goal is to develop neurophysiology driven and connectivity-guided
closed-loop DBS systems for the improved treatment of TS. To this end, we will implant 8 medically resistant TS patients
with bilateral leads in the CM and aGPi. In Aim 1, we will identify structural network projections from CM and aGPi to guide
pre-operative surgical planning and post-operative selection of stimulation parameters. In Aim 2, we will identify
neurophysiologic correlates of tic genesis in the CM and aGPi. We will also study thalamo-pallidal network interactions
leading to and during tics. In Aim 3, we will test the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of closed-loop TS DBS. We expect that
closed-loop stimulation will provide more effective and personalized treatment options with longer battery life and fewer
adverse effects."

The proposed R50 award will support my critical contributions to three cohesive research programs conducted

flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and DNA2 nuclease/helicase, as well as how their functional deficiency causes
genome instabilities and cancer development. More recently, our research has expanded to characterizing the
role of exonuclease 5 (EXO5) in resecting androgen receptor-induced double-strand breaks in prostate cancer.
As the senior research scientist in the Shen laboratory, I have leveraged my expertise in biochemical and cellular
assays of DNA replication and repair, mouse genetics, and cutting-edge next-generation sequencing
technologies to continuously contribute to breakthrough findings that advance Dr. Shen’s research programs.
Since I joined Dr. Shen’s group in 2001, I have co-authored 50 peer-reviewed publications, including 17 peer-
reviewed articles resulting from my R50-sponsored research in the previous funding period (2016-2021).
Currently, I am supporting the CA073764 program by defining post-translational modifications (PTMs) of FEN1
and the dynamic interaction between Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) and histone deposition machinery as
key regulatory mechanisms for efficient and accurate FEN1-mediated OFM. The current goal of the CA085344
program is to define the roles of human DNA2 in counteracting replication stress. In support of this, I will lead a
team to determine how human DNA2 complexes process G4 and other non-B-form DNA structures to facilitate
DNA replication at telomeres and centromeres, using DNA2 mutant mouse models. I am also directing a portion
of the proposed research in the CA233664 program, which aims to define the etiological role of homology-
directed repair (HDR) gene mutations in prostate cancer. I created knockout mice for the EXO5 gene, which we
recently discovered to play a crucial role in HDR in prostate cells. I will lead the effort to define the causal role of
EXO5 in prostate cancer and reveal the underlying molecular events. These studies will leverage my knowledge
and experience accumulated during my previous research in FEN1 and DNA2. As an NCI-sponsored research
specialist, I have and will continue to maximize my contribution to science by leveraging the resources and close
intellectual collaborations available in an established laboratory within a resource-rich institution."
10869953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is the most frequent cause of death in United States hospitals, and the number one cause of
death worldwide, responsible for 11 million deaths in 2017. Primary drivers of sepsis morbidity and
mortality are immune exhaustion leading to deadly secondary infection, and organ tissue damage
leading to multi-organ failure. Despite the critical importance of these processes in governing ultimate
sepsis outcomes, we have an incomplete understanding of their kinetics and dynamics. We thus
propose a two-pronged effort to shift our paradigm regarding sepsis dynamics through plasma cell-free
DNA analysis. Specifically, we propose to 1) track the dynamics of organ-specific damage, and 2) track
the dynamics of T cell exhaustion during sepsis. We will do this through analysis of daily blood samples
acquired from patients admitted to the intensive care unit for sepsis. Methodologically, we will achieve
these through genome-wide methylation sequencing of cell-free DNA. Bioinformatically, we will then
perform CIBERSORTx deconvolution to delineate and quantify specific cell/tissue types contributing to
plasma cell-free DNA, thus enabling us to infer organ tissues being damaged as well as T cell
exhaustion levels from both blood and tissue sources. The methods we will utilize here are highly
innovative yet feasible given recent literature and our own preliminary data. Our proposed work will
form the basis for a rich sepsis-focused research program utilizing cell-free DNA analysis to
answer major questions in the field with the potential to ultimately improve patient survival for
the deadliest disease worldwide."

Introduction: The Respiratory Oxygen Adherence Monitor (ROAM) system will provide an effective, practical,
and affordable method to reliably assess and improve long-term-oxygen therapy (LTOT) adherence.
Problem to be Addressed: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over 15 people in the
United States; the condition causes more than 500,000 hospitalizations and over 100,000 deaths annually. LTOT,
which is generally administered to patients via a nasal cannula attached to an oxygen source, is the only
treatment that has been shown to improve survival in severe hypoxemia due to cardiopulmonary disease. The
improvement in mortality is greatest when oxygen therapy is used at least 16 hours/day. LTOT is also associated
with significant reductions in hospitalizations and lengths of stay, and improved quality of life. Despite the
benefits of LTOT, adherence remains a challenge for most patients. Furthermore, the ability to accurately assess
patient LTOT adherence is limited by current technology, all of which fail to discern whether the patient is
actually wearing the nasal cannula and inhaling oxygen, as opposed to merely having the oxygen source turned
on. Present measures also fail to provide information regarding the pattern of oxygen use for each 24-hour
interval. An objective and accurate method for measuring patient adherence to LTOT is required to increase
clinical effectiveness and improve outcomes.
Phase I Results: During the Phase I effort, a ROAM system prototype was developed and verified to be highly
accurate at determining when the user was wearing the nasal cannula and inhaling oxygen. The data recorded
include minute-by-minute classifications for adherence vs. non-adherence, which provide required and relevant
information regarding patterns of usage and overall adherence times.
Phase II Hypothesis: The SBIR Phase II program will test the hypothesis that adherence feedback provided to
patients by the ROAM system, which includes daily pulse oximetry measurements (a critical health status
metric), will result in increased adherence to LTOT.
Phase II Summary: In the proposed SBIR Phase II effort, the team will develop a commercial-ready ROAM
system using refined hardware components and the inclusion of a software interface that enables patients and
authorized healthcare providers to access adherence data, including pulse oximetry measures. The system will
provide patients with informational, attentional, and motivational feedback to encourage and improve
adherence. The proposed effort will also verify the accuracy and usability of the next-generation ROAM system,
and will culminate with a randomized, controlled field trial with COPD patients to demonstrate system efficacy.
Public Health Impact: The ROAM system will increase LTOT adherence, lead to improved outcomes for
patients with cardiopulmonary disease, and reduce the healthcare costs that are associated with expensive and
preventable hospitalizations due to non-adherence."

Humans have an impressive capacity to recognize the category membership of sensory stimuli. This ability,
which is disrupted by a brain-based diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia,
stroke, and attention deficit disorder, is critical because it allows us to respond appropriately to the stimuli and
events that we encounter in the environment. We are not born with an innate library of categories, such as
“tables” and “chairs”, which we are preprogrammed to recognize. Instead, we learn to recognize familiar
categories through experience. Our recent work has shown that both the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and
prefrontal cortex (PFC) are involved in categorical decisions. We recorded from neurons in PPC and PFC
during performance of visual motion categorization tasks. These recordings revealed that neurons in both
areas robustly encoded stimuli according to their learned category membership, suggesting that both regions
are involved in computing and representing abstract categorical information about visual stimuli. We also
showed that activity in PPC is causally related to categorical decisions, using reversible inactivation. This
project uses novel brain recording techniques to monitor the activity of large neuronal populations of neurons in
the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and superior colliculus during visual categorical decisions. This
will allow us to gain a mechanistic understanding of how interactions between neurons in these three regions
enable computations which transform visual feature encoding into categorical decisions. This work will also
determine how multiple behavioral functions are mediated by this brain network, including eye movements and
spatial attention, as well assess the causal significance of each brain area to categorical decisions.
While much is known about how the brain processes visual features (such as color, orientation, and direction
of motion), less is known about how the brain learns and represents the meaning, or category, of stimuli. A
greater understanding of visual categorization is critical for addressing a number of brain diseases and
conditions (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and stroke) that leave
patients impaired in everyday tasks that require visual learning, recognition and/or evaluating and responding
appropriately to sensory information. The long-term goal of this project is to guide the next generation of
treatments for these brain-based diseases and disorders by helping to develop a detailed understanding of the
brain mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and recognition. These studies also have relevance for
understanding and addressing learning disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, which affect
a substantial fraction of school age children and young adults. Thus, a detailed understanding of the basic
brain mechanisms of categorical decisions and attention will likely give important insights into the causes and
potential treatments for disorders involving these cognitive and perceptual abilities."

 Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited diseases characterized by dysfunctions in
lysosomes, with cumulative frequency of 1 in 7000 live births. Over 2/3 of LSD patients present an involvement
of the central nerve system (CNS) with a broad spectrum of severity (nLSD), which makes LSDs the most
common cause of pediatric neuronopathic diseases. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are main treatment options for LSDs. However, they are largely
unsuccessful in reversing neurological complications due to the poor penetration of the enzymes into the CNS,
a major obstacle in treating nLSD. The impact of the proposed study is driven by the unmet medical need for
efficient treatment of inherited nLSDs AND the major limitation of enzyme-delivery into the CNS.
 The cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) plays a critical role in lysosomal enzyme
trafficking and intercellular transfer for the majority of lysosomal enzymes, which is essential for metabolic cross-
correction in treating LSDs. Developmental decline of M6PR on blood-brain-barrier (BBB) during early postnatal
period in mouse and human is attributable to the lack of CNS enzyme delivery into adult brain. Using a dual
luciferase reporter system with site-mutagenesis, we have recently identified microRNA-143 (miR143) as an
epigenetic modulator to reduce M6PR protein levels on brain microvessels (BrMV). Using a mouse model of
Hurler syndrome (severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I, MPS I), which is caused by the deficiency of α-L-
iduronidase (IDUA), we demonstrated functional rescue of M6PR-mediated IDUA transfer in the brain of double-
knockout (MPS/miR-143KO) mice with long-term CNS therapeutic benefits, as well as in human vascular
endothelial cells by sequestration of miR-143 with miR-143-sponge sequences. The data provide strong
scientific premise for the development of a novel approach that would selectively “open” BBB to systemic
enzymes provided by any current treatment options or future enzyme/gene/cell therapies for synergistic CNS
benefits in many nLSDs. In this proposal, we aim to develop an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-based
translatable platform to “restore” M6PR pathway on mature BBB for advanced delivery of therapeutic enzymes
into the CNS with 3 aims, including developing optimal artificial miR143 inhibitor (143in) and expression
cassette(s) for robust and targeted reduction of miR143 on brain endothelia cells (Aim 1), in vivo examination of
“on-target” and “off-target” expression and effects in mice with AAV/143in delivery (Aim 2), as well as preclinical
evaluation of BrMV-targeted AAV/143in in correcting CNS abnormalities in MPS I mice by enzyme therapy
derived from genetically modified erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages (Aim 3). The studies will provide a proof-
of concept for a new in vivo miRNA-inhibitor mediated, brain-targeted approach that could be applicable for
many other nLSDs involving M6PR pathway AND neurological diseases benefiting from advanced CNS delivery
of therapeutics via adapting M6PR-mediated transport pathway by modification with M6P residues or IGF2-tag."

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen among pregnant women with prediabetes, obesity, and gestational diabetes, and their offspring has a greater risk for developing T2D. Yet, no current study addresses the long-term/longitudinal metabolic outcomes of the offspring when the mother is hyperinsulinemic. Furthermore, the mechanistic link between maternal hyperinsulinemia and the programming of metabolic disease in the offspring remains largely unknown. The dogma is that insulin does not cross the placenta into the fetus to regulate fetal growth. However, maternal insulin can act as a growth factor and an anabolic hormone binding to the placental insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) to drive critical placental function, including nutrient flux to the fetus. Thus, maternal insulin can change placental function by altering nutrient availability to fetal metabolic tissues causing permanent changes that predispose the offspring to T2D in adulthood. Indeed, we have compelling preliminary data showing increased body weight and glucose intolerance in the offspring of hyperinsulinemic dams. We identified that placental-specific IR deletion has a beneficial effect in improving glucose tolerance in the offspring of hyperinsulinemic dams. These observations provide a strong premise that the placenta integrates maternal hyperinsulinemia signals with placental nutrient flux to the growing fetus, thereby programming the metabolic health of the offspring. In this grant, we will test the main hypothesis that the increased body weight and glucose intolerance programming in the offspring by maternal hyperinsulinemia is caused by increased placental nutrient flux to the fetus, which is mediated by increased IR and IGF1R signaling and their downstream targets, mTOR and GLUT4, in the placenta. To test this hypothesis, we developed new innovative models of maternal hyperinsulinemia with or without placental IR or IGF1R deletion, to leverage and obtain a detailed in vivo mechanistic approach of metabolic and physiological studies in a longitudinal cohort of offspring. In Aim 1, we will define long-term metabolic outcomes and signaling mechanisms whereby maternal hyperinsulinemia regulates metabolic health of the offspring using functional studies with preclinical genetic models of maternal hyperinsulinemia during pregnancy with or without placenta-specific loss of IR, IGF1R, IR/IGF1R compound or mTOR. In Aim 2, we will determine maternal-to-fetal nutrient flux in the offspring with or without placenta-specific insulin-signaling or GLUT4 deficiencies. These mechanistic studies are highly significant because they will define the molecular mechanisms whereby maternal hyperinsulinemia impacts metabolic health, and they underscore the importance of clinically controlling insulin levels during pregnancy, similar to glucose, to improve pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the anticipated success of this project will have significant implications in improving women’s reproductive health and the metabolic health of the offspring."

To ensure proper morphogenesis and cell fate speciﬁcation, animals must generate highly stereotyped spatial
and temporal patterns of gene expression. To this end, transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA regulatory
elements such as enhancers to activate or repress transcription in particular cell types at particular
developmental stages. Many TFs are expressed in several cell types at multiple stages throughout animal
development. These TFs modulate diﬀerent gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in diﬀerent cell types, allowing a
single TF to specify multiple cell fates. Despite decades of research, it remains unclear how individual TFs are
able to perform distinct functions in diﬀerent cell types. One example of such a TF is the Drosophila Hox TF
Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Ubx speciﬁes third thoracic (T3) segmental identity by binding thousands of enhancers to
regulate hundreds of genes, modifying the ground-state second thoracic segment (T2) GRN. T3 is highly
modiﬁed at all positions along the proximal-distal (PD) axis relative to the serially homologous T2, including
morphological changes to the body wall, hinge, and appendage proper. All of these changes must ultimately
be due to Ubx activity. A primary mechanism by which TFs such as Ubx enact changes in GRNs is through
modiﬁcation of chromatin structure. This is largely mediated by TF interaction with chromatin remodeling
enzymes, leading to histone post-translational modiﬁcations and changes in chromatin accessibility at
targeted genomic loci. My proposal outlines a series of experiments to identify cell type-speciﬁc molecular
interactions that underlie cell type-speciﬁc Ubx binding, chromatin-modifying activities, and transcriptional
regulatory activities. Recent evidence from our lab suggests that Ubx chromatin remodeling activity is
spatially segregated along the PD axis in T3. In Aim 1 of my Research Strategy, I will test the hypothesis that
Ubx functions predominantly to either promote a more open chromatin state in intermediate positions along
the PD axis or a more closed chromatin state in proximal and distal positions along the PD axis. I will use a
novel technique developed in our lab called SpyChIP to assay Ubx binding in these distinct populations of
cells along the PD axis in T3. I will also perform ATAC-seq in these populations to identify changes in
chromatin accessibility downstream of Ubx binding. These experiments will provide information as to how TF
binding leads to diﬀerential chromatin landscapes in diﬀerent populations of cells. In Aim 2, I will test the
hypothesis that the zinc ﬁnger TF Teashirt (Teashirt) mediates Ubx repressive activity in the proximal domain
of T3. In this Aim, I describe both gain- and loss-of-function experiments to characterize the role of Tsh in
regulating Ubx repressive activity. I will also perform protein-protein interaction experiments to determine if
Ubx interacts with Tsh and other coregulators in a cell type-speciﬁc manner. Overall, these experiments will
elucidate the mechanisms by which a single TF modulates diﬀerent GRNs in diﬀerent populations of cells
throughout animal development to give rise to multiple cell types."

Despite progress in immunotherapies, there are significant challenges to overcome to make them
more broadly applicable to different cancers and more effective for patients. However, current
efforts to improve adoptive cell therapies and immune checkpoint blockade as well as cancer
vaccines are hampered by the lack of a method to characterize the functional and phenotypical
changes of different subpopulations of T cells over time at high throughput. The goal of this SBIR
Phase II project is to develop a novel flow-cytometry method that can solve this technological
bottleneck. The time-lapse flow cytometry uses laser particle (LP) barcodes to track each cell
across flow measurements taken at different time points. Built on demonstrated proof-of-concept
data, this project is focused on establishing a set of novel assays for characterizing T cells in
response to different stimuli in a time-resolved manner. The first specific aim is to demonstrate
short-term time-lapse assays to profile cytokine secretion (t-SEC). Secretion of TNF, IFNγ and
IL10 from millions of the same cells in response to different types of stimulation are measured at
multiple timepoints over 24 hours. The second specific aim is to demonstrate long-term time-lapse
assay to monitor phenotype (t-PHENO), including T-cell exhaustion over 10 days. The third
specific aim is to validate the t-SEC and t-PHENO assays with patient samples. The time-
resolved, high-throughput, high-parameter assays are expected to accelerate the development of
more effective and durable immunotherapies for cancer (>$100 B global market). Beyond
immunotherapy, time-lapse flow cytometry is also expected to be useful in fundamental
immunological research and vaccine development."

Pathology, which plays a vital role in clinical diagnosis, faces numerous challenges that impact its efficacy. For
example, resected specimens often require preparing and analysis of as many as 30-40 slide blocks under a
microscope until the disease is confirmed; selection of slices for slide preparation uses subjective methods such
as palpation, which depend greatly on the skill of the individual performing the assessment and introduces
inconsistency in the clinical process; and for each slide block examined, analysis and annotation requires manual
observation of every microscopic region of the tissue. As a result, most pathology evaluations often take 1-3
weeks to analyze samples and reach a conclusion regarding potential cancers. An added challenge is that
insurance reimbursements are capped per case regardless of the number of slide blocks processed, with any
additional costs being absorbed by the hospital. Consequently, hospitals must balance the trade-off between
minimizing the number of slices (for economic viability) and not compromising diagnostic care. These challenges
affect not only clinical pathology but also research involving pathology specimens and tissue selection for
biobanking. There is a critical need to eliminate subjectivity, reduce pathologists’ workload, and increase
throughput in histological analysis. We propose to meet this need by developing a new technology called X-ray
diffraction imaging (XRDI), which can scan any number of surgically resected, sliced pathology specimens and
automatically indicate the likelihood and location of disease in each slice within minutes. In collaboration with
Duke University, we previously built a research prototype XRDI system and demonstrated its utility by scanning
and evaluating 300 breast cancer slices with high accuracy and resolution. In this direct-to-phase-II SBIR
application, we will now construct a new clinical version of the XRDI scanner that is affordable, reliable, and
accurate, and can be directly integrated into the clinical pathology workflow. We will build the scanner, test and
evaluate its performance, and demonstrate its utility through field-testing in collaboration with clinical pathology
laboratories in the US. This project will provide a first-of-its-kind, commercially feasible XRDI scanner for rapid,
non-destructive imaging of pathology specimens with the ability to inform pathologists about the presence and
location of cancer within the different tissue slices. The proposed clinical scanner will enable: 1) analysis of the
whole slice volume of the specimen rather than a few microns at the surface of a subset of the slices, which is
the current standard of care process using microscopy, 2) quantitative identification of disease based on XRD
information obtained directly from the tissue, and 3) slice selection based on quantitative, reproducible
measurements, thereby eliminating user-related subjectivity. Importantly, it would significantly speed up
pathology workflow, providing decisions within hours instead of days, and improve the productivity and
profitability of pathology labs by reducing the number of slide blocks analyzed per case."

Lysosomal function is crucial for cell homeostasis, autophagy, nutrient sensing, apoptosis and tissue remodeling.
In lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), characterized by genetic defects leading to anomalous accumulation of
metabolites in lysosomes, cells are affected by lysosomal malfunction frequently leading to cell death. Cystinosis
is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from defects in the cystine transporter cystinosin (CTNS). Increased
levels of intra-lysosomal cystine lead to cell malfunction and progressive tissue deterioration, which is especially
manifested in kidneys. As with most LSDs, this leads to a slow but irreversible deterioration, organ dysfunction
and early death. Patients with nephropathic cystinosis develop proximal tubule cell dedifferentiation, Fanconi
syndrome and progressive renal injury, which are not corrected by the current therapy, cysteamine. Thus, cell
malfunction and tissue failure occur despite cystine depletion, suggesting that cystine accumulation is not the
only cause of all the defects observed in cystinosis. We recently revealed a defective mechanism of chaperone-
mediated autophagy (CMA) in cystinosis. Defective CMA is directly linked to human disease, including kidney
pathologies and neurological disorders. CMA defects in cystinosis are caused by mislocalization and
downregulation of the only lysosomal CMA receptor, LAMP2A. Defective CMA activity correlates with high
susceptibility to cell death in cystinosis. Importantly, the defect was not rescued by cystine depleting therapies
supporting that it is independent of lysosomal overload. Our data highlight that CMA impairment is an important
contributor to the pathogenesis of cystinosis and underline the need for new treatments to complement cystine-
depletion therapies. Our research plan aims to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to
abnormal CMA activity in cystinosis. We also propose translational approaches that utilize small-molecule
activators of CMA to improve cellular function in cystinosis. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To elucidate the
molecular basis of the regulation of LAMP2A function in cystinosis. To this end, we will study the interplay
between the CTNS protein and the CMA receptor LAMP2A and elucidate the mechanisms that mediate LAMP2A
trafficking and destabilization at the lysosomal membrane in cystinosis. Aim 2: To determine the molecular basis
of the regulation of CMA activity in cystinosis. We will study the mechanisms mediated by CTNS to regulate
CMA function and will test the hypothesis that the rescue of CMA activity improves the function of proximal tubule
cells from cystinotic patients. Aim 3: To utilize small-molecule CMA activators, in vivo, to improve renal function
in cystinotic mice. We will correct cellular and renal function in cystinotic mice using CMA activators, alone, or in
combination with cysteamine. Our research is highly significant because it aims to elucidate molecular
mechanisms associated with a devastating human pathology and will help develop new therapies for the
treatment of cystinosis and other human diseases."
10683170,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer deaths in the United
States with a dismal 5-year overall survival of 9%. Surgical intervention is currently the only cure for PDAC,
however, 80% of patients are deemed unresectable at presentation due to locally advanced and/or metastatic
disease. Existing therapies are often unable to downsize locally advanced PDAC (LAPC) for surgical candidacy,
and are also ineffective at providing distal tumor control. Therapeutic approaches capable of both local
downstaging and recurrent/metastatic tumor control are desperately needed to improve resectability rates. This
application will address the unmet need by translating an innovative combination immunotherapy to the clinic
and exploring its effects on LAPC in humans. Our recently published work demonstrated that stereotactic body
radiotherapy (SBRT), a less toxic, more effective strategy that focuses higher dose radiation precisely to the
tumor, combined with the potent immune cell–stimulating cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) encapsulated in polymer
microspheres (IL-12MS) resulted in remarkable tumor control and durable cure in preclinical models.
Microsphere technology represents an innovative tool that provides a slow, continuous release of cytokine
intratumorally while also protecting the labile IL-12 protein from degradation by proteases. The combination of
SBRT with IL-12MS not only strongly stimulated the adaptive arm of the immune system including cytotoxic T
cells to destroy pancreatic tumor cells, but also had a repolarizing effect on cells of innate immune system
converting typically immunosuppressive myeloid cells into ones with immunostimulatory potential. Moving this
promising therapy into the clinic, we hypothesize that combined SBRT/IL-12MS therapy is safe and
tolerable, and will improve progression-free survival and tumor downstaging to enable resection in
LAPC. In Aim 1, we will establish a clinical trial exploring the first-in-human use of SBRT followed by ultrasound-
guided IL-12MS delivery in patients with unresectable LAPC. The main objective is to evaluate safety and
tolerability, and the secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy and overall outcome. Aim 2 will perform corollary
studies on peripheral blood along with baseline and on-study tumor biopsies collected from enrolled patients.
These data will address whether SBRT/IL-12MS repolarizes the tumor microenvironment (TME) from an
immunologically “cold” tumor to one that is immunologically “hot”. Aim 3 will utilize preclinical modelling to
develop a strategy to treat metastatic PDAC using SBRT/IL-12MS therapy. These results are essential in order
to expand this therapy into metastatic patients where there are little to no effective treatments. Overall, our
proposed application builds on promising preclinical data showing the potential efficacy of combined SBRT/IL-
12MS therapy for patients with LAPC/metastatic lesions. This technologically innovative strategy utilizes a unique
strategy of repolarizing the TME to treat this recalcitrant malignancy for which there are few effective therapies."

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent responsible for the most severe form of human malaria, a
disease that kills more than 400,000 people a year, mostly young children in Africa. These protozoan
parasites invade and ultimately destroy circulating red blood cells (RBCs) of their host, leading to severe
anemia and the frequently lethal syndromes of cerebral malaria and pregnancy associated malaria. Over
the course of an infection, small sub-populations of parasites arise that have an altered antigenic
phenotype, thus avoiding the antibody response of the host. This process is referred to as antigenic
variation and is responsible for the persistent nature of the disease as well as the waves of parasitemia
frequently observed in P. falciparum infections. Antigenic variation of P. falciparum infected RBCs results
from switches in expression between individual members of the multi-copy var gene family. Each var gene
encodes a different form of a protein called PfEMP1. This protein is placed on the infected RBC surface
and mediates adhesion to specific receptors found on the endothelial surfaces of the blood vessel walls of
the infected individual. This adhesion is responsible for many of the disease manifestations of infection
with P. falciparum, including both cerebral malaria and pregnancy associated malaria. Only a single var
gene is expressed at a time by any given parasite, thus determining both the antigenic phenotype of the
infected cells as well as their adhesive properties. Therefore var gene expression is at the heart of both
antigenic variation and virulence of malaria infections. The long-term objectives of this project are to
understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate var gene expression and antigenic variation by
malaria parasites. Significant work in recent years has defined many molecular aspects that maintain a
gene in the active or silent state, however the mechanisms governing switching between transcriptionally
active genes remain entirely undefined. Moreover, given that an infection can include billions of individual
parasites, how they seemingly coordinate switching events to limit activation to a single or small number of
genes at a time is completely unexplored. In contrast, uncoordinated, random switching would rapidly
exhaust the entire var repertoire. There is no evidence of communication between parasites, and there
does not appear to be a strict switching order within the var gene family, therefore how this is
accomplished remains completely mysterious. The specific aims of the project are designed to decipher
the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. Aim 1 investigates the role of an unusual, highly conserved var
gene that appears to function as central organizing gene that coordinates switching events. Aim 2 will
determine how parasites sense the presence of a placenta and alter var gene expression to take
advantage of this unusual niche. This project will contribute to the ongoing effort to disrupt the process of
antigenic variation and thereby shorten the length of an infection and reduce its severity."

10915469,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The UMass Boston Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Partnership’s Research Education Core (REC) aims
to bridge the divide that exists in the biomedical workforce by increasing the number of UMass Boston
students, particularly those from underrepresented populations, to pursue graduate degrees and cancer/cancer
health disparities research careers. Utilizing evidence-based training that fosters the growth and persistence of
underrepresented students in the sciences, the REC provides trainees with science enrichment education and
mentored research experiences which emphasize professional development, inclusive support, and team
science across multiple disciplines. The framework of the REC focuses on three areas that are critical to the
development of research scientists: (1) acquisition of scientific knowledge; (2) development of communication
skills; and (3) individualized career development. The Core will provide four research education programs:
undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, graduate, and post-doctoral. Over the course of the grant cycle the REC
seeks to support 60 undergraduates (15-20 per year, minimum one semester or summer, 90% multi-
semester), 30 graduate students (6-8 per year, most multi-semester), 15 post-baccalaureate students (3 per
year for 1-2 years), and 2 nursing post-doctoral scientists (1 per two-year fellowship) in innovative research
education programming. Partnership faculty will mentor trainees and fellows at all levels. Recognizing that the
needs of individuals vary and that they change at each educational level, the REC will provide individualized
and developmentally appropriate experiences aimed at preparing students/trainees for the next phase of their
academic and research careers. The REC will continue to provide research opportunities for students at the
intersection between the natural/physical sciences and social/behavioral sciences. Over the past 15 years, the
Research Education Core (REC) has provided 347 trainees/fellows across the scientific preparation levels with
mentored research experiences and scholarly, scientific, and professional development that prepares them to
pursue advanced degrees & fellowships, and then to become cancer, health disparities, and/or biomedical
science researchers. The REC will continue to use innovative methods to assess the extent to which the
Partnership research education program is preparing trainees and fellows to successfully pursue a productive
cancer/cancer health disparities research career. The REC will also advance scientific knowledge on effective
research education programs through the submission of manuscripts to peer-reviewed publications regarding
the impact of Partnership activities on the diversity of the biomedical workforce and effective strategies for
developing research scientists from underrepresented backgrounds."
10887627,"The Small Animal Imaging Shared Resource (SAISR) at Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) is a
comprehensive small animal multimodality imaging resource that facilitates advances in the understanding of
cancer biology and the development of novel therapeutics. The SAISR enables noninvasive assessment of tumor
development, progression, and response to therapy based on multiple imaging technologies, including optical,
ultrasound, photoacoustics, MRI, CT, SPECT, and PET/CT. In addition to anatomical visualization, the SAISR
provides spatial and functional context for prognostic biomarkers and theranostic interventions. Under the
leadership of Ralph P. Mason, PhD, the SAISR facilitates and integrates pathophysiology, metabolism, and
receptor target identification with anatomical imaging. The SAISR provides SCCC investigators with assisted
and unassisted usage of imaging technologies, consultations on optimal imaging approaches, and hands-on
training in the use of imaging modalities. Since the last renewal, the SAISR has incorporated several new
approaches in order to stay at the leading edge of technology. Important enhancements in infrastructure and
capabilities include new photoacoustic tomography and access to short-lived isotopes generated by a new
cyclotron that provides multiple tracers, including 18F-MISO, 11C-acetate, and choline, that can be observed with
a new Mediso PET/CT scanner. There have also been substantial upgrades to the MRI facilities that significantly
expand the new preclinical radiation services so that investigators can use MRI and image-guided irradiation
inside a specific pathogen-free vivarium, complementing the existing instruments in conventional animal housing
areas. These capabilities of the SAISR were utilized by 41 investigators across four SCCC research programs
in 2019 and provided key data and insights to support the success of more than 30 peer-reviewed, funded
research project grants and 119 peer-reviewed publications since 2014, including work published in high-impact
journals such as Nature, Nature Communications, Nature Neurosciences, Journal of Clinical Investigation,
Gastroenterology, and the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In summary, the SAISR advances,
supports, and provides important cancer research imaging modalities to the SCCC community, enabling them
to efficiently test new therapeutic strategies in vivo as well as facilitate companion studies in clinical trials."
10908573,"SUMMARY
Palliative care can reduce physical and psychological symptoms, improve quality of life, and ensure goal-
concordant care at the end-of-life for patients with advanced cancer. There are persistent and worsening
disparities in end-of-life outcomes for African American patients which are confounded by the lower likelihood of
this population to access and receive palliative care. The basis for these disparities are multi-factorial, and at the
end of life, barriers include personal or cultural values in conflict with hospice philosophy, a lack of awareness of
hospice services, concern about burdening family, economic factors, and/or mistrust of the healthcare system.
The addition of individuals to the care team with a nuanced skillset focused on addressing such barriers to care
is a promising approach to enhance palliative care uptake. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are non-clinician,
culturally competent public health workers whose role is to promote access to services, provide health education,
support care delivery, and promote advocacy in underserved populations. CHWs supplement care for patients
with advanced chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and cancer, and their impact on improving
care in these settings is well-established. We developed an integrated CHW model – the Dissemination and
Implementation of a Community Health Worker Intervention for Disparities in Palliative Care (DECIDE PC) – that
utilizes CHWs as care team members to augment palliative care outcomes for underserved patients with
advanced-stage illnesses. In DECIDE PC, CHWs are trained to provide advocacy, support, motivation,
empowerment, and education regarding palliative and end-of-life care to patients and their caregivers. Our
preliminary experience suggests that CHWs can improve palliative care outcomes and improve patient and
caregiver satisfaction with care.
Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in palliative care for African Americans with advanced cancer.
Integration of CHWs as members of the healthcare team may be an effective means to improve access to and
enhance the uptake of palliative care in this population. To explore this, we will conduct a randomized
effectiveness-implementation pragmatic trial at four diverse cancer centers to 1. compare the effectiveness of
the DECIDE PC intervention versus standard care in improving palliative care outcomes, including quality of life,
receipt of quality communication, advance care planning documentation/discussion, and hospice use, and 2.
evaluate contextual factors that influence the effectiveness, fidelity, and adoption of the DECIDE PC intervention.
We anticipate this work will establish the effectiveness of a CHW-based palliative care intervention in a priority
population and generate generalizable knowledge to guide the development and implementation of interventions
to increase the use of palliative care services in underserved populations."

inhibitors have demonstrated increasing clinical traction yet conventional imaging such as CT scans
struggle to accurately assess tumor response in this treatment context. Serially accessible sources of
tumor and host biomarkers could add earlier insights into response this informing timely go / no-go
decision making to render precision immunotherapy. Innovation: In light of needed pre-competitive
nanotechnology tools for EV investigation to ﬁll temporal and scientiﬁc gaps precluding accurate
immunotherapy-based treatment monitoring, our group developed and validated a magneto-
electrochemical platform without need for EV puriﬁcation and capable of 96 parallel readouts within
45 minutes. This proposal exploits the bladder's intimate anatomical location within the genitourinary
system; urine would thus provide us with rich repositories of bladder cancer EVs. We previously
demonstrated feasibility of urine EV testing in kidney transplant rejection. Through increased excited
charges generated by inducing plasmonic resonance in gold nanoparticles, we recently accelerated
electrochemical reactions within our most current and scalable platform to achieve 12-fold signal
increase from EV surface markers. We hypothesize that advancing our nanoplasmonic EV sensor for
human urine and optimizing assay protocols to measure intra-EV and surface markers, could identify
high value bladder cancer and host biomarkers (protein and mRNA) to better examine their interplay
over time and under treatment pressures. We propose three speciﬁc aim: AIM 1: To optimize our
nanoplasmonic sensor (NEXT) assay and instrumentation for high-throughput urine-based analyses
and comprehensive proﬁling of both surface and intra-EV markers. AIM 2: To employ pre-clinical and
banked biospecimens for NEXT analyses to examine proﬁling performance and inform optimal
biomarker panel. AIM 3: Use NEXT to prospectively monitor and proﬁle urinary EVs from patients
undergoing immunotherapy-based therapies for bladder cancer. Impact: Our highly complementary
group of accomplished investigators bring to bear longstanding expertise and translational experience
in EV biology, bioengineering, systems biology, bioinformatics, and clinical oncology. If successful, our
urinary nanoplasmonic EV platform would add critical actionable insights into immunotherapy-based
treatments of advanced bladder cancers with promise in other prevalent genitourinary cancers such
as kidney and prostate."

Within each organism proteins are at work carrying out activities which impact every aspect of cellular function.
A key factor in achieving such a wide range of protein functions involves the post translational modifications
and sequence modifications that act to produce a vast array of functional protein states form a single gene
product. Such proteoforms are further coupled directly to the 3D structures of the biomolecules created, which
are further recruited into a wide array of dynamic multi-protein machines. Directly assessing the structures of
these assembly states, along with the proteoforms that they contain is crucial for understanding human
disease. Despite this, most structures remain unknown and are refractory to current technologies, and their
proteoform compliment remains opaque. Standard structural biology approaches (X-ray, NMR, and Cryo-EM),
while highly successful, require pure samples in large quantities, painstakingly optimized to produce
monodisperse protein populations in every respect, and to remove spectral background. Furthermore, transient
and polydisperse assemblies that exist within complex mixtures cannot be analyzed. Mass spectrometry (MS)
approaches developed to attack this challenging problem can overcome many of these obstacles. While these
tools are undergoing a rapid development phase, they currently lack the ability to discreetly assess the
influence of proteoforms on multiprotein organization. Consequently there is a need to develop improved MS
approaches capable of simultaneously assessing the structural proteome, enabling links between proteoform
composition and 3D structure for the host of dynamic, heterogeneous macromolecular complexes of clear
biomedical importance.
This renewal application seeks to construct new, innovative MS techniques that 1) utilize new classes of
chemical tagging reagents and mixed tagging methodologies to promote comprehensive sequencing of intact
multi-protein complexes, 2) leverage next-generation cyclic ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS)
technology to produce high-definition collision induced unfolding (CIU) and native top-down sequencing
methods that enable improved identification of proteoforms within assemblies, 3) produce new techniques for
the direct sequencing of membrane protein complexes, including laser-based activation of detergent clusters
for improved data quality, 4) combine electron capture dissociation (ECD) with CIU for on-the-fly annotation of
fingerprint data, and 5) automated methods for protein derivatization and clean-up compatible with native
proteomics. This technology will be brought to bear to discover the structures of a series of selected
proteoforms and complexes, each linked to human disease."
10898846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Novel strategies are needed to engage men in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) with HIV testing, treatment and
prevention services to drive the epidemic towards elimination. Suboptimal engagement with HIV prevention by
men increases their risk of HIV acquisition, and is an important driver of new HIV infections in women. HIV self-
testing (HIVST) addresses several key facility-based access barriers and HIVST distribution through leveraging
male peer networks for HIV prevention is feasible, acceptable and effective in SSA.
The objective of this project is to use an implementation science approach to establish the impact of HIVST
distribution through male social networks, with phone-based support and improved risk perception, on PrEP
uptake among men in Eastern Zimbabwe. The project will leverage infrastructure and data associated with 20-
year programme of HIV surveillance and behavioural research in a well-characterized population cohort hosted
by the Manicaland Centre for Public Health Research, Zimbabwe. The project is particularly opportune given
the very recent adoption of PrEP as a key component of the Zimbabwean national AIDS response and the
subsequent roll-out of PrEP in all local clinics.
The study will utilise a cluster randomised design of 44 clusters (22 Intervention:22 control) comprising on
average 81 men in each cluster (total N = 3591) followed for 6 months (giving >80% power to detect a difference
in PrEP initiation among men of 2% versus 8.5%). In intervention clusters we will identify initial distributors who
will receive an HIVST kit for personal use and HIVST kits to distribute to local peers. These peers can
subsequently become distributors, allowing the intervention to propagate through peer networks. A toll-free
helpline will provide pre- and post-test support and an SMS-based risk assessment will expedite PrEP initiation
at the clinic. We will conduct a performance (process) evaluation of the intervention. to assess implementation
fidelity, causal mechanisms underlying trial effectiveness including how characteristics of peer networks affect
outcomes. We will use the results of the study to quantify the population level impacts and cost-effectiveness of
male peer to peer HIVST distribution strategies on the uptake of PrEP in HIV hyper-endemic settings using a
fully calibrated individual-based mathematical model. The envisaged long-term impact of this research is the
development of a generalizable, multicomponent male peer-based HIVST and PrEP uptake model for settings
where HIV incidence is high."

Adolescence presents an ideal developmental transition period for an integrated intervention targeting prevention
of HIV risk behaviors and intimate partner violence (IPV), including sexual violence. Adolescent boys in particular
are at high risk for HIV and perpetration of IPV. Yet, few behavioral interventions integrate HIV-IPV prevention
and are tailored for the unique developmental needs of adolescent boys. In this study, we build on previous
scientific work that demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of Safe South Africa, an integrated HIV-IPV
intervention that uses a developmentally- and gender-tailored approach grounded in social norms theory to
prevent adolescent HIV risk behavior and IPV. We work in South Africa, a country with the largest HIV epidemic
and some of the highest rates of IPV in the world. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Tailoring Safe
South Africa intervention content to address the unique behavioral and social norms data that drives HIV and
IPV behaviors among boys in their socioecological environments. (2) Testing the efficacy of the Safe South
Africa intervention in preventing HIV/STIs and reducing IPV frequency among N=836 adolescent boys (ages 15-
17), with our working hypothesis that the intervention, relative to the usual care condition, will show (a) lower
incidence of any STI (including HIV); and (b) reductions in IPV perpetration frequency and decreased
endorsement of IPV supportive attitudes. (3) Identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing Safe South
Africa within a school setting to provide data for future dissemination (presuming Safe South Africa is
efficacious). We examine processes critical to future dissemination through (a) fidelity data examining adherence
to core active components of the standardized intervention manual guiding consistent delivery of the intervention;
and (b) qualitative data on the experience during and post-implementation from adolescents and stakeholders
using N=20 in-depth interviews."

of Dr. Ken Lau. This subcore will enable technologies for quantifying and analyzing protein expression at a
multiplex, single-cell level, greatly augmenting the histopathology capabilities of the TPCA on both FFPE, fresh,
and frozen tissue samples. While the primary mission of the TPCA is state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry,
research pathology and biorepository services, the single-cell analysis subcore will offer three cutting-edge
technologies: inDrop single-cell RNA-Seq, MxIF, and DISSECT-CyTOF, and their associated computational
analyses. The single-cell analysis subcore will offer services, from the preparation and processing of samples,
the generation and verification of epithelial-specific reagents, screening and validation of targets, and finally,
computational data analysis. Single-cell data will be synthesized and presented to investigators in adaptable
formats for presentation and/or downstream analysis. A specific strength of this subcore in relation to the GI
SPORE is that Dr. Ken Lau's research focus is on GI disorders and his expertise will greatly synergize with the
research of GI neoplasms. We can offer highly specific molecular assays that can flexibly query a wide range of
biological processes including the evaluation of signaling, cell identity, function, and behavior, all within a single
cell. The TPCA will partner with other established tissue collection and immunohistochemistry shared resources,
such as the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Translational Pathology Shared Resource and the Digital
Histology Shared Resource, to provide exceptional services to the GI SPORE in a highly cost-effective manner.
Close collaboration with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will provide the TPCA and GI SPORE with

11196503,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: P2. Targeting Glutamine Metabolism to Enhance EGFR Blockade in
WT RAS CRC
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. A wealth of
proteogenomic information has provided a deep understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CRC and has
led to improved classification systems of the disease. However, matching a CRC patient to the optimum
therapeutic regimen remains a major challenge. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; e.g., panitumumab) are approved for patients with advanced wild-type (WT)
RAS CRC. However, in late-line therapy, only 12–17% of patients exhibit durable responses to EGFR mAb
monotherapy and addition of EGFR mAbs to standard chemotherapy has limited clinical benefit. Clearly,
therapeutic strategies that enhance efficacy of EGFR mAb and/or overcome resistance are needed, along with
novel ways to prioritize patients for such therapy. The metabolic requirements of proliferating cells link signal
transduction with nutrient accumulation, resulting in a direct link between proliferation and metabolism.
Glutamine (Gln) is a key anaplerotic substrate used by cancer cells, providing energy, carbon, and nitrogen to
meet the demands of rapid and sustained growth. Gln replenishes the supply of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
intermediates used to fuel biosynthesis, and also plays a critical role in depleting cytotoxic reactive oxygen
species (ROS). In many cancers, EGFR and Gln cooperate to provide both `signals' and `fuel', which are
required for mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent growth and proliferation. The Scientific
Premise of this project is that Gln provides a `fuel' source to support EGFR-mediated proliferation; blocking
Gln metabolism will deplete a critical metabolic `fuel' required for cell growth and proliferation. The Overall
Hypothesis is that inhibition of Gln metabolism will enhance EGFR mAb therapy for a select group of patients
with CRC who have failed prior EGFR mAb-containing regimens. We propose to evaluate non-invasive PET
imaging as a biomarker of Gln avidity, from which we will develop a Gln PET-derived gene signature. A gene
signature of Gln avidity will allow this information to be utilized in lieu of complex PET imaging. Our project has
three Specific Aims. Aim 1. Conduct a phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of combined CB-839 and
panitumumab in patients with WT RAS CRC who progressed on prior anti-EGFR mAb therapy. Aim 2.
Evaluate quantitative Gln PET in EGFR mAb-naive and EGFR mAb-refractory patients to predict response to
therapy. Aim 3. Develop a PET imaging-derived gene signature of Gln avidity to predict responsiveness to
inhibitors of Gln metabolism. Spanning laboratory studies and clinical trials, deliverables of this project include
a new therapeutic combination to improve response and overcome resistance to anti-EGFR mAb therapy in
WT RAS CRC, as well as a new way to identify patients likely to benefit from inhibitors of Gln metabolism."
11196516,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: P3. Targeting MYC
Recurring genetic perturbations in colorectal cancer (CRC) activate MYC, an oncogenic transcription factor
that features prominently in human cancer. Despite the pervasive involvement of MYC in CRC, and a wealth of
studies demonstrating that genetic inhibition of MYC promotes frank tumor regression in mouse model
systems, MYC is generally considered undruggable. Indeed, there are currently no drug-like molecules
capable of directly blocking MYC function in cancer cells. Recently, however, we presented a new paradigm for
target gene recognition by MYC that also created a new opportunity to discover drugs that block MYC function.
We found that the stable association of MYC with chromatin depends on its direct interaction with the
chromatin scaffolding protein WDR5, which co-localizes broadly with MYC across the genome and facilitates
MYC binding to target genes. Structural analysis revealed that MYC binds WDR5 by engaging a shallow,
hydrophobic cleft on the surface of WDR5 that is well-suited for drug discovery. The goal of this project is to
target the MYC–WDR5 interface to discover a drug that will disable MYC function in CRC by preventing the
stable association of MYC with target gene chromatin. This project combines drug discovery, structural biology,
medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and cutting-edge genomic approaches, along with powerful model systems,
to identify, refine, and validate drug-like molecules that disrupt the MYC-WDR5 interaction, and to explore their
effectiveness as anti-cancer agents against CRC. Within the five year funding period, we intend to produce
first-in-class MYC–WDR5 inhibitors that will be fully validated for their utility in treating CRC and ready to
proceed to Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. Successful completion of this project will address
a clear unmet clinical need for targeted anti-MYC therapies, which are expected to have broad efficacy against
CRCs for which there are only limited treatment options. Drugs discovered in this program will likely also have
utility against a wide spectrum of cancer types."
10925251,"Project Summary
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a strategy to manipulate single mRNAs
in live cell and use it to study post-transcriptional gene regulation, which is essential for cells to
restrict proteins synthesis at the right time and place. It becomes a leading research focus
because of its importance in learning, memory, development and other fundamental biological
processes. Despite decades of research, the spatiotemporal dynamics of post-transcriptional
regulation is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of experimental tools to control gene
expression with high temporal resolution in subcellular compartments, such as leading edges of
moving fibroblasts, anterior or posterior poles of developing oocytes, neuronal growth cones or
dendritic spines. In this work, we propose to develop strategies to regulate gene expression at
the single mRNA level in subcellular compartments. To achieve this goal, we will create
optogenetic and chemigenetic tools to control single RNAs in live cells. First, we will use light-
induced or chemical-induced dimerizer to tether protein factors onto target RNAs. Because
proteins control the RNA metabolism, this allows us to regulate the fate of single mRNAs or modify
the coded protein anywhere in a cell by precisely manipulating laser illumination or administering
small molecules. Second, we will use chemically-modified light-sensitive guide RNA for the
recently developed programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 technology. We plan to
develop a light inducible RNA knock-down method and RNA binding proteins to modulate any
endogenous RNA. We will use the technology to study the decay mechanism by synchronously
induction of rapid RNA degradation. Combined with previously developed single mRNA
translation assay in our lab, we will investigate the interplay between translation and decay
machineries. By controlled RNA editing, we will visualize the distribution of newly synthesized
proteins from single mRNAs in neuronal dendrites.
 Gene expression regulation plays a central role in all biological problems. The tool that the
PI proposed here represents the ultimate spatiotemporal precision that one can manipulate when
and where a gene is expressed. It is comparable to RNA interference technology, with added
advantages of subcellular resolution, activating, repressive, and mRNA editing capability. The
molecular biological reagents and microscopy tools will be applicable to a broad range of scientific
community. This will allow us to address questions that cannot be answered before."

10903738,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has a devastating impact on Veteran health and is a leading cause of
both hospitalization and death. Early pathology of CVD is characterized by impaired vasoreactivity (constriction
and dilation). As the vasculature serves the critical functions of distributing nutrients and regulating blood
pressure, it is important to target early dysfunction in the vascular to further understand and prevent this
chronic pathology. We recently housed rats at thermoneutral (TN) conditions and observed debilitated
vasoreactivity along with high blood pressure in females, resulting in an animal model well-suited to further
CVD investigation along with sex differences in pathology. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), considered
brown adipose tissue (BAT), surrounds and regulates the vasculature. Remodeling of PVAT, or the change in
PVAT phenotype from BAT to white adipose tissue (WAT), may cause dysfunction in PVAT’s paracrine
signaling to the vessel. In a preliminary study, we housed rats at either room temperature (RT) or TN and
investigated their own PVAT or PVAT from the oppositely- housed animals along with each rat’s own aorta for
vasoreactivity ex situ. In aorta of TN-housed animals analyzed with PVAT from RT-housed animals, the
vessels showed a significant increase in vasodilation capacity, strongly suggesting that PVAT not only
regulates vasoreactivity, but can repair consistently observed TN-induced diminished dilation. We hypothesize
that PVAT whitening results in diminished paracrine signaling mechanisms to the vasculature, causing
damaged vasoreactivity. Furthermore, sex as a biological variable determines the pathology of diminished
PVAT and vasculature crosstalk. We will determine whether dysfunction in vascular tissue is governed by
altered PVAT paracrine signaling associated with PVAT whitening, define the impact of estrogen on PVAT
whitening and vascular dysfunction, and elucidate whether PVAT remodeling drives altered β-adrenergic-
induced response to temperature. Experimental results supporting these aims will not only generate novel data
on TN-induced PVAT regulation of vasculature and mitochondrial metabolism in female and male rats, but also
pinpoint sex differences in treatment modalities for impaired vascular function in all Veterans with CVD."
10925192,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long-term goals of this application are to develop safe, effective, and scalable interventions with a strong
basis in neuroscience, to improve the upper extremity (UE) function of children with cerebral palsy (CP). Our
UE intervention called “APPLES” is parent-administered, medical team-directed, uses soft constraint and
“sticky-mittens” and bimanual therapy. Our first R01 showed that it effectively improved UE function, cortical
somatosensory processing, and reach smoothness, while being safe for the developing brain and body in
infants (6-24 months) with CP. Our competing renewal addresses remaining gaps in knowledge: is there an
earliest age at which APPLES is most effective, can APPLES be successfully delivered through telehealth,
and because parents are delivering APPLES, are there evidence-based supports that we can offer them to
be more effective, and do all parents need these supports equally. We also specifically address new
NCMRR priorities for: (1) “multimodal approaches that promote plasticity and sensorimotor function”, (2)
“patient-reported outcomes as ... secondary endpoints in trials”, and (3) “development of scalable
strategies”. We call our new intervention APPLES-tele, as it will be delivered through telehealth and start in
infants as young as 3 months. In addition, we test the relative efficacy of APPLES-tele vs. standard care
group and vs. a novel parent-centered approach (PCA) that is infant- and CP-specific. PCA consists of
education in infant motor learning, adaptive strategies for CP, and positive psychology in parenting (from the
scientifically-proven Triple P Positive Parenting Program model). PCA will help parents develop
“authoritative parenting”, an optimal parenting style proven to promote better long-term developmental
outcomes. The design is a randomized controlled trial with both business-as-usual and active treatment
comparisons; two groups receive PCA and APPLES-tele, but in different order. The other receives standard
care. Both 6- week interventions will have the same weekly-telehealth schedule. Assessments are at
baseline, at 6- weeks and 12 weeks. We use standardized tests of hand function and development, validated
measures of parent-treatment fidelity, and parent-relevant measures of performance. Interventions and
assessments are protocolized and monitored to ensure rigor and reproducibility. We leverage a large cohort
of parents and children across 4 centers already linked through our successful implementation network for
early detection of CP, with diverse socioeconomic and geographic conditions in an area > 11% of the US.
We aim to demonstrate improvements in UE function are greater in the APPLES-tele-first group than in both
control groups after the first 6-weeks of intervention. Conversely, we will show parent CP-specific knowledge
and parent-child emotional connection are greater in the PCA-first group than the other 2 groups. We will
then explore whether relative efficacy of PCA-then-APPLES vs. APPLES-then-PCA on infants’ UE function

particularly from improvised explosive devices. These injuries cause damage to the corneal endothelium, a
non-proliferative monolayer of cells on the posterior layer of the cornea that regulates corneal clarity. The injury
may not initially affect vision because the corneal endothelium has a “reserve” capacity to withstand 80%
damage yet still retain function. However, the initial corneal endothelial cell (CEnC) loss can become significant
later in life, when additional CEnCs are lost during cataract (high energy ultrasound phacoemulsification) and
glaucoma surgery, conditions associated with both age and prior trauma with a high prevalence in the Veteran
population. Corneal opacification due to CEnC loss can only be corrected with corneal transplantation and is a
significant problem for both Veterans and civilians. This amplifies the need to identify sources of CEnC loss
and to minimize cell loss in these circumstances. There is minimal data on how trauma causes CEnC loss.
Preliminary data with post mortem human eyes show that CEnC injury from acoustic blast overpressure
exposure is not from immediate disruption of cell membranes, but from subsequent cellular and metabolic
injury. This provides a window of opportunity to intervene and rescue the injured cells. The objectives of this
study are to determine the signature of corneal endothelial damage from blast exposure in comparison to
iatrogenic CEnC loss and to determine if available pharmacologic therapeutics being studied for corneal
endothelial cell loss can be used to mitigate the damage to corneal endothelium suffered from blast injury. The
overall hypothesis tested in this study is that the mechanisms of corneal endothelial trauma from blast
exposure are similar to that from iatrogenic trauma from phacoemulsification and similar therapeutics will prove
to be beneficial for both conditions. This hypothesis is tested in three specific aims. All studies are performed in
fresh paired human post-mortem eyes where one eye serves as control and the other is exposed to the
experimental intervention. Aim 1 is to decipher the extent and mechanisms of corneal endothelial injury
following blast exposure. Eyes will be subject to blast injury from a shock tube device to generate acoustic
blast overpressure exposure. The corneal endothelium will be assessed immediately following trauma and at 3
days and 3 weeks following organ culture of the corneas to study the injury and healing response. Samples will
be analyzed for cell damage, death, proliferation, oxidative damage, and metabolism. Aim 2 is to compare the
mechanisms of corneal endothelial injury following blast exposure with corneal endothelial injury following
cataract and glaucoma surgical procedures. For these assays, eyes will be subject to phacoemulsification
damage or tube shunt insertion. Corneas will be analyzed with the same assays as specific aim 1 for
comparison to the effects from blast exposure. Aim 3 is to determine the effectiveness of pharmacologic
treatment for corneal endothelial injury following blast exposure and phacoemulsification injury with rho kinase
inhibitors (to enhance corneal endothelial wound healing), N-acetylcysteine (to reduce oxidative damage), and
ubiquinol (to support mitochondrial metabolism). In these studies, both eyes of a pair will be subject to trauma
by blast exposure or phacoemulsification. One eye will receive pharmacologic intervention and both eyes will
be compared for healing response focusing on the primary outcome of endothelial cell density. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide knowledge on the cellular and molecular signature of blast
overpressure injury on the human corneal endothelium, how it relates to common iatrogenic corneal
endothelial injuries, and the therapeutic response to drugs. These data will have significant implications for the
acute phase treatment of the corneal endothelium following blast or phacoemulsification injury. In addition to
benefiting military personnel who suffer blast trauma, these findings will benefit many Veterans undergoing
complex phacoemulsification cataract surgery by reducing the burden of blindness from CEnC loss."

at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) supports postdoctoral trainees developing
research-oriented careers in cancer pathology and is geared towards preparing them for leadership roles in
academic pathology and laboratory-based cancer research. Over the first funding period, the mandate of the
OPTIC program has been to attract and recruit the brightest pathology trainees interested in cancer research; to
pair them with faculty mentors representing the remarkable breadth and diversity of cancer research at JHUSOM;
to protect their time for an immersive experience in the research laboratory; and to involve them in a unique and
program-specific educational curriculum. With four postdoctoral trainees each year, the program is overseen by
internal and external oversight committees consisting of highly successful academic pathologists in cancer
research. Fellows select a research mentor from participating faculty – a stellar group recruited from the full
spectrum of cancer research fields at the institution. All are accomplished investigators with an expertise in
experimental cancer research and strong track records of laboratory-based mentorship. In addition to pursuing
a rigorous research program, trainees participate in program-specific didactics and workshops to develop skills
for their independent careers, and enroll in other course work tailored to their individual interests and chosen to
complement their previous experiences. Fellows create an Independent Development Plan with their mentor,
each trainee convenes meetings of an Individual Progress Committee, members of which provide feedback on
their progress, recommend specific near-term research goals and training activities, and are generally be

Mathematical learning disabilities (MLD) impact up to 14% of school-aged children, and are linked to high rates
of morbidity and poorer health outcomes making it a significant public health concern requiring
extensive health resources. Designing effective interventions to remediate MLD and identifying the
cognitive and neurobiological features underlying their efficacy are critical steps for addressing the public
health burdens of innumeracy and learning disabilities more broadly. Leveraging a productive, innovative, and
high-impact line of research, we propose to investigate neurocognitive mechanisms underlying response to
intervention (RTI) aimed at remediating core and persistent cognitive impairments in children with MLD.
To achieve this goal, we will use a theoretically-motivated integrated symbolic/non-symbolic (iSNS)
intervention with a randomized controlled design to enhance cross-format mapping between symbolic and
non-symbolic representations of quantities. We will develop innovative computational models to investigate
individual differences in latent cognitive processes, including evidence accumulation, sensitivity to item
difficulty, and performance monitoring, that underlie learning and brain plasticity in children with MLD. Our
central hypotheses are that (1) iSNS will remediate numerical problem-solving deficits and strengthen latent
cognitive processes in children with MLD, and that (2) plasticity of neural representations and
reconfiguration of functional brain circuits and networks will contribute to learning, retention, and transfer
in children with MLD. Crucially, building on innovative systems neuroscience approaches, we will leverage
novel computational tools and quantitative network analysis of functional brain circuits linking visuospatial
attention, cognitive control, and memory formation systems to advance foundational knowledge of the
neurocognitive mechanisms underlying RTI in children with MLD. Findings from our novel approach and
neurocognitive models will have major implications for informing the etiology of MLD, the neurobiology of
learning disabilities more generally, and the neurocognitive basis of individual differences in RTI.
Findings will also provide new insights into individual differences in learning, with broad consequences for
optimizing learning in all children. More broadly, our proposed studies will provide a deeper understanding of
dynamic neurocognitive processes underlying learning, retention and transfer (generalization) in children
with learning disabilities."

The Hedgehog (HH) pathway plays a pivotal role in diverse aspects of development and postnatal physiology.
Perturbation of the HH pathway and activation of glioma-associated oncogene (GLI), a dedicated transcription
factor in this pathway, is responsible for approximately 30% of medulloblastomas (MB), a common and
aggressive type of pediatric brain tumor. Therefore, HH signaling has emerged as a therapeutic target for MB
therapy. Despite the relevance of these insights to development and disease, substantial gaps still remain in our
knowledge of the mechanisms involved in regulation of response to HH signaling and crosstalk with other
pathways. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of HH signaling is essential to advance our
fundamental understanding of both developmental processes and HH-dependent MB. Combining a novel
homemade Pan-anti-O-GlcNAc antibody with proteome-wide profiling of O-GlcNAcylated transcription factors by
quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified a previously unknown mechanism by which the HH pathway is
regulated by glucose-sensing O-GlcNAcylation. Specifically, the core component of the HH pathway (GLI1 and
GLI2) is O-GlcNAcylated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which in turn regulates GLI transcriptional activity.
Furthermore, GLI O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by HH ligands and the mTOR/S6K pathway. Importantly, both
OGT and GLI O-GlcNAcylation are significantly elevated in MB. OGT inactivation renders MB cancer cells
particularly sensitive to radiochemotherapy, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation could serve as a novel potential
therapeutic target for MB. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that (a) OGT-mediated GLI O-
GlcNAcylation activates the HH pathway and promotes MB, and (b) dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation could
affect cancer cell sensitivity to radiochemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, in this application we propose to
dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying O-GlcNAcylation-activated GLI in the HH pathway, determine how
GLI O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by canonical and non-canonical HH signaling, and decipher the role of the
OGT- GLI axis in MB growth in vivo. Our studies could address important questions regarding a novel role of
O-GlcNAcylation in HH pathway and radiochemotherapy. Our multifaceted investigation is based on compelling
premises and will be carried out with strong scientific rigor, thus promising to fill a major gap of knowledge and
have a far-reaching conceptual advance in the field. From the translational perspective, elucidating the
significance of O-GlcNAc dysregulation in MB could provide a novel biomarker and a potential alternative
therapeutic strategy to treat patients with HH-dependent MB."

Currently available antiretroviral therapy is effective in treating HIV infection but cannot eliminate it. Once treat-
ment is stopped, viral rebound typically occurs within weeks. Infected individuals must take antiretroviral drugs
throughout their lives and, as a consequence, may experience drug resistance and side effects. Novel antiretro-
virals that can better treat or even eliminate HIV infection are highly desired. One promising and yet underap-
preciated approach is to develop therapeutics that disrupt HIV-induced downregulation of the CD4 receptor and
thereby unleash CD4’s remarkable inhibitory power to combat the infection. CD4 is the entry receptor for HIV
and plays a vital role in the initial stage of the infection, but its presence later in the virus’ replication cycle strongly
inhibits viral replication and sensitizes infected cells to immune-clearance. The potency of CD4 as an inhibitor of
the virus is reflected by the stringent, highly concerted mechanisms HIV uses to antagonize CD4. Two viral
proteins, Nef and Vpu, are involved in downregulating CD4 from the cell surface and from the endoplasmic
reticulum, respectively, leading to degradation of CD4 in either the lysosome (Nef-mediated pathway) or the
proteasome (Vpu-mediated pathway). The level of effort here by HIV is arguably unmatched—no other host
factors including the well-known restriction factors are antagonized in such a multifaceted manner. This suggests
that restoring CD4 levels in infected cells may be significantly damaging to the virus and significantly beneficial
to the host. Designing or developing therapeutics to restore CD4 levels, however, is greatly hindered by the lack
of high-resolution structural information on the pertinent molecular assemblies, e.g., how Nef and Vpu each
recruit CD4 into hijacked host trafficking and degradation machineries. In this project, we will solve such high-
resolution structures to gain the knowledge necessary for this drug discovery approach. Our specific aims are:
 1) Elucidate how the viral Nef protein hijacks the clathrin adaptor protein AP1 to enable the retention of CD4
 in endosomes, thus facilitating the delivery of CD4 to lysosomes for degradation.
 2) Reveal how Nef hijacks the host trafficking protein ALIX to channel CD4 into multivesicular bodies and
 lysosomes for degradation; investigate whether and, if so how, the ALIX-like protein PTPN23 participates
 in Nef-mediated degradation of CD4 and/or other host factors.
 3) Elucidate how the viral Vpu protein targets newly synthesized CD4 in the ER to mediate its polyubiquiti-
 nation via the β-TrCP/cullin1 complex, thereby redirecting CD4 to the proteasome for degradation.
Successful completion of this work should reveal opportunities for the design and/or development of novel ther-
apeutics capable of disrupting HIV-induced CD4 degradation, thus restoring CD4 in infected cells to inhibit HIV
replication or even eliminate the infection."

One in three Americans will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) if no new prevention and intervention
strategies are developed. The pathological hallmarks of AD include accumulation extracellular amyloid plaques
consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ), processed from amyloid precursor protein (APP), and intracellular neurofibrillary
tangles comprised of phospho-tau. These features are proceeded and precipitated by a wide range of intra- and
inter-cellular functions, with derailed neuroinflammation being among the earliest manifestations in human
brains. Of note, Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1, or YKL-40), an inflammatory protein mainly secreted by
reactive astrocytes in the brain, has been documented to be a powerful AD biomarker, and its cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) level has recently been reported to be potentially the first disease indicator. However, how it functions in
the brain and influences neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. In contrast, in
peripheral tissues such as in the pulmonary system, CHI3L1 has been well characterized as an immune signaling
molecule that controls many aspects of inflammatory processes via specific cell surface receptors and
downstream signaling pathways. Teaming up with leading expertise in CHI3L1 biology in lung diseases, the
Huang laboratory has gathered evidence showing that CHI3L1 is expressed more abundantly in astrocytes from
AD brains and can mediate the inflammatory signaling and cellular responses as in the periphery. Supported by
my own preliminary data, my central hypothesis is that CHI3L1 secreted by activated astrocytes engages a
neuronal receptor and triggers a signaling cascade in neurons that contributes to the inflammatory neurotoxicity
and leads to neurodegeneration and relevant AD features. My overall objective here is to define a neuronal
signaling mechanism whereby CHI3L1 regulates glia-derived neuroinflammatory response and the resultant
neurodegeneration. By using human neurons generated from pluripotent stem cells in single cultures and a
Chi3l1-floxed mouse strain, I propose to pursue two specific aims in order to test my hypothesis and achieve the
objective. In Aim 1, I will identify the CHI3L1 receptor and downstream signaling pathway in stem cell-derived
human neurons in vitro. In Aim 2, I will determine the effects of CHI3L1 expression on inflammatory neurotoxicity
in vivo in transgenic mouse brains with conditional Chi3l1 knockout and expression of AD pathology. My
expected outcome is to elucidate an essential signaling function of CHI3L1 in neurons in response to
neuroinflammatory stress. My results will reveal a mechanistic role CHI3L1 plays in the brain, departing from
being merely a biomarker for AD and neuroinflammation. There will be a positive impact as my findings can be
used in targeted therapeutics to combat AD. Finally, the primary responsibility of a F31 awardee is, in lieu of
performing experiments, to prepare him/herself for future success in research. With this regard, my major goal
of award period is to leverage the rich resources at Brown and execute a rigorous training plan that will impart
to me the skills, ingenuity and experimental acumen necessary for growth into an independent investigator."
10828321,"Meiosis is a highly regulated cellular process for generating haploid gametes. During meiosis, programmed
double-strand breaks (DSB) allow homologous chromosomes to synapse, crossover, and segregate
accurately. Chromosomal errors during meiosis are known to result in infertility or congenital disabilities.
Consequently, DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms are crucial during meiosis. A key DDR component
is the heterotrimeric RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) complex. In somatic cells, the 9-1-1 complex 1) directly
recruits DNA repair proteins to damage sites and 2) activates DDR signaling via interactions between the
phosphorylated C-terminal tail of RAD9 and TOPBP1, resulting in ATR activation, which in turn is crucial for
DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and overall genome maintenance. During meiosis, ATR is known to promote
homologous recombination and is a critical player in promoting meiotic silencing at unsynapsed regions.
However, the underlying mechanism of the 9-1-1 complex in regulating ATR signaling during meiosis remains
poorly understood. Adding to the complexity, additional alternative 9-1-1 complexes involving the paralogs
RAD9B and HUS1B form in spermatocytes. To test how all 9-1-1 complexes promote meiosis, we previously
generated testis-specific Rad1 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice and observed severe asynapsis,
compromised DSB repair, impaired meiotic silencing, and ATR signaling defects. Since Rad1 deletion disrupts
clamp formation, the Rad1 CKO model does not differentiate between the signaling-dependent and
independent roles of the 9-1-1 complexes in meiosis. To specifically understand the biological functions of 9-1-
1 mediated ATR activation, we developed separation-of-function mutants with serine-to-alanine (SA) mutations
in the C-terminal tail of RAD9A and RAD9B that disrupt RAD9-TOPBP1 interactions. These mouse mutants
were viable, whereas null mutations in Rad9a or Rad9b cause embryonic lethality. Rad9aSA/SA and Rad9bSA/SA
single mutants were inter-crossed to generate Rad9aSA/SA/9bSA/SA double mutants in which 9-1-1/ATR signaling
is predicted to be fully disabled. In Aim 1, I will determine the effects of 9-1-1-dependent ATR signaling
disruption on fertility and gametogenesis, including its impact on the repair of programmed DSBs, pairing of
homologous chromosomes, and meiotic silencing during prophase I. In addition, I will compare the meiotic
effects of ATR signaling disruption in Rad9 single or double mutants to determine overlapping or differential
functions between the canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes. In Aim 2, I will analyze how RAD9-TOPBP1
interactions influence the phosphorylation of known and novel ATR substrates during meiosis. New 911- and
ATR- dependent targets will be identified by systematic analysis of whole testes phosphoproteomes from
Rad9aSA/SA/9bSA/SA, Rad1 CKO and ATR inhibitor-treated (ATRi) mice. Due to the importance of ATR signaling
in meiosis, it is imperative to shed light on how the meiotic 9-1-1/ATR signaling network enables high-fidelity
gamete production, with important implications for human fertility and congenital disabilities."

 Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. This optic neuropathy is often
associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and all current treatments seek to reduce IOP to prevent
further vision loss. The current first-line treatment is the use of daily topical eye drop medications, which are
notably associated with low adherence rates and systemic side effects. Patients may go on to require surgery,
with potential for revisions and complications. Thus, improved technologies for IOP control are a pressing unmet
need. We previously demonstrated that expansion of the suprachoroidal space (SCS) of the eye using a hydrogel
injected via a microneedle (MN) reduces IOP for up to 4 months in rabbits, likely due to increased aqueous
humor outflow through the unconventional drainage pathway.
 In this project, our long-term goal is to develop hydrogel-based SCS expansion as a novel glaucoma
treatment complementary to topical eyedrops and surgery. As a non-drug, non-surgical method, we expect that
this treatment approach can greatly improve patient adherence and treatment outcomes as compared to existing
approaches. The objectives of this proposal are to: (i) more definitively elucidate the mechanism of IOP
reduction due to SCS expansion; (ii) develop a hydrogel formulation that provides IOP reduction for at least 6
months after a single treatment, which will offer significant translational potential; and (iii) further investigate the
safety and efficacy of this treatment method. To achieve Aim 1, we will measure changes to aqueous humor
outflow through the conventional and unconventional pathways following hydrogel injections. Factors that may
affect hydrogel degradation, such as ciliary muscle contraction, will also be evaluated using a pharmacologic
agent that modifies ciliary muscle action in conjunction with hydrogel injection. In Aim 2, a slowly degrading
enzyme-digestible hydrogel will be developed to provide a longer duration of IOP reduction that can be
controlled/reversed by a healthcare provider. Aim 3 will assess the safety and efficacy of this treatment method
and the feasibility of repeat injections. The outcome of this work will be a novel glaucoma treatment method for
long-term IOP reduction, including evaluations in animal models, that will pave the way for future clinical trials.
 My training plan provides excellent mentorship under my PhD thesis advisors, Drs. Ross Ethier and Mark
Prausnitz, whose expertise in glaucoma and drug delivery methods, respectively, will equip me with a strong
foundation in translational vision research and advance my professional development. My collaborators will also
provide guidance, such as for evaluating aqueous humor outflow in Aim 1 and hydrogel fabrication in Aim 2. I
have planned for longitudinal clinical experiences during my PhD that will prepare me for the last year of my
medical school and for residency training. I have intentionally chosen my thesis to align with my clinical interests,
and this training fellowship will be invaluable preparation for my career as a scientist and clinician in this field."

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a debilitating condition that contributes to high morbidity and poor quality
of life. A risk factor for the development of IBD is a ‘leaky gut’ phenotype where elevated amounts of microbially-
derived antigenic material traverse the gut epithelium into sub-epithelial compartments provoking a dysregulated
inflammatory loop. Therefore, maintaining a strong intestinal epithelial barrier is vital to avoid overt gut
inflammation. By extension, identifying the molecular mechanisms that function in preserving gut epithelial barrier
integrity is critical for understanding optimal intestinal health. There is mounting evidence that bioactive
metabolites generated by the gut microbiome exert profound influence on gut epithelial barrier integrity. However,
we know little about how these bioactive metabolites mechanistically influence host biology. Employing mass
spectrometry-based metabolomics platforms for analysis of small molecules, our research group demonstrated
remarkable differences in the metabolite composition of germ-free and conventional mice, and identified novel
small molecules of microbial origin. The most discriminative molecule was δ-valerobetaine (VB). VB structurally
resembles γ-butyrobetaine, the immediate biosynthetic precursor to carnitine, which is required for mitochondrial
fatty acid oxidation, suggesting a role for VB in controlling energy metabolism in the mitochondria. We also
confirmed that VB is undetectable in germ-free mice and their mitochondria, but present in conventionalized mice
and their mitochondria. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that VB inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
through decreasing cellular carnitine levels. Importantly, the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche is tightly regulated
by numerous host-derived and luminal-derived factors, while the plasticity of the ISC niche is associated with
cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function. In addition, some gastrointestinal diseases such as IBD are
characterized by modifications in mitochondrial function. In preliminary data, we show that VB administration to
germ-free mice induces mitochondrial biogenesis in the gut epithelium, and induces cell proliferation in the
intestinal crypt. We hypothesize that VB derived from the microbiome can influence mitochondrial bioenergetics
in cells within the intestinal epithelium, and functions as a central integrator whereby the microbiota influences
gut cell homeostasis, gut epithelia barrier integrity, and tissue restitution following injury. I will test this hypothesis
by the following specific aims, 1) to characterize the effect of VB on mitochondria function in gut tissue
homeostasis, and 2) to determine the impact of VB on gut epithelial restitution in murine injury models. These
aims will be carried out using a variety of methods in which I will be trained, including 3D ex vivo organoid models,
mouse models of colitis and epithelial restitution, and gnotobiotic mice. The long-term goal of this research is to
understand the role of VB in gut health and identify the therapeutic potential of VB as a treatment for IBD."

We have limited understanding of how uterine contractions develop and become sufficiently coordinated to expel
the fetus at term. For example, we lack answers to basic questions about labor such as where contractions
initiate, how fast contractions propagate, which regions of the uterus are active during contractions, and how
these measures change as labor progresses. To address this knowledge gap, a new imaging technology,
Electromyometrial Imaging (EMMI) was recently developed and validated in a translational sheep model. EMMI
employs magnetic resonance imaging to acquire a subject-specific body-uterus geometry, then combines the
resulting data with electrophysiological data collected from up to 256 electrodes on the abdominal surface. With
EMMI, it is possible to noninvasively image the electrical activation and conduction patterns during contractions
across the entire uterus in three dimensions. Preliminary data indicate that EMMI can be used to systematically
characterize contractions during normal term labor in humans. Additionally, three proposed features of uterine
electrical activity, termed ""contraction indices"", appear to correlate with time until delivery. The objectives of this
proposal are to use EMMI to create a ""normal term atlas"" describing the 3D electrical activation patterns of
human uterine contractions at high spatial and temporal resolution across labor, and to use this atlas to begin to
identify contraction features associated with impending labor arrest. Aim 1 is to define the uterine electrical
maturation and contraction patterns during labor in term nulliparous women. In this Aim, EMMI will be conducted
on 430 nulliparous women throughout labor, and data will be analyzed from the 365 women who are anticipated
to have normal term labor. This aim tests the hypothesis that at least one of the EMMI-derived uterine contraction
indices can precisely reflect progression of normal term labor in nulliparous women, and can reliably differentiate
the different phases of the first stage of labor. Exploratory Aim 2 will evaluate uterine electrical contraction
patterns during labor in the anticipated 75 women from Aim1 who experience labor arrest. This exploratory aim
will provide the basis for a future larger EMMI study to fully characterize the spatial-temporal signatures of uterine
contractions in patients who develop arrested labor. In completing these two aims, this project will generate
physiologically normal standards of uterine contraction indices of nulliparous women during the progress of term
labor. These normal standards will permit future in-depth clinical investigations of the factors leading to
dysfunctional labor. Moreover, they may, in the longer term, serve as standards for monitoring pregnancy and
labor progression and assessing the effectiveness of treatment strategies to manage labor and prevent labor
complications such as preterm birth, labor arrest, and postpartum hemorrhage."
10914839,"Mitochondrial protein homeostasis (proteostasis) has been implicated in cancer and is
regulated by mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). However, it is unknown whether
UPRmt promotes tumorigenesis and whether it could be targeted for therapeutic benefit in prostate
cancer (PCa). This proposal will define how heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), a key component of
UPRmt, promotes aggressive and resistant PCa. Using genetically-engineered triple knockout (TKO:
deletion of Pten, Trp53, and Rb1) tumors, we observed that HSP60 is upregulated in aggressive
tumors and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to WT prostatic tissues. TCGA
data analysis and our preliminary data using human PCa-specific TMAs demonstrated that HSP60
is upregulated in prostate tumors with higher Gleason Scores. HSP60-silencing induced caspase
activation and inhibited cellular proliferation whereas HSP60 overexpression promoted cancer cell
survival and proliferation. We provide the first evidence that, genetic deletion of HSP60 in TKO
mouse and inhibition of HSP60 oligomerization by introducing HSP60D3G KI during prostate
tumorigenesis, reduced tumor burden in vivo. We observed that activating transcription factor 5
(ATF5), specific for HSP60 expression and UPRmt activation, was upregulated with higher Gleason
Scores, and ATF5 was translocated to nucleus during stress. Using in silico analysis, we have
identified a novel UPRmt inhibitor (referred to as DCEM1), which induced robust apoptosis in PCa
cells and blocked tumor growth in vivo. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that HSP60-
dependent mitochondrial unfolded protein response promotes cancer cell adaptation during
tumor progression and therapeutic resistance in PCa. Identification of UPRmt inhibitor provides
alternative treatment option for patients with PCa. We propose the following Specific Aims to test
this hypothesis.
 Aim 1. Define the role of transcription factor ATF5 in activating mitochondrial unfolded protein
response. Aim 2: Evaluate whether HSP60 oligomerization maintains functional mitochondria and
inhibits apoptosis to develop aggressive PCa. Aim 3. Explore the clinical relevance of HSP60
inhibition using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and primary tumor cells.
 Impact: The findings will provide fundamental understanding on how UPRmt is activated and
how persistent mitochondrial stress is attenuated by UPRmt leading to development of aggressive
and lethal PCa. Identification of unique UPRmt inhibitor represents a new therapeutic vulnerability in
PCa that does not rely on androgen modulation. Therefore, UPRmt inhibition by DCEM1 will have
greater therapeutic benefits for patients with androgen-dependent and androgen-independent
CRPC."

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a significant burden to aging men and are often as a result of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While BPH/LUTS is not commonly fatal with proper medical intervention, it does
cause a significant reduction in quality of life for many men as they age. Furthermore, BPH/LUTS increases risk
of mortality and results in billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. There is currently a subset of BPH/LUTS
patients that fail FDA-approved treatments (α-blockers, 5ARI), and these patients have been shown to have
increased prostatic fibrosis. There is no FDA-approved medication targeting fibrosis or the aging process in
BPH/LUTS, even though aging is the greatest risk factor. This proposal aims to develop a better understanding
about the role of aging, fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in BPH/LUTS. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a
hallmark of both aging and fibrosis and has not been thoroughly studied in relation to BPH/LUTS. Preliminary
data suggests that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a mitochondrial pathway contributing to cellular
dysfunction in BPH/LUTS. Aim 1 of this proposal intends to investigate the connection between OXPHOS
disruption and lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) in a novel mouse model. Aim 2 of this proposal will
investigate the connection between OXPHOS disruption and pathways associated with fibrosis, using genetic
loss-of-function cell line models. Finally, Aim 3 will work to identify a new pathway of interest for treatment, using
oleic acid as a mitochondrial metabolism modulator. Collectively, these aims will improve our overall
understanding of the processes underlying BPH/LUTS, with a special focus on aging, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and fibrosis. This proposal hopes to provide translational outcomes that can eventually improve patient care and
treatment options."

Current strategies for developing neutralizing Abs are not effective and typically involve screening IgGs from
recovered patients. Pandemic viruses evolve for mutations that can shield their epitopes from host immune
surveillance system, so a lot of important epitopes will be missed. Even after neutralizing Abs isolated are
from human sample, they still need further characterization using epitope binning and determination of
specificities to avoid off target effect. A systematic method for exploring the entire protein surface of a virus
that can identify all potential sites on the virus which can affect its life cycle would have significant impact and
is needed. We propose a structure-guided systematic Ab development pipeline to discover Abs that
can fight infectious diseases. We propose using our novel site-directed Ab development technology,
‘EpiVolve’ (short for Epitope Evolution). EpiVolve will be used to develop site-specific Abs to solvent-exposed
residues and the adjacent ‘context’ sequences. These Abs will be used for fighting infectious disease. The
advantages of EpiVolve are a) overcoming immune tolerance and targeting virus’ human proteome-mimicking
epitopes, b) precisely targeting any antigenic epitopes regardless of its immunogenicity, c) taking advantage
of B cell expansion and somatic hypermutation to generate IgG clonotypes against one targeted residue,
which allows an ability to generate both pan-variants Abs and polymorphism-specific Abs, and d) an ability
for generating a neutralizing Ab discovery pipeline. We will model this on SARS-cov-2 virus in Phase I and
Influenza A in Phase II. EpiVolve developed site-specific antibodies will target solvent-exposed residues on
the protein surface. Structure-guided Ag design will empower the EpiVolve technology in this systematic
analysis. For this proposal, we will present the current preliminary data on the pilot EpiVolve study on SARS-
cov-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), focused mainly on the host cell receptor ACE2 binding interface. For
Phase I studies, we propose to complete the pilot study and extend the study to the whole protein surface of
the RBD domain. Characterizing each Ab by its binding affinity and ability to neutralize SARS-cov-2 virus will
be included in Phase I studies. For Phase II, we propose to apply the learnings from this Phase I study on
another virus model of great importance, the Influenza A virus. Specifically targeting the solvent-accessible

 Chromosome aberrations are a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia and offer mechanistic and
prognostic insights into disease. As such, a combination of cytogenetic assays are routinely applied as a part
of the AML diagnostic workflow. While offering invaluable information on disease severity, most chromosome
aberrations fall into the “cytogenetic abnormalities not classified” or “complex karyotype” categories. A range
of studies have shown that, while ambiguous, these variants have prognostic value, suggesting the existence
of cryptic variants of significance or complex epistases that drive the AML phenotype. However, there is
currently no system for translating genome-wide chromosomal aberration information into patient risk.
 To improve the predictive potential of chromosome aberration profiles, we propose the development of
a risk-prediction metric that will add new prognostic value to AML studies. Specifically, we will produce a
method which will establish a patient risk metric that can help guide treatment decisions for patients
traditionally judged as of intermediate risk. This development will employ our scalable cytogenomic tools and
novel machine learning analytics to generate a large collection of cytogenomic datasets and analyze them to
identify patterns linked to AML phenotypes. Once completed, we will have a combined kit and software
solution that will not only improve upon existing cytogenetic applications in AML, but will offer new prognostic
insights beyond what is possible with current tools. This product will deliver high-resolution view of the
chromosome aberration landscape in AML and an offer a data-driven interpretation of how variants will impact
disease severity."
10906676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent studies show that not all the COPD patients, but only those having emphysema present a prominent lung
B cell molecular signature irrespectively of the degree of airflow limitation. Our preliminary data show that lung
and circulating B cell responses are upregulated in COPD patients with greater vs. lesser emphysema within the
same COPD severity stage. We will test the central hypothesis that emphysema is characterized by changes in
B cell transcriptome which underlie exaggerated and off-targeted B cell responses contributing to lung
destruction. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that B cell, lymphoid follicles (LFs), and B cell product counts,
and specific LF B cell clonal and post-transcriptional changes are increased in the emphysematous lung vs. lung
with lesser emphysema. In Aim 1A, we will immunostain, using both conventional immunostaining and image
mass cytometry, COPD and control lungs and correlate the numbers of B cells, LFs, and other cells involved in
B cells responses, with the extent of computed tomography (CT)-defined lobar emphysema. In Aim 1B, we will
use laser capture microdissection to extract LF B cells from COPD and control lung sections to then: 1) assess
the clonality of the LFs; and 2) study the rearrangement of the B cell receptor (BCR) using a next-generation
sequencing (NGS) assay. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that an exaggerated B cell activation, associated
with transcriptomic changes, is present in the emphysematous lung. We will isolate lung B cells from COPD
patients and controls in order to: 1) test B cell activation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production in response to
antigens using in vitro cultures and ELISPOT assays; 2) characterize the B cell pool using flow cytometry (Aim
2A); 3) study lung B cell transcriptomes and BCR rearrangements using single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq); 4) generate monoclonal Igs and identify their binding targets in the lung with mass spectrometry
(Aim 2B). We will correlate the readouts of B cell activation in the lung with the extent of CT scan-defined lobar
emphysema. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that circulating B cell function and phenotypes reflect lung B
cell features in correlation studies relating to the extent of emphysema. In Aim 3A, we will: 1) test blood B cell
activation and Ig production in response to antigens using in vitro cultures and ELISPOT assays; 2) characterize
the blood B cell pool using flow cytometry; and 3) study blood B cell transcriptomes and BCR rearrangements
using scRNAseq. In Aim 3B, we will use COPD and control plasma to: 1) quantify the blood Ig isotypes and
identify the blood Ig binding targets in the lung using mass spectrometry; and 2) measure the levels of B cell-
related biomarkers and IgG reactivity against lung matrix. We will correlate the readouts of B cell activation in
blood and lung from the same subject, with the extent of CT scan-defined emphysema. These studies will define
the nature of the B cell responses in a clinical phenotype (likely emphysema) which could benefit from therapies
targeting B cells or B cell products, leading to earlier and more personalized therapeutic intervention for COPD."
10817749,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Improving neonatal outcomes and addressing outcome disparities for mothers and their infants require
national centers with excellence in clinical care and research that partner with communities to address
these challenges equitably. The existence of these disparities based on race and ethnicity, specifically in
maternal and infant mortality and preterm birth, highlight the complex prenatal and postnatal social and biological
factors that influence pregnancy outcomes. The NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN), by creating a
geographically diverse multi-institutional research infrastructure, has an ongoing commitment to improving health
outcomes and reducing known disparities in infants born preterm and in other high-risk situations. The Lurie
Children’s - Northwestern University Study Center, comprised of the Division of Neonatology at the Ann & Robert
H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and the Department of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg
School of Medicine, is anchored by 12,000 deliveries per year and 1700 admissions per year to our 148 NICU
beds at Lurie Children’s Hospital and Prentice Women’s Hospital and our collaboration with our partners at the
Northwestern Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Study Center. We have a long-standing tradition of clinical
excellence, investigator-initiated and multi-center investigation, a commitment to train the next generation of
physician scientists, and advocacy to promote health equity. Thus, we are well-positioned to be a strong addition
as a Clinical Center to the NRN. To achieve the goals of the NRN, the Lurie Children’s-Northwestern Study
Center will: 1) capitalize on the existing synergistic relationships within the Lurie Children’s / Northwestern
Medical Center and underserved neighborhoods of Chicago to “facilitate greater involvement of diverse
populations” and promote recruitment of pregnant women and their newborns for study protocols and facilitate
their retention through the follow-up period; 2) propose and participate in novel clinical studies and analyses that
capitalize on unique resources at the Lurie Children’s-Northwestern site; 3) utilize our site’s effective
organizational structure and management approach to support the objectives of the NRN; 4) establish and
implement high-quality data and biospecimen collection processes that meet the requirements and standards of
the NRN based on our current success with these processes; and 5) contribute to the scientific collaboration
among the NICHD, the NRN and MFMU clinical centers, and the Data Coordinating Center to support the
research networks’ objectives."
10909185,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide
since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. This pandemic has revealed a significant
treatment gap in the ability to minimize the morbidity and mortality of those infected through the use of anti-viral
drugs. Currently only remdesivir has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA, but requires
IV administration for 5-10 days at high cost, and has not demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of
illness or death rate for severely ill patients. Even with two vaccines with EUA, and more on the horizon, it is
likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will persist and may become endemic. As such, vulnerable
individuals will still get infected and may die if new anti-viral drugs are not developed soon.
 The primary aim of this proposal is to synthesize two different types of branched glycopolymers as potential
broad spectrum anti-viral (BSAV) drugs. Our second major aim seeks to assess the glycopolymers for anti-viral
activity against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, both of which are responsible for current, significant pandemics
affecting millions of people around the world. SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, along with many other viruses, share the
ability to hijack cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as receptors in the early-stage
binding/infection process. This is accomplished through electrostatic interactions between the viral surface
glycoproteins, Spike (S, SARS-CoV-2) and gp120 (HIV-1). The glycopolymers will be designed to have
polyanionic charges complementary to the polybasic regions of S and gp120. Using the two different classes of
glycopolymers will allow for a more rapid assessment of which specific architectural features are most critical to
yield the desired anti-viral effect. This will be accomplished using a rapid iterative design build test process
where the glycopolymers are built in parallel, then assessed for anti-viral activities using first an ELISA (Enzyme-
Linked Immunosorbent Assay) to evaluate viral protein binding and provide a “go/no go” decision. If positive
binding is observed, then higher level bioassays will be used to assess quantitative binding (Kd) information, live
cell anti-viral assays to provide IC50 (inhibitory concentration for 50% reduction in infection) values, and
cytotoxicity evaluation. Computational methods will also be used to ascertain the most critical structural features
present in the binding interactions (location, number of contact points, etc.). Evaluation of the comprehensive
biological/structural results will inform further iterations of glycopolymer designs.
 Successful completion of this project has the potential to yield a new class of BSAV. This is crucial for fighting
not only the current pandemics caused by both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1, but could also provide relief for future
viruses not yet emerged."
10915472,"Background: Use of existing cancer prevention strategies could have prevented over half of the roughly 1.7
million new cases of cancer expected in the US in 2019. It is critical to intervene with adolescents and young
adults (AYAs) around key behaviors, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, maintaining healthy weight,
and receiving the human papillomavirus vaccine given a) their potential to shift cancer trajectories and b) the
establishment of these behaviors during AYA developmental stages. However, AYAs are not engaging in these
behaviors at desired levels. For racial and ethnic minorities and low-income individuals, periods of adolescence
(ages 10-19) and emerging adulthood (ages 20-25) are often marked by inconsistent healthcare access and
structural factors that place them at greater risk for cancer.
Goal: The Outreach Core connects implementation science, outreach, and community engagement to address
two key divides that hinder cancer prevention among underserved AYAs: (1) the research-practice divide,
which limits the impact of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for underserved communities and (2) the
cancer workforce divide, in which the communities most impacted by cancer inequities are least represented in
the cancer research workforce. To address these divides, we will use participatory approaches to conduct the
project in collaboration with a Community Advisory Board, thus increasing the impact and relevance of
proposed solutions.
Methods: The study is organized around four aims. With Aim 1, we will build on the existing board, which
includes representatives from the Black and Brazilian communities of Greater Boston and the Latino
community of Greater Lawrence, MA (communities experiencing cancer inequities) and add AYAs and experts
in AYA health and youth-engaged research. With Aim 2, we will support community organizations to adapt and
deliver EBIs focusing on alcohol and tobacco use, maintaining healthy weight, and HPV vaccination among
underserved AYAs. With Aim 3, we will train the next generation of Black, Latino, Brazilian, and Native
scholars in the theory and practice of community-engaged research and community-centered interventions.
With Aim 4, we will co-create products and services with the Community Advisory Board to disseminate
findings and integrate community and equity considerations into Partnership activities.
Innovations and impact: We link outreach, engagement, and implementation science to develop a platform to
shape research conducted at UMB and the seven partner institutions of the DF/HCC, serving as a model
infrastructure for cancer prevention and control in partnership with populations experiencing cancer inequities."

10915478,"Summary. Obesity is associated with 13 cancers and up to 11% of cancer in the United States is associated
with excess body mass index (BMI). Evidence suggests that the food environment is associated with obesity
risk, which affects one third of adults. Restaurants are an important component of the food environment. One-
third of Americans will eat at a fast food restaurant on a typical day. Restaurant sales have steadily increased
over the past 5 decades; in 2015 restaurants spent $6.3 trillion in advertising (more than 100 times the NIH
budget). Advertisements for unhealthy items are often targeted towards those at higher risk for obesity, and
unhealthy food retail outlets, like fast food restaurants, are more densely located in low-income and minority
communities. Therefore, the restaurant environment may more negatively impact low-income and racial
minority populations. To date, research on the relationship between restaurant advertising and obesity risk has
largely focused on children. Available studies are limited by cross-sectional data (limiting identification of
causal relationships). To address these knowledge gaps, we will combine multiple data sources to create a
unique, objective measure of local per capita restaurant advertising (adapting an approach we previously
developed). This will be derived from local-level quarterly restaurant advertising spending from Kantar Media
for the 100 top revenue generating restaurants in the U.S. and the annual physical addresses for all locations
from each restaurant chain from AggData. We will test associations of restaurant advertising per capita with
population weight gain using objectively measured BMI data for 2.3 million people (in 217 counties across 40
states and the District of Columbia, including 9 of the 10 most populous U.S. counties) from athenahealth. We
will test whether this relationship is mediated by advertising exposure using data from Neilson Ad Intel. The
overall objective is to leverage national data and provide a much-needed understanding of how exposure to
changes in local restaurant advertising impacts adult weight gain and disparities. We propose two specific
aims: 1) examine changes in chain restaurant advertising expenditures from 2012 to 2016 and test whether
those changes vary by income and race/ethnicity and 2) estimate the associations between chain restaurant
advertising and weight gain among U.S. adults, by race and SES and whether this relationship is mediated by
the level of exposure to advertising. We will use a set of econometric techniques to assess whether these
relationships are causal. We hypothesize that increases in restaurant advertising per capita were larger in
areas with higher concentrations of racial/ethnic minority and low-income populations and that greater
exposure to restaurant advertising will be associated with higher weight gain, particularly for low-income and
racial/ethnic minority populations and those with higher advertising exposure. This research will make a highly
significant contribution to our understanding of how restaurant advertising impacts weight gain and disparities
among adults, with important implications for subsequent cancer outcomes and health equity."

The current P01 grant supported the creation of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC)
Project Four Country Smoking and Vaping Survey, the first international cohort study of smoking and nicotine
vaping product (NVP) use, which was conducted in three countries supported by the P01 grant (United States
[US], Canada, England, plus Australia, which was supported by other funding). Three waves were conducted,
an average of 19 months apart, in 2016, 2018, and 2020. In this renewal application, we build on that work by
matching the extraordinary international expansion of the nicotine marketplace by adding a focus on heated
tobacco products (HTPs) in addition to cigarettes and NVPs. We propose to continue the adult cohort survey in
US (n=2,150), Canada (n=2,150), and England (n=2,300) for 3 additional waves, 19 months apart, over the
next 5 years, with a substantial expansion by adding adult cohort surveys from 4 other ITC countries, which are
being supported by funding sources outside this proposed grant: Japan (n=4,500) and the Republic of Korea
(n=4,700), countries that are the epicenter of the tobacco industry's introduction of HTPs; New Zealand
(n=1,600), which has incorporated NVPs into their “endgame” strategy; and Australia, which continues its
more restrictive approach to these Alternative Nicotine Delivery Systems (ANDS) (n=1,500; grant application
pending). The resulting 7-country ITC Nicotine Product Adult (NPA) Survey (total n=18,900) will represent
an innovative international evaluation system that will allow the research team to conduct a comprehensive
research program on the use of nicotine products, and transitions between cigarettes and nicotine products,
building on the ITC Project's 18-year global experience in conducting rigorous evaluation of tobacco control
policies, employing quasi-experimental analytic methods. The NPA Survey will provide important evidence to
advance the science and understanding of nicotine products and policies during the next five years, which is
certain to be a period of dynamic change in the nicotine product marketplace. Similar studies in the US such as
the Population Assessment Tobacco and Health (PATH) are limited since they do not readily permit cross-
country comparisons using harmonized measures as the NPA survey does. This innovative Project has three
Specific Aims: 1) to describe patterns use of and transitions of use across different tobacco products among
smokers and recent ex-smokers both over time and by key user characteristics within and between countries;
2) to examine how differences in current and future policies (e.g., taxes, flavor bans, product standards, health
warnings) for cigarettes, NVPs, and HTPs are related to differences in patterns of use of these products over
time; and 3) to examine the relative impact of policies on adults and youth (a Specific Aim shared with Project
2). Two exploratory aims will also be addressed given their likely impact on nicotine product use: (a) to
examine how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting smoking and ANDS use in the 7 countries over time; and
(b) to examine the interplay between cannabis and smoking, vaping, and HTP use over time."

A critical gap often exists at institutions serving underserved health disparity populations and underrepresented
students (ISUPS) between access to Genomics technologies and the high costs associated with the required
instrumentation, technical proficiency, and analytical expertise. The Genomics Core (GC) addresses this gap
by providing expert and affordable access to high-throughput genomics technologies on a reduced fee basis
for all Partnership investigators. The GC benefits the entire Partnership by providing innovative approaches to
explore early project ideas, and by working with Partnership investigators and their trainees to facilitate the use
of genomics technologies to build sustainable cancer biology and cancer disparities research. To accomplish
these goals, the GC (through the auspices of the Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy, CPCT) provides
front-line genomics-related technologies, as well as bioinformatics support for data analysis, to Partnership
investigators through an affordable reimbursement model. The GC proposes to accomplish these goals
through the pursuit of four specific aims designed to build capacity for biomedical and cancer research and
training at UMass Boston by bridging a gap in the availability of cutting-edge genomics-based tools; support
Partnership investigators who wish to pursue early project ideas, especially those that require innovative
and/or technically challenging genomics approaches; bridge a training gap between students and high-level
genomics-based technologies, and provide bioinformatics analysis of data generated in the core. In this
application, the GC specifically supports FP2: Targeting androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer in men
with African Ancestry – Steven Balk (DF/HCC - BIDMC) and Changmeng Cai (UMass Boston) and PP2: High
frequency of CHD1 loss in BRCA2-deficient African American prostate tumors drives treatment resistance –

10919182,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Youth and young adulthood are critical periods for tobacco use. For most of the past two decades, smoking
has steadily declined among young people in the US and other Western countries, including Canada (CA) and
England (EN). In contrast, nicotine vaping products (NVPs) have experienced rapid growth and are now the
most prevalent nicotine product used by youth and young adults. The long-term public health impact of NVP
use among young people is widely debated, including its impact on smoking behavior as either a `gateway' into
smoking or a means to `displace' cigarette use. The nicotine market is poised to diversify further with the
emergence of heated tobacco products (HTPs), such as Marlboro Heatsticks in the US, and novel oral nicotine
products. The extent to which these novel products appeal to young people and follow a similar trajectory as
NVPs represents a critical question. The policy environment is changing in response to the rapidly evolving
product market. A range of new nicotine and tobacco policies are in the process of being implemented in the
US, CA and EN, most of which are targeted at reducing use among young people. The different regulatory
approaches across countries creates a series of `natural experiments' in nicotine and tobacco policy, which can
be used to evaluate their impact on young people. The proposed study consists of repeated cross-sectional
surveys conducted annually with national samples of youth and young adults (aged 16-29) in the US, CA and
EN. The same methods and measures are used in all three countries to provide directly comparable estimates
over time. The study would expand the current focus of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation
Project (ITC) Youth surveys to include young adults (20-29) and will build on the four annual surveys waves
conducted between 2017 and 2020. The study has three primary aims: 1) to examine international variations in
smoking, NVP, and HTP use among young people; 2) to examine the impact of national-level policies on
prevalence and patterns of smoking and vaping among young people; and 3) to examine the relative impact of
policies on youth versus adult smokers. Overall, the proposed Project is uniquely positioned to examine
changes in tobacco and nicotine use among young people during a critical period in which both the product
and policy landscape is rapidly evolving. The between-country design provides a unique framework for
assessing the impact of specific policies, as well as the emergence of novel HTPs and oral nicotine products.
Finally, Project 2 is well-positioned to examine broader contextual differences across countries, such as the
legalization of cannabis."

Project 3's long-term objectives are to understand the substitutability between novel and more frequently used
tobacco products, the factors promoting and mitigating illegal tobacco purchases, and the generality of these
findings in diverse non-laboratory samples in different types of users. Project 3's aims are 1) to compare the
substitution between different tobacco/nicotine products as a function of tobacco-user type, 2) to model policies
that may promote and mitigate illegal tobacco purchases for different types of tobacco users, and 3) to
examine the generality of laboratory-based findings and their moderators using diverse samples (US, England,
and Canada) from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project. Participants will be both
exclusive cigarette smokers and dual cigarette/nicotine vaping product users because these individuals are
most at risk for negative health outcomes associated with combusted tobacco. The methods will employ the
Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM), an online purchasing experience that places a mix of products,
prices, and specific regulations under experimental conditions that simulate “real world” circumstances. The
ETM provides estimates of the effects of product changes and/or policy changes on tobacco purchasing
patterns, including between-product substitution in different types of tobacco product users. Here the ETM will
be used to examine the effects of novel products, such as heated tobacco and nicotine pouch products, on
purchasing patterns and the uptake of different products (substitution). Further, the Illegal Experimental
Tobacco Marketplace (iETM), a methodological extension of the ETM, was developed to examine conditions
that promote or mitigate against illegal purchases. Here the iETM will be used to examine the effects of
regulatory environments that tend to promote illegal purchases, such as high cigarette prices and reduced
nicotine content cigarettes. Moreover, this project will examine policy strategies that may mitigate illegal
purchases, such as health communications, availability of nicotine replacement therapy, and penalties. The
ultimate health impact of this project is to inform tobacco regulation, reduce tobacco-related harm, and improve
public health."
10892847,"ABSTRACT
There is currently a lack of mechanistic understanding of why humoral immunity against malaria is not efficiently
induced and why Plasmodium infections are associated immune failures, even following repeated infections. Our
long-term goal is to determine how Plasmodium parasites, and potentially other protozoan infections, co-opt and
subvert humoral immunity, which will help with the identification and development of new immune-based
interventions against devastating diseases like malaria. The objectives of this project are to define mechanisms
that trigger initial humoral immune dysregulation and study the consequences of these events on the formation
of durable humoral immune memory. Our central hypothesis is that robust humoral immunity does not develop
efficiently because polyclonal B cell activation events establish a nutrient sink that impairs the metabolic,
transcriptional and epigenetic programming and function of Plasmodium-specific memory B cells. The rationale
for this project is linked to our recent discovery that Plasmodium infection results in a massive polyclonal
expansion of B cells that function as a nutrient sink that limits protective memory B cell responses. Deletion of
these B cells accelerates blood-stage Plasmodium parasite clearance and enhances humoral immune
memory. Supplementing the diet of infected mice with a single amino acid is sufficient to overcome the nutrient
sink and metabolic constraints imposed by these B cells and results in enhanced humoral immune memory
responses. Despite our new findings, the molecular mechanisms governing the activation and function of
immunoinhibitory B cells and the impact of these cells on the affinity and longevity of memory B cells remain
critical knowledge gaps in our quest to improve humoral immunity against malaria. Two Aims address these
priority questions. In the first Aim we will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the
expansion of these immunosuppressive B cells and investigate whether these populations are relevant to other
infections associated with dysregulated humoral immunity. In the second Aim we will investigate the molecular
and cellular consequences of immunosuppressive B cell expansions on the genetic and epigenetic programming
of memory B cells. We have developed several innovative new reagents that afford unprecedented resolution
for the study anti-malarial humoral immunity. The significance of this project is directly linked to our new findings
showing that pathophysiological changes that occur during Plasmodium infection durably imprints on B cell fate
and function. Thus, determining how these pathways coordinately regulate polyclonal B cell activation,
development and humoral immunity will be broadly important to those studying infectious disease immunology
and vaccinology."
10914103,"This proposal describes a five-year mentored research and training plan that will facilitate the
development of Dr. Stephanie Ford, MD as an independent investigator in the pathogenesis of congenital heart
disease. Building upon Dr. Ford’s background as a clinical neonatologist and a basic scientist, she will attain
expertise in design of mouse studies, RNA-FISH, and epigenetic mechanisms. She will gain skills through
structured mentorship, hands-on laboratory experiences, didactic teaching, and formal classwork at Case
Western Reserve University, FAES at the NIH, and Jackson Laboratories. Dr. Michael Jenkins, a pioneer in
cardiac optical imaging, and Dr. Cynthia Bearer, an expert in prenatal alcohol exposure models, will provide
their expertise and mentorship skills to this project, fostering Dr. Ford’s transition to research independence.
 An estimated 2.4-4.8% of newborns in the U.S. have fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), caused by
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). PAE induced Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) have not been studied as
intensively as other FASD outcomes despite their high prevalence rate (40%). The CHDs associated with
FASDs, mostly valvuloseptal and outflow tract defects, are life-threatening and impact growth and health. PAE
is known to affect methylation and one-carbon metabolism. Normal one-carbon metabolism and its resulting
methylation of DNA is crucial for the correct expression of genes. Comparative genomics studies have revealed
that there is strong epigenetic conservation across vertebrate species including mice and avians, particularly the
hyper-and hypo-methylated DNA sequences of critical genes. We will investigate the PAE-induced changes at
times critical to heart development (endocardial cushion and 4 chamber development) in mouse and avian
embryonic hearts. All hearts will be imaged with optical coherence tomography to rapidly determine their
phenotype. DNA methylation changes will be determined with a combination of methyl-ATAC-seqand bisulfite
sequencing. DNA methylation will be compared in both species, as conserved changes in two species are more
likely to be relevant to human PAE-induced defects. RNA-FISH will be used to confirm gene expression changes,
which will allow us to pinpoint where within the 3D heart, such as the forming valves, gene expression is changing.
 We will then explore the use of choline and glutathione to prevent the effects of PAE. Choline and
glutathione are known to promote methylation in one-carbon metabolism. Choline has been shown in human
studies to prevent early neurologic effects of PAE. We have shown in an avian model that glutathione prevents
the CHDs and abnormal DNA methylation seen after PAE. We will use both avian and mouse models to
determine the effects of alcohol + choline or glutathione on cardiac structure, DNA methylation, and gene
expression. We hypothesize that by maintaining normal methylation, and therefore DNA
expression, our chosen compounds will prevent the CHDs that result from PAE. Compounds that
could prevent PAE-induced CHDs could help thousands of children and their families each year."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy could provide a curative treatment for a number of blood diseases.
The conventional approach is based on ex vivo HSC gene transfer and has achieved encouraging results.
However, the high cost and side effects limit the patient accessibility of ex vivo HSC gene therapy. We have
developed an in vivo HSC transduction approach involving HSC mobilization and intravenous viral vector
injection. The approach is highlighted by its relatively low cost and technical simplicity. It could be provided as
an outpatient treatment. We have demonstrated its safety and efficacy in several murine disease models,
including β-thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia, and hemophilia A, and more recently, in rhesus macaques. With
more gene therapy products on the horizon, the application of in vivo HSC transduction could extrapolate genetic
treatments to a larger patient population. Further improvements of in vivo HSC gene therapy on the road to
clinical application include more effective mobilization protocols, complete elimination of innate responses upon
intravenous vector injection, more advanced virus capsid modifications that circumvent pre-existing anti-vector
immunity, improved in vivo selection regimens, as well as new methods for purification of gene transfer vectors.
In this application, we will successively test hypotheses to improve in vivo HSC gene therapy approaches for
thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease in mouse models. We will then validate the best combination of
improvements in hon-human primates. Safety, efficacy, portability, and low costs are the major driving forces in
the design/optimization of each technological unit."

This project describes the development of NeuroExM™, a highly innovative system for performing
comprehensive spatial distribution analysis of populations of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins in tissue
processed for expansion microscopy (ExM)). The groundbreaking technological advantage of ExM, which was
recently developed by Dr. Edward S. Boyden (Dept. Biol. Engin., Media Lab and Dept. Brain Cognit. Sci., MIT,
Cambridge, MA) and colleagues, is the ability to isotropically expand tissue and increase the size of the biological
structures. This allows nanoscale-resolution, light-microscopic imaging of small objects that are too small to be
resolved without expansion due to the diffraction limit of light. Among other benefits, ExM allows those small
structures to be imaged with a wider range of microscopy techniques. Processing tissue for ExM also allows
repeated hybridization (for investigations of mRNAs) and/or repeated antibody staining (for investigations of
proteins) of the same tissue, combined with repeated microscopic imaging rounds. Each round yields adjacent,
high-magnification, single field-of-view image stacks, consisting of at least one morphology reference channel
showing neuronal sub-cellular structures (somas, axons, dendrites, dendritic spines, synapses) as well as one
or several info channels showing mRNAs and/or proteins. Comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution of
populations of mRNAs and proteins in neurons in situ requires assembling the image stacks of all performed
rounds into a single, seamless and aligned, three-dimensional (3D) ExM image, which is high-dimensional and
can be several terabytes in size. However, this presents a number of computational challenges with respect to
microscopy image registration, segmentation and analysis. The game-changing innovation in NeuroExM is the
ability to perform all of these tasks without the need to have a computer scientist on staff to run the existing,
individual lab-based software scripts developed for each step of this kind of complex analysis. This is made
possible by implementing a number of significant technical innovations into NeuroExM. Based on pilot work
performed in collaboration with the Boyden lab during preparation of this proposal, we are convinced that
NeuroExM will make a significant impact on the field of neuroscience research. Specifically, the combination of
ExM and NeuroExM will enable substantial advancements in research studies focusing on alterations in the
spatial transcriptome and proteome of neurons associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric,
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders as well as in aging research and drug development. Ultimately,
this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex
brain diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype
software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of NeuroExM for commercial release. We
will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of NeuroExM in close
collaboration with the Boyden lab. A competing technology is not available."

10819587,"HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) is one of the most common and clinically important
complications of HIV infection. There is an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies for HAND exacerbated
by Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD). Through an extensive analysis of the HIV-induced transcriptome, we
determined that HIV and cocaine profoundly induce overexpression of the microglia-specific gene aconitate
decarboxylase 1 (acod1). Acod1 converts the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediate cis-aconitate to itaconate
during inflammation. Itaconate activates anti-inflammatory transcription factors thereby protecting macrophages
from infection-triggered cell death. Although the attenuation of inflammation by itaconate has been characterized
in peripheral macrophages, the role of immunometabolism, including itaconate production, has not been studied
in HIV and cocaine-exposed microglia. This innovative proposal will characterize novel targets of itaconate action
in the brain. The hypothesis of this proposal is that itaconate balances neuroinflammation by activating
anti-inflammatory pathways in HIV-infected microglia cells, consequently cell death is attenuated
allowing microglial HIV reservoirs to be maintained. Further, we hypothesize that inhibition of itaconate
synthesis and downstream pathways in HIV-infected microglia has the potential to selectively eliminate HIV
reservoirs in the brain tissues – i.e., an innovative “Non-activating Shock and Kill” cure approach. In contrast, we
will also explore the strong anti-inflammatory potential of the cell- and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating
modified derivatives of itaconate -- dimethyl Itaconate (DMI) and 4-octyl-itaconate. Our preliminary results show
that 4-octyl-itaconate protects primary neurons from HIV-tat and cocaine toxicity. Thus sustained activation of
itaconate pathways by BBB-penetrable itaconate derivatives may be an alternative approach for the
treatment of HAND worsened by CUD. This innovative proposal employs a novel approach centered on
immunomeabolism that has not been considered in targeting HIV-infected microglia. Esters of other metabolites,
including fumarate, are already approved for inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and arthritis, increasing
the clinical relevance of these exciting studies."
10914045,"The DEPTH trial represents an innovative approach to slowing the progression of emphysema in
people living with HIV (PLWH), a population that has accelerated disease progression for which there is no
targeted therapy. With our CCC collaborators, we propose a phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of doxycycline 100 mg po BID to slow the progression of emphysema as quantified by
diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) among PLWH who are current or former smokers. Participants
will be stratified by smoking status (current vs former smoker) and clinical site, utilizing dynamic randomization.
The primary endpoint of the study is the rate of decline (slope) of percent predicted DLco corrected for
hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and barometric pressure over the 72-week treatment period. Our clinical
collaborators have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this study in their NHLBI-funded pilot study to
test the safety and tolerability of doxycycline in 27 individuals over 24 weeks (NCT 01744093), and have
assembled a group of experienced clinical sites. The DEPTH trial will extend their promising pilot data to a
formal phase II clinical trial.
 An experienced data coordinating center (DCC) with strong statistical leadership and expertise is key in
both design and analysis, particularly when unanticipated issues arise during the conduct of a clinical trial. The
University of Michigan (UM) Statistical Analysis of Biomedical and Educational Research (SABER) unit in a
top-ranked department of biostatistics will serve as DCC, bringing together an experienced group of faculty and
staff in biostatistics, project management, study monitoring, database design and data management, software
development, and research administration. SABER has a strong track record of collaborations with Weill
Cornell Medicine pulmonary team as the clinical coordinating center (CCC). The overarching goal of the UM
DCC is to collaborate with study investigators, the CCC, and NHLBI to enable successful achievement of the
study on time and within budget. We will accomplish these goals through the three specific aims: (1) Enhance
scientific rigor by providing statistical and clinical trials methodological expertise to design, analyze, and
disseminate research findings; (2) Ensure the collection of timely, accurate and reproducible data, and
maximize adherence to the study protocol; and (3) Provide established infrastructure and services for study
administration and operations and for communication among study stakeholders. Our leadership, experience,
and expertise will promote collaborations, encourage scientific productivity, and facilitate timely dissemination
of findings on the benefits of doxycycline in PLWH who have emphysema. We anticipate that upon completion
of this proposed study, our data will support repurposing the inexpensive antibiotic doxycycline, to slow
emphysema progression in PLWH, and demonstrate that it is safe and well tolerated."

therapy. We propose a phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
doxycycline 100 mg po BID to slow the progression of emphysema as assessed by change in diffusing
capacity (DLCO) among PLWH who are current or former smokers. Eligible participants with emphysema
and well-controlled HIV will be randomized 1:1 to doxycycline or placebo, stratified by smoking status (current

rate of decline (slope) of percent predicted DLCO over the 72-week treatment period. We have assembled a
team of experienced clinical sites that has the patient population and expertise to efficiently enroll and conduct
this trial.
In our previous studies, we observed that HIV+ individuals with early emphysema have increased matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP-2, -7, -9, -12; each implicated in emphysema pathogenesis) in bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid samples. MMPs are therefore potential targets for intervention aimed at modifying
progression of emphysema specifically in people with HIV. We successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this
approach in our NHLBI-funded single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to test
the safety and tolerability of doxycycline (FDA-approved as an MMP inhibitor to prevent tissue breakdown in
gum disease) over 24 weeks (NCT 01744093). We studied 27 individuals with HIV and COPD/emphysema
randomized 2:1 to doxycycline 100 mg po BID or placebo. In addition to acceptable safety and tolerability,
there were trends toward stabilization of the diffusing capacity (DLCO) and a reduction of BAL fluid MMP-9
activity in participants assigned to the doxycycline arm. The DEPTH trial will extend these promising pilot data
to a formal Phase II clinical trial.
We anticipate that upon completion of this proposed study, our data will support repurposing the inexpensive
antibiotic doxycycline, to slow emphysema progression in PLWH. Specifically we expect to show:
 1. Doxycycline slows the progression of emphysema in PLWH, as assessed primarily by DLCO and
 secondarily by HRCT.
 2. Doxycycline is safe and tolerable when taken orally for 72 weeks in PLWH who have emphysema.
 3. Doxycycline improves respiratory quality of life and functional status in PLWH who have emphysema."
10907763,"Project Summary
This project aims to discover and validate plasma biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian cancer. A
hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cell division, leading to a doubling time of the tumor. This exponential growth
stands in stark contrast to the stable or slowly changing profile of plasma proteins in almost all other diseases
or in healthy subjects. This project will leverage this unique hallmark to discover and validate plasma protein
biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian cancer. We will discover early detection (ED) plasma protein
biomarkers by identifying the proteins that significantly rise over time in an exponential fashion in a substantial
fraction of cases and yet remain relatively stable over time in most controls. This requires plasma assays over
a large suite of proteins with CVs lower than the protein's biological variation over time which can be as low as
a CV of 10%. Furthermore, a low volume requirement is essential for access to precious biospecimens formed
from long-term large early detection trials. Olink AB has developed proximity extension assays (PEAs) for a
suite of ~1,500 proteins with CVs ranging from 6-12% and with a minimal volume requirement of
3 µL. Applying the Olink proteomic assays to serial pre-diagnostic plasma from subjects in the PLCO who were
diagnosed with ovarian cancer during the study (cases n=50) and to serial plasma samples from a 4:1
matched control (n=200) : case (n=50) cohort will provide longitudinal data on ~1,500 plasma proteins from
cases and controls by which to identify ED candidate biomarkers. Prior to cancer developing in each case, a
biomarker will be stable over time, while after cancer inception the biomarker will rise exponentially reflecting
tumor doubling. This behavior is represented by a change-point model in cases while the same biomarker in
women without ovarian cancer (controls) will have a flat profile. ED biomarkers will be the proteins which have
a change-point in a substantial fraction of cases while remaining stable in most (98%) controls. We will identify
the top 20 ED biomarkers where the criteria for inclusion is a combination of fraction of cases, complementarity
to proteins already selected, and time of rise with earlier risers having priority. After identification of the 20 ED
biomarkers, Olink will develop a custom panel of 20 ED markers with absolute quantification. The custom
panel will assay the same PLCO plasma samples as used in discovery. These data will be analyzed with a
multivariate longitudinal change-point model to form a multiple marker longitudinal algorithm for ED. This
classifier will be locked down. The classifier will be validated by assaying the custom panel of 20 ED
biomarkers on an independent PLCO serial plasma sample set, from cases (n=50) and 10:1 matched controls
(n=500). From these data the classifier will be assessed for two dimensions of sensitivity for early detection: (i)
the number of months prior to detection in PLCO, and (ii) proportion of cases detected, while (iii) maintaining a
high specificity goal of 98% - or a false positive rate of 2%. This low false positive rate requires a large number
of controls (n=500) for its accurate assessment."
10918276,"Radiation Therapy (RT) is a common form of cancer treatment that can be effective in treating numerous
malignancies. Two key components of an effective RT regimen are a dose of irradiation that is sufficient to cause
tumor cell death, and an innate immune response, driven by dendritic cells and fueled by the debris from dying
tumor cells, that goes on to activate anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Collectively, this process has come to be
known as the in situ vaccine effect of radiation. Unfortunately for many patients, a deficiency in one of these two
key components can occur from the onset of treatment, or develop over time, and result in resistance to RT. For
example, if an insufficient amount of tumor cell death occurs from a given dose of radiation, not only will more
live cancer cells remain within the tumor, but this lack of cell death will also ultimately limit the activation and
recruitment of adaptive immune cells. Without adaptive immune activation, the remaining live cells within the
tumor, and potential metastases that could be present throughout the body, can survive and proliferate. We have
determined that chronic stress mediated by β-adrenergic signaling is capable of inducing tumor cell resistance
to irradiation induced cell death in vitro, and we have also determined that this same stress results in a subdued
anti-tumor immune response generated from RT in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to resolve the mechanism
through which adrenergic stress induces tumor cell radioresistance, and to determine whether this change in cell
death is driving the immunologic changes observed in vivo, in addition to the direct effects of stress on immune
cells. To address these goals, we will use pharmacologic and genetic approaches to induce or inhibit signaling
cascades downstream of the β1, β2, and β3-ARs, and determine which receptor, and which signaling pathways,
are responsible for the observed increase in tumor cell survival after irradiation. We will define how this signaling
drives survival by evaluating cell death pathways including apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis, and determine
whether inhibiting this signaling also leads to a potentially more immune stimulating tumor microenvironment. To
do so, we will assess cGAS/STING signaling and damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) production
(including ATP, HMGB1, and Calreticulin) in vitro. Using a series of co-culture experiments where dendritic cells
(DCs) are cultured with irradiated tumor cells experiencing varying levels of β-AR signaling, we will evaluate
whether changes in the radiation induced cell death processes described above affect DC maturation and
function. In vivo, we will utilize various β-AR deficient mouse strains to evaluate whether increased β-AR
signaling in tumor cells alone is sufficient to drive resistance to therapy and impaired anti-tumor immunity.
Changes in DAMP production in vivo will also be evaluated. Taken together, this project has the potential to
produce paradigm shifting discoveries which outline a new and important mechanism of radiation resistance that
is driven by the human physiologic response to chronic stress and anxiety, β-adrenergic signaling. Ultimately,
these discoveries could enhance the efficacy RT, improve patient outcomes, and increase patient quality of life."

10701264,"Abstract
 Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia, often triggers progressive
cognitive impairment similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current treatment strategies focusing on
local lesions for AD and dementia have not led to satisfactory outcomes. Therefore, comprehensively
understanding of the pathogenesis of VaD and AD is urgently required to address the unmet scientific and clinic
needs. Vascular pathologies across all vasculature have also been linked to VaD. Most notably, atherosclerosis,
stroke and hypertension accelerate the progression of cognitive impairments and dementia. Multiple large
genome-wide studies identify the atherosclerosis risk gene apolipoprotein E (APOE) as a strong genetic risk
factor for AD. However, despite shared genetic risk factors, atherosclerosis and AD are often separated in clinical
management and mechanistic studies. Pan-vascular diseases represented by coronary artery disease, ischemic
stroke, aneurysm and peripheral artery disease are all associated with VaD, thus, investigating pan-vascular
changes that impact cognitive functions may open up new avenues to understand VaD and AD. The current
application represents our long-term goals to uncover novel mechanisms linking vascular dysfunctions in the
cardio/cerebrovascular systems to VaD/AD. Our effort has led to the discovery of a new role of the Runt-related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in regulating both aortic and cerebral vascular functions. We and others previously
reported that Runx2 is an integral regulator for vascular calcification. Our preliminary studies identified novel
function of Runx2 in regulating atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in
mice; and uncover upregulation of Runx2 in aging, atherosclerosis and AD mice, as well as in human AD/VaD
tissues. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis further discovered a novel regulation of Runx2 on SMC phenotypic
switch, beyond promoting SMC calcification. With an array of molecular, biochemical, proteomics and
bioinformatics approaches, preliminary studies uncovered Runx2 interaction with an essential contractile SMC
regulator, serum response factor (SRF), supporting a novel Runx2/SRF regulatory network in SMC phenotypic
switch and calcification. Elucidating the novel function of Runx2 and Runx2-dependent signaling in regulating
VaD will provide new insights to fill the knowledge gaps, which may lead to novel strategies for clinical
management or treatment of VaD/AD."
10903740,"Project Summary
Somatic copy number amplification (SCNA) of tumor promoting oncogenes, and focal copy number amplifi-
cations specifically, are a major driver of cancer pathogenicity. Recent results have revealed that that focal
oncogene amplification is mediated to a large extent by extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) i.e., large (1.3 Mb
on average), highly amplified, oncogene-containing circular molecules that occur in nearly 25% of cancers
across all sub-types, but rarely in normal cells. Unresolved questions regarding the formation, evolution, het-
erogeneity, and pathogenicity of ecDNA are becoming central to uncovering vulnerabilities that can be targeted
for diagnostics and therapy. The proposed project will enhance and disseminate “Software and algorithms
for elucidating the structure, function, and evolution of extrachromosomal DNA.” Specifically, we will (1) de-
velop CAPER (a Community Accessible Pipeline for EcDNA Reconstruction) by leveraging the GenePattern
ecosystem to provide an easy point and click interface to running the CPU, memory and storage heavy soft-
ware; (2) design and implement novel algorithmic improvements to the CAPER work flow, including support
for long-reads and integration of Omics data; and, (3) enable the broad adoption of CAPER through strategic

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a complication of pregnancy occurring in 1 in 2000 live
births, which remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Inhibition of prolactin
with the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine appears to improve outcomes in small clinical
studies of PPCM in Africa and Europe; however, no randomized trial has been performed in a
diverse multi-racial North American cohort comparing bromocriptine against standard heart
failure therapy. This multicenter trial, Randomized Evaluation of Bromocriptine In Myocardial
Recovery Therapy for Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (REBIRTH), will evaluate whether the
addition of bromocriptine to standard therapy improves outcomes for women with PPCM. This
trial will randomize 200 women with PPCM to eight weeks of bromocriptine or placebo. Left
ventricular ejection fraction will be determined by echocardiography at study entry, and
reassessed at 6 and 12 months after randomization to determine whether the addition of
bromocriptine improves left ventricular function and overall clinical outcomes.
For women presenting with PPCM, echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular dysfunction
and remodeling helps predict the probability of recovery. This proposal will evaluate whether
global longitudinal strain or left ventricular diastolic volume will predict the therapeutic
response to bromocriptine. The therapeutic impact of bromocriptine is theoretically a result of
the reduction of prolactin and prolactin fragments collectively known as vasoinhibins. This
investigation will investigate whether higher levels of these biomarkers predict greater benefit
from bromocriptine. Breastfeeding raises prolactin levels, and the impact of breastfeeding on
recovery from PPCM remains controversial. Given that bromocriptine causes cessation of
lactation, women with PPCM who want to continue breastfeeding are excluded from the
randomized trial. This proposal will follow 50 such women and investigate the levels of these
biomarkers and whether the recovery of left ventricular function differs in breastfeeding women.
REBIRTH will clarify the role of bromocriptine for the treatment of this disorder. This proposal
will also evaluate the impact of breastfeeding, and will have a significant impact on the overall
management of women with PPCM."

Men in the United States have an exceptionally high prevalence of overweight and obesity, i.e., 71.3%, and
42% of men are currently attempting weight loss. However, men are dramatically underrepresented in weight
loss programs. Men find conventional weight loss program (i.e., group-based, education and counseling-
orientated, dietary/calorie-focused) unappealing because they involve receiving counseling, focus on replacing
“masculine” foods (e.g., meat) with “feminine” ones (e.g., salad), and provide minimal personalization or
autonomy. As such, attempts have been made to increase recruitment and appeal through targeted
recruitment and adaptations to standard weight loss programs. However, these efforts have been
disappointing. Mobile applications (mHealth apps) have attractive features, but have low male enrollment and
poor efficacy as conventionally delivered. A gamified mHealth program offers the possibility of engaging men
and enhancing efficacy given that (1) video gaming is highly appealing to men; (2) gamification features (e.g.,
digital rewards for attaining “streaks” and milestones, competition) are known enhance enjoyment and
motivation and facilitate desired behaviors; and (3) “neurotraining” video games featuring repetitive action
mechanics, adaptive difficulty, and feedback can train inhibitory control, a basic brain capacity to inhibit
intrinsically-generated approach responses that is strongly linked to body mass and the consumption of high-
calorie foods. Inhibitory control training (ICT) games have been successful at reducing consumption of targeted
foods/beverages and improving short-term weight loss. For instance, in our preliminary work we demonstrated
that a weight loss workshop plus a short, daily ICT produced greater weight loss for individuals with higher-
than-average implicit preferences for high-sugar foods, compared to a robust attention control (i.e., the
workshop plus a sham training), and we found that adding gamification elements (e.g., story, music, levels) to
a rudimentary game produced additional 8-week weight loss for men (4.1% vs 2.5%). This project extends
previous work by evaluating the independent effects of gamification and ICT on long-term engagement and
outcomes. As such, 243 men with BMI ≥ 25 will be recruited, with 15 participating in usability testing and 228
assigned to a 12-month mHealth weight loss program that prescribes digital self-monitoring and dietary and
physical activity targets. Utilizing an efficient 2 x 2 factorial design, participants will be randomized to receive
either a standard or fully-gamified program, comprised of a behavior change program featuring team-based
competition, and digital reinforcers for attainment of streaks and milestones, and also randomized to receive
either sham or active inhibitory control neurotraining. Aims include evaluating the efficacy of gamification and
ICTon weight loss, diet and physical activity at 12 months, as well as evaluating hypothesized mediators
(engagement and inhibitory control) and moderators (baseline frequency of video game play and implicit
preferences for ICT-targeted foods)."
10701357,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a chronic inflammatory vascular condition that remains a
leading cause of death in the United States with disproportionate impact on the US veteran and
active military populations. Cigarette smoking and other tobacco products clearly accelerate the
development of CAD; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking smoke with CAD
remain poorly understood. To combat these issues, our group has provided extensive evidence
linking smoke exposure with extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)
and the production of bioactive peptide fragments. These bioactive matrix fragments can promote
chemotaxis (termed matrix-derived chemokines, or matrikines) and have been described by our
group and others as novel mediators of inflammation in cardiovascular disease. Despite these
observations, the contribution of matrikines to smoke-associated CAD is unknown. We provide
preliminary data demonstrating the pro-inflammatory matrikine proline-glycine-proline (PGP) and
its receptor CXC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) to be inducible mediators of endothelial
dysfunction and vascular inflammation with smoking. We also provide evidence that neutrophil
and macrophage-derived exosomes are loaded with active proteases capable of generating PGP
in response to smoke (i.e., proteolytic exosomes). Importantly, within a local cohort of patients
with a significant history of smoking we observed that increased plasma PGP is associated with
CAD or prior coronary revascularization. These results beg the question as to whether smoke
induces a feedforward mechanism of proteolytic exosome release, PGP production, and
subsequent inflammatory cell infiltration into the vascular wall thereby accelerating the
development of CAD. For this proposal, we will build on our seminal observations by first
investigating PGP production and endothelial CXCR2 signaling as critical promoters of vascular
disease in a smoke-induced mouse model of atherosclerosis (Specific Aim 1). Secondly, we will
investigate smoke activated neutrophil and/or macrophage exosomes as direct mediators of
endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation (Specific Aim 2). Notably, we hypothesize that
neutrophil-exosome associated neutrophil elastase (NE) and macrophage-exosome associated
MMP-12 may propagate vascular matrix fragmentation and endothelial dysfunction in response
to smoke. Finally, we will identify PGP and NE+ / MMP-12+ exosomes as clinical biomarkers of
CAD within a cohort of subjects referred for coronary angiography and defined by their smoking
status (i.e., Never, Former, and Current, Specific Aim 3). Successful completion of these aims
will lead to an increased understanding of matrikine biology in vascular disease, as well as
improve our ability to stratify veterans at risk for smoke-induced CAD. Importantly, these studies
will likely result in the development of new biomarkers and potential new therapeutic approaches
for the prevention of CAD among veterans that smoke."
10902033,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 India’s HIV epidemic is being fueled by an alarming rise in injection of opioids. Young people who inject
drugs (YPWID; 18-29 years of age) are poorly engaged in treatment for opioid use disorder and HIV prevention
services and bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections. Increasing engagement in treatment for
opioid use disorder and uptake of HIV prevention services among YPWID is an urgent public health priority.
 YRGCARE, an Indian non-governmental organization, has established Integrated Care Centers in 8 cities
to deliver medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other HIV prevention services, including HIV
testing, clean needles, and condoms to people who inject drugs. YPWID initiating MOUD at Integrated Care
Centers engage poorly in treatment due to diverse barriers that also limit uptake of HIV prevention services.
YPWID under-engaged in MOUD have high risk behaviors, low HIV testing, and high HIV seroconversion. Few
interventions exist to support substance use treatment and HIV prevention among Indian YPWID.
 Dr. Ganapathi is a pediatric infectious diseases physician who aspires to lead rigorous research to address
this gap. Building upon her HIV research fellowship training and unique clinical background, she will utilize this
Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development (K23) Award to: 1) develop expertise in behavioral
intervention development, 2) gain skills in advanced statistical methods and study design for intervention
research, and 3) develop an understanding of the principles of implementation science.
 Dr. Ganapathi will develop and pilot “Yuva Sath”, a brief, peer-led behavioral intervention to support MOUD
engagement and uptake of HIV prevention services among YPWID who have initiated MOUD at Integrated
Care Centers but are under-engaged in treatment. Informed by empirical principles used in successful youth-
tailored interventions, Yuva Sath will be developmentally tailored, leverage peer support, and employ
convenient mobile phone delivery. Development of Yuva Sath will entail adapting “Life-Steps”, an empirically
supported problem-solving intervention originally developed to support antiretroviral therapy adherence.
Intervention development will be informed by: 1) analysis of existing quantitative data collected from a
retrospective cohort of YPWID initiating MOUD across 8 Integrated Care Centers, and 2) collection of
qualitative data to understand YPWID preferences for intervention content and delivery. Dr. Ganapathi will then
conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of Yuva Sath, compared to usual care, among YPWID at a single
Integrated Care Center in Aizawl city in Northeast India, to inform a future fully powered effectiveness trial.
 Leveraging research infrastructure at Harvard Medical School and YRGCARE, Dr. Ganapathi will be
mentored by a multidisciplinary team, with expertise in behavioral medicine, infectious diseases, and addiction
medicine, led by Drs. O’Cleirigh, Solomon, and Mayer. By developing a novel HIV prevention intervention for
YPWID, this work has potential to impact public health while facilitating her transition to independence."

 The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to advance OncoSpherix’s HIF-1 inhibitor, 64B, as part of combination
therapy for metastatic and high-risk uveal melanoma (UM), the most prevalent primary eye cancer in adults. 64B
is a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits HIF function by disrupting the recruitment of the transcriptional co-
factor, p300/CBP, while leaving intact p300/CBP’s ability to function with multiple other transcription factors. As
a consequence, 64B is well-tolerated for prolonged periods in tumor bearing mice, both alone and in combination
with multiple other cancer therapeutics.
 We’ve published studies where several UM cell lines were orthotopically implanted within the uveal of
the eye, showing that 64B inhibits primary tumor growth and metastases in mice while also prolonging survival.
Results from our Phase I SBIR studies built on this prior work and strongly support the continued development
of 64B as an important, novel and innovative cancer therapeutic. 64B demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy
when compared to two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, sunitinib and selumetinib) that are in phase 2 or 3 clinical
testing for UM. 64B was better tolerated that the TKIs. When tumors were much larger when treatment was
started, 64B showed therapeutic synergy when combined with sorafenib, another TKI in clinical testing for UM.
 Our Phase I SBIR studies led to significant progress in the chemistry needed to advance 64B into clinical
testing. A 5-step synthesis was selected that eliminated the use of microwave reactors, chromatographic
purifications and use of palladium catalysts. The overall production yield was improved from about 2 % to >22%,
or about 75% yield per stage across the five stages. Through refinement of the process, 700 g of 64B were
produced with >98 % purity, providing sufficient 64B for proposed SBIR phase 2 studies. We tested amorphous
solid dispersion (ASD) as an enhanced formulation method that improved 64B’s solubility more than 40-fold.
Metabolic and PK studies provided evidence the plasma levels of orally delivered 64B were insufficient to fully
block HIF, most likely due to first pass effects in the liver, and thus we will focus on parenteral delivery for
preclinical and clinical studies.
 Phase II SBIR studies will identify the best 64B-TKI class combination to advance for clinical testing using
UM cells directly implanted in the uvea of the eye. Studies on responsiveness to 64B using several UM cell lines
with targeted deletion of HIF-1a, HIF-2a or both will add additional mechanistic insights. Other objectives are
focused on converting to IV dosing for both efficacy and non-GLP toxicology studies, including determining the
maximum tolerated dose of 64B and repeat dosing toxicity in two species. We anticipate successful completion
of all specific aims within 2 years and securing the additional funds needed for completing IND-enabling studies,
filing an IND, and launching clinical testing using 64B with a TKI for metastatic UM."

Antibody-mediated lymphocyte depletion is a common strategy to eliminate donor-reactive T cells in transplant
recipients. However, memory T cells are more resistant to depletion and have been associated with acute
rejection episodes in transplant recipients treated with polyclonal rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-
CD52 mAb. Understanding the mechanisms and composition of T cells reconstituted in lymphopenic transplant
recipients is thus critical for the rational use of lymphoablative therapies and for improving their graft-prolonging
efficacy. The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop approaches that minimize homeostatic expansion and
shift the balance towards thymopoiesis, thus avoiding over-immunosuppression. During the previous funding
cycle, we used a murine ATG analog (mATG) in a mouse heart allograft model to establish that homeostatic
reconstitution of the entire T cell compartment is driven by depletion-resistant memory CD4+ T cells via B cells
and CD40/CD154 pathway. While cognate TCR-pMHC interactions between B cells and T cells were
dispensable, we identified posttransplant inflammation and B cell-derived cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-27 as key
factors facilitating homeostatic T cell recovery. Our preliminary data indicate that signaling through pattern
recognition receptors TLR4, TLR9 and a Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle, or Clec4e) is required to
initiate B cell production of proinflammatory cytokines. We further identified innate-like marginal zone (MZ) B
cells acting as initial sensors of posttransplant inflammation in lymphopenic recipients. Genetic deficiency or
specific depletion of MZ B cells markedly delays T cell reconstitution in mATG treated heart allograft recipients.
We hypothesize that inflammation induced by transplantation at the time of lymphoablation promotes rapid T cell
reconstitution. DAMPs released by the graft activate B cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that further
amplify B cell activation and directly enhance T cell proliferation. In particular, MZ B cells activated via C-type
lectin receptor Mincle and TLRs act as initial sensors of posttransplant inflammation facilitating proinflammatory
functions of follicular B cells. Therefore, the homeostatic recovery of memory T cells and ensuing allograft
rejection may be decreased by minimizing DAMPs signaling or by targeting MZ B cell activation and functions.
We will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims: Aim 1. To test the role of MZ B cells as primary sensors of graft
tissue injury in lymphopenic recipients. Aim 2. To investigate the mechanisms by which C-type lectin receptor
Mincle facilitates B cell proinflammatory functions after mATG lymphoablation.
The proposed studies will mechanistically dissect how inflammatory pathways triggered by allograft
ischemia/reperfusion injury drive rapid reconstitution of depletion-resistant memory T cells. Based on these
insights, we will test the efficacy of several clinically relevant approaches for inhibiting recovery of pathogenic
donor-reactive memory T cells and prolonging heart allograft survival in ATG treated recipients."

The objective of this proposal is to improve malaria response in the Amazon by enhancing knowledge on when
where, and which targeted interventions will have the greatest impact. There is a critical need for improved
malaria control—since 2011, no region in the world has experienced a larger increase in malaria than the
Amazon. Several events contributed to this rise: extreme weather (i.e., El Nino), expanded resource extraction,
political unrest in Venezuela, and withdrawal of the Global Fund from South America. The unprecedented malaria
resurgence has been particularly high near border regions where migration and poor health care facilitate
transmission. The current surveillance system has a 4-week delay in cases reported, which is completely
inadequate, resulting in reactive vs. preventive intervention strategies. To respond, our team developed a Malaria
Early Warning System (MEWS) with NASA support for Loreto, Peru, where over 90% of malaria cases in Peru
occur. The MEWS forecasts outbreaks with >90% sensitivity and >75% specificity 8-12 weeks in advance in sub-
regions (EcoRegions using unobserved component models [UCM]) and districts (via spatial Bayesian models),
and fits community-based agent based models (ABMs) to evaluate behavioral factors associated with
transmission. However, gaps remain: our MEWS has unknown performance outside of Peru; it does not
incorporate migration; forecasts are not downscaled for hotspot detection; forecasting performance is poor near
border regions; and the models are not integrated across scales. We address these gaps with three aims: (1)
Evaluate MEWS expansion to the Ecuadorian and Brazilian Amazon and evaluate sub-district downscaled
forecasts; (2) Evaluate the relationship between infrastructure, socioeconomic networks, and migration across
international borders with malaria incidence; and (3) Evaluate scenarios of potential malaria interventions along
borders to reduce malaria risk in both countries using ABMs. This project will significantly improve current
surveillance efforts by providing both current estimates and forecasts of malaria using state-of-the-art climate,
hydrology and land cover models. The MEWS is expanded by obtaining surveillance and population data from
Ecuador and Brazil, and merging these with hydro-meteorological data. New EcoRegions that ignore
administrative borders are defined and UCMs are applied. Spatial Bayesian models are used to estimate both
district- and downscaled sub-district level malaria incidence. Infrastructure data are obtained from public sources
and a social network analysis (and data collection) will be conducted in communities along border regions (Brazil-
Peru, Ecuador-Peru). We evaluate malaria incidence along identified network structures up to 300km away from
borders and test simulated intervention scenarios in border communities to evaluate effects on malaria
transmission. This proposal responds to the WHO 2016-2030 Global Technical Strategy for Malaria and the
recent initiatives by the Pan American Health Organization calling for improved malaria surveillance as a core
intervention to improve response to high malaria burden."
10911864,"Waterborne pathogens like Vibrio cholerae pose significant threats to global health. V. cholerae can persist in
the aquatic environment, and it can emerge to cause devastating cholera outbreaks in endemic regions and
vulnerable areas lacking adequate water and sanitation infrastructure. The host-pathogen interactions that
dictate disease outcome and cholera transmission dynamics occur in the context of a complex microbial
ecosystem that includes predatory bacterial viruses (phages). Phages profoundly impact the evolution of their
bacterial hosts, both through predation, which selects for hosts with defenses that overcome phage killing and
through mobilization and dissemination of genetic material. Certain mobile elements called the phage satellites
have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to exploit phages for their own selfish spread. Such elements interfere
with the replication of the phages they parasitize, and as such, provide their cellular hosts with a means to limit
phage predation. Our lab discovered PLEs (for phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements) in V.
cholerae that provide specific and robust defense against ICP1, the dominant lytic phage co-circulating with V.
cholerae in cholera endemic regions. Upon infection by ICP1, PLEs excise from the V. cholerae chromosome,
replicate to high copy and are assembled into virions to spread the PLE genome to new cells while
concurrently abolishing phage production. PLEs are uniquely potent, highly specific, anti-phage barriers that
act through multiple mechanisms to ensure that ICP1 does not propagate and spread to neighboring V.
cholerae cells. However, few mechanisms of direct interference with ICP1 are known, and none are essential
for PLE activity, indicating that additional mechanisms await discovery in this system. This proposal builds on
our prior work defining the PLE lifecycle in response to phage infection to gain a mechanistic understanding of
how PLEs execute their unusually potent anti-phage activity. Our data indicate that PLE’s most potent anti-
phage inhibitors are focused on blocking virion assembly. To understand PLE activity in mechanistic detail, we
will pursue the following specific aims: 1) We will define the structural composition of virions and capsid
assembly intermediates for ICP1 and PLE 2) We will Interrogate the functions of three PLE-encoded ORFs that
are each sufficient to inhibit phage 3) We will determine how a PLE-encoded small RNA perturbs phage gene
expression. The proposed studies are expected to reveal novel mechanistic paradigms not previously
documented in phage satellites or other anti-phage defense systems. The long-term coevolution of V. cholerae
PLE and ICP1 serves as a powerful model system to understand clinically relevant phage defense
mechanisms to inform phage therapy efforts and understand the forces driving the evolution of bacterial
pathogens."

 The NCRAR will hold its next three Biennial Conferences starting with “Vestibular Disorders: From Cause to
Cure” in fall 2021. Subsequent conference topics are tentatively titled “Post-Pandemic Innovations in
Connected Audiology” and “Multi-Sensory Approaches to Auditory Rehabilitation”, to be refined based on
developments in the field and participant feedback from the previous conference. These three-day intensive
conferences will bring together basic and translational scientists, clinicians, patients, and health policymakers
to promote the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of patients with hearing and balance disorders. We
hypothesize that clinical outcomes will be improved if they incorporate a collaborative, interprofessional clinical
approach shaped by both the pathophysiology and the perspective of the patient. Consistent with the NIDCD's
2017-2021 Strategic Plan, these conferences aim to meet the critical need for multidisciplinary approaches to
diagnose and treat auditory and vestibular deficits appropriately within a patient-centered care model.
 The objectives of the 2021 conference are to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms, diagnosis, and
clinical management of vestibular dysfunction. Specific topics include cellular regeneration, aging, head
trauma, psychophysical testing, artificial-intelligence guided diagnosis, virtual reality-based rehabilitation, and
vestibular implantation. Panel discussions with patients and experts and curated matching of mentors with
students provide valuable communication and networking opportunities. A novel aspect of the conference
series is the inclusion of stakeholders, such as patients and policymakers, within the clinical teaching sessions.
An innovative aspect is to optimize the relevance of the case-study focused problem-based learning sessions
by polling attendees regarding their challenges in clinical research and patient care. A closing discussion with
the presenters and audience will recap recommendations for future research and developments in clinical care.
 The conference will be limited to 200 attendees to create an intimate environment enhancing open
communication. Ten scholarships provided to students and 5 to practicing clinicians will attract participants
from outside the scientific community, with at least 8 scholarships awarded to applicants who are women, part
of a racial/ethnic minority group, or have a disability. The conference will be publicized through social media,
email and other professional meetings. Announcements will be posted on the NCRAR website, professional
organization websites, and published in specialty journals. Conference content will be disseminated to non-
attendees via a special issue of the American Journal of Audiology, and the conference presentations will be
available at a reduced price on the NCRAR website (with presenter permissions)."
10913981,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease with only 30% 5-year overall survival. As a blood
cancer, AML appears poised to benefit from the revolution in engineered cellular therapies and bispecific
antibodies. These agents are making an enormous impact in B-cell malignancies. However, extending this
success to AML faces two significant hurdles: 1) lack of highly disease-specific targets, where engaging
current AML therapeutic targets leads to severe cytokine release syndrome and severe myeloablation,
precluding an effective therapeutic index; and 2) significant intratumoral heterogeneity, where targeting a single
surface antigen is likely to lead to antigen-negative relapse. In practice, these two challenges leave few
therapeutic targets sufficient to achieve cures in most patients. Here, my long-term goal is to develop a new
therapeutic approach to overcome these hurdles. This proposal will be led by myself under the sponsorship of
Dr. Arun Wiita, an expert in hematologic malignancies and drug resistance, with collaborative support from Dr.
Kole Roybal, expert in advanced cellular engineering; and Dr. Jim Wells, expert in antibody engineering.
Specifically, I hypothesize that employing SNIPR, the newly-described, next-generation, humanized platform
based on the SynNotch cellular engineering technology (Zhu et al., Cell 2022), will enable development of a
multi-functional T-cell therapy that can eliminate residual AML after induction chemotherapy, clearing relapse-
driving leukemic stem cells and increasing cure rates, while avoiding toxicities of systemic therapeutics. My
major design pillars include 1) develop engineered T-cells that home specifically to the leukemic stem cell
niche; and 2) locally, but not systemically, have SNIPR T-cells secrete multiple protein therapeutics to ablate
heterogenous leukemic stem cells and AML blasts in and near this niche. In Specific Aim 1, I test the feasibility
and initial in vitro and in vivo potency of SNIPR engineered T-cells designed to simultaneously secrete
functional bispecific antibodies against 3 AML targets. In Specific Aim 2, I use PDX models to test whether
SNIPR T-cells can selectively home to the bone marrow niche, with CD70 as the optimal leukemic stem cell
“trigger”. Successful completion of these Aims will set the stage for subsequent work, outside the scope of this
proposal, to validate, using additional in vitro and in vivo models, the ability of CD70-sensing, multi-bispecific-
secreting T-cells to eliminate AML more completely than other therapies while minimizing toxicities.
Furthermore, this approach will ultimately enable delivery of other therapeutic payloads to the leukemic stem
cell niche, ideally targeting this disease-driving cellular population with unprecedented precision. Success here
may also outline a new therapeutic strategy for use across cancers, to eliminate heterogeneous tumor in the
microenvironment while sparing normal cells. Completion of the work in this proposal in conjunction with the
associated training plan will provide critical expertise and experience to support my goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist focused on translational immunotherapy research."

New neurons are added in the adult mammalian brain by a process known as adult neurogenesis and adult
neurogenesis is a key player in functional outcomes for learning and memory. One of the two known niches of
adult neurogenesis is the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus. It is known
that TGF-β signaling is crucial for neurogenesis during development while its role in adult neurogenesis remains
unclear. Due to the lethal phenotype in early neonatal mice of the global TGF-β knockout mice, the precise role
of TGF-β signaling in adult neurogenesis has been challenging to study. Chronic delivery of TGF-β in vivo inhibits
neurogenesis; however, inhibition of TGF-β signaling via knockout of the type I receptor (Alk5) in mature and
immature neurons also leads to compromised adult neurogenesis. Additionally, pharmacological modulation of
TGF-β signaling in previous studies affect multiple cells types including neurons and microglia which are known
to have an indirect role in regulating adult neurogenesis. Therefore, to understand the precise autonomous
requirement of TGF-β signaling in the process of adult neurogenesis during different stages such as proliferation,
differentiation, maturation, and migration, adult neural stem cell specific and inducible gene modulation models
are needed. To circumvent these challenges in the field, we have generated NSC- specific TGF-β receptor type
I (Alk5) or type II (TβRII) inducible knockout (iKO) mice which allows us to more specifically investigate how this
signaling pathway affects adult NSCs and downstream progeny. Preliminary data from our lab shows in vitro
pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β signaling with SB-431542 increases the proliferation of adult neural stem
cell (NSCs) while treatment with TGF-β inhibits the proliferation. This implicates TGF-β signaling in playing an
inhibitory role in the proliferation of adult NSCs. Additionally, our preliminary in vivo data from NestincreER-Alk5
iKO mice suggests TGF-β signaling is important for the maturation and migration of NSCs in the SGZ. We,
therefore, hypothesize a dual role of TGF-β signaling in the neurogenic cascade which inhibits the proliferation
of NSCs while simultaneously supporting maturation and migration in immature and mature neurons. The goal
of this current study is to determine the precise functions and mechanisms of TGF-β signaling in regulation of
adult neurogenesis through different stages and identify distinct target genes in each process. Although previous
studies provide evidence of TGF-β signaling influencing adult neurogenesis, there are conflicting results
throughout the field as TGF-β signaling is known to act in a highly context-dependent manner. With the specificity
of our in vivo mouse models, this proposal will provide novel insight on the cellular and mechanistic processes
involved with adult neurogenesis."

The proposed studies will examine mechanisms by which advanced age increases intestinal permeability and
neuroinflammation after burn injury using a clinically relevant mouse model. Regardless of age, most burn
patients do not die from primary injuries, but rather from complications, such as sepsis. Further, aged burn
patients often experience greater neurological impairments, which may stem from heightened
neuroinflammation. Clinical and experimental evidence reveal that healthy aged subjects are in an elevated
basal inflammatory state, referred to as “inflammaging,” which can contribute to deficits in tissue injury and
repair. We and others believe that inflammaging is caused by translocation of bacterial products from the
intestinal lumen and that exposure to these products triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-C Motif Chemokine
Ligand 2 (CCL2). Novel preliminary data in our clinically-relevant murine model of scald burn injury confirm that
aged mice who sustain a burn injury have heightened circulating levels of danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs), and a greater breach in intestinal epithelial barrier integrity that coincides with an increase
in markers of neuroinflammation. Both neuroinflammation and burn injury in the aged population have been
correlated with breaches in the blood brain barrier, delirium, and other signs of cognitive decline. From these
observations, we hypothesize that post-burn gut leakiness seen in aged mice is driven by excessive IEC
death, ISC dysfunction, and reduced IEC proliferation. Additionally, these changes in the gut lead to
leakiness of the blood brain barrier and neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will
investigate the mechanisms behind gut leakiness in young and aged sham and burn-injured mice by identifying
intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis/necroptosis, epithelial cell proliferation, and intestinal stem cell markers in
vivo and in vitro utilizing whole tissue, isolated epithelium, and intestinal organoids, along with measuring
blood-borne gut-derived bacteria and bacterial cell wall components. In Aim 2, we will examine blood brain
barrier integrity in young and aged sham and burn-injured mice using multiple measures of barrier
permeability. Further, we will examine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and microglial
and astrocyte activation within brain regions. Finally, we will determine if limiting intestinal barrier damage after
burn injury reduces neuroinflammatory markers in the brain. These studies will expand our understanding of
how advanced age alters the gut in the context of burn injury and the impact of intestinal permeability on
neuroinflammation. It is our hope that our work will lead to the development of novel therapies to treat the
excessive inflammatory response and consequences of that inflammation in burn patients of all ages."

This proposal advances the development of a novel therapeutic for p53 wild type sarcomas. Our team has
identified a novel MDM2 inhibitor, SA53, with best-in-class potency, bioavailability and in vivo efficacy across a
broad range of preclinical models. It has also undergone extensive safety and pharmacokinetic testing, suitable
for support of an IND submission, with an identified starting dose in humans. SA53 has the potential to
facilitate apoptosis in p53 wild-type cancers and to spare normal tissue. To drive proof of concept, we will
conduct a first in human trial to 1) identify a safe dose for future clinical trials, 2) establish the pharmacokinetic
profile and appropriate safety endpoints, 3) in an expansion cohort, establish feasibility and early indication of
efficacy in treating p53 wild type soft tissue sarcoma. Our primary objective is to rapidly and efficiently advance
SA53 through clinical trials to implement a novel and innovative treatment for p53 wild type soft tissue
sarcoma. Our approach is first establishing the recommended phase 2 dose in a trial for p53 wild type
refractory solid tumors, then to apply this novel therapy in an expansion cohort targeting a pre-surgical window
in soft tissue sarcoma patients. To achieve these goals, we will complete the following specific aims:
Aim 1: We will complete GMP manufacturing of the drug and formulated clinical product suitable to complete a
phase 1 clinical trial.
Aim 2: We will conduct a phase 1 clinical trial to establish the recommended dose for phase 2 and early
indication of feasibility and efficacy in soft tissue sarcoma patients.
At the completion of this proposal, we will have completed a phase 1 trial to have established safety and
preliminary efficacy, which will serve as the foundation for registration directed studies. In light of our
exceptional in vivo efficacy data, we further believe that this can be a breakthrough paradigm-changing therapy
for cancer treatment."

 Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16
million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation can significantly reduce the
risk of disease even for those who have smoked for decades. Interventions using a combination of behavioral
approaches that focus on maintaining smokers' motivation to quit, providing specific techniques for quitting and
relapse prevention, and using Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) are effective at helping tobacco users quit.
However, standard behavioral treatment may not appeal to, or be effective for, some smokers and novel
approaches are needed to assist these individuals. Guided Imagery (GI) is a form of mind-body therapy that
involves controlled, multi-sensory visualization of specific mental images. GI is an effective therapeutic tool to
change behaviors including tobacco use. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to GI results in significantly
increased abstinence rates compared to controls or those taking bupropion. A large proportion of the U.S.
population uses integrative health approaches. A GI tobacco cessation intervention could appeal to smokers not
interested in using a behavioral approach. Although GI is an effective tool for smoking cessation, the mode of
delivery has generally been in person, limiting dissemination to large populations. Systematic and meta-analytic
reviews have shown that telephone quitlines are a highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. Quitlines
are available in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Guam. The proposed project is highly responsive to PAR-20-
154 by delivering a GI intervention via telephone which is highly scalable and could greatly increase the reach
and accessibility of an effective GI smoking cessation intervention. We recently completed a randomized
feasibility trial of the Be Smoke Free program. Although not powered to determine efficacy, the intervention
showed promise in helping participants to quit and showed high consumer satisfaction. We developed
procedures for recruiting participants and surpassed our recruitment goals. We had >90% retention at 8-weeks
and >80% at 6-months. We also found high levels of adherence. The results of this randomized feasibility study
indicate that a fully powered study of a GI tobacco cessation intervention delivered via telephone is warranted.
Therefore, the objective of this R01 application is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the
efficacy of the Be Smoke Free, telephone-based, GI intervention (IC) for smoking cessation compared to
active behavioral control (CC). The study will recruit 1,200 diverse smokers from three states, Arizona, New
York, and West Virginia to increase generalizability. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the
IC or CC delivered by telephone by University of Arizona study coaches and will be assessed at 3- and 6-months
post-enrollment by study staff. The primary outcome is biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence
at 6 months. This innovative and rigorously designed project conducted by an experienced team has the potential
to improve public health through the delivery of an innovative integrative GI intervention via telephone."

Interleukin-38 (IL-38), a member of the IL-1 family, has not been studied until recently despite its discovery
20 years ago. It is a neglected cytokine because no receptor was identified for how IL-38 functioned.
However, in 2012, we reported that recombinant human IL-38 bound to the IL-36 receptor (now IL-1R6) and
suppressed the production of IL-17 and IL-22. In that study, we proposed that IL-38 acted as a receptor
antagonist for IL-1R6. However, the dose-response of IL-38 did not behave as receptor antagonist but rather
acted as an inhibitor of cell activities. New data suggests that IL-38 requires IL-1R6, an orphan receptor in
the IL-1 Family, to suppress IL-17. Formerly termed IL-1 Receptor Associated Protein Like-1, IL-1R9 will be
studied for its putative role in the suppression of innate immunity by recombinant IL-38. Using CRISPR/Cas
methods, we have generated a colony of mice that are deficient in IL-38. These mice are used to determine
a requirement for endogenous IL-38 in mouse models of human inflammatory diseases. In those models
where disease severity worsens in IL-38 deficient mice, we will use recombinant IL-38 to treat mice for
suppression of innate inflammation. In order to fully understand the role of IL-38 in innate immunity, we
generated a mouse colony deficient in IL-1R9. We will study the requirement of IL-1R9 for the function of
recombinant IL-38 in those mouse models where treatment with IL-38 has significantly reduced disease
severity. A unique aspect of this application is that IL-1R9 in on the X-chromosome, an unusual finding in
cytokine biology. Because IL-1R9 is on the X-chromosome, we can address how suppression of innate
immunity is affected in males compared to females. With most autoimmune diseases having a 70%
predilection for females and with each autoimmune disease there is an inflammatory contribution, we have
designed studies for comparisons of homozygous IL-1R9 deficient males to homozygous IL-1R9 females.
In these studies, we will also evaluate the role of IL-38 to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
using a specific oral NLRP3 inhibitor presently used to treat patients. In addition to AIM 1 and AIM 2 studies
on recombinant IL-38 suppression of innate immunity and the putative role of IL-1R9, we will produce and
test an IL-38-Fc fusion protein (AIM 3). The rationale for producing an IL-38-Fc fusion protein is to provide
pre-clinical data for an IL-38 therapeutic. In AIM 4 we address the issue of IL-38 release from the cell. IL-38
circulates in healthy subjects but levels are significantly low in subjects at risk for a cardiovascular events.
However, IL-38 being a B-cell product suggests that processing of the IL-38 precursor and release from the
cell is not via traditional pathways. We will examine pathways for secretion that are used by other members
of the IL-1 Family : inhibition of NLRP3 and inhibition of calpains. The overall goal of these studies is to
advance the biology and clinical significance of IL-38 as well as to exploit the anti-inflammatory properties of
IL-38 as a therapeutic."
10909883,"OMEGA COPD Trial SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States, with significantly
higher prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in lower income communities. Poor dietary intake, and in particular
low omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, is a common problem in low-income communities and has been
associated with adverse outcomes in populations with respiratory disease. We, and others, have shown that a
diet defined by lower omega-3 intake is associated with worse COPD respiratory outcomes. Because omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids obtained through diet are responsible for arbitration of pulmonary and systemic
inflammation through the eicosanoid pathway, omega-3 intake may also be a critical protector against the
adverse effects of pro-inflammatory exposures related to COPD respiratory morbidity. Our group has further
demonstrated that indoor air particulate matter (PM) levels are linked to worse respiratory morbidity in individuals
with COPD, and indeed a diet low in omega-3 likely augments the adverse effects of pollutant exposure on
respiratory morbidity. Unfortunately, low-income individuals with COPD often have diets with omega-3 intake
levels well below recommended levels in addition to relatively high levels of indoor PM exposures, leading to
heightened risk of poor respiratory outcomes. A dietary intervention, designed to increase intake of omega-3 in
food sources, has the potential for high-impact within this vulnerable group. In this proposal, we will test a dietary
intervention based in omega-3 rich foods, with the aim of improving respiratory health (Aim 1), and protecting
against the adverse effects of environmental exposures (Aim 2) in low income adults with COPD. The
intervention will overcome several common nutritional barriers in low-income communities: food insecurity (a
voucher will be provided), food access and fresh food availability (home delivery and choice from a range of
healthy food options), and support in achieving and sustaining dietary change (regular contact with a dietary
health coach trained to support personal behaviors surrounding healthy food choices and provide culturally-
informed education around nutrition and food preparation). Through qualitative methods (Aim 3), we will also
explore barriers and facilitators of the intervention in order to optimize sustainability of future implementation
strategies. Results will comprehensively address the impact of an evidence-based nutrition intervention on
COPD health, and provide a framework for dietary intervention within other chronic diseases disproportionately
impacting susceptible, low-income populations. Positive results will be buoyed by existing infrastructure within a
leading national grocery delivery service supportive of expanding access to healthy foods, providing a ready
platform for sustainability and dissemination beyond the study and with immediate policy implications."
10699520,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is by far the leading cancer killer in Veterans. Major reasons for death
after surgical resection are the >50% recurrence rate despite curative intent treatment due to micrometastatic
disease at the time of diagnosis. To prevent the development of metastatic recurrence, surgically treated
patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy to eradicate undetectable micrometastatic disease. However, this
therapy is only associated with a 5% survival benefit due to drug resistances of cancer cells. Identifying
personalized treatment strategies to prevent metastases remains an unmet clinical need. Alveolar epithelial
type II (AT2) cells are self-renewing epithelial stem cells in the lung that have been identified as the origin for a
majority of NSCLCs. However, it is unknown whether and how epithelial cancer cells, such as AT2 cells,
contribute to metastatic progression as the major cause of death. Novel data link AT2 cells to the development
of NSCLC metastases. A research team led by a surgeon scientist has integrated expertise in human
biobanking and translational cancer research at two VA hospitals with collaborators specialized in preclinical
cancer models, single cell sequencing, genetics, and bioinformatics. It will be investigated how AT2 and other
epithelial cancer cells contribute to NSCLC metastatic progression and drug resistances, as this will allow
better molecular targeting to improve cure rates. Micrometastatic cells, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs),
are surrogates of the early metastatic process that can be detected by a blood draw as a liquid biopsy.
Currently available preclinical models used to study the spectrum of cancer progression from a localized
primary tumor to metastatic disease are limited. To combat this, a library of patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
mouse models using primary tumors, micrometastatic CTCs (CDX) and brain metastases was developed.
Using single cell RNA sequencing techniques, presence of an additional AT2 population was confirmed in
NSCLC patients' metastatic tissues and primary lung tumors that had metastasized already. However, AT2
cells were absent in primary lung tumors of patients that had not metastasized. Importantly, AT2-depleted
NSCLC cell lines have reduced tumorigenicity in PDX mouse models. Gene expression and culture data also
suggest a strong migratory capacity of AT2-like cancer cells. This indicates an important role of AT2 cells in
metastatic progression. For further validation of these critical leads, patient-derived organoid (PDO) pipelines
for high-throughput tumor growth and drug response testing were generated. It is innovative to expand on
metastasis-associated epithelial cancer cells, such as AT2, using patient-derived models and identify drug
targets. Based on the rationale that AT2 populations with an impact on tumorigenicity are identified in
metastases, the hypothesis is that AT2 cells promote NSCLC metastatic progression and express cancer-
relevant genes. The objective is to identify AT2 lineage-specific phenotypes to detect therapeutic targets in
NSCLC. In task 1, AT2-like and other epithelial cancer cell populations will be dissected in NSCLC primary
tumors and metastases. AT2 cells will be enriched from a library of human NSCLC cell lines for study of
tumorigenicity. Druggable pathways will be identified in NSCLC patient tissues with single cell analyses. In task
2, the impact of epithelial cancer cells, including AT2, on drug responses and patient prognosis will be
determined. PDOs from human primary and metastatic NSCLC tumors will be treated with standard-of-care
chemotherapy to associate drug responses with gene expressions of epithelial cancer cells. AT2 phenotypes
will also be identified in CTCs as liquid biopsies. The impact of AT2-CTCs on survival in surgically treated
NSCLC patients will be determined for risk stratification. Upon completion of the proposal, AT2-associated
cellular and molecular targets to prevent metastatic progression in NSCLC will be identified. Results have high
potential for clinical impact to prevent recurrences in patients undergoing curative surgery for NSCLC. Data will
lead to discovery of drug targets at a single cell level that are primed for translation into clinical trials."
10894677,"Building on a half-century of innovation in transvascular access and ultrasound image guidance, LXS has
developed a novel catheter device and venous access procedure to cannulate and aspirate the thoracic duct
under ultrasound guidance. The company has successfully completed Phase I and II of the NIH’s SBIR program
and is applying for a Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) award to complete development, prepare and
submit for FDA clearance, ramp manufacturing, and develop critical sales and marketing strategies in
anticipation of commercial use. This CRP program has four Specific Aims to be completed over three years.
 With interest in cell-based therapies for a variety of disease states is at an all-time high, access to large
numbers of substrate cells remains a significant obstacle. Harvesting rare cell types from peripheral blood is
costly and time consuming. At present, development of lymphocyte-focused therapies depends on cells collected
from peripheral blood where lymphocytes make up less than 3% of circulating cells. The low number of desirable
cells makes ex-vivo expansion and manipulation impossible in a point-of-care setting.
 Over a quarter century of research has significantly improved our understanding of the circulating
cardiovascular system and its cellular components. However, study of the parallel lymphatic system has lagged
far behind, limiting our understanding of this complex and potentially clinical beneficial network. The lymphatic
system is comprised of an extensive network of vessels and nodes that parallel the venous vasculature.
Peripheral lymphatic channels combine to form a single thoracic duct that enters the venous system at the
confluence of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins. The lymphatic system plays a number of critical roles
in pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.
 In Phase I, we designed and tested a proof-of-concept device capable of accessing the thoracic duct
from a left subclavian vein approach. In Phase II, the company further refined our approach and validated pre -
clinical devices in a large animal study and a unique perfused cadaver model. Outside of NIH-funded efforts, the
company conducted a successful first-in-human study, grew our IP portfolio to 10 applications and issued
patents, and attracted additional funding and resources from the Wellcome Trust, AmFAR, and J&J.
 Completion of this CRP program will place the company in a position to launch sales with an FDA cleared
device as a direct competitor to plasmapheresis and the only transvascular access device for lymphocyte
collection and depletion. Next, through collaborations and partnerships with leaders in basic science and clinical
medicine, we plan to implement a range of studies and applications to expand the therapeutic role for large-scale
lymphocyte collection and manipulation. Data from post-market clinical studies in CAR T-cell production,
infectious disease, heart failure, and autoimmune disorders will lead to additional indication-specific clearances."
10930015,"Summary
Heart failure post-myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Each year it
is estimated that ~550K Americans will have a new MI, and ~200K will have a recurrent MI, leading to a large
body of patients suffering from heart failure. These staggering statistics necessitate the development of new
therapies for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies
offer significant potential for the development of novel therapies to treat these patients. While cell therapies have
been extensively studied for the treatment of MI and heart failure, meta-analyses of initial cell therapy trials
suggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. More recently acellular biomaterials have shown great promise
in providing similar or greater functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Injectable
biomaterials that stimulate endogenous repair are an attractive alternative since potential therapies could still be
delivered minimally invasively via catheter yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs
compared to cell products. Ventrix is therefore focusing on cell-free regenerative medicine approaches. Ventrix
has a history of success in developing injectable biomaterials for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two
previous NIH SBIRs resulted in an approved IND for VentriGel, an injectable, catheter-deliverable hydrogel
derived from decellularized porcine myocardium. This led to a recent successful Phase 1 clinical trial in patients
60 days to 3 years post-MI. We recently developed a new Infusible ECM, for treating acute MI. We showed it
can be delivered to an acute MI via intracoronary infusion and that it improves cardiac function in a rat acute MI
model following simulated intracoronary delivery. In our previous studies, we optimized delivery and retention of
Infusible ECM and demonstrated preliminary feasibility and efficacy in a porcine acute MI model. The studies
proposed in this Phase II project are part of the final steps to initiate studying Infusible ECM in patients, and a
key step in bringing a biomaterial product to market, which will be complementary to existing standard of care.
This will be the first intracoronary infusible regenerative biomaterial product for treating acute MI patients."
10907518,"Project Summary
The broad objective of this research is to use neuroimaging to understand the hemodynamic responses 
to anesthesia and sedation. Anesthesia and sedation, commonly used in pediatric patients, cause 
profound and rapid changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Under normal conditions in 
adults, these changes are tightly coupled to one another to protect the brain from hypoxia and 
ischemia. However, the extent to which flow and metabolism are coupled during anesthesia and 
sedation in pediatric patients is unknown. The aims of this project are (1) to quantify the 
hemodynamic and metabolic responses to anesthesia in infants, and (2) to compare those responses 
during the administration of specific anesthetics in infants with differing disease states that may 
make them more vulnerable to the uncoupling of flow from metabolism. If our hypotheses are borne 
out and infants are particularly vulnerable to this uncoupling, our findings will lead to future 
studies to assess hemodynamic responses as potential biomarkers that predict and mediate adverse 
outcomes in infants exposed to anesthesia. Therefore, this project is relevant to the NHLBI's 
strategic objective to identify factors that account for individual differences in pathobiology and 
treatment response.
This project requires an opportunity for making simultaneous flow and metabolism measurements in 
anesthetized infants. Clinical MR imaging provides this opportunity. Therefore, we will enroll into 
a Naturalistic Cohort Study 120 infants younger than 1 year of age who require a clinical MRI scan, 
half receiving anesthesia and half not. Enrolled infants will be imaged with MRI sequences that 
measure cerebral blood flow and metabolism. In addition, we will enroll 30 additional infants of 
the same age into a Pilot Randomized Comparator Trial (RCT), in which the infants will be 
randomized to receive either propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia. Randomization will dramatically 
reduce potential confounding of diseases and anesthetic agents present in the naturalistic study.
Learning to design RCTs (Goal 1) is addressed with didactics and a practicum to advance my 
translational research skills. This project requires my learning how anesthetics and sedatives 
alter hemodynamics and fluid dynamics (Goal 2) and how the known and putative mechanisms of 
neurotoxicity and flow-metabolism uncoupling affect the developing brain (Goal 3). This project and 
my research career will help infants who require anesthesia or sedation. It creates a paradigm in 
which the hemodynamic response to anesthesia can be explored safely in pediatric critical care 
patients. It requires the combination of MRI and image processing know-how - skills that I already 
have - with a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of altered hemodynamic 
responses to anesthesia in infants. It also requires that I develop an improved ability to design 
research projects that fit within a rigorous and narrow clinical opportunity - skills that I will 
gain with this K25 support."
10932852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project is to investigate how nucleic acids are involved in protein aggregation and folding. Protein
misfolding and aggregation lead to many debilitating diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. We recently
found that nucleic acids can have strong chaperone activity to prevent protein aggregation and aid protein
folding. Given their preponderance in the cell and strong effects on protein folding and aggregation, it is highly
likely that nucleic acids are important players in protein homeostasis. The work described in this proposal lays
out studies to provide our first understanding of the basic principles by which nucleic acids modulate protein
folding and aggregation, and thus protein homeostasis.
Our current investigations are directed at addressing two critical aspects: 1) Understanding the roles of
chaperone nucleic acids in the cell, and 2) Understanding the molecular mechanism of chaperone nucleic
acids. These studies utilize an interdisciplinary approach combining molecular biology, biochemistry,
biophysics, and bacterial genetics.
Our preliminary data indicates that both the activities of nucleic acids to prevent and promote oligomerization
are highly sequence dependent, and are especially encoded for by quadruplex structures. These results help
explain the biophysical causes of several neurodegenerative diseases. This insight also gives us the
opportunity to control and study protein aggregation using specific nucleic acid sequences and structures. Our
preliminary data also indicates that quadruplex-containing chaperone sequences are also effective at
improving the folding environment in E. coli. We are currently expanding these studies to known quadruplex
structures with chaperone-like effects in the cell, and investigating the structural basis of chaperone activity.
Together, these studies will lay the foundation for a new understanding of protein homeostasis and how it
relates to nucleic acid biology. This information will be critical in the future to help combat myriad protein
misfolding and aggregation diseases."

Rigorous environmental health science methods are underutilized in research relevant to nursing practice. This
underutilization is a unique and important gap as the nursing discipline represents the largest proportion of all
health care providers. The Environmental Health Research Institute for Nurse and Clinician Scientists (EHRI-
NCS) is designed to build the nursing discipline-wide capacity and rigor for translational and clinical research
methods in environmental health. The goal of this program is to enhance the discipline-wide capacity of nurse
scientists and their interdisciplinary clinician scientist collaborators for advanced research methods in
environmental health through a flipped classroom, train-the-trainer and mentorship program. This program is
timely to build upon the American Academy of Nursing’s 2019 declaration of environmental health as one of
the discipline’s five topical priorities. The flipped classroom model will be utilized as the best-practice pedagogy
to achieve higher order learning objectives with pre-recorded, online didactic lectures provided for participant
preparation, followed by a synchronous 5-day training and post-course mentorship follow-up. The objectives
are for the participant to 1) Design clinical research studies and research education with advanced
environmental health methodologies, 2) Mentor other peer, student, and early career nurse scientists in
environmental health methodologies, 3) Examine broader theoretical, philosophical, ethical, and legal contexts
related to environmental health exposure science with implications for clinical policy, practice, education, and
research, 4) Analyze strategies used for clinical environmental health interventions, 5) Describe trends in
environmental health molecular approaches of symptom science, 6) Acquire new analytic skills applied to
environmental health data, and 7) Compare and contrast the strengths, weaknesses, and applications of
environmental exposure science measurements and methods in clinical research. We will recruit participants
who have already achieved their terminal doctoral degree and those currently enrolled in a graduate nursing
program who educate, train, and mentor registered nurses in research trajectories. We will include specialized
recruitment and support structured for participants from under-represented minority groups. Course topics will
include 1) Theoretical conceptualization, 2) Intervention Study Designs, 3) Participatory Action Designs, 4)
Physiologic Measurement with Spirometry, 5) Biomarker Measurement, 6) Personal and Area Exposure
Measurement, 7) Informatics and Analytics, and 8) Health Disparities and Vulnerable Populations. Aligned with
the NIH/NIEHS 2018-2023 strategic goal to “Enhance environmental health science through stewardship and
support,” the impact of this successful program will include developing a discipline-wide, highly qualified
research workforce dedicated to solving environmental health problems relevant to nursing practice."
10901943,"Summary:
There is growing evidence implicating that cellular senescence is involved in the progression of chronic liver
diseases (CLD). However, the mechanisms underpinning cellular senescence-mediated progression of CLD
remain unclear. We have recently reported an important role of the activin A/p15INK4b axis in inducing
hepatocyte (HC) senescence. Further suggesting a role of the activin A/p15INK4b axis in inducing HC
senescence in CLD, because our preliminary data from rat models of liver cirrhosis revealed increased
activin A and p15INK4b expression in cirrhotic liver tissue regions, which correlated with increased hepatic
SA-β-gal activity. We also found that elevated p15INK4b expression in the livers of mice treated with CCl4 and
observed that activin A inhibition markedly reduced CCl4-induced hepatic injury. Increased levels of activin
A are also reported in several human CLDs, and our preliminary data demonstrate increased activin A
expression in the livers of cirrhosis patients. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that activin A
contributes to the pathogenesis of CLDs by driving p15INK4b-mediated induction of HC senescence.
Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors produced by senescent HCs promote
inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in CLD progression. We will test our hypothesis using our
established rat HC transplantation model and rodent models of CLD according to the following integrated
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use our HC-transplantation model to precisely demarcate senescent and
neighboring cells, followed by isolation of both cell populations using laser-capture microdissection (LCM).
Comparative analyses of these foci and their surrounding regions will reveal paracrine signals from
senescent HCs and their phenotypic effects on neighboring HCs. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of activin
A/p15INK4b-induced HC senescence in both rat and mouse models of CLD. Studies in the mouse model will
also include a comprehensive phenotypic and functional analysis of hepatic immune cell infiltrates to
determine the impact of HC senescence on immune cells. We will also evaluate hepatic expression of
activin A and p15INK4b in cirrhotic patients by confocal microscopy to determine the clinical relevance of the
activin A/p15INK4b axis. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will investigate the therapeutic benefit of targeting senescence in
CLDs. This application leverages our combined expertise in liver transplantation models (Oertel, MPI),
animal models of liver diseases (Oertel/Raeman, MPIs), immunology (Raeman), and senescence (Oertel),
as well as extensive experience in hepato-pathology and RNA-seq analyses (Locker, Co-I) and
lentiviral/AAV expression systems (Bell, Co-I), to investigate the mechanisms underpinning HC senescence
and the role of senescent HCs and their detrimental effects on neighboring cells in the pathogenesis of
CLD. The results of our investigations will lead to identification of therapeutic strategies to prevent or halt
progression of CLD by targeting hepatic senescence."

Informed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute on Child Health and Human Development
mission “to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people,” demographic
research provides key insights into the population processes that shape health and well-being. Students
trained in population science are well-equipped to pursue careers across academic, government, and
applied research settings and contribute to advancements in human health and development. There
remains, however, a striking lack of racial and ethnic diversity among our PhD programs, researchers, and
professional associations that limits the potential of the field. We propose to address this critical challenge
with a research education program, NextGenPop, that draws undergraduates from underrepresented
backgrounds into population science. This is important both for providing opportunities to students who
have been historically marginalized and for generating a body of demographic knowledge that fully reflects
the diversity of human populations today. Our proposed program will use the pressing growth of inequality
as a lens for studying population composition and change, and our training approach will be structured to
support the learning and career advancement of diverse students. It is a collaborative initiative across five
universities and will be coordinated by the Population Association of America, guided by an external
Advisory Committee and regional partners, and supported by a consortium of population centers within the
Association of Population Centers. The broad aim of NextGenPop is to significantly increase the pipeline of
scholars from underrepresented backgrounds entering the field of population science. It has three specific
aims: Aim 1) to introduce advanced undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds to
foundational demographic concepts and tools; Aim 2) to integrate students’ training in research and
professional development; Aim 3) to foster ongoing engagement of program participants in population
research and allied fields. These specific aims will be met through an intensive nine-day summer residential
program and an infrastructure for ongoing engagement of program participants. The summer program will
be hosted in turn by Wisconsin, Cornell, Duke, UC-Irvine, and Minnesota. It will be governed by a strong
central coordinating core and share a common curriculum. Unique signature themes each summer will
leverage key research strengths of individual population centers. NextGenPop has extensive institutional
commitments from its host institutions, other key contributors in the population profession, and wide-ranging
organizations that serve underrepresented students. It promises to have significant and sustained impact on
the population field by broadening the pipeline and ultimately expanding the kinds of questions, tools, and
conceptual frameworks engaged to advance the science, providing a richer perspective on human health,
well-being and development."
10908403,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality worldwide, and identifying novel therapies to treat HF
represents an urgent clinical need. The long-term vision of my laboratory is that apolipoproteins can be used to
treat HF. We have discovered that reduced circulating levels of apolipoprotein M (ApoM) are associated with
increased mortality in human HF. Each standard deviation reduction in ApoM is associated with a doubling of
mortality risk in HF, an association that is independent of B-type natriuretic peptide, coronary artery disease,
and other known risk factors. ApoM is made almost exclusively by the liver, secreted by hepatocytes, and
binds the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on HDL particles in the circulation, ultimately
activating G-protein coupled S1P receptors on various cell types; however, the precise mechanism by which
ApoM may increase HF survival is unknown.
To understand mechanisms of cardioprotection by ApoM, we utilized a doxorubicin cardiotoxicity (DoxTox)
model. Dox is utilized to treat multiple human cancers, but its use is limited by DoxTox and long-term HF. We
have discovered that Dox reduces ApoM in humans and mice. In DoxTox models, increasing ApoM improves
survival and prevents Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction. In a clinically relevant acute myeloid leukemia model,
preliminary studies indicate ApoM does not interfere with Dox anti-cancer efficacy.
Our preliminary data suggest that ApoM attenuates Dox-induced autophagic impairment in the myocardium.
We find ApoM increases autophagic flux and preserves nuclear transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master
regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis implicated in multiple cardiomyopathies. Our data suggest
ApoM-driven autophagy and preservation of nuclear TFEB are protective mechanisms generalizable to other
cardiomyopathies. This R01 proposal tests the hypothesis that ApoM, via canonical S1P signaling, enhances
myocardial autophagy and preserves nuclear TFEB to attenuate DoxTox. Aim 1 tests whether hepatic S1P
production is required for ApoM-mediated myocardial autophagy; Aim 2 tests whether the S1P receptor at the
level of cardiomyocyte is required for autophagy, and Aim 3 tests whether cardiomyocyte TFEB is required for
the cardioprotective effects of ApoM. Aim 3 also utilizes the innovative technique of CUT&RUN sequencing to
determine whether ApoM directs TFEB to specific transcriptional targets, which will help elucidate or confirm
other pathways downstream of TFEB directed by ApoM. Success of these aims will identify mechanisms by
which ApoM can attenuate DoxTox and improve outcomes in HF."

This R01 application proposes conducting a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of
a patient navigation intervention for Black/African American (B/AA) men who have sex with men (MSM) on
PrEP initiation, adherence and retention in care. B/AA men who have sex with men (MSM) are
disproportionately impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
a once daily medication, can dramatically reduce HIV acquisition risk. However, social and structural barriers
have contributed to suboptimal PrEP initiation, adherence, and retention in care among B/AA MSM. Our prior
NIH-funded pilot study (R34MH109371; MPI: Nunn, Chan, Mena) developed and evaluated an Intervention to
Retain and Adhere MSM in PrEP (RAMP-IT-UP), a brief strengths-based patient navigation program to
enhance PrEP care outcomes among young B/AA MSM. The intervention was found to be highly acceptable
among B/AA MSM and demonstrated preliminary effectiveness. Compared to control participants,
RAMP-IT-UP participants were statistically more likely to initiate PrEP and adhere to PrEP based on pharmacy
fill data and PrEP blood levels. Additionally, RAMP-IT-UP participants were more likely to be retained in PrEP
care at the 3-month and 6-month clinical visits. Specific Aim #1 of this study will conduct a fully powered
randomized controlled trial (RCT to estimate the effectiveness of RAMP-IT-UP in improving PrEP adherence
and care outcomes among B/AA MSM in real-world community health center settings (CHCs). Specific Aim #2
will estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-IT-UP among B/AA MSM attending CHCs compared to standard
of care. We will also determine the cost-effectiveness of differing levels of intensity of navigation services to
prevent HIV based on data collected in Specific Aim #1. Our goal is to develop a cost-effective intervention that
enhances PrEP care outcomes and reduces HIV incidence for B/AA MSM which will be relevant for CHCs
across the US. The long-term goal of this work is to decrease HIV incidence among B/AA MSM, which aligns
with federal Ending the HIV Epidemic and National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals. This application is led by an
experienced team of investigators with a proven track record conducting HIV, PrEP and disparities research in
real-world clinical settings."
11196501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: P1. Interrogating Distinct Tumor-Initiating Cells
A major therapeutic barrier in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is tumor recurrence after treatment. The
“cancer stem cell hypothesis” posits that rare populations of cancer cells with stem cell characteristics, also
known as tumor-initiating cells (TICs), fuel tumor growth, resist therapy, and repopulate the tumor at distal
sites. In the normal colon, multiple stem cell populations exist in a reserve-to-active continuum. We
hypothesize that distinct TIC populations exist in CRC, and these distinct populations of TICs have different
clonogenic properties and tumor-repopulating potential. Using TICs marked by Lrig1 and Lgr5 to represent
reserve and active TICs, respectively, we will use novel single-cell approaches to investigate the behaviors of
these populations in the context of therapeutic intervention. First, we will determine whether there is a defined
directional hierarchy where reserve TICs give rise to active TICs versus mutual interconversion. Second, we
will determine whether TICs with malignant characteristics pre-exist in the primary tumor or if TICs acquire
these characteristics de novo as a result of treatment. Third, we will determine whether a signature derived
from TIC behaviors provides prognostic and/or predictive information for individuals with CRC. Our
translational goal is to apply a systems approach to predict likelihood of tumor recurrence based on properties
of TIC populations with the long-term goal of using combinatorial pathway alterations to target TIC behaviors."
10703734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In order to understand neurological diseases, it is essential to identify the affected neuronal cell types,
create model systems that accurately recapitulate normal function and disease phenotypes, and develop tools
that allow cellular manipulations. Motor neurons in the spinal cord control body movement by communicating
central motor commands with muscle targets. All spinal motor neurons are born and specified during embryonic
development, but their molecular identities and electrophysiological properties evolve for weeks in mice and
months in humans, until motor circuits and behavior become fully mature in post-natal life. In diseases like
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), sarcopenia, or spinal cord injury, the degeneration of specific subsets of
mature, adult motor neurons can lead to loss of muscle control, paralysis, and death. Although several studies
have mapped the mechanisms of motor neuron diversification in the embryonic spinal cord, our understanding
of motor neuron diversity in the adult spinal cord is in its infancy. This hinders the study of adult motor neuron
diseases as the affected motor neuron subtypes are not thoroughly defined. Furthermore, in vitro models that
faithfully recapitulate adult motor neuron identity do not exist, and adequate tools to access specific motor neuron
subtypes in vivo are lacking. This research plan aims to map the trajectory of post-mitotic motor neurons from
embryo to adulthood and use this data to both create viral tools that provide genetic access to specific subtypes
of motor neurons in vivo, and develop methods for generating adult-like motor neurons in vitro. This will be done
by first performing single cell transcriptome and chromatin profiling in mouse spinal motor neurons at various
embryonic to adult ages. The temporal chromatin profiles will be used to develop AAV tools that provide genetic
access to specific motor neuron subtypes at all ages, and to computationally identify candidate regulators of
subtype- and adult-specific identity. The identified regulators will then be used to mature the age of mouse stem
cell derived motor neurons in vitro. Finally, single cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles of adult
human motor neurons will be generated and a combination of mouse and human-specific regulators will be used
to program the age of iPSC-derived motor neurons. This thorough approach will define the molecular features
of motor neuron subtypes that contribute to their differential susceptibility in disease, and establish tools
necessary for dissecting circuits, disease modeling, and the delivery of potential therapeutics.
 The training phase of the award will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Hynek Wichterle at Columbia
University, and under the co- mentorship of Dr. David Gifford and Dr. Paola Arlotta. My career development plan
describes a detailed timeline for acquiring all the technical and professional skills necessary for the successful
transition into a career as an independent researcher. The completion of the proposed research plan will facilitate
future research in my lab aimed at understanding the temporal dynamics of neuronal identity, circuits, and
disease in motor neurons and other nervous system cells."

and a liaison between the ORDRCC leadership, the Research Cores, all Center Investigators, and the
Advisory Committee. The main purpose of Admin Core is to develop new rheumatic disease investigators
through local and distant Junior Center Investigator and Scholars programs which expand use of our patient
collections and clinical data, as well as access to advanced technologies. We propose a new structured
pipeline program to provide early exposure to rheumatic disease patients and investigation to trainees
spanning from undergraduates to housestaff. We will also augment a multi-faceted Enrichment Program with
weekly seminars and an annual all-day symposium with new web-enabled workshops for professional
development, a new Scientific Writing Success Center, and an expanded formalized mentor-development
program. The Administrative Core also serves as the primary communication hub for the ORDRCC. Based
upon input from our patient advisors, we propose to expand communication with our patients and their
advocates, as well as broaden communication to our new external partners, outside JCIs/Scholars and the
broader scientific community. The ORDRCC will expand Core and Collection use and outreach through
collaborations with other Center awards. Finally, the Administrative Core will provide oversight, management,
and prioritization of resources, ensure regulatory compliance, and grant management oversight and serve as
the nidus for interactions with the Advisory Committee which is inclusive of Internal and External members to
ensure suggestions are vetted and implemented. This Core will also provide the overall Leadership and

151 IRB-approved study protocols, nearly all new JCI NIH Human Subject sections, patient recruitment
(n=1,282), and more than 66,068 new sample aliquots linked to comprehensive clinical information. The
current proposal responds to progress in advanced phenotyping science and evolving investigator needs by
modeling clinical and translational research informatics and new methods for collecting and integrating
molecular phenotype data with clinical and patient-reported data to facilitate precision medicine. We will
continue to increase our collections in SLE, RA, UCTD, and Sjogren’s while adding new collections,
including an autoantibody positive post-COVID cohort. Aim 1 will continue rheumatic disease clinical
research support for ORDRCC Junior Investigators, Scholars, and Investigators with mentorship and

identification, recruitment, and clinical characterization. Aim 2 will expand and increase the sophistication of
sample collection, management, SOPs, and Biorepository infrastructure, and support large rheumatic
disease basic/clinical collaborations. In Aim 3 a new CCBC Innovation Hub will pilot new approaches for
diverse patient recruitment, retention, characterization, home monitoring and remote sample collection to
optimize real time access to patient samples and data as disease flares and improves. Aim 4 seeks to
transform patient lives through science-driven clinical trial design that will reduce data complexity and inform
later optimized, individualized treatment selection and guidance for more refined dosing strategies in clinics."
10701376,"Deployment related respiratory exposures (DRREs) during the Gulf War are now presumed to be linked to the
development of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Recently, we employed a unique mouse model of
experimental burn pit-type airborne toxin exposures and found that this induced prolonged inflammation and
epigenetic alterations regulating key cancer associated pathways in alveolar macrophages. Unfortunately,
there is limited research that examines the link between toxic respiratory exposures and an increased risk for
developing lung cancer. Our objective is to determine the pathobiology of how DRREs predispose Veterans to
lung cancer. To do this, we will (1) identify cancer-associated epigenetic alterations in lung tissue from
Veterans deployed during the Gulf War who developed lung cancer, (2) employ digital spatial profiling to
generate a transcriptional atlas of effected lung tissues from Gulf War Veterans to inform immune-mediated
remodeling of the lung, (3) use a mouse model to determine how aerosolized gulf war toxins increase
susceptibility to lung cancer, and (4) reverse the harmful epigenetic changes in cancer promoting pathways in
3D lung culture systems and primary cells from Veterans and following experimental aerosolized toxin
exposures in mice. We will use this information to define the epigenetic alterations from DRREs that promote
lung cancer, develop a grading system based on durable epigenetic marks identified in immune cells, and
identify targetable epigenetic changes to potentially reduce the risk for developing lung cancer. Ultimately, if
this project is successful we will better understand the mechanisms that underlie the development of lung
cancer for deployed Gulf War Veterans. This will improve options for therapy and possibly a way to screen
Veterans for an increased risk for developing lung cancer. Importantly, the findings may have broader
implications for military service members deployed to the Persian Gulf, Southwest Asia and Afghanistan, as

persistent pain at rest, neuronal dysfunction, and ultimately limb loss. While endovascular and surgical
treatment options have advanced, many patients are not candidates for revascularization due to
anatomic constraints or co-morbidities. Therapies for these “no-option CLTI” patients are limited to
palliation consisting of pain control and major amputation, both of which lead to significant morbidity
and disability. Improved therapeutic modalities to treat this “no-option CLTI” population and to
prevent limb loss are desperately needed.
 Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising new modality to treat this “no-option CLTI”
population. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology allows for an infinitely
reproducible and scalable source of stem cells. This technology was rendered applicable to vascular
disease by the establishment of reliable directed differentiation of said stem cells to the myriad vascular
cell types required for a functional blood vessel. Our prior work overcame the barrier of premature loss
of EC function and replicative senescence in culture, opening the door to the next steps in developing
iPSC-EC therapeutics.
 This proposal aims to (1) validate the survival and function of clinical grade iPSC-ECs in implantable
and resorbable platelet lysate hydrogels, and (2) quantify the restoration of limb perfusion and function
after implantation of hydrogels containing iPSC-ECs into ischemic mouse hindlimbs. This work will
generate a critical pre-clinical animal model of utilizing PAD patient-derived iPSC-ECs to promote local
vascular regeneration in ischemic limbs as a novel therapy for CLTI."
10911257,"Human Phenotyping Core Project Summary
This highly successful Human Phenotyping Core focuses on providing Center investigators with access to
state-of-the-art technologies and methods for utilizing multi-parameter, high-content approaches to assess
molecular phenotypes for rheumatic disease research. This Core coordinates expertise and core competencies
in transcriptomics, proteomics, high-content cellular immunophenotypes, single-cell multiomics and tissue-
based spatial multiomics. As such, it continues as a resource where ORDRCC Investigators can generate,
share and analyze the multi-dimensional molecular phenotype data necessary for developing competitive
research programs. Beyond giving ORDRCC investigators access to advanced technologies that are currently
established at OMRF, this Core offers newly developed services providing access to data analytics in single-
cell multi-omics from blood or dissociated tissue, as well as spatially aware tissue-based single-cell
approaches. Our platforms enable investigators to define patient molecular profiles based on genetic,
transcriptome, cellular, and/or proteomic differences in specific cell populations, as well as at the individual cell
level with single cell 10X Genomics multiomic approaches, either 3’ or 5’ scRNA-seq/high-plex CITE-seq +
BCR/TCR repertoire, or snRNA-seq/snATAC-seq for epigenetic analyses. Currently evolving approaches using
fixed cells or fixed tissue dissociated to single cells on the Chromium X platform offer additional options for
difficult to obtain cell populations from existing archival pathology samples in some cases. Spatial technologies
have also advanced significantly and include multiomic (transcript and protein biomarkers) approaches.
Capitalizing on the magnitude of information available through our carefully processed, well-organized,
clinically characterized samples; our ability to provide comprehensive multi-analyte molecular phenotype
profiles provide a foundational resource for identifying new research directions and generating new ideas for
future collaborative projects. Aims of the updated Human Phenotyping Core are: AIM 1: Assist ORDRCC
Investigators, JCIs and Scholars to navigate the stages of project development, experimental design, resource
planning and execution of translational and mechanistic studies through Core Management and individual
consultations, AIM 2: Provide access and training in use of molecular single-cell and spatial multiomic
technologies using the technical personnel experienced in these advanced approaches, AIM 3: Establish data
analytics pipelines for quality control, dataset generation and advanced modeling of single-cell and spatial
multiomic data, and molecular phenotyping for patient stratification, AIM 4: Evaluate, assess and implement

10701174,"Project Summary
 Excessive lipid accumulation is central to the pathogenesis of prevalent metabolic diseases including fatty
liver. Substantial evidence supports a critical role for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein
response (UPR) in driving lipid accumulation and fatty liver development. However, the precise link from the ER
stress-UPR to ectopic fat storage remains elusive. In our preliminary studies, we identified ubiquitin-like protein
5 (UBL5) as a novel ER stress responder, undergoing rapid depletion in response to ER stress in mammalian
cell lines and in livers of mice. The ER stress-induced UBL5 depletion was mediated by the ubiquitin-independent
proteasome system (UIPS). The PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) arm of the UPR pathway was responsible and
sufficient for inducing UBL5 breakdown. RNA-Seq analysis revealed distinctly up- and down-regulated pathways
in UBL5-depleted cells. Most strikingly, UBL5 knockdown upregulated lipogenic programs and simultaneously
downregulated the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Functional analyses confirmed that UBL5 silencing promoted
de novo lipid synthesis and attenuated fatty acid oxidation, placing UBL5 at a unique nexus to control fat storage
by transcriptionally affecting the principal lipid anabolic and catabolic processes in opposite directions.
Consistent with this, UBL5-silenced cells and liver tissues showed excessive lipid droplets and dramatic increase
in cellular triacylglycerol content. These results reveal a novel function of UBL5 in suppression of lipid
accumulation and a regulatory/signaling mechanism to control UBL5 protein stability and activity by the UPR-
PERK arm.
 Based on these observations, UBL5 offers a candidate link from ER stress to abnormal lipid accumulatio,
the hallmark of NAFLD. In further support of the pathophysiological relevance of UBL5, our additional preliminary
data showed that UBL5 protein was significantly reduced in fatty livers of mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) and in liver
biopsies of NAFLD patients. We have also developed ubl5 conditional knockout and liver-specific transgenic
models to explore the biological functions of UBL5 in vivo. We hypothesize that UBL5 is a fat suppressor
whose function is disrupted by recurring or chronic ER stress-UPR-PERK activation to promote lipid
storage and fatty liver development. The lipid burden itself could aggravate the cellular ER stress, further
depleting UBL5 protein and its fat-suppressive function in a vicious cycle toward the full phenotype of
inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We will examine the hypothesis by establishing a general
role and underlying mechanisms for UBL5 in suppression of lipid accumulation (Aim 1), identifying the key
components of the UIPS machinery involved in UBL5 degradation and the communication network from PERK
activation to UBL5 destabilization (Aim 2); and determining the biological relevance of the endogenous UBL5 to
the development and progression of NAFLD (Aim 3). These in vitro and in vivo studies will identify UBL5
dysfunction as a new mediator of NAFLD and a potential target for management of the disease."
10831095,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
People who use opioids (PWUO) from the unregulated drug market have little control over the presence of
unwanted substances within the drug products they obtain. Xylazine, an animal tranquilizer, has been
increasingly detected in opioids throughout the eastern United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Xylazine
produces a more potent high than heroin alone, potentiates and prolongs the effects of opioids, and may
increase the risk of opioid-related overdose or death. Xylazine decreases the release of excitatory
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripherally acts as a vasoconstrictor. This can
lead to sedation, muscle relaxation, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Moreover, the long, sedating
effects of the drug places PWUO at increased risk of sexual assault. Xylazine is also linked to development of
severe infected ulcerating skin lesions in both injection and non-injection sites. Of concern, xylazine is rapidly
spreading across the United States, with a five times higher presence in national overdose deaths in 2020
compared with 2015. Spread has been particularly rapid in the Eastern and Northeast parts of the country. To
date, the United States lacks a robust national public health response to xylazine. As xylazine emerges in drug
markets in other parts of the country, there is an urgent need for a rapid response to prevent adverse
outcomes for PWUO nationally. In response to this rapid rise of xylazine in Philadelphia, PWUO have been
seeking strategies to mitigate xylazine harms. To date, these have not been rigorously explored nor
disseminated. Our research indicates that PWUO in Philadelphia desire tailored harm reduction strategies to
avoid xylazine. The objective of this proposal is to leverage the knowledge and experiences of PWUO in
Philadelphia, an early locus of xylazine emergence, alongside national content experts to develop and test
person-centered approaches to mitigate the impact of xylazine as it emerges as an adulterant in other markets
nationally. We will do this through 1) engaging PWUO and other content experts to explore current
experiences with xylazine adulteration, 2) developing actionable interventions to address emerging xylazine
adulterations, and 3) presenting these draft interventions in emerging xylazine markets in Massachusetts for
purposes of feedback and to inform refinement. Our long-term goal is to translate PWUO needs into PWUO-
centered interventions, creating key harm reduction messaging to mitigate the public health harms of xylazine
adulteration observed in Philadelphia. The proposed work is expected to significantly contribute to informing
optimal harm reduction interventions to mitigate harms associated with xylazine adulteration that can be rapidly
implemented. It is urgent and timely, as xylazine is currently rapidly spreading across the country, and thus
these interventions are imminently needed to prevent unnecessary harm."
10901901,"Over 25% of US Veterans have diabetes, and those Veterans are at an increased risk of hospitalization
and increased morbidity/mortality following severe respiratory viral infections, such as, influenza (H1N1), SARS-
CoV-2 (COVID) and adenovirus (Ad). Infection with these respiratory viruses causes acute lung injury (ALI) that
can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate of ~40%. There are few
therapeutic options for ALI/ARDS. Virus induced ALI/ARDS is driven primarily by uncontrolled inflammatory
responses. Alveolar macrophages both induce and resolve ALI/ARDS, based on their polarization/inflammatory
state. The plasticity of macrophages to vary between pro-inflammatory (M1, pro-ALI/ARDS) and anti-
inflammatory (M2, anti-ALI/ARDS) phenotypes is driven by their metabolic states. Diabetes is a metabolic
disorder in which levels of blood glucose are high and glycolysis is the preferred cellular metabolic pathway.
Macrophages from diabetic patients have a high rate of glycolysis and an increased M1 phenotype. In addition,
macrophages from diabetic patients have a lower rate of plasticity to change from M1 to M2 because of this shift
to glycolysis. One possibility is that this glycolytic shift contributes to severe outcomes from respiratory viral
infections in diabetic patients.
 The Syrian hamster is naturally permissive for influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Ad (in contrast to other
rodents that require viral adaptation). In addition, the Syrian hamster can naturally become diabetic with a high
fat/high sugar diet. Ad14p1 is an emergent strain of Ad14 that has caused outbreaks of severe respiratory illness
and ALI/ARDS throughout the world. Hamster infection with Ad14p1 results in a patchy bronchopneumonia, as
seen in other severe human viral respiratory infections. In contrast, the prototype strain of Ad14 induces little
lung inflammation. Other studies have shown that cells dying from Ad14 infection induce an M2-like human
macrophage response, while cells dying from Ad14p1 infection fail to change M1 alveolar macrophages to an
M2 phenotype. This dying infected cell activity is regulated by the expression of the Ad gene, E1B 20K. Cells
infected by Ad14 produced sufficient E1B 20K to repolarize M1 macrophages to M2, while Ad14p1 infection does
not produce sufficient E1B 20K, and the infected cells fail to alter M1 macrophage polarization. Therefore, the
hamster model of Ad14p1 ALI/ARDS provides an appropriate system to study how diabetes affects macrophage
polarization and pathogenesis during severe viral respiratory infections. The long-term goal of this project is to
understand how emergent viruses regulate macrophage polarization to develop novel therapeutic strategies to
drive macrophage polarization to an ALI/ARDS resolving phenotype in both diabetic and non-diabetic Veterans.
 To achieve this goal, a multi-omics approach will be used to identify and phenotype macrophages in
normal and diabetic hamsters infected with Ad14p1. Transcriptomics using single-cell RNA sequencing will use
gene expression profiles at the resolution of individual cells to identify and phenotype macrophages and their
polarization states. Infiltrating immune cells and other lung resident cells will also be identified. Proteomics will
be used to identify cytokines and chemokines that drive Ad14p1 pathogenesis. Metabolomics will be used to
understand the unique metabolic changes in the lungs during Ad14p1 infection in diabetes and how those
changes affect macrophage polarization. Comparative virology studies with infection of normal and diabetic
hamsters with a pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza will be used to determine whether similar mechanisms of
pathogenesis are involved in ALI/ARDS pathogenesis induced by other severe respiratory viruses. Finally, we
will test the role of miRNA expression during prototype Ad14 and Ad14p1 infection in regulating macrophage
polarization and pathogenesis, with the goals of defining mechanisms of immunomodulation and identifying
candidate miRNAs that might be used as therapeutic agents against viral ALI/ARDS."
10873135,"Celiac disease (CeD) is a gluten-induced, HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 dependent inflammatory disorder of the small
intestine for which no non-dietary therapy is available. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is the target of CeD-specific
autoantibodies and is also involved in disease pathogenesis. In a CeD patient TG2 catalyzes the formation of
deamidated gluten peptides that bind to HLA-DQ2/8 with high affinity and are recognized as epitopes by disease-
specific CD4+ T cells. However, the location where TG2 exerts its pathogenic action is unknown.
The overarching hypothesis of our proposal is that TG2 derived from enterocytes shed into the intestinal lumen
is the source of pathogenically relevant enzyme in CeD. This luminal TG2 reacts with gluten peptides to form
covalent complexes recognized by TG2-specific B cells in Peyer’s patches. In turn, these B cells present gluten
antigens to disease-specific T cells, while also deriving help from these T cells. This hypothesis can explain how
TG2 autoantibodies are formed in CeD. Three Aims involving in vitro and in vivo studies are designed to test
our hypothesis, while taking advantage of the complementary capabilities of the three collaborating laboratories.
Specific aim 1: Two key features of the above hypothesis will be tested at a biochemical level. First, the ability
of antigenic gluten peptides to form metastable covalent intermediates at the TG2 active site will be probed.
Second, a novel isotope labeling assay will be developed to verify that luminal TG2 in the mouse intestine can
recognize and deamidate dietary gluten. Under this Aim we will also engineer a gut-impermeable TG2 inhibitor,
which will be used in Aim 3 to validate the pathogenic role of luminal TG2.
Specific aim 2: Using shed enterocytes collected from the human jejunal lumen as well as human organoid
cultures, we will demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells harbor abundant catalytically competent TG2 at the
time of shedding. The ability of human enterocyte-derived TG2 to form covalent adducts with antigenic gluten
peptides will also be verified. Our organoid cultures will also be used to identify disease-relevant environmental
factors that are most effective at increasing steady-state TG2 activity in the small intestinal lumen.
Specific aim 3: This Aim will test the pathogenic role of enterocyte-derived luminal TG2 in two mouse models
of CeD. In one model of established CeD, we will test whether TG2-gluten peptide covalent complexes in the
gut lumen can stimulate collaboration between TG2-specific B cells and gluten-specific T cells. In another model
where CeD can be induced by feeding gluten, the requirement for TG2 expression in enterocytes or alternately
in the myeloid compartment will be tested.
First-generation TG2 inhibitors are already undergoing human clinical trials. If the overarching hypothesis of our
proposal is correct, it will establish that TG2 inhibition in the intestinal lumen is sufficient to protect against gluten-
induced villous atrophy in CeD. Not only will this motivate the design of a safer and more efficacious therapies,
but our gut-impermeable inhibitors may also serve as next-generation drug prototypes for this lifelong disorder."
10701327,"Heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) caused by hypertension is a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality and escalating health care costs. As opposed to heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the heart cannot properly fill, resulting in left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction and heart failure symptoms. In clinical trials, pharmacological strategies that mitigate HF
progression in HFrEF patients are not as effective in HFpEF patients, rendering HFpEF patients susceptible
to cardiac events including hospital readmission.
About 10-20% of patients with hypertension have treatment resistant hypertension. There is a phenotype of
left ventricular dysfunction in resistant hypertension. Importantly HFpEF still occurs even when blood
pressure is controlled. Treatment options for HFpEF are largely limited to decongestion by diuretics. To
address the clinical need this project will investigate in an innovative way a potential new target, xanthine
oxidoreductase (XOR), which may reveal a new treatment approach for treating and preventing HFpEF.
XOR produces urate with concomitant production of damaging reactive oxygen species. Of direct relevance
to this proposal increased XOR in the heart cardiomyocyte causes a breakdown of myofibrils (contractile
units in the sarcomere) and decrease in calcium sensitivity, resulting in left ventricular dysfunction. We have
reported increased XOR activity in the left ventricle of patients with resistant hypertension, with a greater
increase in African Americans.
The gene encoding XOR (xanthine dehydrogenase, XDH) is genetically associated with urate levels by
genome-wide association study and we have preliminary data for association of the same genetic signal
with gout. These variants regulate expression of XOR, indicating functional genetic variant(s) that can be
used as a basis to develop a causal inference instrument for the effect of XOR activity on HFpEF and risk
factors resistant hypertension and progression of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
We will test the hypothesis that increased XOR activity is causal of HFpEF. We will develop a genetic score
for XOR activity and test for a possible causal role in HFpEF by Mendelian randomization in White and
African American cohorts in the MVP data. In secondary analysis we will test the score for a possible causal
role in resistant hypertension and LV dysfunction.
The XOR activity score will be developed in Aim 1. This will be done in two sub-aims. Aim 1a. Test XDH
variants that associate with expression of XDH for association with plasma XOR activity in a newly recruited
cohort from the VA with replication in an existing cohort from the Alabama Genomic Health Initiative; Aim
1b. Scan the genome outside of the XDH gene locus for other genetic variants that control XOR activity.
In Aim 2 the genetic variants identified in Aim 1 will be combined into an XOR activity score and in the MVP
cohort tested for a possible causal role in HFpEF in the primary analysis using the Mendelian randomization
technique, and in secondary analysis a possible causal role in resistant hypertension and left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. Mediation through resistant hypertension and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction will
be tested. The influence of XOR inhibition (allopurinol and febuxostat) will be evaluated by testing for non-
additive interaction.
Our findings may provide a premise for clinical trial of XOR inhibition in prevention of HFpEF."
10701531,"Abstract
Hematological malignancy is noted as a presumptive disease related to ionizing radiation exposure during
military service and has been associated with exposure to toxic contaminants. Lymphoid malignancies such
as lymphoma and leukemia often compromise host defense by developing mechanisms to evade immune
surveillance. Effective tumor immune responses involve the activation and maintenance of tumor-specific
CD8+ HLA class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and tumor-specific CD4+ class II-restricted helper T cells.
However, many B-cell lymphomas cannot optimally present antigens (Ags) via the HLA class I pathway, which
contributes to their escaping immune recognition from tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. We have recently shown
that B-cell lymphoma-induced stimulation of CD4+ T cells is also impaired however, the mechanisms involved
remain unknown. Preliminary and published data presented here indicate that B-cell lymphomas shed a
49kDa Fc Receptor Like A (FCRLA) molecule which suppresses the ability of professional antigen presenting
cells (APCs) to stimulate CD4+ T cells via the HLA class II pathway. We hypothesize that the shedding of
this FCRLA molecule plays a key role in B-cell lymphoma-mediated immune suppression and that
blockade of this molecule may restore T cell recognition of this class of malignancies. In support, we
show that a novel 49kDa FCRLA molecule secreted by B-cell tumors binds to HLA class II protein and disrupts
functional Ag presentation by professional APCs. Second, higher levels of FCRLA were detected in B-cell
lymphoma patients, which correlated with poor patient outcome. Third, knockdown of FCRLA by shRNA
restored functional HLA class II-Ag presentation by B-cell lymphomas to T cells. Fourth, FCRLA antibody
therapy augmented CD4+ T cell recognition of B-cell lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. These data provide a solid
foundation for our overall goal of elucidating the inhibitory mechanisms of a novel 49kDa FCRLA protein on
HLA class II-mediated T cell recognition of B-cell lymphomas. Studies are also planned to determine the
extent to which immune recognition can be restored by blocking FCRLA functions in vivo. Studies are also
planned to determine whether FCRLA blocking antibody augments immune recognition of B-cell lymphomas.
To accomplish the goals of the proposal, two specific aims are proposed: (Aim 1) To elucidate the molecular
mechanisms through which FCRLA disrupts HLA class II-peptide interactions and impairs T-cell recognition.
To accomplish this aim, we will test the hypothesis that B-cell lymphoma-derived 49kDa FCRLA protein
disrupts peptide binding to HLA class II and impairs CD4+ T cell recognition of tumors. (Aim 2) To investigate
the efficacy of FCRLA blockade in enhancing T cell recognition of B-cell lymphomas in vivo. To accomplish
this aim, we will test the hypothesis that B-cell lymphoma-shed 49kDa FCRLA may influence tumor growth in
vivo, and that blockade of FCRLA will augment antitumor immunity in the host. Blockade of FCLRA function
may have the potential to drastically alter lymphoma progression in vivo. Completion of these studies will
elucidate novel mechanisms for restoring Ag presentation in lymphoid malignancy, and the elucidated
mechanism will likely spur development of novel therapeutic strategies for B-cell lymphomas that may be
applicable to other malignancies. Since lymphoma accounts for almost 4% of all cancer diagnoses in the
Veterans, the success of this project will also profoundly improve the treatment and survivorship of veterans
and their family members who developed lymphoma."
10798269,"Project Summary & Abstract
Lung cancer accounts for about 25% of all cancer deaths in the US, as it is often caught at an
advanced stage when treatment options are limited. This has led to the institution of screening
programs with low-dose CT, resulting in ~1.6 million pulmonary nodules detected every year,
most of them (~80%) in the periphery of the lung.
Tissue biopsy is the standard of care for establishing a definitive diagnosis for treatment
planning. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of tissue biopsies in the procedure room by
cytopathologists or cytotechnicians can be used to establish that:
 1. Diagnostic quality tissue has been procured; identifying malignancy by ROSE has been
 shown to reduce the number of biopsy tools and repeat procedures
 2. An adequate number of cells have been obtained to allow molecular profiling by next-
 generation sequencing and molecular testing
 3. The absence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes justifies the more-invasive
 peripheral biopsy.
Nevertheless, ROSE is not the standard of care despite its advantages, because its quality is
highly variable across sites, it can increase procedure times, and its costs are unlikely to be fully
reimbursed. We propose the development of an FDA-cleared medical device that allows
microscopic imaging of fresh, unprocessed tissue biopsies in the treatment room and provides
accurate, near real-time diagnosis based on deep learning.
Specifically, the proposed system uses Stimulated Raman Histology (SRH), which was
pioneered by the PI, translated for intraoperative diagnosis in brain tumors, shown to be suitable
for automated diagnosis via deep learning with a performance that is non-inferior to
pathologists, and resulted in the first CE-certified device for identification of brain tumor margins
by the company. Here, we address an urgent clinical need in lung cancer, giving doctors
confidence in their intraoperative decisions, and reducing unnecessary biopsies/procedures for
patients and payers.
Further, we will investigate the potential to provide accurate intraoperative diagnosis of
molecular markers that could enable local delivery of pharmaceuticals, ablation, and other
therapies, in the biopsy procedure."
10870117,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating condition that affects more than 5 million Americans,
with a total annual cost of more than $300 billion predicted in 2020. Currently there are no effective
treatments to counteract or slow the progression of AD, with promising findings in rodents failing
to translate into successful therapies for patients. Monkey models may provide a more powerful
translational model. The goal of this proposal is to characterize a monkey model of tau pathology
in AD. This is responsive to RFA-AG-21-003 requesting proposals that target the “development,
characterization, and validation of suitable new or unconventional mammalian non-murine models
of AD that may represent improved translational potential by better replicating pathological
features of the disease”. With respect to nonhuman primate (NHP) models of AD, the RFA states
explicitly that “NHP have a very high translational value because of their close relationship to
humans in terms of phylogeny, genetics, physiology, cognition, emotion, and social behavior”. In
this proposal we describe initial findings in a tau-based monkey model of AD and propose a
program to fully develop and validate the model by three PIs who have decades of experience on
aging and neurodegeneration in NHP models. We have targeted the highly vulnerable entorhinal
cortex (ERC) for unilateral infusions of an adeno-associated virus expressing a double tau
mutation known to cause tau-related dementia in humans (AAV-P301L/S320F) and characterized
neuropathology at 3 and 6 months after viral injection in NHPs. This causes extensive and
progressive neuroinflammation and tau-based neuropathology, including end-stage neurofibrillary
tangles, in ERC and in hippocampal and neocortical targets of ERC. Preliminary PET imaging in
these monkeys displays robust phospho-tau accumulation in the hippocampus. The progressive
time course relative to the time of vector injection is a great strength in terms of using this model
for therapeutic development. These early studies demonstrate the potential for this model to
replicate pathological features of AD in the monkey brain and to capture aspects of pathology that
have not been well-modeled in rodents. We propose to do a full, rigorous characterization of this
model, including long-term behavioral assessment, in vivo imaging, fluid biomarker assessment,
and microscopic analyses. Full characterization of this model, will provide a platform to test
therapeutic agents at different points in the disease process."
10899706,"This MPI R01 combines the expertise of the Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Internal Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine to address MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and early stage AD/ADRD in patients with comorbid chronic pain and depression. We propose to test whether Problem Adaptation Therapy for Pain (PATH-Pain), a novel primary-care based psychosocial intervention designed to reduce stress in MCI and early stage AD/ADRD patients with comorbid depression and pain, has better cognitive, affective, and functional outcomes than Attention Control Usual Care.
PATH-Pain is an easy-to-administer psychosocial intervention designed to improve emotion regulation and reduce stress in older adults with MCI or early stage AD/ADRD, chronic pain, and depression. To reduce stress, PATH-Pain aims to: a) reduce negative emotions associated with pain and pain-related disability; b) reduce negative emotions that interfere with pain treatment (e.g., hopelessness, helplessness); c) increase positive emotions and increase engagement in pleasurable activities; d) help patients identify addressable problems in their lives and try to find the best possible solution to these problems; e) reduce interpersonal tension between patients and family members, caregivers, and friends; and f) shift attention during experiences of pain to reduce pain intensity. To achieve these aims, PATH-Pain employs emotion regulation, problem solving, and behavioral activation techniques. In our preliminary study, PATH-Pain participants showed high acceptability and treatment satisfaction with the intervention.
Based on our power analysis, we will randomize 100 older adults (60 years and older) with MCI or early stage dementia (probable or possible Alzheimer’s Disease), comorbid depression, and chronic pain to 8 weekly in-office sessions and 6 monthly phone (3 individual and 3 group) sessions of PATH-Pain vs. Attention Control Usual Care in 4 primary care sites. The Attention Control Usual Care arm consists of Usual Care, a pamphlet on pain and depression, and a structured interview of the same duration as each PATH-Pain session. The structured interview aims to control for attention and time, and will consist of general questions regarding health habits and other non-medical topics unrelated to cognitive impairment, pain, and depression. The investigators have shown evidence of feasibility of recruitment, retention, and assessment procedures for the proposed study. Assessments will be performed at baseline, and weeks 5 (no cognitive outcomes), 9, 24 (no cognitive outcomes), 36, and 52 by research assistants unaware of the study hypotheses and the participants’ randomization status. PATH-Pain will be administered by certified mental health workers and the Attention-Control sessions will be administered by a non-clinician team member experienced in structured interviews."
10817908,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN) was established to conduct rigorous research in neonatal
medicine, facilitating collaboration among centers to complete studies more rapidly than investigators acting
alone. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center has been one of the most productive sites in the NRN for
over 30 years. Our site’s strong performance is due to our large, diverse patient population, outstanding
research infrastructure and clinical facilities, strong faculty investigators with expertise in a wide variety of
neonatal research, and experienced research support staff. Our leadership understands the importance of
large, multicenter trials to answer clinical questions in neonatology. Dr. Stephanie Merhar, Principal
Investigator for the Cincinnati site, has led NRN studies and other multicenter trials in Cincinnati for over 7
years. She is joined for this renewal by Dr. Tanya Cahill as Follow-up Principal Investigator and Drs. Vivek
Narendran and Jae Kim as alternate PIs. During this next cycle, Cincinnati will work collaboratively with other
Clinical Centers, outside investigators, and the Data Coordinating Center to develop and implement rigorous
and reproducible common protocols. Due to our exceptional model of regional, population-based care with
more than 1900 annual NICU admissions in our 3 recruiting NICUs, we are able to contribute a large number
of subjects to NRN observational studies and clinical trials. Our well-established regional follow up
infrastructure allows us to maximize retention rates for both 22-26 month and school age follow up. We are
committed to conducting definitive multi-site clinical research through the NRN to improve outcomes for
newborns born preterm and with other serious conditions."
10836500,"Abstract
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and diabetic foot infections (DFI) are one of the most challenging complications of
diabetes due to high morbidity and associated mortality and precede the majority of non-traumatic lower limb
amputations in the adult population. Diabetic foot microbiome of intact skin, prior to the onset of the ulcer, is
characterized by the low level of Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) and high levels of Staphylococcus aureus
(SA). Persistent level of bacteria in ulcer tissue, resulting in prolonged and deregulated inflammation is one of
the leading causes of lower leg amputations in patients suffering from DFUs. To gain greater insight into
relationship between innate immune responses and wound healing outcomes, we propose to study how
commensal microorganism SE prevents intracellular accumulation of SA and accelerates the diabetic wound
healing process. The long term goal of this project is to prevent DFI by understanding the mechanism and
developing new therapeutic strategies targeting cutaneous intracellular pathogens in patients with DFUs. We
have already shown that downregulation of an innate-antimicrobial protein P-2 in keratinocytes and gamma
delta (GD) T cells results in accumulation of intracellular MRSA in DFUs, contributing to persistent unresolved
inflammation. Furthermore, loss of P-2 in murine models is associated with both, lower antimicrobial activity
and accumulation of intracellular MRSA, and impaired epithelialization. Importantly, we have shown that killing
of intracellular MRSA is enhanced in skin after exposure to SE. Based on robust preliminary data we postulate
that SE colonization modifies diabetic skin and wound environment to prevent intracellular infections by
pathogenic SA. Our hypothesis is that intracellular bacteria modify expression and function of P-2 to affect
bacterial clearance and inflammatory response, directly impacting healing in DFU. The objective of this project
is to determine mechanism by which SE prevents intracellular infections by pathogenic SA in a diabetic mouse
and human wounds. We hypothesized that SE colonization modifies wound environment in order to prevent or
resolve persistent bacterial wound infections. To test our hypothesis, we will evaluate SE-mediated induction of
P-2 in professional and non-professional phagocytes during acute diabetic and non-diabetic wound healing
process in vivo, using multiple animal and human models and samples obtained from DFU patients. We will
also identify gene expression signatures and pathways in these cells that are differentially regulated in “low
intracellular SA non-healing” vs “high intracellular SA healing” DFU (Aim 1). We will characterize SE protective
mechanisms against intracellular MRSA in diabetic wound infections (Aim 2). Our findings will provide
important new knowledge regarding the role and mechanisms by which commensal SE may prevent persistent
diabetic wound infections. Targeting intracellular bacteria niche to accelerate healing in diabetic patients at risk
of cutaneous and wound infections has potential to achieve a major clinical impact in promoting healing and
reducing amputations."

may be more prone to infections due to limited access to healthcare resources and presence of environmental
hazards that increase infection risk. Only two studies have examined HHC patients' socioeconomic status
(SES) and infection risk, and they are limited by the age of data, local scope of inquiry, and failure to measure
the complex socio-economic composition of communities where HHC patients reside. Infection prevention and
control (IPC) in HHC is prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic as HHC serves a vulnerable population.
However, we found IPC is suboptimal in HHC and HHC clinicians reported that poor housing conditions and
difficulties with patient/informal caregiver compliance with recommended practices pose specific challenges to
IPC in HHC. Building upon our previous studies and guided by the Social-Ecological Model, we propose a 5-
year, multi-site, mixed methods research study to address following aims: 1) examine socio-economic
disparities in infection events, including COVID-19, among HHC patients before and during the COVID-19
pandemic; 2) describe IPC-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices among HHC patients (or informal
caregivers) and examine associated factors; 3) explore IPC practices from the perspectives of HHC patients
(or informal caregivers) and HHC provider; and 4) develop and pilot test a multi-modal intervention to improve
knowledge and practice of IPC in HHC patients (or informal caregivers). We will merge multiple national
datasets from 2019-2020 with the latest Area Deprivation Index (ADI) file, a multidimensional SES measure of
neighborhoods, to study infection-related health disparities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will
study hospital transfers or emergency care visits due to four commonly reported HAIs in HHC (respiratory,
urinary tract, wound and intravenous catheter-related) that occur 2 days after HHC admission as well as
COVID-19 infections. Patients with high and very high risk of infection and/or their informal caregivers (n =
250) from two HHC agencies serving patients with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in large geographic
areas will be surveyed to understand their IPC-related knowledge, attitudes, practices and environmental risk
factors. Using innovative dyadic interview analysis of both patient (or informal caregiver) and HHC provider
interviews (40 pairs), we will better understand patient/caregivers’ barriers to IPC and explore how best to
enhance patient (or informal caregiver)-HHC provider interactions and improve IPC practices at home. Finally,
we will triangulate the results from Aims 1-3 to develop a multimodal intervention to improve IPC knowledge
and practices among HHC patients and informal caregivers, and pilot test it among 30 patients across all
racial/ethnic and SES backgrounds. Conducted by a multi-disciplinary team, findings of this project will be used
to guide future clinical IPC practices in HHC settings."
10892900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous monolayer-bound organelles that function in cellular lipid storage (for metabolic energy
or membrane synthesis). LDs form from the ER, but how LDs are formed remains unknown and is a central question for the
field. The current model indicates that neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TG), are synthesized in the ER and released
into the bilayer. At a critical concentration, TGs de-mix from the phospholipid bilayer in a phase transition that forms
nascent LDs that bud toward the cytosol. We hypothesize that proteins are essential to ensure this process occurs in a
defined manner and to prevent the formation of “ectopic” and potentially dysfunctional LDs, disrupting ER and cell
function. Specifically, two ER proteins – seipin and lipid droplet assembly factor 1 (LDAF1) – operate in the lipid droplet
assembly complex (LDACs) in the ER to form LDs. Both proteins form an oligomeric assembly with seipin forming a ring
of 10-12 subunits and an equal number of LDAF1 occupying the middle of the ring. While we have identified components
of the LD formation machinery and gained some insight into their structures, how these proteins function to facilitate LD
formation remains mostly a mystery. Here we propose to utilize the latest tools and approaches, including biochemistry,
structural biology, molecular simulations, and cell biology, to address the following questions: How and where is TG made
relative to LDACs? What are the molecular structures of the seipin/LDAF1 LDACs? How do these oligomeric complexes
assemble/disassemble? Where do LDACs localize in cells? How do they function to organize LD formation? We will
address these questions by completing four specific aims. Aim 1 will address the mechanism of TG synthesis in the ER by
the DGAT1 enzyme. We will expand on our recent elucidation of the molecular structure of human DGAT1, combining
molecular dynamics and biochemical experiments to elucidate the precise mechanism of TG generation and determine how
TG is released into the ER membrane for LD formation. Aim 2 will determine how and where LD assembly complexes
assemble in cells to form LDs. We will determine the relationship of TG synthesis to LDACs, whether seipin/LDAF1
LDACs localize to ER tubules and how they assemble. Aim 3 will focus on elucidating the molecular structure of the
seipin/LDAF1 LDAC in vitro and in cells. We will utilize cell and structural biology approaches, including cryo-EM and
cryo-ET to test the hypothesis that seipin and LDAF1 form a ring structure with LDAF1 in center and that these LDACs
form at areas of membrane curvature (tubules) where the structure may adopt dynamic conformations and activate of the
complex. Aim 4 will determine the molecular function of the seipin/LDAF1 LDAC in vitro and in molecular dynamics
simulations. We will reconstitute LD formation to test the hypothesis that the seipin/LDAF1 LDAC catalyzes phase
transition of TG in the membrane, ensuring LDs form at these designated formation sites. Successful completion of these
aims will advance the molecular understanding of a fundamental process central to energy metabolism and provide
information on the mechanistic underpinning of many metabolic diseases, such as obesity, atherosclerosis, and fatty liver
disease."

The COVID-19 pandemic and the co-occurring period of racial trauma has upended family environments and
exacted a toll on parents (mothers in particular), racial and ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities.
Understanding how parents functioned during this time is crucial to identifying mechanisms linking race, gender,
and sexual identity marginalization to disparities in parental well-being with critical implications for child health.
Leveraging novel population-based survey and time diary data collected this past year from the National Couples’
Health and Time Study (NCHAT), we will identify mechanisms underlying gender, racial and ethnic minority, and
sexual minority disparities in parenting stress and parental well-being during COVID and this period of intense
racial trauma. NCHAT (N = 3,642) is a population-representative study of individuals between 20 and 60 living
in same and different-gender couples in the U.S. with oversamples of Black, Latinx, and Asian families and
sexual minorities. The study includes 41% of partners as well. The analytic sample for this study focuses on the
35% of the sample that had children under 18 (n = 1,274 main respondents; n = 567 partners). This project has
four specific aims: Aim 1. Determine gender, racial and ethnic minority, and sexual minority disparities in
parenting stress and well-being and parent-child relationship quality and test marginalization, socioeconomic
status, and adverse childhood experiences as mediators; Aim 2. Evaluate COVID and racial trauma stress,
psychological distress, and couple relationship functioning as moderators of parenting stress and well-being and
parent-child relationship quality disparities; Aim 3. Identify dyadic stress processes in the associations between
COVID and racial trauma stress, psychological distress, and relationship functioning and parenting; Aim 4.
Examine community disruptions and context as moderators of parenting stress and well-being and parent-child
relationship quality disparities. Further, the NCHAT data, the contextual data produced for this project on
structural racism, sexism, and heterosexism, and NCHAT survey items for harmonization will be shared with the
Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium Coordination Center (SBECCC) and the
wider health research community, leveraging the exceptional resources of the Institute for Social Research and
Data Innovation (ISRDI), home to the IPUMS data projects. Forty percent of NCHAT main respondents identify
racial and ethnic minorities, and 45% identify as sexual minorities. Data such as these are crucial to the success
and inclusiveness of the SBECCC. This study aligns with the U01’s intention to fund “research to understand the
health impacts of coronavirus mitigation strategies and the mechanisms that may convey risk and resilience,
particularly in underserved and vulnerable populations, [that] will help improve long-term responses to the
pandemic and prepare more effectively for the next public health emergency.” Importantly, understanding family
experiences and strategies at this historical moment can inform interventions to address health detriments and
build resiliency for the future of families."
10817201,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
 This application is to transition the University of Miami (UM) Center for HIV and Research in Mental Health
(CHARM) from a Developmental to a Full NIMH AIDS Research Center (ARC), the next phase in the process
of successfully establishing the Center, creating infrastructure, and catalyzing and developing multidisciplinary
HIV/AIDS mental health (MH) research at our institution. Specific accomplishments during the Developmental
period include dramatic growth of externally funded research related to MH and HIV, establishment and
continuous development of meaningful community engaged activities at the institution, support of yearly
developmental awards, a T32 on HIV/mental health research award related to underrepresented minorities,
competition nationally for EHE supplements, increase in the number of new faculty both overall and in terms of
diversity, and achievement of outstanding early “return on investments” from mentoring our junior faculty.
 Our theme is our organizing mission statement, “To promote, develop, and support high-impact, high-
quality, community-engaged HIV research addressing mental health and related disparities as a
scientific, strategic, and mentoring resource to end the HIV epidemic.” The significant HIV-related mental
health disparities facing our region’s diverse populations in combination with our institution’s strengths make
UM an ideal setting to establish a research infrastructure that can become a national resource. The proposed
organization, structure and distribution of activities of our Cores arises from our mission statement and from
iterative growth and focus during the Developmental period, which has created an effective functional Center.
Ongoing strategic planning includes continuous guidance from our stakeholders, our Community Advisory
Board, our External and Internal Advisory board, and monthly meetings with the other NIMH-funded ARC
Directors. The Administrative (Admin) Core, as an organizational hub, provides Center leadership, strategic
planning, and coordinates cross-Core activities. The Developmental (Dev) Core awards pilot studies and
mentors early-stage investigators and investigators new to HIV/mental health research. The Methods Core
provides innovative research design, biostatistical (e.g. multilevel modeling, machine learning, geospatial
analysis), data management, and qualitative research expertise and maintains the data elements for the
Center’s consent-to-contact databases and a REDCap measures library. The Mental Health Disparities and
Community Engagement (MHD-CE) Core houses our community engagement activities and provides
expertise and resources to promote culturally competent approaches, tools, and interventions for ethical, multi-
level, community-engaged research addressing MH and HIV-related health disparities. The Equitable
Implementation Science (EIS) Core, a new core, provides design and implementation science resources and
expertise to extend the equitable reach of evidenced-based interventions."
10817203,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (A)
 The Administrative (Admin) Core in the Center for HIV and Research in Mental Health (CHARM) acts as
our primary organizational hub. It is responsible for administratively assisting Core leaders, investigators, and
other users, so that the Cores can focus on scientific activities directed to achieving their Aims. This allows
CHARM to be an institutional, regional, and national resource for HIV-related mental health (MH) disparities
research across the HIV prevention and care continua.
 The proposed Admin Core builds on our successes achieved during the current Developmental Center
funding period. We initiated and iteratively refined all organizational and Center-structure activities, such as
establishing and focusing the successful and efficient organizational structure of which Core is responsible for
what activities, coordinating the advisory boards (Internal, External Scientific, and Community), managing
ongoing strategic planning and iterative synergy across the Cores, optimizing the use of existing resources,
and creating a positive collaborative research environment for multi-disciplinary HIV/AIDS MH research. We re-
ignited and re-invigorated supportive MH HIV/AIDS research at UM, facilitating the submission and attainment
of external grant proposals including 9 competitive Federal End-the-Epidemic (EHE) supplements and one
administrative supplement, became an official University-wide designated Center, set up the developmental
award reviews and pre-award initiation of projects.
 As a Full Center, The Admin Core in CHARM will continue to provide the umbrella organizational
structure for the Center and its Cores. We will continue to support scientific growth by assisting the
Developmental and three Research Cores with their Aims; managing overall Center and supplement finances,
reporting, and regulatory requirements; and monitoring Core activities to ensure progress toward the Center’s
short-term objectives and long-term goals. The Admin Core assists with organizing meetings (e.g., Research
in Progress reviews, and cross-Core and Center-Center meetings at UM). The Core facilitates weekly
meetings with the Coordinators of all 5 Cores and the Center Executive Director, monitors Core progress (for
ongoing evaluation / goal attainment, and for reporting to the advisory boards as well as NIH progress reports),
and, through the Admin Core, Center leadership ensures dynamic strategic planning, working closely with
three advisory groups (Internal Advisory Board, External Scientific Advisory Board, and the CAB) and
monitoring enactment of their recommendations. In the Developmental funding period, the Core achieved its
overarching goal to provide sufficient administrative support to the Center leaders, the CAB, the Cores, and the
users to ignite MH HIV/AIDS scientific areas of highest priority in our community in the Greater Miami area. We
will continue to build from this now that we have a highly functioning administrative and organization structure
in place that was initiated during the developmental funding period."
10907654,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI)
and respiratory failure characterized by diffuse alveolar and endothelial damage. ARDS can be
complicated by pulmonary vascular dysfunction (PVD) and right ventricular (RV) failure and
increased mortality. Current imaging technology relies on assessment of anatomic features for
the assessment of ALI, which has limited sensitivity for detecting the initial pulmonary and
vascular injury. We propose a molecular imaging approach that would detect early, subclinical
manifestations of cardiopulmonary injury and define conditions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
activation associated with the risk for advancement to ARDS and complicating cardiac
dysfunction. Patients with ARDS may require different ventilation schemes, and inappropriate
ventilation can lead to superimposed ventilator induced lung injury with disruption of the structural
integrity of the tissue interface between the pulmonary circulation and alveolar space. The
pulmonary architecture, which includes the extracellular matrix (ECM) can be disrupted in ARDS.
MMP activation occurs in the setting of ARDS and is a critical molecular mechanism associated
with disease progression and therefore represents a therapeutic target. Inhibition of MMPs has
also been shown to protect against RV cardiomyocyte injury associated with ARDS. There is an
urgent need for clinically relevant diagnostic imaging biomarkers for detection of patients with ALI
and progressive ARDS and complicating PVD and RV dysfunction. Early and serial targeted MMP
imaging can define the underlying pathology and guide the timing of targeted interventional
strategies to mitigate the progression to life-threatening disease. This project will test the central
hypothesis in a porcine model of ARDS that MMP activation can be visualized, quantified, and
more importantly successfully inhibited with a localized therapeutic delivery approach to mitigate
ARDS progression and vascular and myocardial injury. We will evaluate MMP activation within
the lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature, and right ventricular myocardium in a porcine
model of ARDS induced by regional bronchial lavage. We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
an MMP inhibitor delivered intravenously or via a novel hydrogel-based formulation that will yield
localized high doses of the inhibitor. The role of MMP activation will also be evaluated in ventilated
patients that have died with ARDS. This project will combine both diagnostic and treatment
strategies and coalesce a team of physicians and scientists to advance novel diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies with high relevance to management of ARDS, and in turn will improve
patient recovery from ARDS and utilization of medical resources."
10873179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebrovascular pathology is present throughout stages of Alzheimer’s Disease and is correlated with cognitive
changes. There is strong evidence that vascular dysfunction is a significant driver of neuropathology. Our long-
term objective is to understand the function of Alzheimer’s Disease-associated risk genes in vascular cells, their
contribution to the development of cerebrovascular pathology and the opportunities to use this information in
therapeutic development. There are over 27 Alzheimer’s Disease-associated risk (AD-risk) loci encompassing
numerous genetic variants in non-coding and coding regions and hundreds of linked genes. Our overarching
hypothesis is that a subset of AD-risk genes impairs vascular function, causing release of inflammatory factors,
blood brain barrier (BBB) impairment, and reduced perfusion, thus contributing to neurodegeneration. To
address this, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with a proven track record of collaboration, including
with ADSP and ADGP members, who bring expertise in vascular pathology in dementia, endothelial cell (EC)
signaling and EC functional testing, Alzheimer’s Disease genomics, single cell and nuclear transcriptomics,
bioinformatics, CRISPR-based gene editing for large scale screening and AD mouse models for in-depth
functional assessment in vivo. Notably, we will address differences in gene effects related to the important
biological variables, sex and metabolic disease. Men and women differ in their genetic risk for Alzheimer’s
Disease, with sex-specific polygenic risk scores providing better prediction of onset, progression, and pathology
than pooled-sex scores. Over 80% of individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease have co-morbid metabolic disease,
which exacerbates vascular pathology. We have identified the top 50 AD-risk SNPs and 600 AD-associated
genes, and these will be targeted for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial cell (EC) screens
by prime editing and CRISPR-based gene inhibition and activation approaches respectively. iPSC-based
production of human ECs and mural cells in 2D and 3D models has been optimized and scaled to enable efficient
functional testing of the impact of gene changes, including on neuro-vascular interactions in cerebral organoids.
Discoveries made in these human cell systems will be validated by an in-depth investigation of gene expression
changes in individual ECs and mural cells across a large collection of Alzheimer’s Disease brain samples using
single nuclear sequencing. The EC translatome will also be obtained from mouse Alzheimer’s Disease models
that incorporate sex and metabolic disease. These diverse datasets will be harmonized and integrated in order
to map vascular phenotypes of AD-risk genes and identify critical molecular pathways that are targetable drivers
of AD cerebrovascular pathology. These data will add to the breadth of knowledge being gathered by other
groups to further elucidate underlying neuronal, glial, microglial, endothelial and mural cell-cell interactions that
contribute in a substantial way to the complex architecture of Alzheimer Disease pathology.

10884438,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among American men, and the vast
majority of these deaths are due to metastatic, castration-resistant PC (mCRPC). Androgen suppression therapy
(AST) is used to treat PC patients, which comprise of: (1) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with LHRH
agonists or antagonists; (2) blocking CYP17-mediated androgen synthesis with abiraterone; and (3) androgen
receptor (AR) antagonists such as enzalutamide and others. While AR can significantly prolong overall survival
(OS) of patients with various stages of PC, acquired resistance to either is inevitable, after which limited treatment
options exist. Only about 35% of men respond to enzalutamide after developing resistance to abiraterone [1].
There is therefore a significant unmet need for new mCRPC treatments that act orthogonally and synergistically
with existing AST to increase and prolong its efficacy in mCRPC. The chemokine receptor isoforms CXCR1 and
CXCR2 (CXCR1/2) are validated as orthogonal therapeutic targets in mCRPC. Tumor-secreted CXCR1/2
ligands such as CXCL6 and CXCL8 (IL-8) mediate resistance to ASTs, exerting protumorigenic effects by binding
surface CXCR1/2 on TAMs [2], MDSCs [3-8] and AR negative (AR-) neuroendocrine (NE) cancer cells [9] in the
PC TME. MDSCs are significantly elevated in patient biopsies with CRPC vs. pre-ADT [3], as is expression of
CXCL6 [7] and CXCL8 [5, 10]. Higher patient baseline serum CXCL8 pre-ADT was prognostic for shorter OS
and time to CRPC independent of docetaxel, disease burden, and time of metastases [11]. Circulating MDSCs
positively correlated with clinical stage, and inversely with OS (median OS of 19 vs. 55 months with high vs. low
MDSCs) [12, 13]. We hypothesize that combining CXCR1/2 blockade with standard of care (enzalutamide) in
mCRPC patients progressing on first-line abiraterone will afford enhanced efficacy vs. historical standard of care
efficacy in the same population. SX-682 is a clinical-stage, small-molecule CXCR1/2 inhibitor validated in
numerous published pre-clinical cancer models including mCRPC, and which exhibits activity in patients with
melanoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Through execution of the Specific
Aims, we will advance SX-682 through critical proof-of-concept (POC) efficacy testing in the first ever phase 2
one-arm, open-label trial in mCRPC of a CXCR1/2 inhibitor with enzalutamide in patients failing abiraterone.
The trial will enroll 53 evaluable patients with mCRPC diagnosis with (a) any histology, (b) measurable disease
at enrollment, and (c) currently on or previously on abiraterone with prednisone and with rising PSA (a rising
PSA requires at least 3 measurements obtained at least 1 week apart showing increase from nadir with the last
level above 2 ng/mL). The primary endpoint is clinical benefit (CB), wherein CB is a composite endpoint defined
as 1) RECIST 1.1 CR or PR, 2) confirmed PSA50 decline, or 3) prolonged stable disease by RECIST/PCWG3
criteria for ≥ 6 months. If successful, SX-682 would be a highly valuable new addition to the existing mCRPC
treatment landscape."
10811693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite major advances in the treatment of HIV, people living with HIV (PLWH) experience greater burdens of
multiple aging-related chronic diseases compared to people without HIV. Substance use, depression, and
systemic inflammation are risk factors for aging-related chronic diseases and occur at higher rates among
PLWH. Research is needed to identify factors that drive substance use, depression, and systemic inflammation
among PLWH in young adulthood, at ages when chronic disease prevention is still feasible. The brain’s central
executive network (CEN) plays a key role in exerting self-control, reappraising stressful stimuli, and managing
intrusive thoughts. These skills are critical for managing negative emotions when facing stressful life
circumstances. Lower CEN function may thus increase susceptibility to stress-related mental health outcomes,
such as depression and substance use. Among people living with HIV, greater substance use and depression
may reduce adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Reduced ART adherence may lead to greater systemic
inflammation. Greater systemic inflammation may lead to lower CEN function. Lower CEN function, in turn,
may further increase susceptibility to problematic substance use and depression. PLWH may therefore be at
risk of falling into a vicious cycle of increased depressive symptoms, increased substance use, lower ART
adherence, increased systemic inflammation, and reduced CEN function. This project will test an integrated
neuroimmune model of problematic substance use and depression in a sample of young adults living with HIV
(n=246) who are enrolled in RADAR, a cohort study of sexual and gender minority youth assigned male at birth
(e.g., gay and bisexual men, trans women, non-binary individuals). This project has considerable clinical
importance because previous research suggests that CEN function can be improved through interventions
such as cognitive training, meditation, and neuromodulation. Improving CEN function may therefore prove to
be an important new component of HIV care plans aimed at reducing substance use, improving mental health,
maximizing ART adherence, and reducing systemic inflammation among PLWH. To make this novel project
feasible, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors with expertise in neuroscience, clinical psychology,
and HIV pathogenesis. The applicant’s primary career goal is to establish an independently funded research
program on the neuroimmunology of substance use, mental health, and chronic aging-related diseases among
people living with HIV (PLWH). To this end, the applicant will receive advanced training and research
experience in three interrelated research domains relevant to his career goals: (1) Problematic substance use
among PLWH, (2) Neuroimaging of brain connectivity, and (3) Chronic inflammation in PLWH. This project will
also provide opportunities and formal training to further develop his skills in manuscript writing, grant
development, and project management. Building proficiency in these key skills and research domains will
equip the applicant to become an independently funded investigator in HIV research."
10864802,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ongoing HIV endemic and the COVID-19 pandemic have disproportionately affected racial and ethnic
minority groups. Minority populations have higher HIV and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and mortality
rates. Social determinants of health (SDoH) are most likely the main cause of these racialized inequities. To
create more efficient HIV interventions acting at the individual, structural, and community levels, particularly in
the context of COVID-19, a better knowledge of the SDoH determinants that exacerbate these discrepancies is
urgently required. Further, people with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infections.
Increased rates of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality among PWH are likely associated with individual and
community factors as proposed in the socio-ecological model, that if identified, can be targeted to create better
intervention strategies. Further, effective COVID-19 prevention strategies such as mask mandates, social
distancing orders, and vaccines are available to protect vulnerable populations. Using linked Florida Enhanced
HIV/AIDS Reporting System data and Merlin COVID-19 surveillance data for 2020-2021, this study’s primary
objectives are to (1) assess the effect of COVID-19 community-level prevention strategies and the impact of
COVID-19 vaccine availability in reducing the risk of COVID-19 in PWH and related disparities; and (2) to
identify factors associated with co-occurring high rates of COVID-19 and HIV across communities. Our specific
aims are to (1) identify individual- and community-level factors associated with disparities in COVID-19
incidence and mortality among PWH before and after vaccine availability using multi-level models; (2) identify
dual hotspots of high COVID-19 and HIV incidence rates, and associated community factors using spatial
statistics and multilevel models; and (3) identify the differential effect of COVID-19 prevention strategies (e.g.,
mask mandates, stay at home and social distancing orders) on COVID-19 incidence rates in PWH compared
to people without HIV using longitudinal trend analysis. This study contributes to the Ending the HIV Epidemic
Initiative by identifying modifiable community-level factors associated with the synergistic effects of more than
one epidemic that may negatively impact the HIV endemic. The findings will be beneficial in identifying and
developing tailored prevention strategies and in resource allocation across Florida. The proposed study will
provide hands-on training for Tendai Gwanzura’s and complementary didactic training and mentorship in
advanced social disparities epidemiology methods specific to HIV and COVID-19; advanced statistical
methods in multilevel modelling and longitudinal trend analysis; health policy assessment with regards to
COVID-19 policies and how they affect PWH; and geo-spatial statistics to identify locations with the greatest
burden of disease. These trainings will contribute towards making Tendai, an accomplished minority
predoctoral student, and an independent health disparities researcher."

10897986,"Secondary brain injury is a leading cause of neurological deficits after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a stroke
subtype with no effective treatment. Despite the emerging role of epigenetic mechanisms in the complex
pathophysiology of ICH, the isoform-specific role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) or the precise molecular
mechanism of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-mediated neuroprotection after ICH is yet to be defined.
Based on our recent findings and compelling preliminary observations, our central hypothesis is that a class I
HDAC isoform, HDAC3, is a critical molecular regulator of secondary brain injury and, thereby, neurological
outcomes after ICH by modulating Nrf2 signaling. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed.
Aim 1: To determine that pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 attenuates secondary brain injury and improves
hematoma resolution and neurobehavioral outcomes after ICH. Aim 2: To determine the molecular mechanism
by which selective HDAC3 inhibition confers neuroprotection after ICH. Aim 3: To determine the functional role
of microglial/macrophage HDAC3 in modulating secondary brain injury, hematoma resolution, and
neurobehavioral outcomes after ICH. The proposed studies include a rigorous pharmacological and transgenic
approach, including newly developed myeloid as well as microglia-specific HDAC3 conditional knockouts and a
next-generation technique (CUT and Tag assay). The proposed project would determine for the first time (1)
the therapeutic potential of selectively inhibiting HDAC3 in attenuating secondary brain damage and improving
hematoma resolution and neurological outcomes after ICH (2) whether Nrf2 signaling is critical for the
neuroprotection conferred via HDAC3 inhibition after ICH (3) gene-specific histone acetylation changes in
microglia/macrophages upon HDAC3 inhibition after ICH and (4) the functional role of macrophage and
microglia-specific expression of HDAC3 in modulating secondary brain damage, hematoma resolution and
neurological outcomes after ICH. Altogether, the proposed project would identify clinically relevant molecular
targets for therapeutic intervention for ICH."
10977417,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in
Africa. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in
people with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body
fluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,
children) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral
transmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,
remains unresolved. Several KSHV–host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were
performed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through
collaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to
KSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this
application is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to
selecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.
Ogembo’s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine
development. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of
epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both
monoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of
diverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking
the four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies
specific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the
hypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is
built on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the
KSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the
permissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV
gp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV
gps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the
initial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV
transmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV
infection and its associated cancers."

In the next decade, well trained researchers are needed to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS especially
among children, adolescents, and young adults. Effective intervention programs are needed for both the
prevention and treatment of HIV. This research training program will prepare Ph.D. and M.D. fellows to carry
out independent research. Our faculty in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have expertise in HIV
prevention and treatment, adolescent risk behaviors, normative development, psychopathology, and the
psychology of physically ill youth. Additional faculty at Brown (through the Center for AIDS Research, Division
of Infectious Disease, and School of Public Health) have expertise in the medical care of HIV infected youth
and adults, HIV testing, treatment as prevention, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, sexually transmitted infections,
substance abuse, and international health. The strong faculty record of NIH funded research ensures that
trainees are exposed to thriving areas of programmatic research. Training involves interdisciplinary and
translational elements to prepare trainees for the integration of the medical, psychiatric, and developmental
issues and as they inform biobehavioral HIV/AIDS research. The program has a total of six postdoctoral
trainees and one summer trainee each year. Two or three new psychology trainees are enrolled every year for
a two-year fellowship (with an optional third year) and one new M.D. is enrolled in alternate training years.
Consistent with each trainee’s individual needs, a graduated program for progressive independent research is
designed. A formal training curriculum targets specific learning objectives to develop the skills needed for the
next generation of HIV research. Core areas of learning include models of behavior and its change; the
influence of heath disparities on HIV risk, infection, and treatment; the adaptation of evidence-based
interventions and implementation science; the biology of HIV, its prevention and its treatment; and advanced
statistical techniques such as comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and transmission network
analyses. Curriculum needs are satisfied by HIV-specific seminars, general research design seminars, and
tutorials in addition to formal courses at Brown or nearby universities. The postdoctoral graduates from our
three cycles have been very successful - 19 of the 32 postdoctoral graduates (60%) have become PIs on NIH
K or R series grants and the rate is similar in the current cycle (56%) and prior (61%). In addition, they have
authored 260 relevant peer-reviewed publications related to their training, 102 of which were authored by
graduates of this cycle. These outcomes suggest that our training program is meeting its goal of preparing
trainees to conduct high quality, relevant, HIV research."
10830468,"Development of new therapeutics often fails in human clinical trials due to the biological differences between humans and
animal models and the inability of current in vitro models to accurately recapitulate the in vivo state. As such, in vitro microfluidic (MF)
models have seen significant growth and become a key tool for understanding biological systems, and for testing and development of
new therapeutics. Innovation in microfluidics, however, is limited by materials and manufacturing challenges associated with
conventional processes such as soft lithography, injection molding, and mechanical milling. Additive manufacturing (AM), also referred
to as 3D printing, has been heralded as the solution to these manufacturing challenges and AM additionally offers broad design
freedom not accessible via conventional manufacturing. However, AM faces a critical hurdle: the limited ability to 3D print conventional
(thermally-curable) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the most widely established R&D microfluidic material. Despite the potential
manufacturing and design benefits, AM has not been broadly adopted for MF production due in large part to the potential material risks.
Of the commercially available AM processes and those being researched, none offer a clear path to commercial 3D printing of
conventional PDMS MF devices. Our hypothesis is: combining the knowledge-base and familiarity of conventional PDMS with our 3D
PDMS process will fundamentally change the way microfluidics are fabricated and unlock the design freedom of additive manufacturing
for the MF community, which will lead to significant advancements of in vitro MF models.
 Building upon our successful Phase I effort — during which we demonstrated the ability of our patent-pending 3D PDMS process
to 3D print MF devices from conventional PDMS — this Phase II effort focuses on developing a pilot-scale commercial 3D PDMS system
and using the 3D PDMS process to fabricate cutting edge in vitro blood-brain-barrier models for testing by our collaborators at Virginia
Tech. They recently developed a MF BBB model containing a nanofiber basement membrane mimic which demonstrates a superior
ability to recapitulate the in vivo BBB architecture. In Phase II, the team will optimize the architecture of the nanomembranes and then
design and demonstrate a commercially producible 3D PDMS MF nanomembrane BBB model with integrated electrodes. We will also
collaborate with the Nadkarni group at Harvard MGH to characterize the PDMS curing kinetics in 3D PDMS printing using laser speckle
rheology.
 Aim 1: Operational Pilot-Scale 3D PDMS System. The objective of this aim is to design and a build pilot-scale 3D PDMS
system. Milestone 1A: 3D PDMS Simulation & Model Accurately Predict Curing within +/-10%; Milestone 1A: 3D PDMS Simulation
Model Accurately Predicts Curing within +/-10%; Milestone 1B: 3D PDMS unit achieves 200 mm3/hr build rate for MF device.
 Aim 2: 3D Printed Nanofiber Blood-Brain-Barrier Model. The objective of this aim is to 3D print a highly reproducible BBB
model which incorporates a nanofiber membrane and integrated TEER electrodes. Milestone 2A: Transport master curves for nanofiber
membranes developed; Milestone 2B: Optimized nanofiber BBB model demonstrated by a 20% increase in TEER values for a co-
culture sample as compared to a monoculture sample.

10886660,"Low back pain (LBP) is a key source of medical costs and disability, impacting over 31 million Americans at
any given time and resulting in $100-$200 billion per year in total healthcare costs. LBP is one of the leading
causes of ambulatory care visits to US physicians; unfortunately, these visits often result in treatments such as
opioids that can lead to more harm than benefit. In 2017 the American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline
for LBP recommended patients receive non-pharmacological interventions as a first-line treatment but stopped
short of offering solutions regarding how such treatments should be integrated into routine patient care.
Roadmaps exist for multi-disciplinary collaborative care that includes doctors of chiropractic and physical
therapists, well-trained primary contact clinicians with specific expertise in the treatment of musculoskeletal
conditions, as first line providers for LBP. These clinicians routinely employ many of the non-pharmacological
approaches recommended by the ACP guideline, including spinal manipulation and exercise. Important
foundational work conducted by members of the study team has demonstrated that such care is feasible, safe,
and results in improved physical function, less pain, fewer opioid prescriptions, and reduced utilization of
healthcare services. However, this treatment approach for LBP has yet to be widely implemented or validated
using rigorous scientific methods. Our overarching goal is to refine and implement a multidisciplinary
collaborative care model for LBP (MC2LBP) in 3 academic Health Care Systems (HCS) and then evaluate its
effectiveness by comparing it to usual medical care in patients age 18 and older suffering from LBP.
Completion of project study aims will begin with a one-year UG3 planning phase involving completion of 22
milestones in 2 categories of phased activities - model implementation and clinical trial design. UH3 study aims
will be accomplished using a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, clinical trial design. The study will be managed
through a Clinical Coordinating Center and Data Coordinating Center, both housed at the Duke Clinical
Research Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the University of Iowa.
During the planning phase, we will build implementation infrastructure across three HCS, finalize the clinical
trial protocol, and complete the tasks necessary to transition from the UG3 to UH3 phase. The UH3 phase will
be used to: 1) Operationalize the integration of new organizational policies and procedures required to facilitate
implementation of MC2LBP at intervention clinics; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of MC2LBP vs
usual care; 3) Estimate and compare medical resource use and costs of implementing MC2LBP; and 4)
Evaluate patient, provider, system and policy level barriers and facilitators to implementing MC2LBP, using a
mixed method, process evaluation approach. Results from this study have the potential to inform future
implementation and policy efforts to improve the quality of pain management for patients suffering from LBP
while simultaneously reducing opioid prescriptions, health care costs and utilization of services."

 Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at
risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are
generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage.
The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately
without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo-
hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from
pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes
complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton-
photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage
robustness and OAR sparing optimality.
 Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is
limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT,
owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT.
(B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and
photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with
both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization
devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system.
(C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing
infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer
patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving)
distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.
 Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our
joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials.
However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning
system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will
develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step
towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.
 Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.
 Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.
 Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning."

This project seeks to continue providing high quality, interdisciplinary training in demography,
with a focus on the relationships between population dynamics, socio-cultural systems, and
human health and welfare. Our objective is to continue with our successful recruiting, training,
and placement of high quality and diverse trainees across a range of disciplines. Demographic
analysis offers a distinct and critical perspective on the health and development of children, as
many of the most important issues influencing child and family well-being in the contemporary
world are demographic in nature, including declining and postponed fertility, declining and
postponed marriage, and the divergence of child welfare by social class. Berkeley is widely
recognized as one of the leading centers of demographic training and research in the US and
the world. Berkeley has long occupied a unique niche in the population studies training
ecosystem, with a strong focus on the analysis of population systems and how they relate to
cultural, economic, and political systems. Our graduates hold academic positions at leading
universities and demographic research centers in the departments of sociology, economics,
anthropology, demography, history, public health and statistics, with recent trainees accepting
tenure-track positions at Princeton, NYU, Michigan, Stanford, and others. This training grant
complements our other NIA- and NIH-funded initiatives, including the P30 Center for the
Economics and Demography of Aging, the R24/P2C Berkeley Population Center, the R25
Summer Workshop in Formal Demography, the NIA T32 Training in the Demography of Aging,
the NIA-funded undergraduate diversity program R25 Cal ADAR: Advancing Diversity in Aging
Research; and the newly funding NICHD T32 Training in Data Science. Berkeley demography
has deep tradition of formal demography, increasingly complemented by computational
demography, as well as its cultural, critical, and theoretical approaches. The program is deeply
interdisciplinary, drawing students and trainees from demography, sociology, public health, and
economics. Our trainees will continue to (1) learn core demographic methods and theory, with a
focus on formal aggregate and computational approaches; (2) learn to think in critical and
theoretically rich ways about population processes and dynamics; (3) apply their knowledge of
population processes and dynamics to substantive areas, including family, migration, and
health; and (4) take a broad array of supplemental courses. Some trainees received their PhD in
Demography or in Sociology and Demography, and others do so in different disciplines, learning
demography supplemental to their other discipline. Time from entry to PhD is typically 5 to 6
years. Trainees typically receive T32 support for up to four years for the Demography PhD, and
up to two years for trainees from other departments, and most are recruited for the T32 in their
first or second years. Support is requested for six predoctoral trainees, consistent with the past."

Approximately 10-25% of the population has degeneration of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condyle.
Cartilage does not heal itself, and there are no mid-stage interventions to prevent condylar degeneration which
can lead to life-threatening conditions such as changes to the airway. This proposal aims to improve translation
of tissue engineering strategies for TMJ condylar regeneration toward human use in the clinic via characterization
of the mandibular condyle of the Yucatan minipig, engineering neocartilage-bone implants with robust interfacial
properties, and in vivo studies using neocartilage-bone implants to regenerate osteochondral defects of the TMJ
condyle. Preliminary proteomics data show that spatial distributions of collagen types I and II can be achieved
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), indicators of
fibrocartilage and hyaline articular cartilage, respectively. MALDI-IMS will serve as a powerful tool in a
characterization of the Yucatan minipig mandibular condyle, including the spatial distributions of collagen types
I, II, X, and XXVII. This characterization will provide gold standards for tissue-engineering approaches to treat
condylar defects. Preliminary ex vivo experiments indicate a high feasibility of creating osteochondral defects on
the TMJ condyle. Through these novel techniques, I will enhance tissue-engineering approaches for TMJ
condyle regeneration in three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, many techniques, including MALDI-IMS, will be
used to characterize the TMJ condyle of the Yucatan minipig. This characterization will result in gold standard
values for engineered tissues. In Specific Aim 2, a novel tissue-engineering technique involving seeding of
mesenchymal stem cells into decellularized bone scaffolds, then combining with self-assembled neocartilage,
will be interrogated. This will result in the formation of neocartilage-bone implants with robust interfacial
properties for long term in vivo efficacy. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, neocartilage-bone implants will be used in a
large animal study, where they will regenerate defects of the Yucatan minipig TMJ condyle. Successful
completion of this proposal will enhance the translation of tissue engineering strategies for TMJ disorders toward
the FDA paradigm of clinical trials and human use in the clinic."
10842249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Brain metastasis (BM) frequently arises from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and represents the most
common cause of cancer related death in the US, yet our understanding of BM biology is rudimentary. Our group
has recently identified excessive chromosomal instability (CIN) as a hallmark of BM19. In in vitro studies, in
addition to validation in multiple independent NSCLC patient datasets (TCGA, GENIE, CCLE, and CPTAC)
detailed in this proposal, we have identified CIN as a hallmark of NSCLCs harboring mutations in STK11
(encoding LKB1). LKB1-deficient NSCLCs are an aggressive tumor subtype associated with increased risk of
BM and immunotherapy resistance, and thus serves as a relevant archetypical disease that may broadly inform
the role of CIN in BM biology and cancer immune evasion. CIN arises from failures in correct chromosome
segregation during mitosis, leading to perpetual gains and losses of chromosome arms and the creation of
rupture-prone micronuclei. Upon rupture, these micronuclei expose DNA to the cytosol, activating cGAS-STING
signaling. This would seemingly present a conundrum for CINhigh cancers, as prototypical outputs of cGAS-
STING activation promote anti-tumor type I interferon (IFN) responses. However, it has been recently shown
that chronic cGAS-STING signaling characteristic of CINhigh tumors promotes metastatic non-canonical NF-kB
output, in addition to immune-evasive adenosine generation in the tumor microenvironment, the latter
accomplished through adaptive increases in cGAMP export and upregulation of surface ectonucleotidases
ENPP1 and NT5E. In addition to its ability to promote immunosuppression, adenosine also permeabilizes the
blood brain barrier and thus may potentially mechanistically link BM to CIN. This proposal seeks to understand
how cancer cell adaptations to CIN enable BM and immune evasion, namely through investigation of tonic
activation of cGAS-STING signaling. In Aim 1, I propose to delineate the respective contributions of CIN and
LKB1 loss per se to metastatic behavior and immunotherapy resistance in vivo. In Aim 2, I will perform spatio-
temporal resolved in vivo studies to delineate CIN-intrinsic (i.e., STING signaling) and -extrinsic (e.g. adenosine
generation) interactions that enable immune evasion and BM. Through generation of genetic perturbations in
LKB1-deficient and WT models, I will investigate whether chronic cGAMP-triggered STING recycling is a
hallmark of CINhigh, LKB1-deficient NSCLC that favors immune-evasive tumor behavior and establishment of BM.
Together, these aims offer unparalleled study of interactions critical for the establishment of the brain metastatic
niche and will pave the way for therapeutic development of malignant, treatment-resistant CINhigh tumors. With
the guidance from exceptional mentors and collaborators and access to the unparalleled scientific research
environment at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, this project will prepare me for a successful career
as a physician-scientist in the field of cancer biology."
10914945,"Development of an UNC13A antisense oligonucleotide treatment for ALS and FTD
Project Summary
Background: In 97% of ALS cases, and roughly half of FTD cases, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is
lost from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it forms into aggregates. A major function of TDP-43 in the
nucleus is to repress cryptic exon (CE) inclusion during RNA splicing. Recent studies have shown that a CE is
included in UNC13A mRNA when TDP-43 is depleted from the nucleus of neurons resulting in a loss of
UNC13A protein. UNC13A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are among the strongest hits associated
with ALS and FTD in human GWAS studies. The CE is located in the same intronic region as the primary risk
SNP. The risk SNP exacerbates the UNC13A CE inclusion - ALS / FTD patients with both risk alleles have
more CE inclusion than patients with one risk allele, who have more CE inclusion than patients with the
non-risk alleles. Similarly, risk SNP carriers have a dose-dependent reduction in survival. This additive risk
strongly suggests that targeting UNC13A to suppress the CE inclusion could have a substantial therapeutic
benefit. Since nearly all ALS patients have TDP-43 pathology, such a treatment would benefit them and not be
limited to SNP carriers. UNC13A plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and is essential for synaptic
vesicle release at most excitatory synapses and neuromuscular junctions. Among all the genes known to be
dysregulated by the loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus, only UNC13A has such strong genetic validation. Altered
STMN2 expression in the context of TDP-43 depletion is a hallmark of ALS / FTD, yet no link between ALS
risk and STMN2 variants has been established. Thus, UNC13A targeting treatments should be prioritized for
rapid advancement into clinical proof of concept studies.
 AcuraStem’s mission is to identify targets that rescue multiple forms of ALS / FTD. Thus we have
established patient-specific ALS / FTD disease models of both genetically defined and sporadic diseases. We
show in these models that cortical neurons derived from an ALS patient with the risk SNP have more UNC13A
CE inclusion than neurons derived from ALS patients with non-risk alleles. When we depleted TDP-43 in
patient-derived neurons using short interfering RNAs (siRNA) it induced a robust inclusion of CEs and reduced
normal UNC13A mRNA and protein levels across many patient lines. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are
an attractive approach for genetic targets in the CNS like UNC13A with several successes, including nusinersen
for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and tofersen, soon to be approved for SOD1-ALS. We used our proprietary
ASO design platform to synthesize >125 ASOs and identified several novel ASO sequences that potently
blocked CE inclusion and restored UNC13A mRNA and protein levels. AcuraStem is uniquely positioned with
potent UNC13A ASO candidates that can be advanced towards the clinic for ALS and FTD.
Objectives & Impact: This Direct to Phase 2 project aims to optimize these candidates and identify a bona fide
development candidate for advancement in investigational new drug (IND)-enabling toxicity studies. This
project involves collaborating with the Jackson Laboratory to characterize a new human UNC13A TDP-43 ALS
/ FTD mouse model that will be essential for the field. This project has a high probability of commercial success
because there is a dearth of disease-modifying treatments in development that could work for the sporadic ALS
and FTD population, a large unmet need and commercial opportunity."
10993959,"SUMMARY
Cocaine addiction is driven by drug-induced adaptations in the function of mesolimbocortical brain reward
circuits. A major unanswered question in the field of addiction biology is why behaviors such as drug seeking
remain persistent even after cocaine use has ceased. A leading mechanistic hypothesis proposes that drug
memory is encoded in the epigenome, and that consequent changes in gene expression within specific cell
populations play a key role in the persistent circuit plasticities that drive addiction-associated behaviors.
However, establishing experimental causality between the epigenome and drug seeking behaviors is
challenging. In particular, the cellular heterogeneity of the brain presents a barrier to biochemical sequencing-
based methods for chromatin studies, and the descriptive nature of epigenome data on its own is insufficient to
demonstrate causality. We have been working to overcome these barriers via the application of innovative
molecular genetic methods that allow us to both discover and disrupt chromatin regulation in specific populations
of neurons in vivo. This study focuses on dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which
play an essential role in the maintenance of drug seeking behaviors after cocaine exposure and forced
abstinence. Transcription of the gene encoding Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (Bdnf) is persistently induced
in neurons of the VTA following forced abstinence after chronic cocaine, and the experimental elevation of VTA
BDNF was shown to be sufficient to promote drug seeking in a rodent model of cocaine craving. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that forced abstinence from cocaine induces functional changes in chromatin of VTA DA
neurons that mediate the enhanced expression of plasticity genes including Bdnf. We further hypothesize that
the enhanced transcription of Bdnf in the VTA is required for the induction of drug seeking. To test these
hypotheses we will use an innovative low-input protocol to define the chromatin architecture of DA neurons from
the VTA and to discover the changes in 3D chromatin architecture genome-wide that accompany persistent
alterations in gene expression upon forced abstinence from chronic cocaine. Then we will use dCas9/CRISPR-
mediated functional genome engineering to test the requirement for VTA Bdnf transcription in the maintenance
of cocaine seeking behavior in a mouse model of the incubation of cocaine craving after forced abstinence.
Taken together, these studies will use leading edge molecular genetic methods to advance circuit-level
understanding of the cellular plasticities that contribute to increased drug seeking behaviors."

 A more robust research infrastructure is urgently needed to develop and test best practices in the
emergency department (ED) setting that address the medical, health, and psychosocial needs of older patients
and persons living with dementia (PLWD). The aging population and utilization of emergency care combine to
create an opportunity in the care continuum to detect and change patient care trajectories and underscore the
urgency to identify and disseminate best practices in geriatrics and dementia emergency care. Unfortunately,
due to the lack of infrastructure, there is a paucity of research to guide this work. The field is limited by lack of
standardization and few estimates of effectiveness of interventions and geriatric care delivered at facilities that
report Geriatric Emergency Department (GED) programs. We have built and designed an early research
infrastructure, the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (GEAR) network to meet this critical need.
GEAR is a growing network of health systems with GEDs, transdisciplinary researchers, and content experts
that have created a multicenter database and pilot study opportunities focused on aging studies in geriatric and
dementia emergency care.
 We will grow the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (GEAR 1.1) network by expanding and
leveraging the research data infrastructure established during its first phase, going from 4 to 7 health systems,
from 6 to 47 hospitals, representing over 2.2M ED encounters made by over 684K unique patients. The GEAR
1.1 Ecosystem will be available to the general research community, supporting efficient access to and use of
large, multicenter datasets for the conduct of geriatric and dementia-related emergency care aging studies,
including the ability to focus on health disparities. Specifically, we will: (1) Increase the number of sites and
data capabilities of GEAR, (2) Coordinate data harmonization and data linkage development across multiple
sites including NIA LINKAGE between Medicare and GEAR 1.1 data, and (3) Conduct multicenter evaluations,
including small-scale pilot studies that leverage the GEAR Ecosystem to address research gaps identified by
GEAR priority populations.
 We will expand and build upon an early platform from which GEAR and future investigators will be able
to generate and use the data for multicenter projects, conduct larger scale observational studies, and emulate
multicenter clinical trials. This will grow intra- and inter-networks both within and across participating healthcare
systems promoting the spread and partnerships of transdisciplinary aging studies and sciences. Now that the
initial GEAR network has laid the groundwork, GEAR 1.1 will solidify the foundation to create a more mature
and sustainable research infrastructure to support the development of an evidence-base for high-quality
geriatric and dementia emergency care."
10996033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The cohesin complex mediates the hierarchical organization of the genome into chromatin loops and
topologically associating domains (TADs) through a proposed model of loop extrusion. Indeed, cohesin plays an
important role in human health, since mutations in cohesin cause a developmental disorder known as Cornelia
de Lange Syndrome (CdLS). However, mechanistically, it remains unclear how cohesin dysfunction contributes
to the pathogenesis of CdLS. Interestingly, ~30% of CdLS patients do not harbor mutations in known cohesin
components highlighting the gap in our understanding of cohesin regulation. Therefore, we reason that unknown
factors are contributing to cohesin function, and that uncovering these factors may reveal mechanistic links
between cohesin dysfunction and disease. To this end, we completed screening genome-wide for genes that
can modulate chromatin interactions across TADs. We found that SMARCE1, which is a DNA-binding subunit of
the ATP-dependent human chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, promotes inter-TAD interactions, which
cohesin also facilitates. We next determined that SMARCE1 genetically interacts with cohesin, suggesting
SMARCE1 regulates cohesin-mediated chromatin looping. Strikingly, mutations in SWI/SNF cause Coffin-Siris
Syndrome (CSS), a developmental disorder that shares overwhelming phenotypic overlap with CdLS. The goal
of this proposal is to determine how SMARCE1 regulates cohesin and chromatin looping across the
genome, and the extent to which a cohesin dysfunction may underlie a shared signature of gene
misexpression in CdLS and CSS through two related, but independent aims.
 I will first determine the SWI/SNF dependency of SMARCE1 in promoting cohesin-mediated loop
extrusion. Next, I will interrogate the consequences of SWI/SNF and SMARCE1 loss on global cohesin
localization and chromatin organization. In parallel, I will intersect the changes in chromatin folding following
SMARCE1 depletion with changes in SWI/SNF and cohesin localization. Taking advantage of publicly available
genomic datasets, I will also intersect any detected differential looping or cohesin localization in the context of
different chromatin states. Furthermore, the novel role of a CSS-associated gene in chromatin folding suggests
that CdLS and CSS may converge on cohesin dysfunction. In addition to the overlapping clinical presentations
of CdLS and CSS, I will define the extent to which CdLS and CSS share signatures of cohesin dysfunction
in patient-derived cell lines. I will investigate whether chromatin is misfolded in CSS as in CdLS and how this
chromatin misfolding correlates with comparative transcriptomics between CSS and CdLS. As is the case in
CdLS, I will determine if any marker of cohesin dysfunction correlates with CSS disease severity. Completion of
this proposal will define the role of SMARCE1 in regulating cohesin-mediated chromatin folding and highlight a
potential shared molecular etiology at the intersection of CdLS and CSS providing the foundational knowledge
upon which to further explore common therapeutic interventions in more complex in vivo models."
10866489,"Teams of HIV/AIDS biomedical researchers who perform their own data analysis and consult with
biostatisticians as needed, are increasingly finding standard consultations inadequate because of the need to
1) tackle complex research questions, 2) make sense of big data, and 3) ensure that analysis is rigorous.
There is a critical need to train the future HIV/AIDS workforce for an interdisciplinary big data environment in
which quantitative experts with specialized methodological expertise are partnering on collaborative projects as
appropriate. Researchers need to be trained to identify their own knowledge gaps and identify collaborators
with the necessary expertise, which is getting more complex as quantitative expertise areas are becoming
more and more specialized. To address this, the HIV/AIDS community needs to develop programs that train
researchers and quantitative scientists — statisticians, computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers etc. —
to work cohesively in team science. We propose a program to cross-train HIV/AIDS researchers in
fundamental concepts of quantitative analysis, and quantitative scientists in the biological, clinical, and socio-
behavioral context of HIV/AIDS research. This program capitalizes on the breadth and depth of resources in
HIV/AIDS and in quantitative science at Duke to offer real-world HIV/AIDS research experiences with expert
quantitative mentoring not only to Duke trainees, but also trainees from regional institutions in North Carolina
who may not otherwise have access to these resources. It is designed to provide biomedical and quantitative
trainees with the Skills, Opportunities, Access, and Resources (SOAR) for interdisciplinary HIV/AIDS team
science. In the past project period, we taught data science, statistics, and assay bioinformatics to over 100
junior HIV/AIDS researchers through a series of 18 workshops we developed and implemented each year. We
were also able to introduce 50 graduate students in statistics, mathematics, and computer science to
multidisciplinary HIV/AIDS research through our summer internship program. To build upon this work, we are
proposing a novel research education program designed to fulfill several key objectives: First, we will provide
training for biomedical trainees interested in HIV/AIDS research to build up their skills in data science,
predictive modeling, and assay analysis through a series of workshops centered on real-world HIV case
studies. Second, we will implement a structured internship training program for quantitative graduate students
to have an enhanced mentoring and team science experience working on real-world research problems with
leading HIV/AIDS investigators. Third, we will develop a dedicated mentoring program for biomedical trainees
and provide interdisciplinary professional development training opportunities, including long-term expert
quantitative mentoring for trainees with data-driven research projects. This program will provide an exemplar
for developing multidisciplinary team science training programs that can be used to develop the workforce
across the country."

understanding of the effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on the rectal mucosal environment, a critical
site of vulnerability to HIV infection. This is of paramount importance, as biological sex and sex hormones
mediate effects on epithelial and immune cell function through their influence on transcriptional activity of the
cell, and these effects could alter the susceptibility of the rectal mucosa to HIV infection. The Specific Aims of
this proposal are to compare sex-specific, spatially localized gene expression patterns of rectal mucosal immune
and epithelial cell subpopulations between cisgender men and cisgender women utilizing spatial transcriptomics
integrated with single cell RNA sequencing (Aim 1), to define the single cell transcriptomic signatures of rectal
mucosal cellular subsets from cisgender men and cisgender women following ex vivo sex hormone exposure
(Aim 2), and to use the HIV explant challenge model to examine the impact of ex vivo sex hormone treatment
on rectal tissue susceptibility and host mucosal immune responses to HIV infection (Aim 3). This research
strategy will facilitate a 5-year career development and training plan that will enable Dr. Grimsley Ackerley to
build upon her prior research experience and gain critical mentored research training in: 1) Bioinformatics and
Transcriptomic Data Analyses, 2) Mucosal Immunology and HIV transmission, and 3) the Conduct of Sex- and
Gender-Based HIV Research. To achieve these training aims, Dr. Grimsley Ackerley has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in mucosal immunology, sex hormone biology, single cell and
spatial transcriptomic technologies, sex- and gender-based research, and biostatistics. This proposal will
capitalize on a robust research environment at Emory University and will be supported by resources available
through The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center and the Emory National Primate Research Center.
Dr. Grimsley Ackerley’s long-term career goal is to lead a successful and independent translational mucosal
immunology program that specializes in the use of genomics applications and the ex vivo HIV explant challenge
model to better understand biologic and immunologic factors that influence mucosal HIV susceptibility among
gender and sexual minority populations. Achievement of this long-term goal will be made possible through the
completion of the proposed K23 research aims and training plan, along with the support garnered from the highly
experienced mentorship team. This proposal will begin to address, mechanistically, the effects of biological sex
and gender-affirming hormone therapy on the rectal mucosal environment and rectal HIV susceptibility. The data
generated will serve as the foundation for future NIH R-level funding to facilitate Dr. Grimsley Ackerley’s transition
to an independent clinical-translational research career in the field of HIV prevention science."
10868725,"The Emerging Infectious Disease and HIV Scholars Program (EIDS) program seeks to develop
a physician-scientist workforce focused on clinical research to inform practical responses to HIV
and associated infections over the next decades. The Alpert Medical School of Brown University
has incorporated a Master of Science with specific coursework to provide an educational
foundation for clinical research with a dedicated research block. The program offers financial
support for pilot research projects and appropriate mentors will be assigned to guide scholars.
Scholars in medical school will attend a relevant professional conference each year and
program faculty and mentors will provide supplemental networking opportunities at these
meetings. The program will work closely with the Rhode Island Department of Health to engage
trainees in the investigation of ongoing epidemics in Rhode Island, such as HIV, COVID-19,
monkey pox, hepatitis C, and escalating sexually transmitted infections including syphilis.
 In the first four years, we enrolled and supported 66 scholars who completed clinical research
projects resulting in 72 abstracts and 31 publications. 25 out of 66 scholars (39%) were from
groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social
sciences (URM utilizing the NIH definition).
This grant will continue to inspire, train, support, and retain a community of scholars to serve as
“microbes hunters”. Specific Aim 1: Inspire future physician-scientists to rapidly address
challenges of HIV associated infections and emerging epidemics. Specific Aim 2: Train future
physician-scientists. Over the course of four years, medical students will complete coursework
leading to a Master in Science degree. Specific Aim 3: Support future physician-scientists. All
scholars will have access to resources to develop an independent research proposal. Support
in clinical research tools, biostatistics, analysis, abstract development, and manuscript
preparation will be provided through tailored coursework and program faculty, staff, and
mentors, and funds will be available for scholars and program faculty and mentors to attend
appropriate scientific conferences.
Specific Aim 4: Retain the community of scholars throughout training. All aspects of the
program will be evaluated on an ongoing basis in order to determine acceptability, relevance,
and value of each component of the training program. Outcomes of interest include research
project development and completion, abstract presentation and manuscript publication, and
long-term engagement in clinical research related to emerging infectious disease."
10903736,"The pathophysiology of many diseases that are common in the Veteran population such as diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, asthma, and the metabolic syndrome is
thought to be due in part to a “leaky gut”, an impairment of small intestinal barrier function that facilitates the
entrance of luminal microbial-derived toxins into the systemic circulation. Specifically, many of the
morbidities associated with obesity, which affects 35% of the US population and a much great percentage
of the Veteran population, are related to “metabolic endotoxemia”, a condition in which elevated
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels are present in the circulation, attributed to increased intestinal paracellular
permeability.
Increased circulating LPS has been implicated in the activation of inflammatory pathways, which in turn
have been associated with many of the metabolic derangements characteristic of obesity, including insulin
resistance and excess hepatic and adipose lipid storage, leading to serious clinical morbidity such as type II
diabetes and cirrhosis. LPS entering the portal vein is a component of the “gut liver axis” implicated in the
pathogenesis the aforementioned diseases associated with metabolic endotoxemia.
The mechanism by which LPS enters the systemic circulation, though attributed to increased paracellular
permeability, is primarily based on the association between small intestinal paracellular permeability to
small solutes and endotoxemia. As plausible and attractive as is this hypothesis, there are few direct studies
of intestinal LPS absorption; the few studies available, including those from our laboratory, support that LPS
is cotrancytosed with luminal lipids via three transcellular pathways, the chylomicron pathway that absorbs
long-chain triglycerides (LCT) into the lymphatics, and two transcellular endocytic pathways that absorbs
LPS into the portal vein (PV) by clathrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These latter pathways
support the mechanism whereby LPS enters the PV as part of the “gut-liver axis”, that links the gut
microbiome with hepatic and systemic inflammation.
Certain dietary lipids are considered to be either anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory. For example, the
ingestion of long-chain saturated fatty acids are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as the
metabolic syndrome whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that often accompany the “Mediterranean
diet” are believed to be anti-inflammatory. The highly expressed ecto-enzyme intestinal alkaline
phosphatase (IAP) is released into the circulation following a fat meal. Since IAP detoxifies LPS, we
propose to study which lipids maximally release IAP into the portal vein, detoxifying LPS, in order to help
understand why certain dietary lipids are anti-inflammatory.
Building on our prior studies, we plan to study the mechanisms by which enterocytes cotrancytose luminal
lipids and LPS by using mouse models in which the endocytic protein caveolin has been deleted. This
model will be used to study the relation between lipid structure and transcytotic pathway to test the
hypothesis that the LPS uptake pathways is determined by the co-transcytosed lipid and that pathways are
either pro or anti-inflammatory based on their ability to mobilize detoxifying IAP. We will examine the uptake
in the presence of lipids of varying structure, will study the inhibition of intestinal active glucose transport by
certain lipids, and finally study the effect of dietary supplementation with lipids of varying structure on the
induction of the metabolic syndrome. Through these studies we hope to gain a deeper understanding of
LPS uptake mechanisms that we hope can be used to discover interventions that impair LPS uptake
chronically or acutely with the hope of treating and preventing diseases associated with the “leaky gut”."

The significance of the public health crisis presented by the epidemic in opioid abuse is abundantly clear.
There is a desperate need to develop therapeutics for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), and also to
develop pain treatments that are non-addictive. Both of these goals will be served by high-throughput models
amenable to drug screening, based on the use of human cells, that recapitulate features of the neurobiology
underlying the addictive process. The model we propose to develop focuses on a key component of addictive
circuitry – the dopaminergic and Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid (GABA)ergic neurons of the midbrain, long
recognized as responsible for mediating the reinforcing properties of many classes of abused drugs, including
opioids. We will develop multi-organ, microphysiological systems (MPSs) based on the use of human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain-fated dopamine (DA)/ GABA neurons on a three-dimensional
platform that incorporates microglia, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and liver metabolism components. RNA
sequencing (RNAseq) and metabolomics analyses will complement the primary DA release measure to identify
novel mechanisms contributing to chronic opioid-induced plasticity in DA responsiveness thought to underlie 1)
the anhedonia characteristic of opioid withdrawal; 2) the negative affective component of chronic pain states;
3) craving and relapse. The chronic pain-relevant aspect of the model will be realized by examination of
aversive kappa-mediated opioid effects on DA transmission in addition to the commonly abused mu opioid
receptor agonists, and by incorporation of inflammatory-mediating microglia into the model. The incorporation
of BBB and liver metabolism modules into the MPS platform will permit screening of drugs in the UH3 phase of
the project that accounts for different routes of abused opioid administration and the bioavailability of potential
therapeutic drugs, increasing translatability. Throughput will be increased by the integration of online sensors
into the MPS for online detection of DA and other key analytes identified in the UG3 phase of the project. For
addiction-treatment screening we will use a curated set of 100 chemical genomics probes from our UCLA
kinase inhibitor library. The focus on kinases is based on their well-described role in plasticity, and will cover
activities along the BDNF signaling pathway, mTORC2, mTORC1, AKT and other targets along the BDNF axis.
Our selection of compounds/targets in this context will also be informed by the RNAseq and metabolomics
results from the UG3 phase and we will supplement other drugs if needed from UCLA’s Molecular Screening
Shared Resource chemical genomics libraries, which is over 3k probes strong. Although not proposed here, it
is also important to point out that the MoC device could also be used to test the abuse liability of novel
antinociceptive agents identified by other screening tools. With an interdisciplinary team of scientists and
engineers, this proposal will build upon recent advances in organ-on-a-chip and iPSC technologies to create
innovative MPSs with high potential to have significant clinical impacts in the future."

I am a clinical psychologist interested in understanding the role of environmental exposures in neuro-endocrine
development. The goal of this proposal is to receive training to acquire the skills needed to continue my
academic career by examining the role of child fluoride exposure in sleep patterns and melatonin production.
In this proposal, I plan to train with an expert mentoring team with transdisciplinary expertise covering
exposure biology, sleep disorders, toxicology, epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, I will train in 1)
exposure science with Dr. Manish Arora 2) clinical sleep research with Dr. Michael Thorpy, and 3) toxicology
with Dr. Robert Wright. I will also acquire expertise in epidemiology and the epidemiological assessment of
pediatric sleep with Drs. Rosalind Wright, Emily Oken and Kristie Ross, as well as biostatistics with Dr. Chris
Gennings. The proposed formal coursework and training with my mentors, advisors and collaborators will
enable me to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to become an independent transdisciplinary
researcher. Further, it will enable me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an environmental
health scientist investigating the role of environmental toxicants in sleep and neuro-endocrine development.
I propose to leverage biospecimens and collected measures, including urine, saliva, Actigraphy data, and self-
reported daytime fatigue from an existent prospective birth cohort, the Programming Research in Obesity,
Growth Environment and Social Stress study. I also aim to conduct an in-depth clinical study examining
associations of urine fluoride with gold standard measures of sleep among adolescents. This work will address
the following aims: 1.) Determine whether childhood urinary fluoride concentrations (CUF) at 4-5 and 6-7 years
predict sleep and wake time, sleep duration and sleep efficiency (measured via accelerometry) and daytime
fatigue (measured via a validated self-report questionnaire) at later ages; 2.) Examine whether salivary
melatonin rhythms at 6-7 years mediate the association between CUF and sleep patterns/daytime fatigue
among children as assessed in Aim 1; 3.) Determine whether urinary fluoride levels are associated with
physiological sleep parameters and symptoms of sleep apnea among adolescents assessed at the Sleep-
Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center.
The proposed research represents the first study to examine whether early childhood fluoride exposure
predicts changes in childhood sleep patterns, daytime fatigue or melatonin rhythms. As such, it will advance
the field of pediatric sleep research by providing valuable information regarding a modifiable potential risk
factor for pediatric sleep disturbances. It will also help to inform titration of the appropriate dose of fluoride to
maximize dental health efficacy and minimize risk. I will conduct this study in a cost-effective manner by
levering available resources from a previously funded cohort. Lastly, I will translate the research and training in
this proposal to position myself as an independent investigator with a tenure track faculty position."
10895436,"Abstract
Adaptive control of behavior is critical for survival. Even a simple movement, like extending the arm, requires
the activation of many neuronal populations across the nervous system. Our lab has used a combination of
anatomical, genetic, optical and behavioral approaches to unravel how animals move, and learn to control
movement. However, adaptive responses are not effected only through muscles, but also through other
organs. For example, planning to pick an apple will trigger not only muscle activity but also the expectation
of food, and the conditioned release of insulin. Hence adaptive behavior requires the coordination of an
organism's actions with its physiological internal states. We propose to leverage our expertise to dissect the
neural circuits and principles governing the learning and adaptive “motor” control of internal organ function.
We will spearhead this new research direction by investigating conditioned insulin release and conditioned
immunosuppression, mediated by the innervation of the pancreas and spleen, respectively. We will leverage
state of the art viral and RNA-seq approaches to map with high-resolution the first, second and third-order
innervation of spleen and pancreas. Our preliminary anatomical mapping of the innervation of these organs
revealed that different populations of celiac-mesenteric ganglia sympathetic neurons innervate pancreas
versus spleen. Remarkably, most innervation of the thoracic preganglionic spinal cord targeting these organs
emerges from the cortex: motor cortex, but also sensory and prefrontal. We therefore hypothesize that
learning to select the appropriate responses in internal organs after conditioning is mediated by higher-order
brain circuits, and follows principles similar to those used for motor responses. We propose to use both
targeted and unbiased approaches to identify and manipulate the activity of descending neural populations
responsible for the learned control of spleen and pancreatic function. This new line of research is innovative
but trackable with our expertise, and the Pioneer award support will help us attack this novel research area.
Importantly, the proposed research has the potential to conceptually position the nervous system as a “smart”
regulator of organism homeostasis, and hence impact health in unexpected ways - mental disorders like
anxiety and depression, or neurological problems like stroke, are associated with abnormal physiological
states likely emerging from these brain-internal organ interactions."

10876924,"Previous studies showed that blast-exposed and traumatic brain injury (TBI) Veterans had normal hearing
thresholds but exhibited auditory synaptopathy, including central auditory processing deficits and subclinical
levels of hearing dysfunction. In the peripheral auditory system, cochlear synaptopathy is the degeneration of
inner hair cell synapses in the presence of nearly normal audiometric measurements and hair cells, which has
been reported in age-related and noise-induced hearing loss rodent models. Knowledge of central auditory
synaptopathy, however, remains very limited. Currently, the molecular mechanism critical for central auditory
synaptopathy has not been determined, which restricts the understanding of central auditory synaptopathy and
the development of specific treatment methods. Therefore, there is a critical need to study central auditory
synapse and synaptopathy. In this proposal, spiral ganglion neuron-cochlear nucleus (SGN-CN) synapse will be
investigated, as the SGN-CN synapse is the first central auditory relay that receives signals from the inner ear.
Without functional SGN-CN synapses, auditory signals cannot be efficiently transferred to the brain. The
objectives of this proposal are to understand the molecular mechanism critical for SGN-CN synapse integrity
and develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat SGN-CN synaptopathy. Progranulin is a secreted glycoprotein
that is associated with a variety of neuronal activities, including neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, synapse
formation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. The role of Progranulin in auditory synapses has not
been reported. Our preliminary data suggest the relationship between Progranulin and SGN-CN synapses.
Based on previous and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Progranulin may regulate mouse SGN-CN
synapse integrity. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize SGN-CN synaptopathy in the Grn-/- mouse model
and determine the extent to which Progranulin plays a role in young adult mouse SGN-CN synapse integrity
(Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which Progranulin rescues the structure and function of SCN-
CN synaptopathy. The results of this proposal will significantly advance knowledge in the integrity and
regeneration of auditory synapses, which is a largely understudied VA rehabilitation research area. If cochlear
synaptopathy is found in the Grn-/- mouse in this proposal, we will further characterize the role of Grn in cochlear
synaptopathy and determine whether Grn-/- mouse SGN-CN synaptopathy is primary, secondary, or mixed in our
future proposals. Additionally, we will investigate the role of Grn in age-related and noise-induced auditory
synaptopathy. Outcome of these studies will unravel the molecular mechanisms critical for auditory synaptopathy
and open new avenues to develop specific strategies for the treatment of auditory synaptopathy."
10911055,"Abstract
Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction have been associated with the
pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), either as a primary cause or as a secondary component of the
pathogenic process. AD, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by the
accumulation of intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques. The main component
of the plaque core is the amyloid β (Aβ)-peptide. Longitudinal studies have shown that the appearance of plaques
and tangles, together with markers of inflammation, starts decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. Some
components of the inflammatory response may promote resolution and facilitate Aβ clearance, while sustained
inflammation induces neurotoxicity. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) have recently emerged as key
regulators of cell metabolism and inflammation. They control the intracellular transport of lipids that function as
both, ligands for transcription factors and substrates for enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. In AD and other
pathological conditions, astrocytes upregulate FABP7 expression. This increase in FABP7 expression has been
linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Accordingly, FABP7 is especially abundant in astrocytes that are rich in
cytoplasmic granules originated from degraded mitochondria. Our preliminary data indicate that FABP7
participates in the development of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human astrocytes, while down-regulation of
FABP7 reduces the expression of inflammatory markers. FABP7 regulates the inflammatory response at least
through 2 different mechanisms that have been independently pursued as therapeutic targets in AD. These
include the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and the regulation of
arachidonic acid metabolism by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This suggests that FABP7 could function as a key
regulator of the inflammatory response in astrocytes and constitutes a potential therapeutic target in AD. By
simultaneously regulating two central components of the inflammatory response, targeting FABP7 may confer
enhanced therapeutic efficacy over conventional anti-inflammatory therapies. On the aforementioned context,
we will determine the mechanism by which FABP7 regulates the inflammatory response in astrocytes (Aim 1)
and we will determine the therapeutic potential of targeting FABP7 in AD mouse models (Aim 2). Lastly in Aim 3
we will evaluate the extent to which FABP7 expression correlates with biomarkers of AD pathology and the rate
of cognitive decline in human subjects. This proposal will contribute to the understanding of the role of FABP7
in neurodegeneration and will provide in vivo proof of the value of modulating FABP7 expression as a therapeutic
target in AD."
10701140,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability in adult humans including
service personnel and veterans. TBI promotes significant motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction.
The effects of TBI in surviving veterans can often be seen for decades after the initial injury. However, there
is no efficacious therapy to prevent post-TBI secondary brain damage and neurologic deficits.
Vitamin C (ascorbate) is highly concentrated in brain and known to promote neuroprotection after acute and
chronic CNS insults. However, its efficacy in TBI was not yet tested comprehensively. In preliminary studies,
we observed that ascorbate treatment reduces secondary brain damage and promotes better motor and
cognitive functional outcome in adult mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI)- induced TBI. Based
on this, we will test the hypothesis “ascorbate treatment is neuroprotective after TBI.”
Epigenetic changes are known to significantly influence the gene expression and outcome after many
diseases. Of particular interest, cytosine in DNA undergoes methylation to form 5-methylcytosine (5mC) which
is a transcriptional silencer. 5mC will be oxidized by TET hydroxylases to form 5- hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) which is a transcriptional derepression mark that increases cell survival under adverse conditions. In
particular, brain contains ~10 fold higher 5hmC levels than other organs of the body. Preliminary studies
showed that that ascorbate treatment enhances cerebral TET activity and 5hmC levels after TBI. Hence, we
further hypothesize that “the mechanism of ascorbate-induced neuroprotection after TBI is by the epigenetic
modulation of 5hmC.”
Aim 1: To test the neuroprotective potential of ascorbate after TBI. For any drug to be translated
clinically after TBI, robust preclinical testing that includes, but not limited to, a window of therapeutic
opportunity, long-term outcomes, efficacy in both sexes using a mouse CCI injury model that is rigorously
established in our lab.
Aim 2: To evaluate if DNA hydroxymethylation is mechanistically responsible for ascorbate
neuroprotection after TBI. Understanding the mechanisms of a drug actions help fine tune the therapy as
needed. Based on established work and preliminary data, we will test the functional significance of 5hmC in
post-TBI pathophysiology by knockdown of TET/5hmC together with ascorbate treatment. Genomic sites
where 5hmC is increased by ascorbate treatment after TBI will be mapped by hMeDIP- seq following TET
knockdown. This profiling will show the ascorbate-induced (TET-dependent) gene expression that helps to
understand the downstream effects of ascorbate protection. We will then analyze the effect of ascorbate
therapy on post-TBI gene expression (RNA-seq) in both male and female mice.
Overall, the present project will help us to identify if ascorbate minimizes secondary brain damage and
neurologic dysfunction after TBI by modulating the neuroprotective epigenetic modification 5hmC after TBI.
Relevance of the proposed work to the VA patient care mission: Every year, thousands of service personnel
will suffer TBI and many of those who survive struggle with long-term functional deficits. The negative impact
of this devastating condition on veterans is enormous for the families as well as society in terms of financial
loss and quality of life. Successful completion of the proposed studies to identify a drug that leads to better
recovery of functions in surviving TBI sufferers will be enormously helpful to veterans."
10907517,"Project Summary
 Problems with function in the lower urinary tract (LUT) are remarkably common: in adults
over 40, up to 70% of all survey respondents report LUT pathologies. This is in part because the
physiology of urination (micturition) is complex: it requires smooth muscle in the bladder and
urethra to be coordinated with activity in the voluntary, striated muscle of the urethral sphincter.
Seven peripheral reflexes enable this coordination, and all of these arise from mechanical cues
in the bladder (i.e. bladder stretch) or in the urethra (i.e. urethral fluid flow or distension).
Remarkably, we do not know the identity of the molecules or exactly which cell types sense these
mechanical forces. For example, two cell types, sensory neurons that innervate the LUT and the
urothelial cells in the bladder, are proposed to contribute to these reflexes. Therefore, the details
of how these reflexes are initiated and integrated in the system remain poorly understood.
 I hypothesize that the mechanosensory ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 mediate
mechanosensing in the lower urinary tract. I will use bladder-pressure recordings in combination
with electromyography to characterize micturition reflexes, as well as histology and behavior to
characterize the expression and the functional role of PIEZOs in urination, specifically as they
function in the urothelial cells. I will also test the role of PIEZOs in mediating bladder
accommodation responses to fluid filling, as well as their role in mediating pain during pathological
conditions like cystitis. Together, these results will delineate the contribution of the
mechanotransduction ion channels, specific cell types and peripheral circuitry that facilitate
urination. Understanding these processes is an important first step to alleviate the enormous
burden of LUT pathologies in humans."
10701532,"Recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a devastating
diagnosis and is largely incurable even with maximal therapy. Despite the recent FDA approval
of immunotherapy drugs targeting the PD-1/PDL-1 axis, response rates in HNSCC patients are
less than 20% with durable responses in less than 5% of patients. Therefore, there is a pressing
need for novel treatment modalities that target tumor cell defenses and work synergistically with
existing treatment modalities to improve patient outcomes.
Analyses of large genomic libraries have highlighted that dysregulation of the NRF2 oxidative
stress pathway occurs in up to 40% of HNSCC tumors indicating a central role of this pathway
in HNSCC tumorigenesis. This pathway is responsible for maintaining cellular reduction-
oxidation balance and preventing toxin/carcinogen/inflammation induced cellular damage. In
cancer cells, constitutive activation of this pathway induces activation of over 200 antioxidant-
response element (ARE)- related cytoprotective genes that support rapid cell growth and
proliferation in hypoxic, nutrient-depleted environments. NRF2 activation confers a survival
advantage to tumor cells and is associated with immune evasion, treatment resistance, and
worse clinical outcomes. However, no preclinical models of NRF2-active head and neck cancer
exist and, therefore, mechanistic studies to understand this clinical phenotype are lacking.
Our lab conducted a chemical screen of over 35,000 FDA-approved drugs to identify inhibitors
of the NRF2 pathway. We discovered that the antiplasmodial drug, pyrimethamine(PYR),
effectively inhibited NRF2 pathway activation including downstream effector proteins through its
inhibition of DHFR. We are also investigating two DHFR inhibitors, methotrexate and a novel
PYR analog, WCDD115, which are highly potent inhibitors of NRF2 activity. Neither drug has
been studied in selective NRF2-active tumors previously.
The objectives of this study are to 1) Characterize the downstream effects of constitutive NRF2
activation on ARE gene activation, tumor growth, and immune cell infiltration and 2) Evaluate
the anti-tumor activity of pyrimethamine and methotrexate on the NRF2 pathway and as a
sensitizer to anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade.
We will utilize engineered mouse head and neck cancer models to characterize the molecular
and biologic phenotype associated with NRF2 pathway activation. We will perform targeted
proteomics, transcriptomics and flow cytometry to interrogate the immune microenvironment
and NRF2 pathway activity. We will then evaluate if DHFR inhibition reverses this NRF2-
mediated biology and induces a more favorable microenvironment to support anti-PD1
inhibition. If successful, we anticipate that this novel treatment approach would lend itself well to
an early phase clinical trial. Given the prevalence of head and neck cancer, especially in the VA
Health Care System, and the poor response rates to immunotherapy currently, the ability to
target the NRF2 pathway and increase response rates could provide tremendous upside to
veterans suffering from this disease."
10932887,"There is a critical need to identify mechanisms whereby abnormally regulated lncRNAs in macrophages drive
progression of GBM and ways to target these lncRNAs preclinically. Our long-term goal is to accelerate the
development of immune therapeutics targeting dysregulated lncRNAs to improve outcomes of GBM patients.
Our overall objective for this application is to establish a delivery platform targeting novel GBM-specific
lncRNAs that promote tumor progression. Our central hypothesis is that overexpression of lncRNAs in TAMs
promote GBM tumor progression and immune suppression and are targetable with nanoparticles. The rationale
for the proposed research is that evidence of nanoparticle-based targeting of dysregulated GBM-specific
lncRNAs will provide new opportunities for the continued development of novel treatment strategies focused on
inhibiting TAM-mediated immune suppression. Aim 1: Identify candidate lncRNAs mediating GBM
progression. Our approach will be to perform deep bulk RNASeq of CD14+ cell subsets sorted from single
cell suspensions of fresh GBM tissue and compare these to the peripheral blood of GBM patients and normal
controls to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs, then use bioinformatic tools to choose lncRNAs that are
likely to contribute to GBM immune suppression. Our working hypothesis is that TAMs overexpress lncRNAs
associated with promotion of immune suppression in GBM beyond those identified from PBMCs alone. Aim 2.
Determine the effect(s) of candidate lncRNA depletion on TAM phenotype and function. Our approach
will be to deplete candidate lncRNAs in monocytes using siRNA. We will functionally characterize the response
to depletion of these lncRNAs and begin mechanistic characterization of novel lncRNAs from Aim 1. Our
working hypothesis is that depleting target lncRNAs will change the phenotype and function of these cells,
making them resistant to M2-like polarization by IL-4 and IL-13, maintaining a more immune-stimulating state.
Aim 3. Develop lncRNA targeted theranostic nanoparticles for lncRNA depletion in TAMs. Our approach
will be to further develop MRI trackable nanoparticles for depletion of our preliminary target lncRNAs and any
lncRNAs identified in Aim 1 in our genetically engineered murine model of GBM. Our working hypothesis is that
our nanoparticles will deplete M2-like TAMs in the murine tumors and improve survival in this model. Our
contribution here is expected to be the identification of novel lncRNAs with functional relevance in GBM TAMs
and a translational platform for their delivery in murine models of GBM. These contributions will be significant
because they are expected to represent an important next step toward future development and clinical trials of
novel immune therapeutics for patients with this devastating brain cancer. The proposed research is
innovative, in our opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on
discovery of immune-related lncRNAs that have been identified from GBM patient myeloid cells and by using
nanoparticles to modulate the immune system by targeting these lncRNAs."
10918069,"ABSTRACT
This is a renewal application of a program investigating the role of sensory nerves in bone. Our studies
during the first funding period demonstrate that NGF-dependent TrkA signaling by sensory nerves is the
primary driver of angiogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing femur and skull. In these avascular
settings, acute up-regulation of NGF in mesenchymal lineage cell domains is followed by nociceptive fiber
ingrowth, which subsequently home to locations of proliferating mesenchymal cells. Blockade of sensory
nerve ingrowth, either by inhibition of TrkA signaling or disruption of NGF, retards vascularization and
disrupts femoral and calvarial bone formation. Histological data in the calvaria model revealed that loss
of sensory nerve fibers is associated with reduced numbers of proliferating mesenchymal progenitor cells
(MPCs) in the sutures and premature suture closure. These observations suggest a paradigm in which
sensory nerves function in developing bone to maintain MPC plasticity, a concept well established in
models of limb regeneration and supported by recent studies in developing mouse femur. Our preliminary
findings directly examining the interaction of sensory nerve axons with MPCs in microfluidic chambers
suggest that infiltrating DRG nerve fibers induce MPC proliferation, but limit differentiation in a non-contact
dependent fashion. These effects appear to be mediated by neural derived FSTL1, which induces MPC
proliferation and impairs BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation. Together, this data support the premise
that TrkA+ sensory nerves function in developing bone to maintain stem cells in a proliferative,
undifferentiated state by delivering soluble factors that activate mitogenic and anti-differentiation
signaling pathways.
This conceptual model will be explored in studies divided into two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will define the
spatiotemporal patterning of TrkA+ skeletal sensory nerves in the developing cranium, determine their
influence on MPC proliferation and cellular fate, and further elucidate signaling pathways associated with
impaired innervation. Specific Aim 2 will identify sensory axon-derived factors that regulate MPC proliferation
and cell fate decisions, and definitively identifying FSTL1 as a neural-derived factor which impacts MPC
cellular behavior. Our results should provide new insights into the fundamental roles sensory nerves play in
skeletal morphogenesis, homeostasis and repair, and provide critical insight into the neuropathological
manifestations associated with bone disorders in humans."

 The long-term objective of this proposal is to further develop a photochemical signal amplification method
(PSAM) for increasing the sensitivity of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for
determination of biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
Immunoenzymatic methods such as ELISA are widely used in biology and medicine for drug screening, for
detecting viruses (including coronaviruses), bacteria, and biomarkers, particularly cytokines and interleukins for
cancer and immunological disorders, and biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. They are routinely used
in manual, semi-automated, and automated systems where high volumes of tests are performed. However, in
many cases the sensitivity of ELISA is inadequate.
 Some of the key biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD include three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers:
amyloid ß-42 (Aß-42), which causes formation of oligomeric plaques, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau
(p-tau) (which increases intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). To date, there is no sensitive and cost-
effective method for the quantification of these three proteins, hindering the diagnosis and progression
monitoring of AD.
 Existing highly sensitive methods are cumbersome and expensive. Therefore, there is an increased
necessity for a common ELISA platform to detect low levels of Aß-42, t-tau, p-tau and other biomarkers for
various neurodegenerative diseases that is both inexpensive and simple enough to not require specialized
laboratory equipment. In our Phase II project, we propose to further develop a very sensitive and inexpensive
immunoassay platform for detection of biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, we will
1) design and manufacture a pre-production PSAM illumination device; 2) design and develop a PSAM detection
system kit, ELISA + PSAM kits for detection of Aß-42, t-tau, p-tau, BDNF and proBDNF; 3) conduct extensive
performance evaluation studies towards Research Use Only applications of the PSAM products."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe inherited blood disorder that leads to frequent acute and costly long-term
complications. Hydroxyurea is the primary SCD modifying medication in childhood because studies show that it
can reduce acute complications and mitigate costly long-term comorbidities. Hydroxyurea non-adherence is
common, however, and a key reason for the limited impact that it has had on the outcomes of youth in clinical
practice. Despite the impact that improving hydroxyurea adherence among children and adolescents could
have on reducing SCD burden, studies testing adherence-promoting interventions for youth are lacking. Video
directly observed therapy (VDOT) is an electronic hydroxyurea adherence-promoting strategy delivered using
smartphones and includes reminder alerts, video directly observed therapy by trained observers, encouraging
adherence feedback from the observers, and monetary incentives for achieving adherence goals. VDOT has
been tested in a single-arm study and showed promising results. Yet, attrition was higher than anticipated due
to some dissatisfaction with the previous email platform that was used to deliver VDOT and many participants
having inconsistent personal smartphone and cellular data access. Engagement with VDOT was not
thoroughly assessed, even though the degree of engagement with VDOT has potential to moderate the impact
of the intervention. Aspects of the previous study, including the method used to measure adherence and the
non-randomized design also limited the ability to definitively conclude that VDOT improves adherence. Finally,
the adherence decline that was observed after VDOT was discontinued without any additional adherence
support suggested that additional monitoring and intervention after intensive VDOT may be needed to promote
lasting adherence behavior change. This feedback and experience prompted us to partner with emocha
Health. This is a small business that has a user-friendly VDOT platform, experience successfully providing
VDOT to other chronically ill populations, and an established system to provide intermittent ongoing adherence
to support after VDOT to limit attrition, optimize participant engagement, and sustain adherence. Therefore, the
primary objective of this proposal is to assess retention and sustained engagement during a pilot RCT
comparing VDOT via the emocha Health platform to attention control. We will also explore adolescents’ and
caregivers’ needs and preferences for longer-term adherence monitoring and intervention. This application
aligns with NHLBI’s goal to optimize therapeutic strategies for SCD as it improving adherence is critically
relevant to support life-long healthy behaviors and improve outcomes of these youth."

Motivational interviewing (MI) is a leading evidence-based practice (EBP) for substance use disorder (SUD)
with potential to improve population health. Although disseminated widely, MI fidelity and sustained use remain
low among community providers. Strategies are needed to improve the reach and impact of EBPs in usual
care. Implementation strategies related to improving the organizational context of SUD treatment programs
may lead to improved MI implementation. Improving an organization’s EBP implementation climate, the shared
perception of the importance of EBP implementation within an organization, can promote provider
implementation outcomes. EBP implementation climate is cultivated by program leaders who exhibit behaviors
that support implementation; thus, interventions, such as the Leadership and Organizational Change for
Implementation (LOCI) intervention, are being evaluated for their impact on provider MI implementation
outcomes. A presumed mechanism of LOCI is organizational vertical alignment, which is the extent to which
leaders and staff share perceptions about EBP implementation climate. Vertical alignment between leaders
and providers regarding implementation climate can signal shared views about the importance of the EBP, and
shared views that the structures and processes set in place by leaders facilitate implementation on the front
lines. However, analyses have yet to quantitatively examine this mechanism, with research typically indexing
mean level perceptions of front-line providers, without considering the impact of variation or provider alignment
with leader perceptions. Additionally, it is yet unknown whether vertical alignment is sensitive to change over
time and with exposure to leadership intervention. These data are critical to establishing vertical alignment of
implementation climate perceptions as a potential mechanism of action of implementation strategies.
The objective of this NRSA application is to foster my development as an implementation scientist with a focus
on organizational behavior, leadership, and addiction health services. This proposal leverages data from a
NIDA funded cluster randomized trial that examined the effect of LOCI on implementation leadership and
climate and MI implementation outcomes. The proposed project will examine organizational vertical alignment
of perceived implementation climate as a potential mechanism of action of organizational implementation
strategies. Specifically, Aim #1 will measure vertical alignment in perceived implementation climate among
providers and leaders in SUD treatment clinics implementing MI. Aim #2 will identify clinic characteristics that
are correlated with vertical alignment at baseline. Lastly, Aim #3 will examine longitudinal trajectories of vertical
alignment in perceptions of implementation climate and their associations with MI implementation outcomes.
The present study represents an important step in further understanding mechanisms of implementation
strategies and, with the support of my mentoring team, my development toward a career as an independent
implementation scientist intervening to improve EBP implementation in addiction health service settings."
10910870,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a multifaceted disorder that impacts 11% of American children
and persists into adulthood for roughly 1/3 of those diagnosed. The prevalence of ADHD surged by 42%
between 2003 and 2011, sparking concern about the reliance on subjective diagnoses and treatment with
stimulants. A comprehensive understanding of the neurophysiological basis of ADHD pathophysiology is a
promising way to accelerate the development of objective diagnostic tools and expansion of treatment options.
Current research suggests that disruption of the prefrontal-basal ganglia network that supports inhibitory
control is a key factor in the cognitive (i.e. inattentiveness) and motoric (i.e. hyperactivity) inhibitory deficits
associated with ADHD. This hypothesis is further supported by the relationship between ADHD and diminished
prefrontal beta frequency activity (13-30Hz)- a putative signature of network communication between nodes of
the inhibitory control system. Typical motor inhibition tasks used to study inhibitory control, such as the stop
signal task, require comparing trials in which subjects moved to trials in which they withheld movement (i.e.
comparing going to stopping) to identify neurological substrates of stopping. This comparison confounds
physiological processes involved in motoric inhibition and the cognitive control processes preceding motoric
inhibition. That is, activity underlying suppression of movement cannot be differentiated from that underlying
reaction to a sudden change in environmental demands. Given the potential for these mechanisms to
asymmetrically contribute to different facets of ADHD, the obfuscation of cognitive and motoric aspects of
inhibition is a significant barrier to progress.
To address this gap in knowledge, I developed a novel stop signal task that instructs participants to stop an on-
going movement under conditions in which the stop signal is expected (planned stop) and unexpected
(unplanned stop), providing an opportunity to isolate cognitive and motoric aspects of inhibition. Based on
previous research, my central hypothesis is that I will observe prefrontal beta increases on unplanned
stop trials in which subjects must react to a sudden change in environmental demands, reflecting
cognitive aspects of inhibition, and I will observe beta increases in sensorimotor areas (but not
prefrontal areas) on planned stop trials, reflecting suppression of physical movement. I will leverage my
novel task to test this hypothesis by (1) using scalp electroencephalography to dissociate electrophysiological
signatures associated with cognitive and motoric aspects of inhibition and (2) using intracranial
electroencephalography to identify precise anatomical substrates contributing to cognitive and motoric aspects
of inhibition. The information gained through this research will advance our understanding of the
neurophysiological underpinnings of inhibitory control and pave the way for the potential use of EEG to
diagnose ADHD and to monitor patient response to treatment regimens."
10914861,"Despite improvements of neonatal intensive care over recent decades, hypoxic-ischemic perinatal brain
injury remains a major cause of neurodevelopmental impairment among term and preterm infant, including
motor, behavioral and cognitive deficits. Diagnosis of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities cannot be
accurately made until 2-3 years old. Current state of the art provides no objective functional measures of brain
injury in newborns that predict long term cognitive and behavioral deficits. Clearly there is a need for an early
non-invasive measure that can prognosticate for cognitive problems in later development and provide an
opportunity for early intervention.
 Among few available modalities to assess functional brain development is resting state functional MRI
(rsfMRI). This modality is particularly suited for neonatal and infant studies since it requires minimal subject
cooperation, easy to implement, short in duration, and can be done in natural sleep. However, mechanism and
origins of rsfMRI signal are poorly understood. Emerging cellular mechanisms of microvascular tone regulation
and our preliminary observations suggest that activity of GABAergic interneurons, and not primary neurons,
may play a significant role in early local rsfMRI connectivity. Developmental shift to higher frequencies and
increased amplitudes of rsfMRI BOLD oscillations in this range coincides with the maturation of interneurons in
somatosensory cortexes in early perinatal period. We hypothesized that properties of rsfMRI signal in the
higher range of rsfMRI and local rsfMRI connectivity is largely determined by activity of interneurons and thus
reflect maturation progression of cortical interneurons during normal perinatal development and after injury.
 The overall goals of the proposal are to explore cellular mechanisms of rsfMRI regulation, discover and
validate cell specific information in rsfMRI connectivity that informs us about the state of functional maturation
of cortical interneurons in early postnatal period in rabbit. Using simultaneous recording of neuronal activity,
local tissue oxygen fluctuations during MRI acquisition in Aim 1 we will characterize physiological mechanisms
modulating resting state fMRI signal in rabbit cortex during postnatal development. Role of interneurons will be
explored using pharmacological interventions to selectively block activity of interneurons and and/or pyramidal
neurons. Specific signature of interneuron contribution to rsfMRI signal and local connectivity between
neighboring voxels will be determined during normal postnatal development and applied to predict injury to
interneurons and cognitive abnormalities in Aim 2 in a rabbit model of antenatal hypoxic ischemic injury."
10874416,"Project Summary
GATA3 is a transcription factor that acts as a pioneer factor in breast cancer cells. However, the function of
pioneer factors isn’t well understood. Specifically, how they activate silent chromatin is largely
unknown. The long-term goal is to provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of pioneer factor-
mediated cellular reprogramming at a chromatin level.
More than 7 million GATA3 motifs exist in the human genome, but the experimental data from GATA3 ChIP-
seq analysis indicates less than 1% of the motifs are occupied by the pioneer factor, GATA3. In addition to
binding selectivity, pioneer factor action, including GATA3, is known to be site-specific (context-dependent),
and they can only induce chromatin opening and enhancer formation at a subset of binding sites. The overall
objective of this proposal is to identify the binding specificity of the pioneer factor, GATA3, in the genome and
elucidate the impact of the interaction between GATA3 and chromatin-modification enzyme, Poly ADP-ribose
polymerase 1 (PARP1), on gene activation. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that PARP1 is involved in
such context-dependent action of GATA3. The central hypothesis is that GATA3-mediated cellular
reprogramming is dependent on the PARP1 activity. The rationale for this study is that the identification of
the roles of GATA3 and PARP1 interaction will provide novel molecular mechanisms underlying the site-
specific expression of pioneer factor activities during cellular reprogramming. The central hypothesis will be
tested by (1) investigating the function of PARP1 in the binding selectivity of GATA3 and (2) identifying the
role(s) of GATA3-PARP1 interaction in gene activation. To test this hypothesis, I will use our unique DOX-
inducible system in MDA-MB-231 basal breast cancer cells. In this system, exogenous GATA3 expression
initiates mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). This system recapitulates GATA3 function in patient
breast tumors since GATA3 expression is known to be higher in the luminal/epithelial breast tumors, and is
essential for the maintenance of epithelial phenotypes. Under the first aim, we will investigate changes in
GATA3 binding across the genome in the presence and absence of PARP1. The second aim will utilize next-
generation sequencing to evaluate the effects that GATA3 and PARP1 have on the steps in pioneer factor-
mediated cellular reprogramming. The proposed research is innovative because we are addressing the novel
concept of context-dependent enhancer formation by a pioneer factor during cellular reprogramming.
This research is significant because it will fill a critical gap in our knowledge about how pioneer factors mediate
cell fate transition."
10843764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia among adults. In AF, dysfunctional atrial
cardiomyocytes (aCMs) and fibrosis within the atrial wall result in abnormal impulse generation and disorganized
wave front propagation, preventing a coordinated atrial contraction, ultimately increasing the risk of
thromboembolic stroke and heart failure in patients. Hypertension predisposes patients to AF due to the
increased afterload, or pressure the heart must work against. In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been
shown to be consistently activated in AF patients, however, the mechanism of activation has yet to be explained.
Despite its growing prevalence, AF treatments remain inadequate. Clinically available anticoagulants and
antiarrhythmic drugs have dangerous side effects and fail to address the causal mechanisms of AF, including
the dysfunctional aCMs and fibrosis. Preventative strategies are limited to managing underlying conditions.
Given that AF is progressive in nature, preventing its onset in susceptible patients may yield better outcomes
and significantly improve patient survival. Therefore, we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying electrical
and structural remodeling seen in afterload-induced AF to identify possible upstream targets. The overall
hypothesis is that elevated afterload in the cell-in-gel EHT platform will recapitulate pressure overload
seen in chronic hypertension and heart failure. The increase in afterload on our EHT will activate the
NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in CF activation, pro-fibrotic signaling cascades, and
electrophysiological and structural remodeling seen in AF development. To achieve this, we will utilize a
novel physiologically relevant model of AF. Engineered heart tissue, composed of decellularized human atrial
tissue recellularized with hiPSC derived aCMs and cardiac fibroblasts, will recapitulate the heterogeneity,
complex structure, and functionality of native atrial myocardium. This tissue will be encased within a stiff polyvinyl
alcohol hydrogel that will apply multiaxial stress to it. This will mimic the increased afterload seen in hypertension.
This novel platform will provide the field with a new and relevant in vitro model of human AF. We will observe
AF-like remodeling in loaded control engineered tissue along with an NLRP3-/- tissue. These experiments will
determine the critical roles of afterload and the NLRP3 inflammasome in AF development. This research could
elucidate the steady rise in AF occurrence and actively work to curtail its prevalence."
10923900,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Obesity and eating disorders can present with uncontrolled and compulsive food seeking that is resistant
to negative consequences. The goal of this proposal is to understand how consequences of food seeking actions
are integrated into motivational neural circuits and describe how these circuits are modulated by homeostatic
state. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in the control
of compulsive food seeking behavior. Aversive stimuli can impact the DA system to reduce food seeking, but the
impact of this stimuli is blunted when animals are hungry. Homeostatic circuits, like those downstream of agouti-
related peptide (AGRP) expressing neurons, dampen aversive stimuli by suppressing neural activity in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN). The PBN provides input to the VTA, indicating that hunger may modulate the ability
of aversive stimuli to impact DA signaling and compulsive behavior. I hypothesize that AGRP neurons inhibit the
response of VTA projecting PBN neurons to aversive stimuli, leading to continued food seeking despite negative
consequences. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo neuroimaging of VTA projecting PBN neurons during
aversive stimuli and neurobehavioral analysis of compulsive operant food seeking behavior. In specific Aim 1, I
will use microendoscopic calcium imaging to resolve the neural activity of individual VTA projecting PBN neurons
during footshock, and I will determine how this neural activity changes following stimulation of AGRP neurons.
In specific Aim 2, I will test the necessity of the PBN to VTA circuit in punishment-induced suppression of food
seeking. Additionally, I will test whether activation of AGRP neuron terminals in the PBN is sufficient to increase
food seeking despite negative consequences. Together, these experiments inform on how negative
consequences impact food seeking and how this can be modulated by homeostatic circuits. Understanding this
interaction will provide a novel perspective on compulsive behavior and will identify mechanisms for how
compulsive behavior can develop in disease states where homeostatic circuits are disrupted. Through
completing this proposal, I will gain valuable skills in in vivo neuroimaging and build my expertise in the study of
operant food seeking behavior. These skills will complement my prior expertise, and significantly improve my
ability to address the neural control of food-seeking behavior in my career. These technical skills, along with the
training in research, mentoring, and professional development are necessary to support my success in pursuit
of a career as an independent scientist studying the neurobiology of feeding."
10832686,"It is estimated that approximately 5-10% of all diagnosed cancers are caused by Hereditary Cancer
Syndromes (HCS) that are associated with germline mutations (inherited genetic mutations passed directly
from a parent to a child that create a genetic predisposition to certain types of cancer). Recent epidemiologic
models indicate that 1 in 279 people may be carriers of one of the most common HCS, and advances in genetic
testing continue to identify new inherited mutations. Individuals with an HCS (Previvors) have up to an 80%
lifetime risk of developing cancer and are at an increased risk of developing multiple primary cancers during
their lifetime, often with onset at an early age. Previvors face multiple forms of adversity, including a multitude
of annual cancer screenings and the uncertainty of not only their own health but the health of affected family
members. Previvors also regularly experience “scanxiety” while anticipating, undergoing, and awaiting the
results of screenings. While interventions to promote resilience among Previvors would address an important
unmet public health need, existing solutions have a number of gaps that limit effectiveness, widespread
dissemination, and applicability to Previvors.
 The proposed research will employ a participatory design approach to create and examine the
acceptability and preliminary effects of PREcharge, a resilience-boosting solution specifically designed for
Previvors and delivered primarily via bi-directional text messaging. PREcharge will use proven approaches to
behavior change tailoring to increase resilience by promoting a positive mindset, strong social connections, and
a deep sense of meaning and purpose while also proactively addressing scanxiety. The design and development
of PREcharge will be informed by extensive and ongoing end-user input from 10 Previvor advisors as well as 6
experts in this area. One hundred and twenty-nine Previvors will be recruited for a 30-day pilot test. Phase I
milestones will include: 1) acceptability of the program, as evidenced by overall mean ratings of at least 4 out of
5 on a widely used acceptability measure and obtaining 75% endorsement that users would recommend the
program to a fellow Previvor; (2) engagement as evidenced by continued receipt of text messages and one or
more interactions with the online tools by at least 70% of participants; and (3) benefit from the program,
evidenced by statistically significant pre-post improvement on the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale. Pilot
participants who fail to sustain engagement will be asked to provide feedback on how PREcharge could be
improved. The data from this pilot test will lay the foundation for the further development of tailored text-
messaging solutions to improve resilience outcomes among the expanding population of Previvors. This type of
easily disseminable, potentially cost-effective, and highly tailored solution would overcome the limitations of
existing interventions and provide a framework for messaging on other key behaviors (e.g., health care
provider communication) in the future."

The study of protein/ligand binding is one of the central problems in computational biology because of its
importance in understanding intermolecular interactions, and because of its practical payoff in drug discovery
efforts. The transformative impact accurate target/ligand structure can have in the design of next generation
medicines cannot be overstated. If we could routinely and accurately design molecules using these approaches
it would revolutionize drug discovery by winnowing out compounds with no activity while focusing more effort
and scrutiny on highly active compounds.
In this proposal we describe a novel method we call MovableType (MT) that for the first time will be coupled with
cutting edge enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) methods (e.g., Simulated Tempering, Accelerated MD,
Metadynamics, and Replica exchange MD) in Aims I.1 and II.1a, linear scaling quantum mechanics (for
improved electrostatics) in Aim I.2, and a new Monte Carlo sampling regime called Consecutive Histograms
Monte Carlo (CHMC) in Aim II.1b for increased speed. We expect this development to significantly expand the
domain applicability of MT in particular (and free energy methods in general) to include those situations which
require greater conformational sampling than can be provided by docking alone.
MT addresses the protein ligand binding and scoring problem using fundamental statistical mechanics combined
with a new way to generate the ensemble of a ligand in a protein binding pocket. Via a rapid assembly of the
necessary partition functions, with MT we directly obtain absolute binding free energies and the low free energy
poses (versus most conventional free energy methods in commercial/industrial labs which usually obtain relative
binding free energies). Conceptually, the MT method is analogous to block and type set printing, which allows
us to efficiently evaluate partition functions describing regions or systems of interest. Overall, the MT method is
a general one and can use a broad range of two-body potential functions and can be extended to higher-order
interactions if so desired. Recent work with the MT method has led to the launch of three core product modules:
MTScore (both end state and ensemble-based binding affinity prediction), MTDock (ligand placement), and MTCS
(ligand conformational search). In this project, we will extend our MT product line by optimizing the method for
use with advanced sampling techniques and deliver this methodology to computational chemists for use in their
industrial structure-based drug design campaigns. This work will involve development of a new, integrated tool
for automated structure/model preparation, integration with and optimization for several molecular dynamics
engines, addition an updated electrostatics engine (built on our mature, linear scaling, semi-empirical quantum
mechanics infrastructure), development of a new Monte Carlo method for increased speed, and cloud-based
deployment on the GridMarkets platform (Aim II.2). Finally, in Aim II.3, we will commercially deploy the
technology, construct graphical user interfaces for use in MOE, and validate its use in real life structure-based
drug discovery problems with our pharmaceutical collaborators (see Letters of Support)."

Currently, the Draize live rabbit eye test is the benchmark to distinguish consumer products and materials that
are safe from those that are hazardous and can cause mild, moderate, or severe ocular damage. However,
new laws are currently being, or are planned to be, implemented in California, the United States, and the
European Union to ban the use of animals for ocular irritation testing. Despite this fact, there is currently no
single nonanimal test or combination of nonanimal tests that can accurately classify all levels of ocular irritants
and corrosives. It is of particular concern that all nonanimal tests generally overpredict the least damaging
class of ocular irritants and cannot determine (or determine with low sensitivity) the most extreme class for
which they have sensitivity rates as low as 50%. More importantly, none of the currently validated alternative
tests can detect irritants that require proper safety labeling (GHS Cat. 2A) or those that cause irritation that
lasts up to 21 days but then clears without causing permanent corneal damage. This target classification
represents a critical UNMET NEED for correctly informing and advising consumers and manufacturers about
product safety. We have recently developed and tested a new method, the in vitro depth of injury eye irritation
test (IVD EIT), to detect all classes of irritants with high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this
application is to further develop the IVD EIT with the long-term goal of providing a service and/or kit for the
accurate classification of ocular irritants to meet this UNMET NEED for a nonanimal ocular irritation test to be
used to label product and chemicals and hence ensure safe handling practices.

10884284,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypoxia (O2 deprivation) plays a central role in diverse human diseases, including ischemic stroke, myocardial
infarction, pulmonary hypertension, Cerebral Palsy, COVID-19, and cancer. Metazoans respond to hypoxia by
employing the conserved hypoxia response pathway. The pathway senses O2 through a prolyl hydroxylase
(PHD) enzyme, which uses O2 to hydroxylate specific proline side chains on the Hypoxia Inducible Factor α
(HIFα). Once hydroxylated, HIFα is ubiquitinated by the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase, resulting in
its proteolysis. When O2 is abundant, HIFα is unstable. When hypoxia ensues, PHD enzymes lack O2 to
hydroxylate HIFα, resulting in HIFα stabilization and the transcriptional regulation of multiple target genes that
help the organism survive. Under some circumstances (e.g., solid tumors, stem cell niches), HIFα is activated
despite adequate O2 levels (i.e., the Warburg effect), but how the response differs under aerobic conditions is
unclear. While the HIFα pathway has been well studied in tissue culture, a full understanding of how it
operates in specific tissues (particularly neurons) in vivo to provide tailored responses is needed.
 This proposal takes advantage of genetics and an intact, isogenic model organism (C. elegans) that
can thrive under hypoxia, and whose environment and genetics can be controlled with fidelity and
reproducibility. C. elegans possess single genes for the PHD (EGL-9), the VHL (VHL-1), and the HIFα (HIF-1).
The overall premise of this proposal is that the hypoxia response pathway pathway protects against hypoxic
damage by (1) removing mitochondria through mitophagy, which eliminates a source of ROS, and by (2)
mobilizing antioxidant metabolism, which detoxifies ROS during hypoxia and reoxygenation. A better
understanding of the pathway response will provide therapeutic targets for diseases associated with hypoxia.
 Preliminary ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and metabolomics suggest that HIF-1 promotes gluconeogenesis, the
pentose phosphate pathway, and antioxidant generation. We hypothesize that HIF-1 promotes this metabolic
reprograming by binding an enhancer sequence and activating the expression of the PEP carboxykinase pck-
1, a key enzyme for moving metabolites through gluconeogenesis. Aim 1 tests this hypothesis by using
CRISPR/Cas9 editing to remove this enhancer, then testing for the effects on HIF-1 binding, pck-1 and global
gene expression, metabolism, oxidative stress resistance, neurodegeneration, and hypoxia survival.
 Preliminary cell biological approaches with a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for mitophagy
suggest that HIF-1 promotes mitophagy. We hypothesize that HIF-1 promotes mitophagy by binding
enhancer sequences and activating the expression of the mitophagy receptors fndc-1 and dct-1. Aim 2 tests
this hypothesis by using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to remove these enhancers, then testing for the effects on HIF-
1 binding, global gene expression, mitophagy and bulk autophagy, metabolism, oxidative stress resistance,
neurodegeneration, and hypoxia survival."
10906257,"Each year, at least 1.7 million adults in the US develop sepsis and nearly 270,000 Americans die of

sepsis hospitalization rate and 20% more likely to die of sepsis compared to whites even after adjusting for
co-variates. Close to 45% African American carry at least one APOL1 risk allele. Variants in APOL1 are thought
to have arisen as a result of positive genetic selection, as they confer resistance against Trypanosome brucei
rhodesiense, a parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. While having one risk variant imparts this crucial
resistance against sleeping sickness, having two risk alleles significantly increases the risk of developing kidney

Recent genetic and mouse model studies indicate that APOL1 risk variant (RV) in endothelial cells might
explain the increased sepsis susceptibility and severity in African Americans.

in mice with conditional inducible expression of RV and reference APOL1 in endothelial cells, kidney and liver
cells. B. Examine the association between APOL1 RV genotype and sepsis incidence and severity in the
Upenn (PMBB) and Vanderbilt (BioVU) Biobanks. C. Determine the association of plasma APOL1 level and

11059043,"Left ventricular (LV) remodeling is a summation of cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) events,
which invariably occur following a myocardial infarction (MI) and is an important predictor of clinical
outcomes. Increased inductions of the ECM proteolytic enzymes, the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), occur in the early and late phases of post-MI remodeling. While MMP inhibition remains an
important therapeutic target in the context of post-MI remodeling, systemic delivery of broad spectrum
pharmacologic MMP inhibitors can be associated with adverse events, and these concerns coupled
with difficulties in dosing regimens have hindered clinical progress. During our past performance
period, we have successfully moved the field forward in terms of demonstrating that localized delivery
of a hyaluronic acid based hydrogel (HA-gel) and release of an MMP inhibitory peptide could
effectively attenuate adverse post-MI remodeling. We now propose to further advance the
translational and clinical relevance of these proof of concept studies and “repurpose” MMP inhibitors
that were advanced clinically by overcoming past obstacles regarding systemic delivery and
specificity. Our guiding hypothesis is that using a novel self-assembling HA-gel, which will release a
pharmacological MMP inhibitor selectively into the MI region, will effectively and favorably alter the
course of adverse post-MI remodeling. We will first establish that localized injection of an HA-
gel/MMP inhibitor construct will reduce regional local MMP activity, attenuate post-MI regional
remodeling and fibroblast transdifferentiation, and thereby prevent the progression of LV pump
failure. Next, we will demonstrate that targeted injection of an HA-gel/MMP inhibitor construct will
cause favorable effects on the natural history of post-MI remodeling, whether injected early or late
post-MI. Finally, we will advance the translational relevance of these studies by demonstrating the
beneficial effects of the HA-gel/MMP inhibitor construct using novel delivery methods. These studies
will provide the pivotal pre-clinical information in order to further advance the therapeutic avenue of
localized MMP inhibitory control in order to interrupt the inexorable progression of adverse LV
remodeling post-MI and subsequent heart failure."

Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Criminal Justice version (MISSION-CJ) is a
new case manager and peer delivered team-based treatment for JIVs with a COD. Three recent open pilots of
MISSION-CJ showed reduced criminal recidivism, improved behavioral health outcomes and increased access
and engagement in care. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a critical next step prior to dissemination.
Significance/Impact: This application is responsive to the VHA MISSION Act, Veteran Care Priorities of
Access to Care, Mental Health, and Health Equity. The project aims to (a) increase access and engagement in
VHA and community-based care, (b) offer timely Veteran-centered care, and (c) improve the health and well-
being of JIVs while reducing disparities. It also includes an implementation aim to support VHA learning.
Innovation: While MISSION-CJ derives in part from an evidence-based treatment for homeless individuals
(MISSION), it includes a new conceptual framework and numerous new and differentiating features for a CJ
population including: (1) a treatment planning tool focused on criminogenic needs that monitors progress and
tunes service delivery elements, (2) a prosocial treatment curriculum, and (3) tools/resources to address
Veteran legal issues. With MISSION-CJ, this study attempts to change the practice paradigm and transform
care for JIVs by moving beyond the current model of linking Veterans to VA care and tracking behavioral
health outcomes, to a hybrid treatment/linkage approach that addresses criminogenic needs, supports
engagement in VA and non-VA care, and targets recidivism as an outcome–the gold standard for CJ research.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: An RCT will compare MISSION-CJ to EUC. We predict that those in MISSION-CJ will
have (1a) lower criminal recidivism; (1b) lower overall risk for criminal recidivism; (1c) better health-related
outcomes (substance use, mental health, housing, employment); and (1d) the effects of MISSION-CJ on 1a,
1b and 1c, will be mediated by (i) reductions antisocial attitudes, (ii) reductions in affiliations with antisocial
peers and increases in affiliations with prosocial peers, (iii) greater treatment engagement (i.e., MH RRTP
completion; substance use/mental health continuing care; 12-step group attendance), and (iv) increased
community reintegration. Aim 2: A formative evaluation will identify barriers and facilitators to future
implementation of MISSION-CJ in other MH RRTPs nationally.
Methodology: This project will use a Hybrid Type 1 design. First, we will test the effectiveness of MISSION-
CJ in a two-site RCT (Bedford and Palo Alto VAs) with 226 Veterans with a COD, admitted to an MH RRTP,
and previously arrested and charged and/or released from incarceration in the past 12 months. Next, we will
use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation & Maintenance framework to conduct a formative
evaluation with 7 providers and 12 Veterans at each site to inform future MISSION-CJ implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results of this study, we will work with our VACO operational
partners and two HSR&D Centers of Innovation to conduct a large multisite implementation trial."
11145601,"Background: Among the 146,000 Veterans released from correctional settings annually, approximately 60%
have a co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder (COD). These individuals often access
treatment inconsistently, resulting in increased antisocial activities and acceleration into unemployment and
homelessness – strong predictors of reoffending. VHA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment
Programs (MH RRTPs) commonly serve justice-involved Veterans (JIVs) with an estimated 50% annually. JIVs
receive assistance with their addiction and behavioral health needs, but MH RRTP programs do not directly
address their antisocial behaviors and cognitions. Furthermore, MH RRTP discharge is a vulnerable transition

maintain MH RRTP gains, and ultimately reducing revolving door service use. Maintaining Independence and

10894914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stands out as notable in two respects––in not having a cure and in affecting
women more than men. While declining estrogen has been thought to underpin post–menopausal AD, there is
a clear clinical correlation of AD with rising levels of follicle–stimulating hormone (FSH). Most notably, there is
a ‘spike’ in cognitive decline in women in the early years of the menopausal transition, when serum estrogen is
normal and FSH levels begin to rise. Collaborative studies between the Mount Sinai and Emory groups have
identified FSH as a potential driver for AD—and suggest that rising FSH levels may contribute to the
disproportionate increase of AD in aging women. Notably, we find that FSH receptors (FSHRs) are expressed
in both mouse and human brain, and that the injection of recombinant FSH or ovariectomy (that elevates serum
FSH) aggravates AD pathology and cognitive decline in 3xTg mice. Inhibiting the action of FSH in 3xTg or
APP/PS1 mice by an FSH–blocking antibody or downregulating Fshr expression in the hippocampus prevents
onset of the AD phenotype. The Emory group also provides strong preliminary evidence that FSH upregulates
C/EBPβ, which activates asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a δ–secretase that cleaves amyloid precursor
protein (APP) and Tau––resulting in neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively. The goal of the
transdisciplinary collaboration between the disciplines of endocrinology and neuroscience is to fully
understand the mechanism of FSH action on AD–vulnerable brain regions. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, we will
map the distribution and cellular localization of the FSHR and its signaling partners CEBPB and LGMN in human
and mouse brain using single–transcript technologies. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine the function of the
brain FSHR in driving AD pathology and cognitive decline. For this, we will downregulate or overexpress the
Fshr in specific brain areas of 3xTg mice by stereotaxically injecting AAV expressing siFshr or Fshr. We will also
study the effect of high FSH in 3xTg mice rendered haploinsufficient in Cebpb, and delineate the transcriptomic
architecture of FSH–treated human neuronal cells by RNA–seq. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether
deleting the Fshr or inhibiting FSH action by our murine FSH blocking antibody, Hf2, injected over the lifespan
of 3xTg mice can prevent the onset of cognitive decline. To contemporaneously replicate our data, the Emory
group will study the effect of treating established cognitive impairment with Hf2 in 18–month–old APP knock–in
(KI) mice. In all, our proof–of–concept studies––conducted using our Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)
Platform––should not only establish a role for high FSH in driving AD, but also provide a framework for the future
testing of our humanized FSH–blocking antibody, Hu6, in aging women."

A New Database to Measure the Association Between Income, Race, and Mortality: Inequality in
Longevity During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic
Disparities in health and life expectancy by income are a central challenge for the United States. The highest-
income American men live nearly 15 years longer on average than the lowest-income American men; the
corresponding gap for women is 10 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these disparities by income,
race, and other dimensions. Unfortunately, we currently lack information on how mortality rates due to COVID-
19 vary with individual income, because available U.S. population mortality data lacks information on income.
The absence of this information has hindered our ability to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and develop policies
to mitigate its impacts, particularly on disadvantaged and underserved populations, going forward. This project
will resolve these challenges by constructing a new public database of mortality rates incorporating
socioeconomic and demographic variables and covering the entire U.S. population. Using these data,
researchers will be able to analyze the sources of disparate impacts of COVID-19 on mortality across subgroups,
with the aim of understanding how to reduce health inequality in the pandemic and beyond. The project has
three specific aims. Aim 1 of this project is to release a new public database of mortality rates by age, income,
race/ethnicity, gender and county, and provide recurring annual updates to this database. This database will be
constructed by linking from tax returns, the decennial Census, and Social Security death records. Aim 2 will
characterize the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality rates by race and income in 2020-
21. This analysis will measure the quantity of excess deaths and disparities in their distribution caused by the
pandemic, and identify economic and health mechanisms generating those disparities. Aim 3 will measure the
long-term effects of post-pandemic changes in health, health behaviors, labor income, tax and transfer policies,
and behaviors on racial and socioeconomic inequality in mortality. This broader set of analyses will use the
substantial disruptions generated by the pandemic to examine how and why disparities are growing or shrinking
over time. Taken together, this project will contribute to research and policy work by providing critical new data
on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health, thereby providing a tool to monitor progress in
mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in underserved communities."
10799661,"Virus infections such as HIV/AIDS and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 sicken hundreds of millions of people.
The current multiple pandemics have caused unprecedented levels of stress and other life disruptions,
which exacerbate substance use disorders, increasing side effects of antiviral drugs and interfering with
recovery of individuals suffering from virus infections. Antivirals such as remdesivir, molnupiravir,
ritonavir, nirmatrelvir, tenofovir, and darunavir are commonly used to inhibit replication or cell entry for
HIV and
SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting viral infections. However, some antivirals such as ritonavir of
current regimens, especially in combination with other drugs or substance alcohol use, often induced
liver injuries causing serious complications. Recently, we have found that remdesivir, ritonavir, and
alcohol induce cellular organelle stress, especially endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is well
established not only to cause hepatic cell death but also to compromise immune response leading to a
spectrum of liver diseases in a variety of animal models as well as in human patients. Most recently,
we discovered with next-generation RNA sequencing that a host protease, RCE1 is a potential off-
target of the antiviral drugs. The substrates of RCE1 are limited to a few Rab small GTPase proteins
(Rab proteins) with a CaaX motif, which are consequently reduced in the presence of anti-HIV or anti-
COVID-19 drugs and reduced much more in drug and alcohol combinations. Because the Rab proteins
regulate ER-Golgi trafficking that is essential for cellular organellar homeostasis in the liver, we
hypothesize that the antiviral drugs inhibit the host RCE-Rab proteins and induce organelle stress
responses that leads to fatty liver injury, and alcohol consumption under stress conditions (e.g.,
suffering from COVID-19 or frequent quarantine) worsens the drug-induced liver complications. We
propose to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of the RCE-Rab pathway in the antiviral-induced
organelle stress and explore pharmaceutical and genetic solutions to mitigate the antiviral drug-induced
hepatic injury. Our specific aims are to: (1) validate the mechanistic link of the RCE-Rab pathway with
anti-HIV drug and alcohol-induced organelle stress and liver injury, (2) verify whether emerging anti-
coronavirus drugs and/or alcohol consumption inhibit the RCE-Rab pathway and induce organelle
stress in the liver, (3) explore pharmaceutical and genetic solutions to mitigate the antiviral drug-
induced liver injury via testing prophylactic effects of enhanced expression of Rab proteins that
compensate the consequence of the antiviral-inhibited host protease, and testing effects of unique
enzyme nano-particles that facilitate alcohol removal. Our long-term objectives are to unravel specific
pathogenic mechanisms underlying side effects of antivirals so that to improve/modify current antiviral
drugs for a better care of the AIDS patients suffering from HIV and SARS-CoV-2 virus infections."
10695782,"The Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), mostly a mutant K-Ras driven, in which hypoxia triggers
acidification of extracellular matrix, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/cancer stemness (CSCs),
metastasis, desmoplasia, and chemoresistance. These pathological changes grim the prognosis of the disease.
Thus, EMT/CSCs and desmoplasia must be destructed to improve the prognosis. Emerging evidence indicates
that these processes are disrupted by targeting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) downstream
of the mutant K-Ras-signaling pathway. However, in the clinic, the weak bioavailability and dose-limiting toxicity
reduce ERK inhibitors' efficiency in halting tumor progression. Thus, there is a critical need to develop drug
carriers that selectively target PDAC tissues and suppress the growth of cancer cells via sustained drug release
deep into the tumor. We recently discovered that the efficacy of SCH 772984, an ERK-inhibitor (ERKi), can be
enhanced in systemic delivery if we encapsulated the ERKi in a pH/hypoxic-responsive nanocarrier (pHNPs)
attached with a tumor-penetrating peptide iRGD. Our preliminary studies suggest that ERKi suppresses the
production of CSCs and desmoplastic regulator protein CTGF/CCN2 in pancreatic cancer cells via blocking AP-
1-signaling. Finally, we also found that CTGF blockade by ERKi may participate in tumor fibroblast cell activation,
a hallmark of desmoplastic reaction. Building on these exciting preliminary findings, we propose finding the
optimal variant of ERKi-pHNPs, unraveling the mechanisms of response to ERKi therapy in human and murine
PDAC cell lines, and therapeutic efficacy alone or combined with gemcitabine and/or Nap-paclitaxel using
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. The goal
of the project is to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA with the long-term goal is to
translate this novel therapeutic product to the clinic to treat Veterans.
 We propose three Aims. In Aim 1, we will synthesize different ERKi-pHNPs variants by modifying the
moieties, identifying an optimal variant from them by determining the in vitro and in vivo functional efficacy, and
evaluating the mechanism of action through the in vitro characterization in PDAC cells. In Aim 2, we will
determine the MTD, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of an optimal variant of ERKi-PHNPs in the presence or
absence of chemotherapy in tumor-bearing CDX mice. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the effect of optimal
ERKi- pHNPs and free-GEM in translational studies using KPC and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models
for PC. The effect of Nab-paclitaxel with these combinations will also be tested. To realize these aims, we have
developed stimuli-responsive polymers (Mol. Pharmaceutics 2021, 18, 87−100 ), a unique in vitro desmoplastic
model (Mol Cancer Ther; 18, 2019), standardized non-invasive, high-resolution imaging, and high-thorough put
technologies to unveil various steps of tumor progression and associated molecular markers. We will use these
technologies and the outstanding collective expertise of our multi-disciplinary team to establish that ERKi-pHNPs
therapy is a powerful treatment strategy to target CSCs and desmoplasia and enhance the gemcitabine effect in
aggressive pancreatic cancer."
11194616,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The combination of COVID-19 and alcohol/substance use disorders exacerbates a wide range of existing
problems, including the likelihood of contracting COVID and severity of consequences, pandemic-related
stresses that trigger alcohol and substance use, loss of jobs and healthcare access, increased interpersonal
violence, and overarching systemic inequities. Interventions are needed to address these serious problems,
which are likely to persist even after widespread availability of COVID vaccines.
In response to PAR 20-243, this R01 project is a Hybrid II RCT/implementation study modifying and testing two
of our alcohol smartphone interventions to address the fallout from COVID. We propose a 3-arm RCT
comparing a control vs. a drinker-focused intervention vs. a family-focused intervention. The drinker-focused
intervention (ACHESS-C) is an extension of our evidence-based Addiction–Comprehensive Health
Enhancement Support system (ACHESS), augmented with COVID resources. The family-focused intervention
(FamCHESS-C) combines ACHESS-C services with evidence-based Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy
services to help both drinker and partner with behavior change, relationship problems, and general well-being.
In the proposed 8-month trial plus 4-month follow-up, 198 dyads (drinker + family member) will be randomly
assigned to: 1) Smartphone control: both receive a smartphone with standard support and crisis numbers; 2)
ACHESS-C: drinker receives a phone with ACHESS-C, partner receives a phone with support and crisis
numbers; 3) Fam-CHESS-C: both receive phone with FamCHESS-C. The project has the following aims:
Aim 1: Complete refinements to the FamCHESS-C app.
Aim 2: Conduct a balanced RCT to test the following outcomes: Primary: 1) drinker % heavy drinking days, 2)
dyad quality of life. Secondary: 3) dyad relationship satisfaction, 4) dyad psychological/physical conflict, 5)
drinker no heavy drinking days, 6) drinker % days alcohol/drug use, 7) dyad COVID vaccination rates, 8)
drinker alcohol- and drug-related problems. Exploratory: 9) partner % days alcohol/drug use, 10) dyad crisis
healthcare use, 11) dyad technology satisfaction. We hypothesize that outcomes will be more favorable in
FamCHESS-C relative to ACHESS-C, and both will be more favorable relative to smartphone control.
Aim 3: Examine mediation effects of dyad's competence, relatedness, and motivation; drinker's interim change
in % days of alcohol and drug use, and extent of app use for comparisons of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C.
Examine moderation of effects of condition by drinker sex, severity of drinker’s baseline alcohol use, drinker
engagement in treatment for AUD/SUD, and dyad’s baseline relationship satisfaction.
Aim 4: Conduct a small-scale (20 dyads) formative evaluation using an implementation science model to
collect qualitative data on perceptions of difficulties and benefits of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C use."

The global COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented pressure on health systems and has interrupted
public health efforts for other major health conditions, including HIV. HIV service interruptions in the forms
of redeployment of staff, reallocation of resources, lack of equipment and medicine (e.g., shortages of HIV/STI
testing kits, strained drug supply chain), and reduced access to care (e.g., travel restrictions, lock downs) may
have a profound and long-term impact on HIV treatment cascade outcomes, especially given the evolving
nature of the pandemic. There are several gaps in the existing literature in addressing HIV service
interruptions and their consequences. These gaps include a lack of using large-scale, real-world, multi-type
data with theoretical guidance; the focus on single or limited HIV treatment cascade outcomes; and limited
efforts to identify factors that can mitigate the negative impacts of such interruptions to inform potential
interventions and capacity building at state or local levels. In response to NOT-AI-21-057, we propose to
comprehensively investigate HIV service interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic following a
socioecological model, assess their impacts on various outcomes of the HIV prevention and treatment cascade,
and identify resilience resources for buffering impacts of interruptions on HIV treatment cascade outcomes.
Specifically, we will assess HIV service interruptions in South Carolina (SC) since 2020 using operational
report data of Ryan White HIV clinics, in-depth interview data with clinic leaders and providers, and HIV
service utilization data based on both electronic health records (EHR) and publicly available cellphone-based
HIV clinics visitation data. We will further explore how HIV service interruptions affects HIV prevention and
treatment cascade outcomes at appropriate geospatial units based on the integration of multi-type datasets
(e.g., EHR, geospatial data) from multiple sources. Finally, we will identify institutional-, community-, and
structural-level factors (e.g., resilience resources) that may mitigate the adverse impacts of HIV service
interruptions based on the triangulation of quantitative (EHR data, online survey data) and qualitative (in-
depth interviews, focus group discussion) data regarding health infrastructure, social capital, and
organizational preparedness. Our proposed research can lead to a better understanding of complicated HIV
service interruptions in SC and resilience factors that can mitigate the negative effects of such interruptions on
various HIV treatment cascade outcomes. The multi-level resilience resources identified through data
triangulation will assist SC health departments and communities in developing strategic plans in response to
this evolving pandemic and other future public health emergencies (e.g., monkeypox, disasters caused by
climate change). The research findings can also inform public health policymaking and the practices of other
Deep South states with similar sociocultural contexts and experiences of HIV service interruptions during the
pandemic."
10932129,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the scaling up of evidence-based interventions to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE) in the U.S., several
communities most affected by HIV lag behind the EHE goal of reducing HIV infections by 90% by 2030.
Black/African American (AA) people with HIV (PWH) account for a large proportion of HIV diagnoses in the
U.S. Specifically, AAs represented 42% of all new HIV diagnoses reported in 2019 despite comprising only
13% of the total United States population. Furthermore, AA PWH have poorer outcomes along the entire HIV
care continuum, including a greater number with undiagnosed HIV, poorer linkage to and retention in HIV care,
lower rates of receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), lower ART adherence rates, and lower likelihood of
achieving viral suppression. While AA PWH with strong community cohesion report positive HIV outcomes
(e.g., high ART adherence, viral suppression), in regions where there is low community cohesion among AA
PWH, these individuals may be overlooked, despite the unique experience of having weaker community
cohesion. As such, it is imperative to focus research efforts on investigating psychosocial determinants of
health among AA PWH with low community cohesion. We have shown that high psychosocial resources
(e.g., resilience, personal mastery, social support) positively influences health outcomes such as medication
adherence, and physical and mental health-related quality of life. Nevertheless, these quantitative-based
studies may not account for the unique, individual experiences of AA PWH who lack strong community
cohesion. Assessing the relationships between psychosocial determinants of health, medication adherence, and
healthcare utilization is critical toward identifying AA PWH most at-risk for poor health outcomes. Accordingly, the
proposed F31 project will follow-up on an initial study of AA PWH in order to: 1) Characterize ART adherence
trajectories and their associations with HIV characteristics among AA PWH in an EHE jurisdiction with low AA
community cohesion; 2) Identify modifiable psychosocial determinants of health associated with ART
adherence trajectories among AA PWH in an EHE jurisdiction with low AA community cohesion; and 3)
Explore qualitative relationships between positive modifiable psychosocial determinants of health (e.g.,
resilience), ART adherence, and healthcare utilization among AA PWH in an EHE jurisdiction with low AA
community cohesion. The proposed research will use advanced qualitative and quantitative research methods
to examine these relationships. The opportunities afforded via this F31 mechanism will facilitate the applicant’s
professional development toward becoming an independent investigator dedicated to researching behavioral
medicine topics such as psychosocial determinants of health outcomes among diverse populations."

Alcohol abuse remains a significant cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Yet
only 15% of those with AUD receive treatment. Our group, and others have demonstrated that
contingency management (CM) is an effective approach for reducing alcohol use in problematic

to reduce alcohol use in problematic drinkers. Our goal is to combine mobile technology,
geospatial mapping and biomarker measurement, with individual goal setting and EMA feedback
to launch behavioral modification strategies and progress monitoring. The goal of the system is
to provide a feasible and effective end-to-end CM platform, which can aggregate information to
allow individuals and their clinicians to monitor drinking, reduce alcohol consumption, as well as
better understand factors related to each individual’s alcohol use (e.g., correlations between
mood, location, etc). Importantly, this intervention will be suitable for treatment and naturalistic
settings and require little to no required clinician involvement."
10703740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Stroke-causing illness, disability, and early death is set to double worldwide within the next 15 years. Despite
physical therapy, about 50% of stroke survivors have impaired hand function, which strongly impacts activities
of daily living and independence; novel treatment methods are urgently required. While most pre-clinical research
addressing stroke recovery and rehabilitation focuses on restoring damaged descending movement pathways,
dexterous hand function is also reliant on the brain receiving ascending somatosensory input and being able to
use it to guide movements. Clinically and in animal models, deficits in somatosensory cortices predict worse
recovery of hand function following stroke, though the functional mechanisms by which somatosensory signals
support hand function remain poorly characterized. In this proposal, we aim to uncover how somatosensory
signals drive motor activity during the acquisition and performance of dexterous manipulation behaviors in intact
and post-stroke non-human primates.
 The main experimental approach of this proposal includes simultaneous high-density, high channel-count
acute electrophysiological recordings from the somatosensory thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, and
primary motor cortex in intact and post-stroke non-human primates performing complex manipulation tasks. The
main analytical approach includes modeling motor activity evolution as a combination of intrinsic motor cortical
dynamics and inputs from somatosensory thalamic and somatosensory cortex. The hypothesis of this proposal
is that somatosensory input signals guide the identification of effective motor activity trajectories that become
frequently used and less input-dependent with improved manipulation skill. Thus, somatosensory signals are
critical for improvement of manipulation skill and recovery of dexterity post-stroke. Completion of this proposal
will identify nodes and functional interactions within the sensorimotor system that could be targeted with novel
therapies for improving recovery of hand function following stroke.
 I will complete these aims with the guidance of an exceptional mentoring team led by Dr. Karunesh
Ganguly and including Dr. Joni Wallis, Dr. Robert Morecraft, and Dr. Aaron Suminski. During the mentored phase
of the award at UCSF, I will develop a state-of-the-art high channel-count, multi-area electrophysiological
approach for monitoring the sensorimotor network. I will also conduct the proposed experiments in animals
performing object manipulation tasks, pilot a haptic brain-machine-interface task, and focus on professional
development in order to facilitate a successful transition into an independent faculty position at an academic
institution."
10903725,"This Collaborative Merit Award application (CMA), consisting of three projects (CMA1-3), addresses a critical
challenge in the clinical management of ovarian cancer (OC). The most common and lethal subtype of OC is
high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Standard treatment for HGSOC combines surgical
cytoreduction with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients diagnosed with HGSOC often suffer from disease
relapse associated with the emergence of chemotherapy resistance. The clinically needed key to increasing
survival in HGSOC is to prevent the development of platinum resistance or identify alternative means of targeting
platinum resistant (PtR) tumors. The main goal of this interdisciplinary and collaborative project is to identify
novel targets and biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy for HGSOC. This requires a better understanding of the
mechanisms that results in transformation of HGSOC cells to an aggressive, therapy-resistant phenotype.
Increasing evidence support the hypothesis that a key contributor to platinum resistance is the reprogramming
of cancer cells into a less differentiated and metabolically adaptable state. This collaborative proposal by three
established OC researchers will leverage their interdisciplinary expertise and resources to define new
mechanisms of resistance in OC. CMA1 will use spatial profiling and systems biology to provide a holistic
understanding of PtR as well as prioritize cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental clinically relevant underlying
molecular pathways. Preclinical immunocompetent mouse models and co-culture models will be used to study
the role of the tumor microenvironment in PtR. CMA2 will study metabolic adaptation associated with the
emergence of PtR focusing on a shift to fatty acid oxidation in PtR HGSOC tumors CMA2 will use resources
shared with CMA1&3 and cellular biology and single cell metabolic imaging to define unique metabolic
dependencies of PtR HGSOC. As PtR tumors are susceptible to death induced by oxidized lipid membranes,
mechanisms of ferroptosis will be examined in PtR models treated with novel metabolism targeting agents, which
will be tested with CMA1. CMA3 will explore the reprogramming of recurrent HGSOC cells into more tumor
subpopulations with neuroendocrine (NE)-like features. Mounting evidence in other tumors suggest progression
to a NE-like state results in therapy resistance- a concept yet to be explored in OC. To identify NE-like cells in
OC, the transcriptome, proteome, gene vulnerability, and drug sensitivity landscape of matched patient tumors
and model systems will be evaluated for emergence of NE-like cells under chemotherapeutic pressures. Data
emerging from the analysis of patient tumor samples in this proposal in addition to existing drug dependency
databases will be mined for identification of druggable targets in NE-like cells. Drugs effective against these cells
will be tested alone or in combination with carboplatin in targeting PtR OCs. Hallmarks of NE-like cells including
metabolic adaptations and histologic characteristics will be explored with CMA2 & CMA1 respectively.
Rationale: Recent work demonstrates that many epithelial cancers converge to more aggressive state with
genetic hallmarks and characteristics of NE-like cells. Histologic analysis, the original standard for defining
neuroendocrine phenotypes, of recurrent ovarian tumors supports emergence of NE-like cells. Our preliminary
bulk RNA sequencing data from longitudinally collected ovarian tumor samples, further supports chemo-induced
progression to an NE-like state based on our previously published NE gene expression signatures. Pan cancer
data has revealed that NE-like cells are more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. This is why
understanding the molecular underpinnings of NE-like cells in ovarian cancers is critical. We hypothesize that
eradication of PtR disease, requires additional therapeutic approaches that are directed to target NE-like cells in
ovarian tumors. CMA3 plans to mechanistically define vital pathways for survival of PtR NE-like tumor cells and
test drugs that can eliminate this tumor subpopulation. We envision our work will result in immediate clinical trial
designs that can test new approaches for treating OC patients."

all secondary glioblastoma multiform (GBM). However, because IDH mutation-bearing glioma cells are
difficult to isolate and propagate, an experimental system that allows dissection of the roles of IDH
mutations and the subsequent genetic events in gliomagenesis is currently unavailable. Our overall goal
is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying gliomagenesis and to identify novel targets to
treat gliomas. It is generally believed that gliomas are originated from brain progenitor cells such as
neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, these cells are inaccessible for experimentation. Human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), have the potential to differentiate into different somatic cell types and organoids including
brain organoid. Brain organoids possess primitive brain structure with different cell types and therefore
may provide a microenvironment permissive for gliomagenesis. We hypothesize that iPSCs derived
brain organoids serve as an alternative source for human brain cells, which can be used to dissect the
roles of IDH mutations and other associated genetic events in LGGs. The objective of this proposal is
to establish a novel brain organoid model for LGGs allowing assess the roles of IDH1 mutations and
other glioma-associated genetic alterations in disease-relevant cell types. The rationale is that by
establishing such a LGG model, we will be able to dissect the underlying molecular mechanism of
gliomagenesis. These discoveries will ultimately facilitate identification of novel therapeutic targets and
strengthen our capacity for therapeutic intervention. To achieve the objective, three specific aims are
proposed. In Aim 1, we will assess the roles of IDH and TP53 mutations in gliomagenesis using the
brain organoid LGG model. We will first generate brain organoid from iPSCs and then introduce
genetic changes including IDH1 mutation and TP53 knock-down. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of
ATRX mutation in brain organoid based gliomagenesis in vitro. In Aim 3. We will characterize brain
organoid-derived xenograft tumor in comparison to genetically engineered brain organoids and patient
LGGs. If successfully completed, we expect to establish a novel brain organoid model for LGGs, which
will enable us to assess the specific roles of IDH mutations and other glioma-associated genetic
mutations in tumorigenesis. The project will ultimately facilitate identification of novel drug targets
and development of new therapies to treat gliomas."
10798166,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Intestinal Stem Cells (ISCs) are responsible for maintenance and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, and
reside in a domain called the crypt, supported by physical and biochemical cues that make up the stem cell
niche. Despite the vital role ISCs play in human intestinal development, homeostasis and disease, the
signaling cues that make up the human ISC niche are poorly understood. By analyzing single cell RNA
sequencing data from human duodenal samples spanning approximately 7-to-21-week post conception, we
determined that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), which is commonly used to create an artificial in vitro niche
for growing intestinal organoids, was expressed on the differentiated cells of the villus, far from the stem cell
domain. We also identified another EGF family member, Epiregulin (EREG), which was highly enriched in the
stem cell domain and spatial location confirmed to the crypt. Functional experiments suggest that culturing
isolated intestinal epithelium (known as enteroids) in EREG or EGF lead to dramatically different cellular
outcomes and spatial organization. Based on this data, the overarching goal of this proposal is to determine
the functional role of EREG as a novel intestinal stem cell niche cue. We will test the hypothesis that EREG,
and not EGF, is a critical physiologically relevant growth factor for intestinal stem cell homeostasis and plays a
key role in human intestinal development. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1)
Elucidate the mechanism by which EGF and EREG act on human ISCs; 2) Assess the role of EREG in a
complex model of the developing human intestine in vitro and following xenotransplantation."
10701436,"The dismal prognosis associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is attributed to the aggressive
nature of these tumors and the lack of effective screening or treatment strategies. PDAC is especially problematic
for the U.S. Veterans population, which has a higher PDAC prevalence than the general population. Studies
have shown that patients with PDAC have a high rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is also an
important cancer-associated factor in the Veteran population. Critically, patients with VTE are more likely to have
an advanced stage of cancer and worse prognosis than patients without VTE. Fibrinogen is primarily considered
in the context of hemostasis; however, it is also important for other processes such as cell-cell interaction,
inflammation, and tumorigenesis. Although fibrinogen levels are elevated in cancer patient plasma and cancer
tissues, the mechanistic roles for fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of any cancer, including PDAC, are largely
unknown. We have performed extensive preliminary studies to show functional roles of fibrinogen in PDAC. For
the current project, we hypothesize that increased fibrinogen expression in the basal subtype of PDAC plays an
important role in cancer progression through the AKT/STAT3 signaling axis, thereby promoting EMT/metastasis,
chemoresistance and anti-apoptosis in cancer cells. We propose that a novel therapy (A2 protein) targeting
fibrinogen in combination with the first-line chemotherapeutic drug regimen (FOLFIRINOX) could be beneficial
primarily for PDAC patients with basal subtype tumors. Two specific aims are proposed: 1). Determine the
functions and molecular mechanisms of tumor-derived fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of the basal subtype of
PDAC in vitro and in vivo. 2). Determine the therapeutic efficacy of the novel combination of chemotherapy with
A2 protein targeting fibrinogen in the basal subtype of PDAC in PDX mouse models.
The proposed project is highly relevant to U.S. veterans due to their increased risk for PDAC. With the in depth
research on roles of tumor-derived and systemic fibrinogen on PDAC progression, and effective targeting
strategy, we expect this project to offer a new, groundbreaking paradigm for VA patient care, and bring a novel
treatment option for basal subtype of PDAC patients. Results obtained from the current project will be ready to
implement into clinical trials."
10912626,"Project Summary
 The research in this proposal focuses on the development of methods for fabricating magic-angle
spinning (MAS) rotors from single crystal diamond logs for applications (1) in ambient temperature MAS
experiments, and (2) dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) MAS experiments. In particular, there is an ever-
increasing push towards rotors that attain higher spinning frequencies for MAS NMR in order to improve
sensitivity and resolution. However, the spinning frequencies currently obtainable (~100 kHz) are limited by
the strength of the material from which the rotors are fabricated – typically ZrO2 with flexural strength of
~800 MPa. Above ~120 kHz the ZrO2 rotors explode. Diamond is one of the strongest materials on earth
with flexural strengths of 2-5 GPa for single crystal samples and therefore an ideal material to manufacture
MAS rotors. Furthermore, diamond is transparent to terahertz radiation, so it is ideal for DNP experiments.
Finally, it has excellent thermal properties – it thermal conductivity is 10x better than Cu. Thus, it is easy to
compensate for the aerodynamic heating associated with MAS. Machining diamond cylinders to high
tolerance required for rotors requires a novel laser machining processes which we have begun to develop to
produce small (≤1.3 mm OD) diamond rotors. Here we propose to refine our processes and test them in our
available instrumentation. The goal is to produce 1.3 mm, 0.7 mm and a new generation of 0.5 mm rotors
that will attain ωr/2π>300 kHz and improve the resolution of MAS spectra by a factor of ~5 over what is
currently available. In addition, we anticipate that diamond rotors will lead to larger DNP enhancements.
We also describe some applications to amyloid fibrils and membrane proteins where we anticipate that
diamond rotors will have a significant scientific impact."
10932134,"Abstract
 Venom is a complex trait that has convergently evolved in over 200,000 animals across the tree of life, totaling
approximately ~15-30% of animal biodiversity. The prevalence of the venom phenotype demonstrates its molecular success
and studying its evolution has broad applications to understanding the development of homologous tissues, the origins of
novel genes, and the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation and expression of bioactive compounds.
 Considerably, venoms are the prototype of precision medicine: inducing a highly specific and immediate response.
These attributes have fueled drug discovery efforts, leading to breakthrough venom-derived therapeutics for a wide range
of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease to pain. However, the full potential of venom, in both medicine and biological
research, is untapped. This unmet need arises because of the lack of robust models for genetically manipulating the
development of venom glands and regulation and expression of venom bioactive peptides.
 The work of the Holford group was the first to characterize terebrid venom peptides as bioactive in mitigating
analgesic and antitumor activity. However, without guiding principles for how venoms and venom glands develop in vivo,
we, and other venom researchers, have just scratched the surface. We need model systems to revolutionize the study venom
gland biology, so that we can radically transform how we generate, manipulate, and utilize venom arsenals.
 The cephalopod breeding program provide the tools and models necessary to tackle biological and translational
questions that have remained unapproachable, such as: What drives the expression of predatory versus defensive venom
components? Can we manipulate the production of specific toxins with a desired function, such as those targeting receptors
involved in analgesic activity? Advancements in genetic engineering, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics will allow
us to generate the first marine invertebrate transgenic cephalopod organisms that produce venom in specialized glands that
can be investigated to explore fundamental questions about tissue development and gene regulation and expression.
Specifically, we will: (1) Determine genes and proteins relevant to venom gland development, maintenance, and secretion
across diverse cephalopod taxa. This objective will determine the evolutionary underpinnings between venom salivary
glands and other exocrine tissues across taxa. (2) Trace the development of cephalopod salivary glands. This objective will
reveal genetic pathways that can be leveraged to determine the formation and function of venom gland from diverse taxa.
(3) Establish comparative cephalopod transgenic models. This objective will establish transgenic cephalopods allowing us
to optimize the utility of venom glands for understanding the development of homologous tissues, the origins of novel genes,
and the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation and expression of bioactive compounds.
 The proposed research is a new direction for the PI that is high risk-high reward, and will benefit disparate fields
and industries, including developmental cellular and molecular biology and drug discovery and development. Most diseases,
like Alzheimer or cancer have complex traits whose genetic characterization in model systems have been essential to finding
effective therapies. Studying the evolutionary genetics in the complex trait of venom in a reliably, cultured cephalopod
system will broadly impact research towards the NIH’s mission of enhancing human health."
10702183,"Project Summary/Abstract
We have analyzed Kras mutant lung adenocarcinoma and demonstrated that the cell of origin is
the alveolar Type II cell. Alveolar Type II cells undergo a Notch-dependent dedifferentiation to
bipotent progenitor cells. These cells have markers of both Type I and Type II cells and initiate
and propagate tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, finding methods of inhibiting these cells
could quickly lead to important therapeutic advances for patients with KRAS mutant tumors.
Sphingolipid pathways downstream of Kras are promising therapeutic targets in these cells. In
the current application, we will use mechanistic and high throughput methods to test existing
drugs against 3-dimensional cultures of Kras mutant bipotent progenitor cells. We will also use
Cas/Crispr technology to identify sphingolipid genes and pathways that will be effective in
inhibiting these cells. Finally, because macrophages are intimately involved with the tumor
cells during initiation and progression and sphingolipids are involved in tumor immune
suppression, we will test unique inhibitors of immunosuppressive tumor macrophages and
sphingolipid inhibitors to allow immune surveillance of forming tumors. In addition, additive
mutations of p53 and Lkb1 which are common in lung adenocarcinoma will be used in all assays
so that the broad range of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas will be addressed."
10703332,"Effective treatments for alcohol-use disorder (AUD), especially for women veterans are critically needed, as
rates of AUD in women veterans have been steadily increasing. Sex differences in psychosocial and biological
risk factors, however, have not been systematically studied in clinical trials for AUD. Women veterans have a
higher prevalence of trauma and abuse than men, and
70% of women veterans experience military sexual
trauma and 36% report being victims of military sexual assault or rape. Abuse
and trauma
are significant
predictors for AUD in women veterans but not in men. Exposure to trauma and consequent impairments in
emotion regulation are significant risk factors for women with AUD and likely interact with immunological and
neurobiological pathways to promote greater addiction severity. Despite clear evidence that psychosocial
vulnerabilities, such as trauma and emotion regulation difficulties contribute to greater risk for relapse in
women
, there has been a paucity of studies that evaluate how these risk factors interact with sex-specific
differences in immunological and neurobiological systems to influence treatment outcome.
The primary objective of this study is to identify
the mechanistic link between sex-dependent risk factors and
treatment efficacy in a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone (NTX). This proposal will
extend and leverage previous studies of NTX to determine whether the neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory
properties of NTX improve brain function, reduce inflammation and enhance emotion regulation in a sex-
dependent manner. Validated rating scales will comprehensively assess trauma history, including military
sexual trauma, combat exposure, physical or sexual assault, intimate partner violence and other traumatic life
events. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest and during an emotion regulation task will
assess limbic system connectivity and reactivity, respectively. Inflammation and neuronal integrity will be
assessed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a multiplex panel assay of peripheral inflammatory
markers. This project will first identify sex differences in the relationships between trauma and emotion
regulation, inflammation and limbic function deficits. The mechanism of NTX on biobehavioral interactions to
improve drinking behavior will then be assessed by testing whether reductions in alcohol use is moderated by
changes in or interactions between emotion regulation, inflammation or limbic function. Sex-dependent
mechanisms underlying NTX response will also be tested to examine if moderating effects on treatment
outcome differ between men and women veterans.
Findings from this project will identify psychosocial factors that influence immunological and neurobiological
systems and clarify how these risk factors manifest in emotion regulation deficits and alcohol use in a sex-
dependent manner. This systematic study of sex differences will provide a mechanistic understanding of NTX
on biobehavioral interactions and identify therapeutic targets by providing evidence for sex-specific biomarkers
that enhance treatment response. As women veterans have unique vulnerabilities that contribute to disease
severity, results from this study will have substantial impact in advancing the VA mission for precision medicine
by providing biomarkers for tailored treatment approaches, as well as, supporting a VA priority in addressing
the unique needs and improving health outcomes for female veterans."
10772018,"In autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly identifies “self”-molecules/antigens as foreign, resulting
in an orchestrated attack of the body. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the immune system attack of the protective neuronal sheath
– myelin - results in debilitating neurological impairment and poor quality of life. Current MS therapies are non-curative,
require life-long compliance, and exhibit non-specific effects that increase patient susceptibility to infection. To circumvent
MS treatment challenges, emerging therapies seek to direct myelin self-antigens (MOG) and immunomodulatory cues to
redirect the immune response. Toll-like receptors, which detect pathogen-associated patterns on antigen presenting cells
(APCs) are involved in MS. Recently, TLR9 antagonist, GpG has been shown to downregulate APC activation while
promoting TREGS. Similarly, Rapamycin (Rapa), an immunosuppressant drug has garnered interest because it inhibits major
pathways and promotes regulatory T cells (TREGS). Since coordination between the innate and adaptive immune system in
MS drives disease, the proposed study will target these pathways simultaneously to promote antigen-specific immune
tolerance in MS.
 We have previously developed self-assembled carriers built entirely from immune cues – termed immune
polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) that enable combinatory delivery of multiple cues, controlled loading, and high cargo
densities. iPEMs assembled using MOG and GpG reduce TLR9 signaling while promoting TREGS but show moderate
efficacy in preclinical MS models. Since TREGS play a crucial role in moderating immune responses, the proposed work aims
to load Rapa in the core of MOG/GpG iPEMs to enable co-delivery of MOG to induce antigen-specific immune responses,
GpG to downregulate APC activity, and incorporate cross-links to control Rapa delivery to induce TREGS. In Aim 1, the
hypothesis that cross-link density in MOG/GpG (Rapa) iPEMs is correlated to release intervals will be tested. This will be
accomplished by generating a library of iPEMs from combinations of MOG, control antigen (ANT-CTRL), GpG, inactive
control ODN (ODNCTRL), as well as Rapa with distinct cross-linking conditions to control release. In Aim 2, cross-linked
iPEM release kinetics will be linked to APC activation and T cell polarization. In Aim 3, the efficacy of crosslinked iPEMs
in preclinical MS models will be assessed to test the hypothesis that dual-targeting of innate and adaptive immunity is
necessary to drive antigen-specific TREGS in MS. These studies will show that modulating both innate and adaptive immunity
is necessary to generate robust antigen-specific responses in MS and will provide insight that informs the design of new
therapies to treat MS and other autoimmune diseases. At the same time, new skills and techniques will be acquired
throughout the course of the studies to propel the goal of the trainee to lead an academic research lab focused on developing
immunomodulatory drug delivery systems after postdoctoral training."
10830450,"Abstract
New neurobiological understanding of and therapeutic targets for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are needed.
Advances in the biology of AUD indicate that lipid signaling is a key regulator of ethanol use and withdrawal
behavior via specialized G-protein coupled membrane receptors, transport proteins, and, more recently,
nuclear transcription factors. PPARs are lipid-sensing transcription factors encoded by 3 genes (PPAR,
PPAR, PPAR) that were identified for their roles in peripheral regulation of fuel homeostasis. PPAR and
PPAR have received intense attention for their anti-addiction-like actions. Yet, the central role of the more
abundantly expressed brain PPARreceptor isotype in the control of compulsive alcohol use behaviors is
entirely unknown. Here, we test the overarching hypothesis that brain peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors-delta subtype (PPAR) inhibits compulsive ethanol use and negative emotional withdrawal. Studies
use the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure model to elicit escalated and aversion-resistant ethanol
intake and withdrawal anxiety- and irritability-like behavior to yield new translational insights into AUD. We
combine novel brain-penetrant and translatable PPAR agonist (KD3010, T3D-959) and brain-restricted and
site-specific cre/lox conditional PPAR knockouts to test the causal role and central sites of PPARaction in
compulsive-like alcohol use phenotypes. The resulting data and novel genetic and translationally-relevant
pharmacological tools for this understudied PPARδ isotype will lay the groundwork for cell type- and
anatomically-specific mechanistic studies and may lead to interventions for people affected by compulsive
alcohol use and other forms of addiction."
11072322,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Administrative Core is critical to facilitating the mission of the HHEAR Data Center, to provide logistical 
and intellectual support for the maintenance, analysis, interpretation, curation, and reuse of data generated by 
HHEAR. The Administrative Core will provide administrative and organizational management of the Data 
Repository and Management Core, Data Science Resource, and Statistical Services and Analysis Resource by 
serving as the primary interface between the Data Center and other units of the overall HHEAR Network (i.e., 
the HHEAR Coordinating Center and the HHEAR Exposure Assessment Laboratory Network). Further, Data 
Center leadership are committed to the FAIR principles, and thus we will strive to make HHEAR data as 
findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable as possible. Additionally, considerable effort will be focused 
on the technical development of biomedical vocabulary/ontology data standards and the management of 
community-driven standards development. A unique Translation and Engagement group within the 
Administrative Core has been designed to develop, implement, and coordinate the dissemination and 
engagement activities within and across each resource of the HHEAR Data Center. This will allow us to 
achieve our goal of ensuring that HHEAR data and resources fulfill the FAIR principles and will be of 
immediate relevance to our stakeholders. Through these efforts, the HHEAR Data Center will ensure that 
research will advance quickly and efficiently toward a better understanding of the environment and human 
health across the lifecourse. The Administrative Core provides essential support to meet these goals. 
Additionally, leveraging our existing infrastructure and expertise will overcome the need for a long

11072323,"DATA REPOSITORY AND MANAGEMENT CORE PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Data Repository and Management Core (DRMC) will advance scientific understanding of environmental 
exposures by expanding our successful CHEAR Data Center (DC) data portal and repository to encompass 
humans at all life stages. Our proposed HHEAR DC data portal and repository, along with our effective user 
support team, will help researchers add comprehensive exposure analysis to their studies. Our demonstrated 
commitment to FAIR principles and our unique harmonized data sets will enhance research productivity and 
general public understanding by (1) providing access to cleaned and harmonized data and larger data sets for 
greater statistical power and maximal reuse; (2) interoperating with relevant national data sets such as the 
Metabolomics Workbench, ECHO, and others to facilitate data submission of new data types; and (3) 
facilitating access to modern collaborative data analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks and Google's 
Colaboratory. We will employ best practices for high reliability and security and follow HIPAA guidelines. To 
develop effective and focused infrastructure, services, and processes tailored for the CHEAR community, our 
interdisciplinary team developed strong partnerships with the Coordinating Center (CC), the Lab Network, the 
ECHO DC, the Metabolomics Workbench, and others. These relationships, along with our existing CHEAR 
infrastructure, singular expertise, and established processes, will carry over to the creation of the HHEAR DC 
and will help accelerate its rollout. These services will give the HHEAR community the ability to discover new 
correlations and relationships between multi-scale and multimodal data sets, thus progressing toward the 
promise of big data to help solve the major challenges of human environmental health research across the 
lifecourse. Combining data from a set of individual studies would likely require substantial work if it were 
attempted without resources similar to those of the HHEAR DMRC; the design of the data repository will 
facilitate manageable and efficient combining of existing data sets; the availability of common vocabularies 
developed by the DSR will contribute to maximizing the usable data from each study; and the SSAR will 
ultimately receive a dataset to which they can apply their exposome-related analytic methods to address 
hypotheses on the environmental health of the pooled study population. Our state-of-the-art DRMC has been 
fulfilling these roles within the CHEAR program, and will build on and extend our capabilities as the HHEAR

11072324,"STATISTICAL SERVICES AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE SUMMARY 
Research in environmental health demonstrates that consequence of environmental exposures during critical 
periods in development can manifest as disease or dysfunction across the human life span. Indeed, humans 
are exposed to environmental factors ranging from internal physiology (e.g., oxidative stress) to external 
chemical (e.g., air pollution, consumer products) and lifestyle factors including exposures to environmental 
contaminants, poor nutrition, and stress. These factors are multi-dimensional and complex – not simple, single 
exposures related to a single health outcome. Statistical methods and study designs for analyzing the complex, 
high-dimensional data that arise in such settings are still relatively new and require knowledge of advanced 
statistical techniques. The Statistical Services and Analysis Resource (SSAR) consolidates multi-disciplinary 
expertise (statistics, epidemiology, bioinformatics) in a single faculty made available for collaboration with the 
broader environmental health research community through the Data Center. The aims of the SSAR are in three 
primary categories: consultation and analysis support, HHEAR mission-related methods development and 
implementation of novel methods, and support of collaborative research across the Environmental Health 
Research consortium. Our specific aims are: 1) provide statistical, epidemiological, and bioinformatics 
consultation and analysis support to investigators utilizing the HHEAR Laboratory Network resources; 2) 
catalyze the application of novel statistical, analytical, and bioinformatics methodologies in relevant areas to 
the HHEAR and the Data Center; 3) catalyze the implementation of these methods in Aim 2 through statistical 
training for environmental health researchers by creating publicly available statistical software for analysis of 
the HHEAR data and developing publicly available training/example datasets to be used for didactic learning 
through webinars related to children's environmental health; and 4) support collaborative research across the 
HHEAR consortium by conducting initial meta-analyses relating environmental exposures and selected 
disease conditions within a consortium of relevant experts; and supporting other collaborative research 
projects that may initiate through the HHEAR consortium of research investigators. The achievement of these 
aims will advance the goals of the HHEAR Data Center and the larger HHEAR Network to maximize our 
understanding of the potential impact of environmental exposures on human health by providing rigorous and 
innovative biostatistical/bioinformatics methods for analyzing environmental health data."

10903849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancers of different types preferentially metastasize to different tissues and specific sites in these tissues. Why
this is true remains poorly understood but is likely to involve a combination of cell intrinsic factors (e.g., the
ability of a cell to survive differences in mitogenic factors, nutrient availability, or context-specific stressors) and
extrinsic effects (tissue-specific mechanical and biochemical cues). Gaining molecular insight into events
involved in metastatic colonization is challenging, because such events are rare, colonies are initially small,
and potential sites of colonization are widely distributed. The focus of this TDU is the development, validation
and dissemination of innovative toolkits for deep multiplexed tissue imaging; these toolkits will be developed in
close association with our RTBs and provided to the wider CCBIR consortium. When mature, the methods we
described will enable quantitative measurement of molecular processes involving ~60 proteins or other
biomolecules at subcellular resolution in a preserved tissue context. In Aim 1 we will assemble a self-driving
multiscale microscope that leverages advances in tissue clearing, fully automated high-speed and high-
resolution light-sheet fluorescence imaging, and computer vision, to identify the earliest events in metastasis,
including the colonization of a tissue by a single metastatic cell. This microscope will have mesoscopic and
nanoscopic imaging modes. The mesoscopic module has computationally controlled magnification (0.63X to
6.3X) and provides ~5-10 µm isotropic resolution throughout a 2.1-21mm field of view. The nanoscopic module
provides ~330nm isotropic resolution throughout a 300 µm field of view. Biological features (metastatic
colonies) will be rapidly and efficiently identified with the mesoscopic module and interrogated at high
resolution using the nanoscopic module. Aim 2 will involve development of physically and chemically
accelerated 60-plex cyclic immunofluorescence assays of tissue sections thick enough(~200 µm) to fully
encompass a metastatic colony and its tissue niche. Thick section highly multiplexed and high-resolution
imaging will then be combined with CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cell lines from the RTBs to test specific
hypotheses about signaling, differentiation, and morphological mechanisms involved in metastasis. Support for
spatial transcript profiling and tissue proteomics will aid with integration into more gnomically focused NCI
programs. Aim 3 will develop a fully automated multi-technology microscope able to accurately describe
metastatic heterogeneity in a statistically robust fashion. The instrument will combine deep isotropic resolution
imaging with highly multiplexed methods via automated sample handling, labeling, imaging and analysis. This
next-generation microscope will involve several generalizable technologies for comprehensively profiling rare
events in metastasis and also cancer initiation, which is another rare event. Together, the approaches we
describe are expected to substantially advance our understanding of one of the least characterized and most
lethal features of solid tumors."
10903855,"Ewing sarcoma, a malignant tumor of bone and soft tissue affecting children, adolescents, and young adults. For
the one-third of Ewing sarcoma patients who develop metastasis, the long-term survival rate remains less than
30%. Decades of clinical trials with ever-increasing intensity of chemotherapy have increased the toxicity of
treatment but have not affected the poor outcome of metastatic disease. This failure to adequately treat
metastases indicates that new approaches are needed to better understand the genesis of metastatic cells from
the primary tumor and behavior of these cells in the in vivo microenvironment. Though there has been substantial
progress in genomic profiling of tumors, these assays are unlikely to identify major determinants of metastatic
behavior. This is because i) Ewing sarcomas typically have “quiet” genomes with few identifiable driver
mutations; and ii) adverse outcomes may arise due to the functional adaptations of a small population of cells to
the tumor microenvironment, driven by epigenetic, metabolic, morphologic or non-cell autonomous mechanisms.
The broad goal of this project is thus to determine how extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence Ewing sarcoma
cell fates at the metastatic site. A significant barrier to better understanding has been the lack of experimental
systems that can probe heterogeneity of cell functional states, at whole-organism, single-cell and subcellular
levels. Recent findings suggest that modulation of cell-mechanical features via the caveolin-1 and WNT signaling
pathways may contribute to Ewing sarcoma metastasis, however the mechanisms of this adaptation are not
known. As a system to visualize the heterogeneous functional properties of the metastatic cell population shed
from a primary tumor, we leverage the zebrafish embryo as a host organism for human tumor xenografts. Ewing
sarcoma cells readily engraft into zebrafish embryos and directly interact with the microenvironment of fully
functional organs. The optical clarity of the fish allows us to perform multi-modal imaging to 1) identify host
tissues associated with recurrent metastatic events; 2) define morphologic changes in cells undergoing
metastatic adaptation in vivo; and 3) probe the activity of cancer cell signaling pathways in metastatic cells at
subcellular resolution. Using powerful genetic tools and specific biosensors, we will exploit the quantitative
imaging technology developed by TDU-1 to probe the role of caveolin-1 and WNT-dependent signaling in Ewing
sarcoma metastasis. These studies will be complemented by parallel assays in mouse models and human Ewing
sarcoma tumors, enabled by collaboration with TDU-2. Ultimately, these findings will inform strategies aimed at
preventing or eliminating metastasis via targeting signaling mechanisms. We will determine effects of
microenvironmental interactions on morphology and signaling of metastatic tumor cells; test the contribution of
Caveolin-1 to metastatic cell adaptation to host environments; and probe the role of WNT signaling in Ewing
sarcoma metastasis in genetic models. Ultimately these results will inform novel strategies to prevent or
ameliorate metastasis in patients with Ewing sarcoma."
10903859,"Project Summary
Metastasis is a highly inefficient process in which few disseminating cancer cells survive. We discovered that
melanoma metastasis is limited by oxidative stress. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) increase dramatically in
melanoma cells as they metastasize through the blood. The rare cells that survive undergo reversible
metabolic changes that confer oxidative stress resistance. Consistent with this, large clinical trials found that
patients administered anti-oxidants were more likely to die of cancer than control patients. Cancer cells,
including melanoma, often metastasize regionally through lymphatic vessels before metastasizing systemically
through the blood. We recently discovered that melanoma cells in lymph experience less oxidative stress and
form more metastases than melanoma cells in blood. This was true of patient-derived melanomas growing in
immunocompromised mice as well as mouse melanomas growing in immunocompetent mice. The oxidative
stress kills melanoma cells in the blood by inducing ferroptosis, a form of cell death marked by the
accumulation of lipid peroxides. One of the ways in which lymph protects from ferroptosis is by having high
levels of the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), oleic acid, which protects cells from lipid oxidation by
reducing the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membrane phospholipids. The more
abundant PUFAs are in membrane phospholipids, the more sensitive cells are to ferroptosis. Melanoma cells
are thus exposed to different lipid environments in different locations as they metastasize and these cell-
extrinsic changes influence their survival. There are also cell-intrinsic differences among melanomas that
influence their response to these environments: melanomas from different patients differ in the sites to which
they metastasize upon xenografting. We hypothesize that these differences in metastasis patterns result from
cell-intrinsic differences in lipid metabolism that influence their sensitivity to ferroptosis in response to the lipid
environments they encounter as they metastasize. Nonetheless, we have never been able to image the fates
of metastasizing melanoma cells in vivo, limiting our understanding of how oxidative stress affects these cells.
A critical barrier is the efficient imaging of entire organs to identify rare melanoma cells at the earliest stages of
metastasis. The lack of subcellular resolution in whole organs also impairs our ability to explore the ways in
which oxidative stress influences cell survival and proliferation. Both of these limitations will be addressed by
the Technology Development Unit (TDU) of this consortium, which is developing the ability to perform high
throughput imaging of whole, cleared organs to assess the survival, proliferation, and localization of rare
melanoma cells after metastasis. We will validate these imaging data by flow cytometry. By combining single
cell imaging (Aim 1) with metabolic assays, we will characterize cell-extrinsic (Aim 2) and cell-intrinsic (Aims 1,
3) mechanisms that regulate the earliest stages of metastasis."
10894659,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core represents the executive, coordinating and oversight component of the Joint Biology
Consortium (JBC). The Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and collaborators have
much to offer researchers in arthritis and related diseases, but smooth access to these resources requires a
shared logistical infrastructure. The Admin Core develops and maintains this infrastructure, keeping JBC
members informed of the latest technological advances and maximizing opportunities for collaborative studies.
Importantly, the Admin Core will leverage the expertise and commitment of JBC members to develop the next
generation of top-flight musculoskeletal researchers. This work is reflected in two aims.
First, an experienced team of investigators and administrators will ensure efficient, fiscally-responsible
operation of the JBC Resource Cores to provide key tools for arthritis research, coordinated through a central
user interface: the JBC Web Portal. This team will monitor service utilization, user feedback, and research
productivity. Leadership will work together with the JBC Advisory Committee to adapt the JBC rapidly to
member needs to ensure optimal utilization of JBC resources.
Second, the JBC will build the arthritis research community through the monthly JBC Synergy Meeting,
communication through the JBC Web Portal and an electronic newsletter, the JBC visiting professor program,
and outreach. Importantly, the JBC Enrichment Program will foster junior investigators through the Aims
Review Committee, the JBC Mentoring Program, and the JBC Microgrant Program, including dedicated
programmatic attention to diversity and inclusion to ensure optimization of the JBC researcher pool.
The Admin Core is led by committed arthritis researchers and award-winning mentors Dr. Peter Nigrovic and
Dr. Elizabeth Karlson, supported by a skilled administrative team, a JBC Executive Committee composed of all
core service leaders, and oversight through the JBC Advisory Committee chaired by Dr. Michael Brenner.
Together, this team will ensure that the JBC becomes an even more effective community of junior and senior
investigators working toward the common goal of understanding inflammatory arthritis."
10894664,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Resource Core 1: Human Biosamples Core
Obtaining fresh, carefully phenotyped human samples is the most daunting logistical hurdle facing the Joint
Biology Consortium (JBC) Research Community. The Human Biosamples Core overcomes this barrier with a
“systems solution” that integrates existing resources at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Boston
Children’s Hospital (BCH), and affiliated institutions with a bioinformatically-sophisticated team of personnel to
support sample identification, patient recruitment, sample processing, data management, and statistical
analysis. Unique strengths include an extraordinary range of patient samples, both pediatric and adult; core
leadership with expertise in cutting-edge translational research, biobanking, and electronic health record (EHR)
interrogation; bioinformatics and biostatistics; and access to healthy controls as well as patients with
comparator diseases. This mission will be realized through two Specific Aims.
Aim I helps JBC members identify and obtain relevant archived biosamples from 16 different established
sources, ranging from >120,000 patients in the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank to highly specialized
collections from common and rare rheumatic diseases as well as relevant controls. Examples include registries
of rheumatoid arthritis (BRASS), psoriatic arthritis (COPPAR), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SYLVER);
juvenile-onset rheumatic disease biobanks at BCH and CARRA; checkpoint inhibitor-induced rheumatic
diseases; and synovial tissue from the Amsterdam Arthritis Bank as well as local archives.
Aim II provides targeted, prospective recruitment via the JBC Recruitment Core, through which a dedicated
team identifies, contacts, consents, obtains, and processes samples from patients meeting JBC member
specifications. Donors include >120,000 MGB Biobank patients, including >45,000 with genotype data, BWH
and BCH rheumatology clinics, ongoing clinical trials, and other sources.
Led by expert rheumatoid arthritis investigator and methodologist Dr. Elizabeth Karlson, supported by
associate directors Dr. Jeffrey Sparks at BWH, Dr. Lauren Henderson at BCH, and Dr. Deepak Rao heading
the BWH Human Immunology Center for sample processing, the Human Biosamples Core represents a unified
biospecimen pipeline to accelerate hypothesis-driven research into inflammatory arthritis and related diseases
for investigators across the multicenter JBC network."

Investigators in the Joint Biology Consortium (JBC) share a set of challenges that impede utilization of state-of-
the-art technologies for research in arthritis and related diseases. Building on success in the first cycle of the
JBC, the Cellular Systems Core (CSC) will leverage local resources and economies of scale to cultivate an
integrated set of research tools to serve JBC members. The CSC will provide two broad categories of service.
First, the CSC will deliver technologies realized through next-generation sequencing. These include single-cell
RNAseq, ATAC-seq, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, genomic DNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics,
CRISPR-based genomic perturbation screens, and autoantigen detection through PhIP-seq and T-scan.
Second, the CSC will deliver tools centered on protein detection. These include optimized cytometry by time of
flight (CyTOF), tissue mass cytometry, and Luminex-based screens for economical, customizable detection of
cyctokines, antibodies, and other proteins.
Resulting data will be analyzed through the new Joint Biology Consortium Bioinformatics Core, providing both
high-end big-data analysis and structured education and coaching for JBC members, with the goal of
developing a community of investigators conversant with advanced computational methods.
This program integrates services available through the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Single-Cell Genomics
Core and Center for Data Sciences, the Harvard Medical Area CyTOF Core, the Boston Children’s Hospital
Division of Immunology, the Broad Institute’s Genomic Perturbation Platform, and other affiliated cores and
labs. Progressive optimization of CSC services – now encompassing both cells and intact tissues – will result
further through close affiliation with technical and computational leaders of the Accelerating Medicines
Partnership (AMP) consortium in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, ensuring JBC members access to the latest
methodologic advances. Service delivery will be led by a scientific team consisting of Harvard CyTOF director
Dr. James Lederer supported by associate directors Dr. Kevin Wei and bioinformatician Dr. Maria Gutierrez-
Arcelus. This team will ensure that the logistical investment represented by the Cellular Systems Core
continues to accelerate innovative translational arthritis research within the JBC."
10922744,"The defining role of the Administrative (Admin) Core of the Center for Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics
(CBSD) during phase III COBRE funding is to provide the framework that guides efficient and strategic
operation of the CBSD so that it becomes a self-sustaining research center at the University of Montana (UM).
This task will be led by PD Bruce E. Bowler with assistance from Assistant Director for Budget and Finance
Heidi Boggs and her staff. The focus of phase III funding will be on affording guidance and resources to the
four research cores supported by the CBSD so that they can grow their user bases and maintain state-of-the-
art facilities that will be necessary to give their users a competitive edge for research funding. The Admin Core
will build upon the successful programs administered during phases I and II of COBRE funding, which led to 58
grant awards to CBSD investigators that brought in more than $27 million in funding to support their research
and use of the four research cores that are critical for maintaining their research programs at the forefront of
their research areas. During phase III, the goal of achieving long term sustainability for the CBSD will be
achieved by optimizing core recharge structures (specific aim 2) and promoting further growth of research
core user bases by 1) ensuring that they continue to offer state-of-the-art facilities (specific aim 1), 2) by
facilitating strategic use of Pilot Project grants and 3) by partnering with other COBRE centers at UM and in
nearby IDeA states with overlapping needs (specific aim 2). Closely coupled to these core-centric strategies
are mentoring programs that keep the research of CBSD researchers at the vanguard of their science
(specific aim 3). These programs include 1) the Hot Water grant writing workshop that provides panel-style
review of grants before submission that help CBSD researchers at all career stages improve both the clarity
and quality of their grant applications and 2) the monthly CBSD Research Meeting that provides a forum for
CBSD investigators to present their research in an informal environment meant to stimulate new ideas and
promote collaboration with their peers. The Admin Core will also focus the weekly Molecular and Biomedical
Sciences Seminar series on prominent outside speakers whose research highlights the leading edge science
made possible by our research cores (specific aim 4). This integrated approach will create synergies between
the cutting-edge capabilities of our research cores and a scientifically stimulating environment that will grow the
research enterprise of the CBSD ensuring its long-term sustainability. Oversight and guidance for this evolution
will be provided by our Internal Advisory Committee, which includes representative members of the CBSD
community, and an External Advisory Committee comprised of eminent biophysicists and structural biologists."
10848347,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. suffer from cutaneous lupus lesions (CLE), with a significant impact
on quality of life.4 Yet, there is no cure, the treatment options are limited, and no new drug has been FDA-
approved for over 50 years.84 As such, CLE represents a high unmet need for directed therapeutics.
Skin lesions are caused by a complex autoimmune response dependent on genetic and environmental factors.80
These lesions have common histological features such as interface dermatitis with interferon-regulated
chemokines expression.19 Anandamide (AEA) is a primary endocannabinoid involved in (i) modulation of the
innate and the adaptive immune system, (ii) processing of sensory input such as pruritus and pain, and (iii)
maintenance of skin barrier integrity.152,153 AEA’s primary pathway for decreasing inflammation is through binding
to CB2 receptors, which are predominantly expressed by macrophages and lymphocytes in peripheral organs
with immune function, including the skin.164 Preliminary data (i) demonstrate upregulation of CB2 receptors in
lesional human CLE tissue and (ii) show that AEA-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLE patients
produce lower levels of cytokines.
Given all this, AEA is a promising drug candidate for treatment of CLE. AEA faces a variety of delivery challenges,
however, including instability, limited penetration into the stratum corneum, and rapid metabolism by fatty acid
amide hydrolase (FAAH).134-135 To overcome these challenges, AEA was loaded into a novel topical silica-
derived particle delivery system that has been demonstrated to enhance bioavailability of several other APIs.
The resulting formulation (AEA-ZP) was shown to (i) enhance penetration of AEA into the stratum corneum, (ii)
provide extended release of AEA in the skin, and (iii) significantly reduce the size and severity of lupus lesions
in two murine lupus studies as compared to controls, including unencapsulated AEA.
During this Phase I proposal, the AEA-ZP prototype will be evaluated for efficacy in vivo in a new mouse model,
and preliminary toxicity data will be obtained. In vitro mechanism-of-action studies will be conducted using blood
and lesional tissue from human CLE patients; such data is expected to inform clinical development decisions
relating to target patient populations in which specific biomarker profiles might indicate patients that are more
likely to respond to treatment with AEA-ZP. In parallel, higher loaded AEA-ZP prototypes will be developed in
preparation for dose-ranging safety and efficacy studies to follow, and accelerated stability testing performed."
10878848,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
Our administrative infrastructure has been molded to meet the needs of the NCQBCS as it stands today. All Co-
Investigators have been recruited by Resource PI Coon to fulfill the scientific and technical needs of the
Resource. Co-Investigators Pagliarini and Li, both part of Cycle 1, will continue their commitment to the
NCQBCS’s work. Our TR&Ds and DBPs have been organized to take advantage of the expertise of the
investigators. Dr. Pagliarini, with assistance from Dr. Katie Overymyer, will continue to lead the DBPs. Pagliarini
has an extensive background in chemical and molecular biology. Overmyer is a classically trained biochemist
who has recently joined our staff. Prof. Li is recognized as a leader in chemical labeling strategies for quantitative
proteomics using mass spectrometry and is therefore a natural fit for TR&D 2, which focuses on developing
enhanced tagging technologies for protein quantification. In Cycle 2, we are excited to announce that we will be
bringing in Prof. Robert Kennedy, University of Michigan, to provide cutting-edge separations technology needed
to advance the multi-omics component of our scientific aims. Therefore, our established procedures will be
modified to ensure proper integration of an off-sight Co-Investigator into the Resource. Prof. Kennedy’s expertise
makes him the ideal lead for TR&D 3, directed toward integrated multi-omics. PI Coon brings extensive
experience in instrumentation, training, and leadership, making him the perfect fit as the PI of the Resource and
lead of TR&D 1 on biomolecule characterization. Although each investigator has responsibility for direction and
lead on an individual component, no TR&D or DBP can be successfully carried out on their own. They are neither
disparate projects nor research interests that simply happen to fall under the same thematic umbrella. In fact,
they are by design integrative with collaborative interaction between the Co-I’s across the TR&D projects.

structure is largely unchanged from Cycle 1."
10878849,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TR&D 1
We direct this TR&D toward improved biomolecule characterization. The rationale is simple: you cannot quantify
what you cannot characterize! Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the central approach for characterizing
biomolecules with MS, is typically achieved by collisional activation. This process often fails, however, when the
peptide precursor contains amino acids that inhibit random backbone protonation and PTMs that dissociate by
a lower energy pathway than that involved in the cleavage of the amide linkage. Beyond these limitations, several
biomolecule classes – O-glycopeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and modified nucleic acids, to name a few –
preferentially ionize in the negative mode and are therefore extremely difficult to sequence with current
technologies. To access these challenging biomolecules, researchers across the globe have turned to electron
transfer dissociation (ETD). Now a mainstay in proteomic technology, ETD reacts peptide cations with small
molecule anions. That said, future breakthroughs in biomolecule characterization will require key advancements
in ETD technology. First, ETD reaction rates are now an order of magnitude longer (~60–90 ms per scan) than
collision-based methods, limiting the impact ETD can have in a modern era that demands high throughput and
high sensitivity. Second, the success rate of assigning peptide sequence to ETD scans suffers for precursors
with low charge density (>1,000 m/z). That impedes ETD’s use in a number of applications, especially those
involving large biomolecules or PTMs that add mass without adding charge (e.g., glycosylation). And finally, a
variant of ETD – negative electron transfer dissociation (NETD) – has tremendous potential to allow access to
acidic biomolecules, but is not widely available because there is not yet an ion source that can produce a high
flux of the reagent cations needed to conduct the reaction. Here we leverage our deep history and expertise in
ETD to propose creative, exportable technologies that remedy these crucial bottlenecks."
10878853,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TR&D 2
Processing multiple samples in parallel in a single MS analysis – i.e., sample multiplexing – has become a
preferred method for the application of MS-based systems biology approaches to translational medicine thanks
to numerous key advantages. First, parallel processing of samples in a single mass spectrometric analysis
reduces the amount of material required from any one sample. Second, multiplexing reduces sample preparation
and instrument analysis time requirements. Third, highly plexed analyses facilitate collection of biological
replicate data. Fourth, the ability to combine samples into a single analysis permits fewer MS experiments, which
in turn allows for greater data overlap across all conditions. In this TR&D, we will develop and apply a new class
of isobaric tags for protein and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) quantitation. Specifically, the tags
will be built upon an amine-reactive N,N-dialkylated amino acid-based scaffold that is compatible with electron
transfer dissociation (ETD). The ultimate goal of this aim is to determine how to most effectively combine the
efficiencies of multiplexed quantification with the advantages of ETD for labile PTM identification. Second, we
will develop and apply chemical tags for multiplexed quantification with data independent acquisition (DIA). To
date, only metabolic labels have been successful in multiplexing analysis for DIA. Here we will continue to
develop our mass defect-based chemical tag, amine-reactive dimethyl pyrimidinyl ornithine (DiPyrO) tags, to
facilitate multiplexed quantitative DIA applications. These tags will offer up to 10-plex DIA quantification, bringing
multiplexed capacity for this emergent technology. Third, we will improve MS hardware for isobaric tag
technology. In particular, we will use gas-phase ion/ion reactions to purify the target analyte and remove
contaminants, thereby improving the quantitative accuracy of isobaric tagging. And, to improve precision, we will
leverage infrared photo-activation to completely release all reporter tags, thereby boosting signal."
10878859,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TR&D 3
MS is a popular and powerful technique for measuring proteomes, metabolomes, and lipidomes. For each of
these classes, the MS analysis is remarkably similar, consisting of chromatographic separation, mass
measurement, and tandem MS. Despite this commonality, nearly all MS laboratories specialize in analysis of a
single ome, at the exclusion of the others. The integrated workflow we describe will overcome this limitation by
providing a chromatography and MS technology capable of separating and characterizing a complex mixture
containing peptides, metabolites, and lipids. We envision this to happen in a few hours of analysis time and to
provide comprehensive coverage across omes. Here we lay the foundation for this work by eliminating existing
shortcomings in proteomics and lipidomic technologies and commence work on an integrated multi-omic platform
that allows for simultaneous analysis of peptides, lipids, and metabolites. First, work by us and others has
demonstrated that with the latest high MS/MS sampling rates, the primary limitation preventing deeper single-
shot proteome analysis is peptide separations. Second, we have identified two primary obstacles limiting
lipidomic analyses: (1) Poor separation of isomeric and isobaric lipid species, which often co-elute such that the
number of unique lipid species and their quantities cannot be determined. (2) MS/MS bandwidth is limited and
often consumed by redundant sampling of in-source fragments, adducts, and dimers. Finally, presently, most
multi-omic studies split biological samples so that each omic analysis is conducted separately – from sample
preparation to data analysis – by different people with different MS systems. This fragmentation results in
substantial hands-on sample preparation labor and instrument acquisition time. Sample-to-sample
heterogeneity, independent sample handling, and instrument-to-instrument variance all contribute noise, thereby
obscuring otherwise strong biomolecular associations."
10878863,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DRIVING BIOMEDICAL PROJECTS
The high-level goals of our Resource are to accelerate the pace, depth, and accuracy of protein and PTM
quantification, and to empower the scientific community to make new, impactful discoveries with these
technologies. Initially, our TR&Ds were influenced by a clear need in the broad field of metabolism for new
technologies that could accelerate discovery. Using our expertise in this field, we recruited world-class scientists
who devised projects that served as robust testbeds for our TR&Ds. Many of these projects have been driven to
completion while others have remained active and have influenced new TR&Ds. These interactions – and the
broad utility of our technologies – have led to a natural expansion of our focus areas. We have also become
better calibrated on our capabilities and bandwidth, allowing us to shoulder a broad swath of projects with
efficiency and high success rates. For Cycle 2, two overarching DBP themes motivate our Resource’s technology
development: Theme 1. New, metabolite-derived post-translational modifications (PTMs). The ability of PTMs
such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation to regulate signaling and protein turnover has long been established,
and we have accelerated discoveries in this space through our original DBPs. Now, the scientific community is
experiencing a renaissance of interest in how understudied modifications exert control over protein function in
diverse cell biological contexts. These include methylation, acylation, glycosylation, and hydroxylation.
Additionally, modifications to other biological species, such as glycosylated nucleic acids, are emerging as
exciting, unexplored areas of biology. Many of these modifications are directly derived from central metabolites,
thus intimately linking them to the metabolic state of the cell. Theme 2. Large-scale systems and multi-omics
analyses to explore physiology and metabolism. The sequencing of the human genome, a watershed moment
for biology, set a framework for deep understanding of genes and their functions. Next-generation sequencing
has greatly accelerated our ability to measure the expression levels of these genes, thereby giving us a surface-
level understanding of how cellular processes are changing under contrasting states. Nonetheless, myriad large-
scale analyses have revealed a marginal protein/RNA correlation (R ~ 0.5), demonstrating the need for protein
measurements of comparable depth and precision. Similarly, comprehensive analyses of lipid and metabolite
abundance have revealed that protein expression alone is insufficient to predict metabolite levels, which are
further affected by protein modifications and substrate availability, among other influences. Collectively, these
observations have mandated the development of integrated, multi-omic analyses that provide a more holistic
picture of a biological state."
10840473,"ABSTRACT
Talaromycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei (Tm) is an invasive mycosis endemic in
Southeast Asia. Tm causes a multi-organ disseminated infection that kills one in three affected persons with an
immunocompromised condition despite antifungal therapy. Persons with advanced HIV disease (AHD, CD4<200
cells/L) have the greatest risk and account for 90% of diagnosed cases globally. In highly-endemic countries of
Vietnam, Thailand, and China, Tm accounts for 18% of HIV-related hospital admissions and surpasses
tuberculosis and cryptococcosis as the leading cause of AIDS deaths. An impediment to reducing talaromycosis
mortality is our reliance on century-old diagnostic methods of culture which lack sensitivity and can take up to
28 days, leading to treatment delay and higher mortality. The scientific premise of this proposal is that early
diagnosis of talaromycosis (up to 16 weeks before culture diagnosis) using a novel point-of-care test (POCT) is
achievable, thus would enable early treatment and improve patient outcomes. We will engage multidisciplinary
team science to translate a first-in-kind POC technology from bench to bedside to policy, and we will pave a way
for an active screen-and-treat strategy to reduce disease burden and HIV mortality in Southeast Asia.
Our objective is to develop, optimize, and validate a novel POCT for early diagnosis and for screening of
talaromycosis, and to gather inputs from stakeholders to inform the development of a talaromycosis screening
program in people with AHD. Contact MPI Le and colleagues have developed a sensitive and specific enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) targeting a Tm-specific mannoprotein Mp1p abundantly secreted in patient blood and urine
during infection. She has shown that Mp1p is a more sensitive biomarker than blood culture for diagnosis and
can be detected up to 16 weeks before blood culture turns positive. MPI Chilkoti has pioneered the D4 POCT—
a self-contained immunoassay that can quantify Mp1p levels in <30 minutes. Herein, we propose the translation
of the Mp1p EIA onto the Mp1p D4 POCT to provide a rapid, cheap, and ultra-sensitive test for talaromycosis.
AIM 1: Develop and optimize a Mp1p D4 point-of-care test (POCT) for early diagnosis of talaromycosis in
human blood, serum, and urine.
AIM 2: Determine the clinical utility of the Mp1p D4 POCT as a rapid diagnostic tool for symptomatic
 talaromycosis and as a screening tool for pre-clinical disease in two cohorts of patients with AHD.
 AIM 3: Determine the cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of implementing a public health
 talaromycosis screening program.
Impact: This proposal will translate a novel POC technology from ‘bench to bedside to policy’, forging a paradigm
shift from passive treatment to an active screen-and-treat approach that will improve the individual patient
outcome and reduce disease burden at the population level. It will build important partnerships with the health
system and community and facilitate the implementation of a talaromycosis screening program in Vietnam."
10897301,"Abstract/Summary:
Commonly used animal models of HIV-1 include infection of macaques with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus
(SIV) or Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) containing HIV envelope (Env) or reverse transcriptase.
These animal models have been extremely useful in understanding HIV pathogenesis and disease progression,
as well as understanding the efficacy of vaccines and drugs. However, the genetic difference between HIV-1
and SIV, and the absence of other HIV-1 genes such as gag, pol, vif, vpr, and nef in SHIV limits the utility of
these models in vaccine studies. Ideally, good animal model of HIV-1 infection/AIDS would be infection of
macaques with HIV-1. However, HIV-1 does not replicate in macaque cells due to the presence of retroviral
restriction factors. HIV-1 can be made to replicate by substituting its accessory genes with SIV genes such as
vif, vpx, vpr, and nef, which can counteract interferon-induced restriction factors in macaque cells. Human-Simian
Immunodeficiency Virus (HSIV) is an HIV-1NL4-3 derivative with SIV vif gene substitution (named HSIV-vifNL4-3)
that can replicate persistently in pigtail macaques (PTMs). However, infection did not result in high peak viremia
and setpoint viral loads as observed during SIV infection of macaques. Serial in vivo passaging in PTMs was
performed to enhance infectivity or replicative capacity of HSIV. Three rounds of animal-to-animal transfer of
infected blood in 3 immunocompetent PTMs with starting initial inoculum containing a mixture of CXCR4- (HSIV-
vifNL4-3 recovered from previously infected macaque) and CCR5-tropic HSIV (HSIV-vif derivative based on pNL-
AD8 and Bru-Yu2) was conducted to generate pathogenic variants. Interestingly, all the macaques showed peak
viremia close to or above 105 copies/ml and virus replication persisted for more than 20 weeks. Following in vivo
passaging, three infectious molecular clones (IMCs) were recovered from passage 3 macaque (HSIV-P3 IMCs).
Sequencing of HSIV-P3 IMCs showed several interesting mutations throughout the genome, perhaps suggesting
adaptation to PTMs. These mutations could help the virus in overcoming restriction factors, or better utilization
of host dependency factors, or they could help the virus escape host immune responses. Focus of this grant
application is to determine the functional significance of mutations observed in envelope gene. The results from
this study will provide valuable insights into the role of envelope gene in cross-species transmission of HIV-1 to
pigtailed macaques."
10896023,"Abstract
In glioblastoma (GBM), cancer cells break away from the tumor mass and infiltrate into adjacent brain tissue.
Like other poor-prognosis cancers, GBM has been extensively analyzed by genome-wide transcriptomic
analyses. This has led to the identification of 3-4 subtypes that span a spectrum of states from “Proneural” (PN)
to “Mesenchymal” (MES). While the identification of subtypes is intriguing, it has yet to produce clinically-
actionable mechanistic insight. In our unpublished work, we discovered key mechanical signatures of these two
subtypes. Using our Sleeping Beauty (SB) immunocompetent genetically-induced mouse glioma model, we
found that the oncogenic driver NRasG12V promotes a MES-like phenotype and the oncogenic driver PDGFβ
promotes a PN-like phenotype. In addition, we found that NRas-driven tumors migrate fast and generate large
traction forces, while PDGFβ-driven tumors migrate slowly and generate weaker traction forces, features we also
observe with human cells in brain tissue. Thus, the two subtypes may each have their own distinct mechanical
weaknesses that can be effectively targeted. Since brute force trial-and-error of possible targets is not feasible,
we will manage complexity using the modeling approach that is widely used in engineering. As pointed out in the
Overall section of this proposal, the mobility of the cancer cells and the antitumoral T cells are both critical
determinants of tumor progression/regression, so we will apply our recently published “Cell Migration
Simulator” (CMS1.0) to cancer and immune cell migration and use experimental microscopy measurements
made in brain tissue to identify the model parameters for the two GBM subtypes. This will then allow us to identify
key mechanical vulnerabilities that will be tested using digital multiplex T cell genome engineering (as described
in Project 3) and will provide a computational platform for application to pancreatic cancer and immune cells (in
Project 2). To simulate the multicellular migration, proliferation, and immune-mediated killing dynamics, we will
apply our “Brownian Dynamics Tumor Simulator” (BDTS1.0) to predict the overall tumor dynamics of the
NRas (MES) and PDGFβ (PN) tumors. Interestingly, like the human disease, the NRas (MES) tumors are
immunologically ‘hot’, while the PDGFβ (PN) tumors are immunologically ‘cold’. Thus, the BDTS1.0, once
developed for these two subtypes of brain tumors, will allow us to predict the effects of emergent immunotherapy
concepts developed by our team, including CD200 peptide therapy and Peptide Alarm Therapy. By
constraining the simulators with data obtained by live cell fluorescence microscopy, we will develop a multiscale
computational model that provides mechanistic de-risking and optimization to maximize the physical proximity
and encounter frequency between antitumoral T cells and cancer cells. Together the modeling and experiments
will allow us to test our central hypothesis that T cell proximity to cancer cells is a major determinant of
successful immunotherapy of solid tumors."
10896031,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an extremely lethal disease with the lowest 1-year and 5-year survival
rates of any cancer. This is due, in part, to the extremely metastatic behavior of pancreas carcinoma cells and
their extreme resistance to both chemical and radiotherapies. Importantly, we now know that a strong, but
nevertheless unique, fibrotic and immunosuppressive stromal response is present in PDA. This intense
fibroinflammatory, or desmoplastic, response is essentially pathognomonic for PDA and limits infiltration of
anti-tumor immune cells and also their ability to move throughout and sample the tumor volume. Indeed,
immunotherapies with immune checkpoint blockade or infusion of genetically modified cells are producing
remarkable clinical responses in other advanced malignancies, but to date, success has been much more
limited in PDA. However, focused preclinical strategies to disrupt the stroma or specifically engineer T cell
therapies have shown promise in PDA. Thus, understanding the molecular basis for engineered T cell
infiltration and identifying strategies to further enhance their infiltration, migration throughout tumor masses,
and persistence and function in cancer will inform cell engineering strategies for improved treatment. Here, we
test a number of focused hypotheses using integrated experiments, advanced imaging, and mathematical
modeling to elucidate engineered T cell migratory mechanisms both in vivo and in engineered platforms in vitro
and utilize genome editing and overexpression to engineer T cells that can maximally infiltrate and move
throughout complex tumor microenvironments. We hypothesize that by enhancing the ability of engineered T
cells to move throughout tumor we can profoundly improve their efficacy and employ combinations of stroma
targeting and T cell therapies to improve disease outcomes. We will dissect mechanisms governing infiltration,
longevity and functionality of engineered T cells and determine how engineered T cell migrate within the
physically complex tumor environments. This information will be used engineer T cells that most effectively
move throughout the entire tumor mass. Using these cells, we will perform rigorous preclinical evaluation of
our engineered T cell approach in concert with rational stroma re-engineering. Our goals are aligned with
Projects 1 and 3 where we seek to collectively elucidate fundamental mechanisms of immune cell migration
and to innovate novel cell engineering approaches to eradicate cancer."
10913543,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although HIV remains a major global health problem, strategies such as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) can
reduce the incidence of new infections. However, the antiretrovirals used for HIV prevention have been
associated with increased enteric inflammation in individuals using them. We hypothesize that their broad activity
affects both the viral and bacterial communities of the gut, causing local inflammation which may cause epithelial
dysfunction and increase microbial translocation and systemic inflammation.
We propose a series of metagenomic experiments to characterize the inflammatory contributions of intestinal
viruses and bacteria and their changes with PrEP. For this novel research, we must first enroll a cohort of
participants starting HIV PrEP and a similar group of control participants not using PrEP. We will collect blood
and stool samples at baseline and after three months. First, we will characterize the virome fromstool specimens
using metagenomic sequencing of filtered viral particles and compare the changes of within- and between-
individual diversity in the participants on PrEP and those in the control group (aim 1). Next, we will use
metagenomic sequencing to characterize stool bacterial populations, including prophages (aim 2). We will
computationally predict bacterial targets of bacteriophages, then culture the identified virus-bacterial pairs from
participant specimens. Using these cultures, we will validate the predicted interactions and assess the ability of
PrEP to disrupt them. Finally, we will measure inflammatory markers in stool and blood and use the viral and
bacterial abundances to identify which organisms are most strongly associated with inflammation (aim 3). These
experiments will identify viruses and bacteria which interact with each other and with PrEP and define their
impact on host inflammation.
Dr. Maust’s career development plan builds on his background in computational biology, and lab expertise in
analyzing bacterial communities by marker gene sequencing and adds training in metagenomic sequencing,
biostatistical techniques, and methods for viral and bacterial culture. This K08 award is a well-structured way for
him to make maximal use of UW and Seattle Children’s extensive scientific resources to achieve independence
as a physician scientist, advancing his career goal to understand microbial interactions as they impact host
immunity to guide therapeutic interventions."
10918089,"The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  One to two percent of adults in the U.S. have asymptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid artery exceeding 50% luminal narrowing. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. The findings of trials assessing the efficacy of revascularization begun in the 1980’s and 1990’s that showed efficacy of revascularization are now in question because of improvements in medical therapy to prevent atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis and concurrent improvements in revascularization by endarterectomy and by carotid stenting.  To address the question of how best to treat patients with ≥70% carotid bifurcation stenosis to prevent stroke, we are currently completing the first funding cycle for the CREST-2 trials. CREST-2 is a pair of parallel randomized, multicenter trials with the primary aims: 1) to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management (IMM) vs. carotid endarterectomy plus IMM (n=1240), and 2) to compare the effectiveness of IMM vs. carotid stenting plus IMM (n=1240). The primary endpoint is a composite of any stroke or death within 44 days of randomization (periprocedural risk) plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. An important secondary endpoint is cognitive function, assessed periodically and by a centralized, standardized computer- aided telephone interview. Endpoints are assessed in a manner blinded to treatment assignment. IMM involves central management of vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia. Primary risk factor therapeutic targets are systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and a low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL. IMM also includes telephone-delivered periodic lifestyle coaching. Preliminary data show that the IMM has significantly favorably improved vascular risk factors across treatment arms. As of October 26, 2020, a total of 70% (1734/2480) of the required patients have been randomized across the US, Canada, and Spain. All procedures are performed only by rigorously credentialed surgeons and interventionists. IMM and revascularization procedures are being successfully delivered. Cross- overs and withdrawal from the study are within design assumptions, and the quality of the data is high. CREST-2 supports a companion ancillary study known as CREST-H (NCT03121209) that tests the cognitive implications of revascularization in patients with hemispheric hypoperfusion. We are requesting support to complete recruitment, complete follow-up of the cohort (2-years after recruitment of last patient), and report study results."
10813048,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) are the most common cause of morbidity in the Veteran population. Medical costs for U.S. Veterans of
Iraq and Afghanistan could be enormous because of differences between these wars and previous conflicts
due to today’s Veterans surviving injuries that would have been fatal in previous wars, and ""polytraumatic""
injuries that require decades of costly physical and social rehabilitation. With no prevention or treatment,
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions could reach 11-16 million by 2050. In addition to age-related
neurodegeneration, depression among the elderly has been estimated to increase health care costs by 50%
and increase outpatient costs by 43 to 52% in these individuals compared to non-depressed patients. With this
growing Veteran population is an increase in chronic health conditions, and social and financial burdens on
their families and the health care system. Neurodegeneration diseases are closely associated with decreased
neuronal signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of synapses and neuromuscular junctions. Since receiving
the VA CDA in 2009, the Head laboratory has focused on targeting molecular mechanisms (via genetic and/or
pharmacologic interventions) to evoke functional neuronal and synaptic plasticity to improve cognitive and
motor function in the neurodegenerative brain and spinal cord respectively. As a result of continuous funding
from the VA (3 Merits since 2011) and NIH (NINDS R01 2011), in 2012 Dr. Head was bestowed the
Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) through the Department of Veterans
Affairs, which is the highest honor given by the United States Government to early-stage scientist and
engineers. Specifically, the Head laboratory investigates how caveolin (Cav), a cholesterol binding and
scaffolding protein within membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs), regulates synaptic signaling, mitochondrial function,
and neuroplasticity in neuronal models in vitro using human neurons derived from iPSCs and in animal models
of neurodegeneration such as AD and ALS. Cav-1 is a cholesterol-binding and membrane protein that is
essential for MLR formation and MLR-localization of neurotrophin receptors and synaptic proteins necessary
for synaptic function and neuroplasticity. Dr. Head engineered a genetic construct that contains a neuron-
targeted promoter (synapsin) to drive the expression of Cav-1 (termed SynCav1) specifically in neurons to
evoke neuroprotection and functional plasticity in the setting of disease or following traumatic injury (work
funded by NINDS, VA, and DoD). Dr. Head patented this novel gene therapy through the U.S. Patent Office in
March 2015 (U.S. Patent No. 8,969,077 B2: Neuronal specific targeting of caveolin expression to restore
synaptic signaling and improve cognitive function in the neurodegenerative brain and motor function in spinal
cord) of which the VA and UCSD are owners. The Head laboratory published several seminal studies
demonstrating that exogenous delivery of SynCav1 (using AAV9) promotes hippocampal synaptic and
neuroplasticity, significantly improves learning and memory in aged mice and in AD mice, the latter
independent of reducing amyloid plaques. More recently, Dr. Head’s group showed that spinal cord delivery of
AAV9-SynCav1 protects and preserves spinal motor neuron and neuromuscular junction morphology, motor
function, delays disease onset, and extends longevity in a mouse model of familial (F)ALS, without reducing
the toxic monogenic component (mutant hSOD1). Furthermore, SynCav1 delivery preserved neuromuscular
function in a rat model of FALS. The latter findings strongly indicate the therapeutic applicability of SynCav1 to
treat ALS attributed to monogenic (FALS) and potentially in sporadic cases (i.e., SALS). Dr. Head’s long-term
goal is to translate this gene therapy to the clinical setting to treat Veterans suffering from neurodegenerative
conditions such as AD and ALS."

10925271,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
 The WU-RDRRC seeks to advance the health of patients with rheumatic diseases by supporting enabling
technology and promoting the members’ basic, clinical, and translational research interests that are organized
around three major themes: 1) elucidating basic mechanisms of inflammation and autoimmunity; 2)
accelerating clinical/translational research to inform precision medicine; and 3) advancing genome engineering
and regenerative medicine to develop new treatment approaches for rheumatic diseases.
 We posit that translational research endeavors in rheumatic diseases require a team approach cultivated in
a vibrant environment and supported by cross-disciplinary groups of experts and cutting-edge technologies.
Over the past four years, this operational philosophy and the infrastructure supported by the WU-RDRRC
perfectly positioned our investigators to increase the efficiency and impact of their research, allowed them to
quickly address emergent issues that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, and helped a number of young
investigators obtain extramural funding and successfully transition to research independence. The WU-
RDRRC propose to continue promoting rheumatic disease research by: 1) providing the infrastructure,
education, and training needed to assist investigators with the experimental and scientific design of their
projects; 2) organizing and supporting Core laboratories that will adopt and apply innovative technologies and
expertise that would otherwise be unavailable to investigators in a cost-effective manner; 3) promoting interest
in rheumatic diseases research by engaging multidisciplinary teams and bringing together diverse disciplines
and clinical divisions to address roadblocks in translational science; 4) fostering the next generation of junior
investigators who are interested in the study of rheumatic disease-related areas.
 To accomplish our goals we propose four cores: 1) a Biobank and Phenotyping Core to collect high-quality
biospecimens for downstream molecular analysis; 2) a Genome Engineering Core to generate bioengineered
cell-based therapies, knockin/knockout mice for testing in preclinical disease models; 3) a Cellular Imaging
Core that offers novel microscopy technologies for building models of health and disease; and 4) an
Administrative Core that promotes collaborative and synergistic interactions among rheumatic disease
researchers and the mentoring of junior and new investigators interested in rheumatic disease research.
 In addition, we will address members’ evolving needs by expanding access to novel technologies such as
spatial transcriptomics, and the changing societal landscape by incorporating social determinants of health into
clinical data collection, and enhancing diversity of trainees entering the physician-scientist pathway."
10915632,"SUMMARY. Radiation therapy (RT) and immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors are used in early and relapsed
head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC), respectively; RT failures are common, and most patients do
not respond to PD-1 inhibition. Both impact the tumor microenvironment (TME), but studying the TME is limited
by the availability of models with human immune cells. PI3K/mTOR signaling regulates protein synthesis through
transcription factors such as Myc or SOX2, that dictate growth, invasion, and drug resistance in HNSCC. SVC112
is a fully synthetic small molecule that inhibits protein synthesis at the elongation step by inhibiting eEF2. SVC112
had greater effect on cancer over non-cancer cells, and was more potent and selective than homoharringtonin
(HHT), an FDA-approved translation elongation inhibitor. Cancer cells had higher eEF2 than non-cancer cells,
and the most susceptible strain had the highest eEF2 expression. SVC112 depleted SOX2, Myc, and Cyclin D1
in HNSCC cells at concentrations that had minimal effect on the rest of the proteome. SVC112 decreased
spheres in vitro, reduced tumor growth in vivo in patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and induced tumor regression
when given with RT in three out of four PDX models. SVC112 also reduced the E6 oncoprotein in human
papillomavirus-driven cells. Lastly, SVC112 decreased PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) resulting in decreased PD-L1:PD-1
interactions leading to increased sphere T cell invasion, while having no effect on T cell fitness or function. Thus,
SVC112 can target multiple key pathways (SOX2, Myc, PD-L1), and can influence the TME to reverse immune
evasion. To test SVC112’s therapeutic potential in HNSCC, several unique tools will be used including 1) spheres
containing cancer cells and T cells (iSpheres) that enable studying TME interactions and immunotherapy in vitro,
2) syngeneic mouse models of HNSCC, and 3) humanized mouse (HM) models, developed by the PI, that enable
studying TME interactions and immunotherapy in vivo. The hypothesis that SVC112’s discriminating effect is
due to selective depletion of key proteins will be tested by ribosome profiling (to identify mRNA targets) and
proteomics analysis (to identify proteins targets). Then, we will test the mechanism of SVC112 synergy with RT,
and if the modulation of the TME by SVC112 will further enhance RT efficacy. Lastly, the hypothesis that
reduction of PD-L1 by SVC112 in HNSCC will alter the tumor-immune interaction will be tested by defining the
effect of SVC112 on the expression of proteins critical for the TME, T cell tumor infiltration, and cancer-immune
crosstalk. The effect of SVC112 on T cell fitness and function will be examined, aiding SVC112 translation. We
will assess SVC112 and PD-1 inhibition in iSphere and HM models, and explore their efficacy when both are
combined. Lastly, we will test the predictive value of eEF2 in SVC112 susceptibility, and we will assess eEF2
expression in human tumors, to enable identifying a companion biomarker to SVC112, using a HNSCC tissue
bank with 1,250 patient cases. This project will propel the translation of SVC112, a drug discovered in Colorado,
by dissecting the basis for its effect, studying its toxicity, and testing predictive biomarkers to aid clinical trials."
10909267,"Cirrhosis is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States and its incidence is rising. Major causes of
cirrhosis include chronic viral infections (hepatitis B and C), alcohol-associated cirrhosis (ALD) and non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Stable compensated cirrhosis offers an opportunity to intervene to prevent
progression to decompensation and thereby reduce liver-related deaths. Two stages of compensated cirrhosis
are recognized; with stage 2 identified by the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH,
defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient of 10 mmHg or higher). Statins are a novel drug class for
consideration in treatment of cirrhosis as preliminary data show reductions in both portal hypertension and
improved survival and offer promise as a therapeutic intervention in stage 2 compensated cirrhosis. This
multicenter study will establish a prospective cohort of 2000 patients with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH for
longitudinal follow-up of changes in clinical, lifestyle, laboratory, and imaging characteristics combined with a
rich biospecimen collection for future translational studies. Genetic variants, especially the role of patatin-like
phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA-3), in cirrhosis progression and response to statin therapy.
The primary goal of this longitudinal cohort is to characterize that natural history of compensated cirrhosis in a
representative and contemporary population, and to refine the risk profiles for progression versus non-
progression. Additionally, social determinants of health and their influence on healthcare engagement and
promotion of healthy liver lifestyle will be examined, with further exploration of how these factors affects liver-
related outcomes. Finally, a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of rosuvastatin will be conducted in
200 patients with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH due to treated hepatitis B or C, ALD or NASH. The
treatment duration is 96 weeks with the primary endpoint being survival without decompensation. Secondary
endpoints include liver-related mortality, cardiovascular events, diabetes and statin safety, including rates of
hepatotoxicity and myotoxicity. The City of Angeles Clinical Center for Cirrhosis (CACC), located at the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles, has a unique, ethnically diverse population, that well-
represents the population experiencing rising rates of cirrhosis. Through this collaborative network, CACC will
contribute to an: 1) enhanced patient-centered model of care; 2) build a rich biorepository to support
ancillary and translational studies to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of cirrhosis progression
and regression; and 3) conduct a rigorous clinical trial to define the role of statins, with particular attention
to the role of PNPLA3 genetic variants on efficacy. Ultimately, the goal of these studies is to improve the
clinical outcomes of patients with compensated cirrhosis, especially those from underrepresented
minorities."
10702127,"Chronic pain affects approximately 20 million veterans as about 1 in 3 Veterans have been diagnosed with a
condition related to chronic pain.
There is also a significant interaction between chronic pain, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), and persistent post-concussive syndromes common to the veteran population. Opioids
prescribed to treat chronic pain are often less than effective and are
associated with a significantly increased
risk of misuse, addiction, diversion, overdose, and death. Unconventional treatment options that can effectively
manage pain and avoid or reduce opioid addiction in Veterans are of significant clinical importance to VA
healthcare. Given the high morbidity and mortality attributable to pain therapy, not to mention the staggering
medical cost, it is vital to the VA healthcare mission to explore novel strategies to effectively treat chronic pain.
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an inflammatory disease characterized by pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis, and
abdominal pain. CP patients often suffer extreme pain that shares common underlying mechanisms compared
to chronic pain caused by other reasons seen in the VA population. CP pain, therefore, provides a valuable
model for the treatment of pain syndromes, and improving the management of CP pain may translate to a non-
opioid treatment option for Veterans. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that can be
harvested and expanded for therapy. MSC therapy represents a promising new intervention as increasing
evidence demonstrates that MSC therapy can effectively target several injury pathways in a variety of
fibroinflammatory diseases and can reduce pain while suppressing inflammation, something that most
pharmacological interventions cannot accomplish.
Data from animal models and clinical trials support the outstanding and durable effects of MSC infusion in the
suppression of chronic neurological pain and inflammation associated with chronic pain. The goal of this
application is to test whether an infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) can reduce
pain associated with CP and to explore the potential mechanism of MSC action. Our specific aims are: Aim 1:
Determine the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of the MSC therapy in reducing pain and disease
remission in patients with painful CP. We will perform a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
single-dose study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of MSC therapy in CP patients with severe
abdominal pain. This clinical trial will enroll 40 subjects. Aim 2: Elucidate potential mechanisms of action of
MSC therapy by assaying immune cell subsets and gene expression, serum neuropeptides, and inflammatory
cytokines. We will measure changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets, and inflammatory
cytokines levels in patients receiving placebo or cell therapy to elucidate potential indicators of treatment
efficiency. If successful, improving the management for CP pain may translate to other disease states with pain
and opioid addiction specifically related to the VA population."
10842242,"Abstract
The primary purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F30 application is to provide the groundwork that will
prepare the applicant for an academic medical career. Much of the applicant’s career development will come
from work in alcohol comorbidity-related research. Alcohol is the most abused substance in the United States
with about one-quarter of the adult population partaking in heavy and/or binge drinking. Chronic alcohol
consumption also disrupts glucose homeostasis and is associated with the development of insulin resistance.
The immune system plays a comprehensive and understated role in adipose tissue and systemic metabolism
surveilling and responding to specific metabolic signals through a set of processes termed immunometabolism.
Results from our previous studies suggest that alcohol-induced mesenteric lymphatic leakage and subsequent
perilymphatic adipose tissue inflammation may be a primary event in the development of systemic
immunometabolic dysregulation seen in chronic alcohol use. Previously our lab has demonstrated that chronic
alcohol induced lymphatic leakage, increased CD3+ and CD4+ T cells, fTregs, and IL-6 in PLAT. Our studies
have also shown that chronic alcohol led to decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in PLAT. We
speculate that cells or molecules leaking from lymphatic vessels into PLAT stimulate fTreg expansion and lead
to PLAT metabolic dysregulation. Taken together, published and preliminary data support the hypothesis that
lymph contents from alcohol-treated animals disrupt PLAT immune and metabolic homeostasis
through fTreg expansion. The proposed study will employ a wide variety of techniques to test the hypothesis
using three specific aims: (1) Lymph from alcohol-treated animals will expand FOXP3+ fTregs in naïve PLAT
explants via IL33/ST2 signaling pathway, (2) alcohol-induced fTreg expansion contributes to metabolic
dysregulation in PLAT, and (3) alcohol-induced PLAT metabolic dysregulation is associated with systemic
metabolic consequences. Findings from the proposed studies will provide insight on the deleterious effects of
alcohol-associated lymph leakage and how its constituents impact PLAT immune cell milieu, specifically
fTregs, contributing to development of PLAT IR and potentially systemic IR. With a strong mentoring team
committed to developing a well-rounded physician scientist, completion of the proposed training plan will
ensure that the applicant is ready to embark on a career in academic medicine."
10915507,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common cancer overall in the U.S. and
causes substantial morbidity, with a significant risk of metastatic spread and death. Treatment options are limited
in unresectable cases, which are estimated at up to 40,000 per year. Advances in treatment have been hindered
by incomplete knowledge of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in cSCC, particularly regarding how different tumor
subpopulations behave within a growing tumor. ITH can be driven by cell-intrinsic abnormalities within cancer
cells, but increasing evidence suggests that cancer cells communicate with diverse cell types, such as immune
or stromal cells, in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to coordinate malignant behavior such as invasion. Thus,
a deeper understanding of how ITH arises in cSCC, from both TME and cell-intrinsic contributions, has the
potential to yield new treatment strategies.
 Recent discovery of a novel subpopulation of cSCC tumor cells was facilitated through single-cell profiling of
patient cSCC tumors. This tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) subpopulation was found to express a gene
signature that was absent in normal skin, suggestive of invasive capacity, and associated with worse prognosis
across several epithelial cancers. Spatial profiling demonstrated that TSKs resided at the tumor leading edge
adjacent to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), suggesting that crosstalk among these cell types in the TME
may control TSK cell state or function. Global ligand-receptor analyses integrating single-cell and spatial data
nominated specific CAF-derived ligands matched with receptors expressed by TSKs, including several integrins.
Integrin signaling genes mediating TME signals were required for tumor growth in CRISPR screens in vivo,
including ITGB1, FERMT1, CD151, and ARPC2. Thus, these data support a model in which signals derived from
TME cells proximal to TSKs promote tumorigenesis and potential invasion through ITGB1-mediated signaling.
 Through two specific aims, this work will determine if blocking cSCC-specific CAF-derived factors and
disabling cancer subpopulation-intrinsic factors can impede TSK formation and subsequent tumor invasion and
progression in preclinical models. Aim I will employ a human organoid model of cSCC to assess the contribution
of CAF-derived ligands toward emergence of TSKs and invasion through genetic ablation and therapeutic
blockade. Aim II will determine how TSK subpopulation-specific factors cooperate to facilitate invasion in
organoids and tumorigenesis in xenograft mouse models through genetic manipulation of cancer cells to prevent
factor interaction. This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Paul Khavari, a physician-scientist
and expert in skin cancer genetics, at Stanford University, a world-class research institution. These studies could
aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat unresectable cSCC and lead to a deeper molecular
understanding of pathways enabling tumor invasion, heterogeneity, and progression."
10910903,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have revolutionized the field of solid tumor oncology - in particular, they
have played a substantial role in improving the survival of patients with advanced lung or bladder cancer.
However, despite clinical successes, immune checkpoint inhibitors are not effective in all cases, and may be
associated with serious immune-related adverse events. This application is in response to the National Cancer
Institute’s Provocative Question #8: “What are the predictive biomarkers for the onset of immune-related adverse
events (irAE) associated with checkpoint inhibition, and are they related to markers for efficacy?” The goal of the
proposed studies is to identify T cell biomarkers that predict autoimmune-related irAE associated with ICI
therapy. The central hypothesis for the proposed studies is that the frequency and phenotype of T cells
specific for self-antigens predicts autoimmune irAE, which in turn predicts therapeutic efficacy in some
patients. The following four Specific Aims will address this hypothesis. Aim 1 studies will determine how immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy alters the frequency and phenotype(s) of tumor- and autoantigen-specific T cells
using an innovative approach to isolate antigen-specific T cells, and a longitudinal cohort of subjects before and
after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Aim 2 studies will use an innovative single cell RNA-sequencing
approach to determine if expanded T cell clones arise with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and whether
these T cells have phenotypic or functional properties predictive of anti-tumor and autoimmune responses. Aim
3 studies will determine whether immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy alters the CD4 and CD8 T cell landscape
in cancer making it similar to that seen in individuals with natural autoimmunity. Aim 4 studies will test the
hypothesis that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy releases quiescent autoreactive T cells from regulation,
leading to increased frequency and activation distinct from the global T cell response. Together, these studies
will systematically elucidate the relationship between tumor- and auto- immunity following immune checkpoint
inhibitor therapy, and will provide insight into the potential of T cell biomarkers to predict clinical outcome."
10870044,"Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias represent an increasing burden on society, with an estimated
5.8 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. A major barrier to progress in Alzheimer’s disease
research is a lack of suitable animal models that (1) show pathological hallmarks and clinical features similar to
those seen in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and (2) have similar genetic and environmental heterogeneity
to people. The privately-owned companion dog uniquely captures both of these features.
 The Dog Aging Project (DAP) is a consortium of investigators with the shared goal of understanding the
biological aging process, including age-related cognitive changes and dementia, in companion dogs through
large-scale longitudinal study and clinical evaluation of putative healthspan-promoting interventions. More than
50,000 companion dogs will ultimately be enrolled in the DAP Pack, for which detailed owner survey information
is collected annually, including the gold standard cognitive assessment questionnaire for diagnosis of canine
cognitive dysfunction (CCD). A high-resolution “Precision Group” of 1,000 dogs are being studied in much
greater depth, including full genome sequencing, veterinarian-reviewed electronic medical records (VEMRs),
and annual assessments including physical exam, clinical chemistry, blood epigenome, serum metabolome, and
fecal microbiome. We propose to synergistically leverage the infrastructure of the DAP to create an unparalleled
and one-of-a-kind resource for studying Alzheimer’s-like disease in the companion dog.
 To accomplish this goal, we will (1) recruit 200 dogs with CCD into a “CCD Precision Group” which will
be studied at high resolution in parallel with the cognitively normal DAP Precision Group, including
assessments of serum abundance of AD markers such as Ab42, Tau, and hyperphosphorylated Tau, (2)
quantitatively assess proteomic and neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s-like disease in brains from 100
companion dogs who reach the end of their natural lives, and (3) create a large canine data and biospecimen
repository to support future studies of Alzheimer’s-like disease in companion dogs.
 We anticipate that successful completion of this project will not only create a rich dataset on AD-like
disease in companion dogs, but will also spur numerous follow-on studies by other investigators. It is our hope
and expectation that these resources will have a major impact on Alzheimer’s disease research far into the
future."
10910932,"The prevalence of depression is high after childbirth: rates of postpartum depression (PPD) are as high as 25%
among women without prior PPD or depression but with personal or structural risk factors such as being low-

recommends screening women for PPD. However, disparities in postpartum mental health care exist: <60% of
women attend post-partum visits where PPD screening occurs, and barriers such as lack of transportation or
childcare have been shown to not only reduce rates of postpartum visit attendance but to disproportionately
affect low-income women or women of color. In addition, the risk of PPD extends beyond 60 days post-partum,
when pregnancy-related federal health insurance often expires. Smartphone applications (apps) may increase
equity in postpartum mental health by providing long-term access to mental health treatment to most women.
Indeed, in the United States, 96% of those aged 18-29 own a smartphone, and medical apps have been shown
to improve obstetric outcomes and increase access to mental health services. Though in-person, cognitive
behavioral therapy given through the Mothers and Babies Program (MB) has been shown to reduce PPD by
53% among low-income women of color, the effect of app-provided group MB is unclear. The purpose of this
Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to enable the candidate to develop a funded
research program to optimize postpartum mental health care for low-income women of color via an innovative
technology-based intervention that may decrease their rates of PPD. To achieve this goal, training and mentor-
ship are proposed in three key areas: 1) Advanced training in mixed methods research, perinatal psychology,
digital health, and biostatistics; 2) Mentorship from a multi-disciplinary team of established researchers; and 3)
Protected time to perform patient-oriented research on the feasibility of utilizing app-provided MB as a study
intervention for low-income women of color with risk factors for PPD. Two study phases are required. First,
focus groups and interviews will optimize the study intervention, which contains MB and parenting education
(PE). Those in the intervention group will access MB+PE while those in the control group will access PE to
encourage app engagement with both study groups. This is because women in both groups will receive
bimonthly Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales (EPDS) scores from birth to six months postpartum. The
primary outcome of the proposed randomized trial is demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of app-based
MB, defined via recruitment and app usage (feasibility), and scores on the System Usability Scale and Client
Satisfaction Questionnaire (acceptability). Secondary outcomes include EDPS scores. The proposed trial will
provide critical insight into a subsequent R01-supported randomized trial designed to examine the effect of
app-based MB on PPD among low-income, racially and ethnically diverse women. If effective, app-based MB
has great potential for scalability and could increase postpartum mental health equity for most women."

The incidence of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease continues to
increase as human lifespan continues to increase. Advancements in science and healthcare have resulted in
effective therapies for many diseases but treatments for these debilitating diseases remain elusive. Many studies
on aging focus on the dysfunction of basic cellular processes, or the hallmarks of aging. These include
mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal nutrient signaling, telomere shortening, amongst many others. We recently
found that lysosomal (vacuole in yeast) deacidification is an early event in aging and precedes mitochondrial
dysfunction. Vacuole deacidification results in a loss of amino acid compartmentalization, particularly cysteine,
and this results in mitochondrial dysfunction. Amino acid restriction or supplementation with iron rescued
mitochondrial function. These previous findings demonstrate the importance of the vacuole in amino acid
homeostasis and aging. It should be noted that vacuole deacidification is a gradual process in aging and there
are likely systems that collaborate with the vacuole in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Thus, we performed a
screen to determine what genes are conditionally essential upon vacuole deacidification. We uncovered genes
involved in the ESCRT/MVB pathway as essential under these conditions. Furthermore, we also found several
genes involved in endocytosis to be conditionally essential too. The ESCRT pathway is a cellular trafficking
pathway that allows for the remodeling of the plasma membrane (PM) proteome, especially nutrient transporters.
When transporters are endocytosed, the ESCRT pathway recognizes ubiquitylated transporters and directs them
to the vacuole for degradation. The known function of the ESCRT pathway in conjunction with the vacuole’s role
in amino acid compartmentalization raises the idea that these two systems collaborate in maintaining cellular
amino acid homeostasis during the aging process. This is supported by our pilot study showing that amino acid
transporters (AATs) are indeed endocytosed upon vacuole deacidification. By using the budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we will determine how amino acid uptake and metabolite pools are affected under
conditions of vacuole deacidification. Furthermore, we will elucidate the signal that originates from dysfunctional
vacuoles that triggers AAT endocytosis and turnover. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that Aβ inhibits ESCRT-
mediated turnover of AATs and inhibits cell growth by causing amino acid toxicity. Aging remains an active field
of research but how the ESCRT pathway cooperates with the vacuole in the context of aging is understudied.
Furthermore, how Aβ expression affects cellular amino acid homeostasis is understudied. The goal of this
proposal is to elucidate a novel mechanism for cellular aging and increase our understanding of the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer’s disease."

Nearly 850,000 Americans have died from overdose in the past two decades. Stigma remains an under-
addressed central barrier to ending the drug epidemic. Substance use stigma reduces treatment and harm
reduction utilization among people who use drugs (PWUD) and is associated with increased drug use,
depression, social isolation, and numerous other psychosocial indicators of healthy functioning. Though
interventions focused on education and social contact have proven successful in reducing stigmatizing
attitudes in the public, much less is known about how to intervene on self-stigma, the negative feelings PWUD
have about their drug use. Developing strategies for PWUD to cope with and resist stigma may promote quality
of life and reduce overdose in this population. Stigma resistance is a promising approach that promotes
resilience through self-empowerment and positive identity formation. In line with NIDA’s priorities of reducing
stigma and developing recovery support strategies, the goal of this application is to develop and evaluate a
stigma resistance text message intervention for PWUD. Nested within the NIDA-funded Ohio Opioid Project
(UG3/UH3DA044822), the specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Identify PWUD self-stigma subgroups and
describe associated demographic, health, and drug use risk factors among rural PWUD in an eight-state multi-
site cohort using latent class analysis; 2) identify stigma-related attitudes and beliefs and text message content
and delivery preferences through iterative elicitation interviews with 20 rural Ohio PWUD; 3) develop a four-
week automated daily text message stigma resistance intervention; and 4) evaluate the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention in a sample of 30 rural Ohio PWUD in active
use. An iterative convergent mixed-methods design informed by health communication and behavioral health
theories will guide the development of interactive messages that are hypothesized to increase stigma
resistance and reduce self-stigma. This proposal will lay the groundwork for a self-stigma intervention and
provide further evidence for text messaging as a cost-effective, impactful modality for engaging this hard-to-
reach population. Alongside the planned research, the applicant proposes training that will enhance his
theoretical understanding of stigma, advance his quantitative analysis skills, strengthen his competence in
health communication strategies, and build his communication record through scholarly presentations and
publications. Under the expert mentorship of co-sponsor Drs. Vivian Go and William Miller and other
collaborators, this research and training plan will contribute to the applicant’s career trajectory as an
independent mixed-methods substance use and stigma researcher."
10831392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During development, the formation of heterogenous tissues, organs, and cellular networks depends on a careful
balance between cellular proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation. Once cells have fully differentiated, their
ability to proliferate or differentiate are most often lost, and so most adult cells are generally incapable of self-
regeneration or repair. The development of regenerative therapies will require harnessing this latent ability, but
first we need a deeper understanding of the processes that control it. Thus, understanding the genetic
architecture underlying quiescent progenitor behavior is key to developing and applying emerging therapies with
new technologies such as cellular reprogramming or genome editing. The objective of this proposal is to
characterize the regulation and functions of potentially important genes controlling quiescence, differentiation,
and proliferation in marine invertebrate and chordate Ciona robusta. Ciona are among our closest invertebrate
relatives, and so during development we share similar structural and molecular features. However, Ciona
undergo a dramatic conversion from larval to adult forms called metamorphosis, when the larval body plan
degenerates and is replaced by quiescent progenitors which must bypass programmed cell death to reemerge
post-metamorphosis and generate the adult body plan. One such cell population are larval neural progenitors
called Neck cells which are established in a discrete stem cell niche-like compartment. The signaling pathways
and genetic components that direct Neck entry, maintenance, and exit from quiescence remain uncharacterized.
I propose using the Neck cell population as a model to identify unique mechanisms regulating quiescence and
regeneration that can be harnessed for future therapies. The rationale for this proposal is that, by exploiting the
tractability of Ciona, the accessibility of these Neck cells, and their stereotyped cellular behaviors, I can closely
examine regulatory control of Neck cell quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. I will do so by pursuing two
specific aims. 1) To investigate the control of Neck quiescence and proliferation during the larval stage by the
integration of extracellular cues and intracellular transcriptional control. 2) To investigate a novel mechanism for
transcriptional priming and delay of Neck cell differentiation. I will pursue these aims using an innovative
approach that combines cell lineage-specific, CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic gene knockouts and fluorescence
microscopy. The expected outcomes of the proposed work include identifying previously unrecognized functions
for conserved but poorly studied genes in neurodevelopment and how their spatiotemporal regulation can be
instructive for the precise timing of quiescence. This will establish a foundation for a targeted investigation of
neurodevelopmental processes underlying a wide range of human disorders."

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is often considered the prototype hospital-acquired infection. In spite
of the billions of dollars spent on preventive measures, estimates of the incidence are in the hundreds of
thousands, with tens of thousands of people per year succumbing to disease in the USA alone. Prophylactic
vaccines against S. aureus would have an enormous impact in the healthcare fight against antibiotic-resistant
strains. In our previous studies, we used a novel method to generate next-generation whole-cell Staphylococcus
vaccine candidates that resulted in high levels of clearance in a stringent biofilm model of infection. The method
utilizes a manganese-decapeptide-phosphate (MDP) complex that has been adapted from the radiation-resistant
bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans. We propose to further develop this approach by directly comparing several
of the identified vaccine candidates and next-generation modified versions in expanded studies. Candidates will
be tested for stimulating protective immunity in biofilm pin implantation and abscess mouse models. Down-
selected “best” candidates will also be tested in a S. aureus preexposure model as different immunogens (protein
sets) circumvent deceptive immune imprinting. These experiments should allow us to categorically report which
candidate proves the most efficacious in relevant animal models, and position a candidate ready for cross-
protection, dosing, and toxicity studies to follow."

Decisions concerning anesthetic dosing typically rely on population-based measures of drug potency.
However, similar anesthetic doses have markedly different effects on distinct individuals. While some patients
recover from anesthesia uneventfully, in others, recovery is complicated by postoperative delirium and
cognitive dysfunction. Such complications are disproportionally prevalent in the elderly. It is presently unclear
why some elderly patients exhibit these debilitating and costly complications. To answer this question,
individual-based rather than population-based measures of drug effects must be developed. We create such
measures for anesthetics in mice. Preliminary data indicate that standard population-based measures of
anesthetic potency, such as half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), are insufficient to explain anesthetic
responses in each individual. This is because at a fixed anesthetic concentration, the level of consciousness in
each individual fluctuates. While fluctuations in the state of arousal occur spontaneously, there is an inertial
tendency in each animal to resist state transitions. Hence, the response in each individual depends not just
upon the anesthetic concentration, but also upon the individual’s previous state of arousal. Standard drug
potency measures fail to account for this history-dependence. Thus, to adequately quantify individual-based
responses to anesthetics, we develop two independent measures: personalized drug sensitivity and resistance
to state transitions. We hypothesize that resistance to state transitions contributes to delayed restoration of
cognitive function after anesthesia. We investigate age-dependence of resistance to state transitions in a first
of a kind longitudinal study (Aim 1). To investigate a neurobiological basis of resistance to state transitions, we
selectively decrease resistance to state transitions using chemogenetic activation of orexinergic neurons that
are critically involved in stabilization of sleep and wakefulness (Aim 2). To determine whether resistance to
state transitions is causally linked to restoration of cognition, we use a behavioral test of sustained attention
(SA) performed immediately upon recovery after anesthesia. Our published results indicate that SA is
dramatically disrupted after recovery from anesthesia in human volunteers. We determine if increased
resistance to state transitions is associated with greater impairment on SA performance after emergence in
mice. We attempt to restore normal SA performance by modulating resistance to state transitions using
chemogenetic activation of orexinergic neurons (Aim 3). In summary, we develop a qualitatively novel measure
of personalized, rather than population-based anesthetic responses: resistance to state transitions. We
determine the neurobiological underpinnings of resistance to state transitions, and investigate its relationship to
subsequent cognitive recovery. Thus, we offer a critical first step towards developing truly personalized
anesthesia and delineate factors underlying delayed restoration of consciousness."

Fluorescence microscopy combined with the optically transparent Zebrafish xenograft model has the potential
to unravel the functional heterogeneity and adaptation of cancer cells that underlies their metastatic potential.
However, this requires bridging disparate scales, as metastatic sites can form across an entire organism, and
cancer cells within need to be imaged with sub-micron 3D resolution. Further, low occupancy of specific
metastatic niches requires imaging many xenografts. This stretches the capabilities of current microscope
technology as they fail to provide high-throughput, high-spatial resolution, and whole organism imaging
capability at the same time. To break through this boundary, we will develop a new multi-modal microscope to
autonomously image both at the organism and subcellular scale in a high-throughput fashion. An optogenetic
module further allows to manipulate pathways or photo-convert selected cancer cells for either tracking or
single cell sequencing approaches. A computational pipeline will automatically detect and select recurring
metastatic sites across many xenografts for high-resolution imaging. This will allow for the first time the
quantitative comparison of functional states such as morphology, survival and proliferation, and signaling
between different niches. We anticipate that the combination of multi-modal microscopy and the computational
pipelines for autonomous imaging will shed new light on key aspects of functional heterogeneity in cancer
metastasis."

Tenofovir prodrugs, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) are
cornerstones of the first-line therapy in HIV/AIDS patients and there are at least 15 FDA-approved antiretroviral
products that contain either TDF or TAF. However, due to their hydrophilic nature, low permeability, and
premature hydrolysis or activation, TDF and TAF both have a considerably low oral bioavailability of 25% and
40% respectively. Given that these drugs need to be administered for the lifetime of HIV patients, strategies to
improve oral bioavailability leading to optimal drug utilization and reduced therapeutic dose need to be
developed. Transformation of ionizable, highly hydrophilic or hydrophobic drugs into ionic liquids (ILs), low-
melting organic salts with a melting point < 100°C, has emerged as a novel and pharmaceutically viable approach
to improving pharmaceutical processability, solubility, permeability, and oral bioavailability of drugs. Our
preliminary data show that it is possible to transform ionizable hydrophobic drugs such as anthelmintic
benzimidazoles, and hydrophilic ionizable drugs such as metformin hydrochloride into low-melting ILs using
pharmaceutically acceptable fatty anion such as sodium docusate. Our preliminary further show that the
developed ILs can be efficiently packaged into polymeric nanomicelles further leading to improved oral delivery
and in vivo efficacy. Hence, we hypothesize that the transformation of TDF and TAF into amphiphilic ionic
liquids (ILs) using generally regarded as safe (GRAS) fatty permeation enhancers and their subsequent
incorporation into polymeric nanomicelles will improve oral bioavailability and in vivo antiviral efficacy. Our
preliminary data show that TDF and TAF can be rapidly and efficiently converted to amphiphilic ILs using GRAS
fatty permeation enhancers such as decanoic acid, undecylenic acid, oleic acid, and salcaprozic acid. Aim 1 will
focus on the development, characterization, and pharmacokinetic evaluation of polymeric nanomicelles
containing TDF-ILs or TAF ILs. Aim 2 will focus on the in vivo antiviral efficacy evaluation of oral polymeric
nanomicelles containing TDF IL in humanized BLT mouse model of HIV infection compared to pure TDF or TAF
to establish the proof of concept. The successful completion of this proposal is expected to lead to the
development of clinically viable pharmaceutical formulations containing ILs of tenofovir prodrugs to achieve
effective long-term management of HIV infection."
10880313,"The progress in understanding how neuronal dysfunction can lead to nervous system disorders has
drawn attention to the central role played by trophic factors in modulating brain function. Cognitive deficits,
which are widely prevalent in neuropsychiatric disorders, are known to be regulated by trophic factors.
The hippocampal actions of neurotrophic factors have been shown to be particularly important,
influencing cellular pathways and mechanisms to produce behavioral effects. Erythropoietin (EPO), a
naturally occurring hormone and trophic factor, widely prescribed to treat anemia, exerts robust
neurotrophic actions in the brain. Moreover, peripheral administration is sufficient to elicit CNS effects in
several preclinical and clinical psychiatry studies. Multiple human studies have demonstrated that EPO
produces cognitive enhancing effects. The regulation of behavior is considered to be a result of
neurotrophic activity that is independent of EPO’s physiological and hemostatic role in regulating
hematopoiesis. However, the specific trophic mechanisms in the brain have not been characterized.
Furthermore, the use of an inherently erythropoietic molecule to produce therapeutic neurotrophic effects
can lead to elevated blood viscosity and increase the risk for adverse vascular events. We therefore
utilize chemically engineered EPO derivatives that are non-erythropoietic but retain neurotrophic activity,
to investigate the role of its hippocampal actions in cognition. Employing a combination of conditional,
region-specific, receptor knockout mice and viral-mediated gene manipulation we will determine the role
of hippocampal neurotrophic factor-driven mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and behavioral levels.
Our studies are expected to provide new insight into trophic factor-mediated modulation of cognitive
behavior and also inform the development of novel trophic factor based therapeutic agents."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death among adults in the United States. Its prevalence is
highest in individuals of African ancestry. It has been estimated that genetic factors account for 26% to 69% of
interindividual variation in CAD risk. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CAD have mainly
been conducted in populations of European and East-Asian ancestries and identified 207 independent loci so
far. Few of the identified loci have been replicated in populations of African ancestries. Large-scale genetic study
of CAD in African-ancestry populations are lacking. This proposal will efficiently leverage the existing resources
of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology Consortium, Million Veteran Program and other
established cohorts to create the largest-ever sample size for a genetic study of African-ancestry populations
comprehensively phenotyped for CAD and related cardiometabolic traits. We propose to address the following
Specific Aims. Aim 1 will interrogate the genome using admixture mapping, univariate GWAS, multi-variate
GWAS and trans-ethnic GWAS approaches to identify loci associated with CAD in African-ancestry populations.
Aim 2 will use phenome-wide association studies, variant-trait hierarchical clustering and integrative genomic
analyses to characterize CAD loci and gain insights into phenotypic, physiologic, and mechanistic impacts that
underlie the pathophysiology of CAD. Aim 3 will explore the public health impact and clinical relevance of CAD
risk variants by constructing polygenic CAD risk scores and identifying pathogenic variants in Mendelian
syndromes of CAD genes that are relevant to African-ancestry populations. The construction of population-
specific polygenic risk scores and identification of rare and low-frequency pathogenic variants of large effect in
Mendelian syndromes of CAD genes will facilitate quantification of CAD risk in individuals of African ancestry
and potentially narrow the translational gap towards clinical use of genetic information across diverse
populations. The comprehensive cross-trait associations of identified CAD risk loci will facilitate the discovery of
subtypes of CAD. Both improved genetic CAD risk classifications and refined CAD sub-phenotyping would help
with the implementation of precision medicine in CAD. The new biological insights elucidated from novel loci
identified in African-ancestry populations may also be generalized to other populations for the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of CAD."
10894840,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary objective of this renewal application is to elucidate how the metal-sequestering host-defense
protein calprotectin (CP) modulates the physiology and interactions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and
Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) using models that consider environmental cues relevant to infection. Metal ions
are essential nutrients for all organisms, and pathogens must acquire these nutrients from the host to replicate
and cause infection. In response to pathogen invasion, the human innate immune system enacts a metal-
withholding response to limit the bioavailability of transition metal nutrients including manganese (Mn), iron
(Fe), and zinc (Zn). This host response includes the deployment of CP and other metal-sequestering proteins
at sites of infection. We discovered that CP withholds Fe(II) from and induces Fe-starvation responses by Pa
and Sa, two bacterial pathogens that cause chronic polymicrobial infections in diverse patient populations,
including lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This hereditary disease predisposes individuals
to life-long pulmonary infections, marked by debilitating exacerbations that reduce lung function. Notably, the
CF lung becomes increasingly acidic and hypoxic as disease progresses, and Fe(II) becomes a predominant
form of bioavailable Fe in this environment. Nevertheless, few studies have addressed how acidic pH and
hypoxia impact microbial Fe homeostasis and the host metal-withholding response. We hypothesize that the
Fe(II)-sequestering activity of CP has profound consequences on the physiology and virulence potential of Pa
and Sa in diverse environmental milieus relevant to infection. We further propose that interactions between CP
and these pathogens depend on environmental cues that vary both temporally and spatially at infection foci. In
Aim 1, we will evaluate how mildly-acidic pH affects the metal-sequestration profile of CP as well as the
physiology of Pa and Sa and their responses to CP and metal starvation. In Aim 2, we will examine how
hypoxia affects the responses of Pa and Sa to metal starvation and CP. In Aim 3, we will extend these
investigations to more complex in vitro models that incorporate relevant aspects of infection including co-
cultures, biofilms, and additional metal-sequestering host-defense factors such as lactoferrin and S100A12.
These investigations will enable future studies that address how CP and Fe drive the progression of CF lung
infections and may guide the design and development of novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic
approaches to treat bacterial infections."
10700314,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common traumatic brain injury affecting military personnel. mTBI
is associated with several neurological symptoms that correlate with neuroinflammation. One of the neurological
symptoms associated with mTBI is pain. mTBI-induced pain may be challenging to manage in some cases.
Therefore, opioids may be used to control such pain. However, opioids have significant side effects, especially
when used chronically, which may lead to substance misuse. The opioid crisis has demonstrated the need for
complementary methods for pain control. Because of the association between mTBI and substance misuse,
there is a significant need for alternative/complementary approaches to opioids to treat pain, especially in treating
the pain associated with mTBI.
mTBI induces inflammation as manifested by increased inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in the
central nervous system (CNS) and plasma. Two sources for these cytokines are microglia and astrocytes, both
of which become activated after mTBI, contributing to the development of pain. Decreasing the levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines may promote decreased mTBI-
induced pain. A therapy that reduces microglia and astrocytes' activation and decreases the neuroinflammatory
environment would be ideal for both military personnel and veterans.
Phototherapy is used for multiple medical conditions, but few studies investigated the effects of phototherapy on
pain. We have shown that green light exposure (GLED) was antinociceptive by reversing thermal and mechanical
hypersensitivity in rats. In humans, we have demonstrated that GLED decreased chronic pain and sleep
disturbances in fibromyalgia and migraine, suggesting that GLED therapy applies to humans despite differences
in the visual systems between rodents and humans. Furthermore, we have shown that GLED reversed the
hypersensitivity associated with mTBI in two different TBI mice models. We also demonstrated that GLED
reversed postsurgical thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity by increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels in
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) while decreasing pro-inflammatory IL-6. GLED reversal of thermal and mechanical
hypersensitivities was attenuated when the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a crucial pain-modulating center, was
blocked, suggesting that GLED may be inhibiting the descending pain-facilitatory pathway.
Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate our hypothesis that GLED visual exposure will attenuate mTBI-
induced hypersensitivity by inhibiting the descending pain-facilitatory pathway.
We will use three specific aims (SA) to investigate our hypothesis. SA1 will explore the potential translation of
GLED therapy by exploring its ability to reverse the mTBI-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivities in
multiple rodent sexes and species. SA2 will evaluate the effects of GLED on modulating glial cells and the effects
on neuroinflammation while assessing the contribution of microglia and astrocytes to the development of mTBI-
induced hypersensitivities. SA3 will elucidate how GLED interacts with the descending pain-facilitatory pathway
Short-term benefits of completing our proposed studies include elucidating the neuronal circuitry mediating the
effects of GLED and characterizing the effects of GLED on the PAG, which may bring GLED therapy a step
closer to clinical implementation. The long-term benefits include the innovative development of a regenerative
medicine approach using the minimally invasive and affordable GLED therapy for mTBI and other conditions that
involve CNS inflammation and decreasing the need for opioids."

Over the last several decades, it has become possible to isolate a patient’s own cells, engineer and expand them
in the laboratory, and use them to treat an existing cancer. This technology has largely advanced to using primary
human T cells genetically modified to express a tumor specific T cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR). This approach has demonstrated durable cures in some leukemias, but has had limited success in the
treatment of solid tumors. This lack of efficacy is believed to be due to challenges faced by T cells in migrating
into and within complex solid tumor microenvironments and multiple immunosuppressive modalities found there.
As many of these challenges have been identified and mechanistically studied, we hypothesize that we can
engineer CAR T cells capable of overcoming all challenges found in the solid tumor microenvironment, leading
to durable cures for cancer patients with the worst prognosis. Recently, a number of groups have published high
efficiency methods for engineering T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, the use of recombinant adeno
associated virus (rAAV) as a DNA donor molecule for homologous recombination (HR) combined with Cas9 has
also demonstrated incredible rates of site-specific gene delivery in T cells. Although these approaches are highly
effective, there are still drawbacks and issues to be resolved to improve capabilities and safety of gene editing
cells for therapy. For instance, nuclease-based gene editing still relies on stochastic repair of genotoxic double
strand breaks (DSBs) with little uniformity in the editing outcome. Fortunately, new technologies have emerged
to gene edit DNA at single base pair resolution with high product purity and efficiency and without a targeted
DSB, termed Cas9 base editors (BEs) and primer editors (PEs). We have demonstrated that this technology
allows for highly efficient multiplex genome editing via programmable enzymatic single base changes without
creating toxic DSBs, i.e. “digital editing”. As this technology is relatively new, there is also opportunity to develop
new and innovative genome editing strategies to develop fully digitally edited cells intended for therapeutic use
in a cost effect, rapid, and accurate manner. Thus, our specific aims are as follows: 1) Further develop multiplex
digital editing in murine and human T cells and explore novel uses for digital editing, 2) Deploy multiplex digital
editing to install novel edits in order to enhance T cells migration into and within mechanically complex tumor
microenvironment and also hardwire T cells to maintain a T resident memory phenotype, 3) Implement digital
editing to develop “off-the-shelf” T cells with enhanced solid tumor efficacy via digital knockout of all 3 NUR4A
transcription factor family. In summary, by deploying digital editing, we will make gene editing of cells intended
for therapeutic use more sophisticated, safe and lead to effective therapies against solid tumor tumors with
mechanically complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments."

The mission of the Columbia University George M. O’Brien Urology Cooperative Research Center is to
advance the understanding of benign genitourinary diseases/disorders. The Center consists of an
Administrative (Admin) Core, a Microbial Genomics Biomedical Research Core, and three Research
Projects that include preclinical and clinical studies. Our focus includes: (1) the intersection of the host
genome and the urinary microbiome; (2) the transcriptional regulation of urothelial differentiation during
homeostasis and repair in response to UTI; and (3) how the regulation of urinary chemistry and urothelial
iron metabolism (“iron-heme machine”) is a component of the urothelial response to UTI. We anticipate
that the proposed studies will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of disorders of high relevance to
benign urology and also facilitate introduction of genetic testing into the practice of Urology and even
suggest new treatments. We will examine the interactions between host and invading bacteria, and the
role of nutrient iron in shaping the outcome of UT infections; we will undertake a new GWAS analysis to
search for mutations that lead to LUTD, including incontinence, obstruction and pelvic floor prolapse, we
will analyze the urinary microbiome of patients with lower urinary tract disfunction (LUTD), and we propose
to identify pathways that program urothelial cell types that may be used to treat benign urothelial
abnormalities associated with disease. The most important goal of this center is to utilize the expertise and
experience of the urological community to increase the scope of our studies and to help direct the kinds of
questions we will address. We have directly integrated members of the P20/U54 community as well as
clinicians and scientists in the benign urological community. Co-investigators on our projects include Indira
Mysorekar (P20), an expert in UTI and urothelial biology who will work with Dr. Mendelsohn and Dr.
Barasch, Chad Vezina (Wisconsin U54) and collaborating scientists and clinicians from the benign
urological community, (Lori Birder, Gerry Apodaca, Doug Strand). In addition, we have invited outside
experts to join our work, for example, the heme biologist, Iqbal Hamza (University of Maryland). We are
also highly focused on education and outreach: Our summer program has trained 73 students since our
center has been established, including undergraduates, fourth year medical students and urology
residents. we have provided opportunity pool funds to Dr. Putonti (Loyola University) and Dr. Catherine
Brownstein, (Harvard University). We held a Symposium in October of 2019 that was extremely successful
""The problem of UTI: The microbiome of the Urogenital Tract and its immune Defense"" bringing together
a dozen experts with >138 members of the Urological community."

Heat waves are lethal and cause a disproportionate number of deaths in the elderly relative to any other age
group. It is important to note that such deaths are primarily cardiovascular, not hyperthermia itself, in origin.
Nevertheless, we know relatively little about the effects of aging on cardiovascular function during actual heat
wave-like conditions. The central hypothesis of this work is that the elderly exhibit greater cardiovascular
stress during heat wave conditions, which can be mitigated by employing low-energy demand cooling
strategies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that recognized impairments in thermoregulatory capacity in the elderly
will culminate in heightened cardiovascular stress during prolonged exposure to heat wave conditions.
Comprehensive cardiovascular and thermal responses in the elderly, relative to younger adults, will be evaluated
during exposure to two prolonged heat wave conditions: hot and humid (replicating the 1995 Chicago heat wave),
very hot and dry (replicating the 2018 Los Angeles heat wave). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that skin wetting is
an effective cooling modality to attenuate elevations in core body temperature and accompanying cardiovascular
stress during heat waves in the elderly, while the use of a fan may be detrimental depending on air temperature
and whether skin wetting is employed. Though air conditioning is the most effective strategy to prevent heat-
related morbidity and mortality, 1 in 8 (~12%) Americans do not have access to air conditioners, and this
percentage is likely higher in the Midwest and Northeast United States where injury and deaths during heat
waves are particularly high. Moreover, factors such as socio-economic status, power outages, government-
imposed rolling blackouts, and COVID-19 related closures of public spaces (e.g., malls, libraries, senior centers,
etc.) threaten region-wide access to air conditioning often at times when it is most needed. Therefore, it is
essential to identify non-air conditioning dependent modalities that will attenuate excessive elevations in core
body temperature and associated cardiovascular stress in the elderly during heat wave conditions. This aim will
assess the efficacy of skin wetting only, fan use only, and a combination of skin wetting and fan use in mitigating
excessive elevations in core body temperature and associated cardiovascular stress in the elderly during both
types of heat waves outlined in Aim 1. The expected outcomes from this body of work will re-shape our
understanding of the consequences of aging on cardiovascular function during heat waves, as well as identify
the efficacy of low-energy cooling modalities directed towards saving the lives of this vulnerable population during
heat wave exposure."

 Antiretroviral-based HIV prophylaxis is highly effective at preventing acquisition of HIV, yet there are many
implementation challenges. Population-based effectiveness studies seek to evaluate real-world impact of preventive
interventions. There is, however, a major limitation in our current ability to measure effectiveness of preventive
interventions at the population-level due to its requirement of resource-extensive longitudinal testing in a closed
cohort. HIV recency assays (assays that provide information on the timing of HIV acquisition) offer resource-
efficient estimates of incidence. However, the utility of such assays is currently limited due to lack of precision. In
addition, designing efficacy trials to evaluate new HIV preventive interventions is increasingly challenging when
effective prevention agents exist. To fill these gaps, we will advance statistical methodology to measure HIV
incidence and develop a new trial design to assess efficacy of an HIV preventive intervention. Specifically, we will
extend existing methods for estimating HIV incidence using recency assay data to accommodate covariate effects
on assay properties, temporal trends in HIV incidence, and to estimate HIV incidence with increased precision.
We will also develop a new class of HIV prevention efficacy trial design termed the ‘augmented active-controlled
design’ which will leverage additional information to infer HIV incidence absent intervention, i.e. ‘counterfactual
placebo’ HIV incidence. To extend and develop these methods, we will define a statistical framework; define
approaches to estimating and drawing inference about parameters given the data; derive and compare analytic
properties of the inferential methods; evaluate performance in simulation studies; and apply the methods to real
data to generate new scientific insights. These novel methods have direct application to evaluating the impact of
HIV preventive interventions in population-based effectiveness studies and randomized controlled efficacy trials,
and will be applicable to the study of other infectious diseases.

10700514,"Respiratory infections and pneumonia account for approximately 5% of deaths in the United
States since 1999 and are a major burden on older adults. Vaccination against influenza has
been the cornerstone of mitigating this burden. Older adults are a particularly important target
for vaccination, with specific CDC recommendations for vaccination against S. pneumoniae and
for preferential use of enhanced influenza vaccines. However, older adults have wide variation
in health and functional status, which may reflect underlying physiologic aging in particular and
immunosenescence in particular. Measures of frailty are useful clinical tools for assessing
physiologic aging in older adults, and evidence of differential influenza vaccine effectiveness by
frailty is limited. Assessing whether frailty is associated with reduced effectiveness of influenza
vaccination among older adults has important implications for vaccination strategies. Revealing
the links among frailty, immunosenescence, and vaccine responses will improve approaches to
developing vaccines for those at the greatest risk of adverse outcomes if infected. Aim 1 will
assess whether frailty, assessed electronically by the VA Frailty Index (VA-FI), is an effect
modifier of influenza vaccine effectiveness among community-dwelling Veterans. Aim 2 will
assess whether frailty is associated with poor outcomes among vaccinated Veterans in
Community Living Centers (CLCs) and whether influenza infection is a mediator of such an
association. Aim 3 will develop a pilot cohort to study the links among frailty, markers of
immunosenescence, and outcomes following vaccination, identifying the physiologic pathways
that affect vaccine responses among older adults. The first two Aims will establish the role of
frailty in vaccine-related outcomes among older Veterans to inform VA vaccination policies,
while the third Aim will provide the basis for a fully-powered study to find the biology of
immunosenesence that links frailty and vaccine outcomes in humans. In addition, the career
development and mentoring programs outlined in this award will accelerate Dr. Seligman’s path
toward becoming an independent investigator at the intersection of geriatric medicine and
infectious diseases."

The HIV-1 capsid protects the viral genome from host innate sensors and mediates the nuclear import of pre-
integration complexes. At some point during intra-cellular trafficking the capsid must disassemble to release the
reverse transcribing vDNA for its integration into host-genes. The underlying mechanisms and the cellular
location of capsid disassembly, which is commonly referred to as uncoating, remain unclear. Recent evidence
points to the possibility to transport a few apparently intact capsids (dimensions ~30 x 60 nm) through a dilated
(~60 nm) nuclear pore complex and into the nucleus1-3. The relevance of these few capsids to infection remains
unclear, and their prior dynamics inside cells unknown. An unbiased and detailed structural analysis of relevant
intra-cellular HIV-1 uncoating structures by cryo-EM remains highly challenging. Notably, in situ cryo-EM
necessitates the use of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to generate a thin (100-300nm) sheet of vitreous
ice referred to as a ‘lamella’ inside rapidly frozen cells. Procedures to precisely control the location in a cell where
the lamella is prepared remains underdeveloped and a bottleneck for in situ structural investigation, especially of
sparsely located HIV-1 specimen. The scientific premise of this proposal is to develop a robust 3D correlative light
and cryo-EM (3D-CLEM) workflow to facilitate cryo-FIB ‘lamella’ preparation at precise intra-cellular sites containing
HIV-1, and to characterize relevant capsid structures and correlate to their functional dynamics by live-cell imaging.
This project will leverage, (1) fluorescence live-cell imaging of HIV-1 infection to locate relevant capsids that are
respectively poised for nuclear entry and integration4, 5 and correlate their dynamics to capsid structures determined
by 3D-CLEM, cryo-FIB lamella preparation and high-resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET); (2) develop
automated methods to locate HIV-1 macrostructures on a lamella using low-resolution cryo-ET maps via a
convoluted neural network (CNN)-trained software6 to un-biasedly pick capsid templates and 3D-HIV structures on
a lamella, for high-resolution cryo-ET structural imaging and classification. The development and validation of the
3D-CLEM workflow and automated macrostructure localization procedure will improve throughput in cryo-EM
imaging of HIV-1 structures inside cells, and improve our understanding of virus cell biology, which is of high
public health significance."

Malignancy is the leading cause of mortality amongst people living with HIV (PLWH). Of these malignancies,
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematological neoplasm affecting PLWH. Despite the
introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), PLWH are 10-20 times more likely to develop NHL than
those without HIV. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is associated with the lymphomas most
commonly observed in PLWH. Active HIV infection can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in
untreated people, and it is known that AIDS promotes the development of EBV+ lymphomas, termed AIDS-
defining cancers (ADCs), the effect of host factors, including endogenous retroviruses on lymphomagenesis in
immunocompetent PLWH treated with ART, remains to be explored. Work in the Cesarman and Nixon labs has
shown that EBV and HIV each hijack host cell signaling pathways upon infection to induce the expression of
endogenous retroelements, including as human endogenous retroviruses (HERV). To determine the
contributions of these viruses on lymphomagenesis, we will generate data from in vitro lymphoma models to test
the effect of EBV and HIV proteins on the expression of endogenous retroviral oncoproteins. Additionally, we will
perform bulk and single-cell sequencing of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) from PLWH to determine
the changes in cell populations of the tumor microenvironment (TME). We hypothesize that there will be unique
populations of EBV infected B cells with pre-malignant transcriptomic signatures that correlate with dysregulated
HERV expression, including expression of the HERVK(HML2) Np9 oncogene.
In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of EBV latency III LMP2A and extracellular HIV p17 variants on the
expression of the Np9 oncogene. We will perform stepwise molecular and cellular studies to determine the
translational impact of exogenous viral infection on the expression of this endogenous retroviral oncogene. We
will additionally perform multi-omic analysis to identify viral and host factors relevant to the transcriptional
machinery of virus-mediated Np9 oncogene expression.
In Aim 2, we will use our novel established single cell pipeline to determine locus-specific endogenous retroviral
transcription of DLBCL samples from PLWH. Preliminary data from our work in the Nixon lab strongly suggests
that we will be able to use the pipeline that we have developed to identify and quantify these HERV transcripts
from RNA-sequencing data. We will assess the relative cell populations of samples that are EBV+ to those that
are EBV- and determine the differences in host gene, retroviral and viral transcripts. Additionally, we intend to
validate these single cell findings with bulk RNA-sequencing from a larger cohort of EBV+/- fresh frozen tissue
of DLBCL from PLWH."

In Zimbabwe, the burden of cancer among people with HIV is increasing. Consistent engagement in HIV care
is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among people with HIV in general, and continuation of ART
through cancer treatment is essential for people with HIV who have cancer. Because the cancer and HIV care
pathways in Zimbabwe are siloed, people with HIV who are attempting to access cancer treatment face unique
barriers to engagement in both care continua. While guidelines for treatment of people with HIV and cancer in
low- and middle-income settings recommend integration of cancer and HIV care, there is a limited evidence
base for how to accomplish this successfully in these settings. There is an important gap in provision of
continuous HIV care when people with HIV in Zimbabwe receive a concurrent diagnosis of cancer. The goal of
this project is to address that gap by identifying barriers to HIV care engagement specific to people
with HIV receiving cancer treatment, and devising, refining, and testing strategies to address those
barriers. In Aim 1, we will use questionnaires and routinely collected clinical data to measure disruptions to
HIV-related care over time among cancer patients with HIV. In Aim 2A, we will use a mixed-methods approach
including questionnaires and in-depth interviews to quantify and contextualize patient-identified barriers and
facilitators to consistent engagement in the HIV care continuum during cancer treatment. In Aim 2B, we will
first prioritize barriers based on ubiquity and strength of impact, then convene a group of experts and key
stakeholders in HIV and cancer healthcare and research to develop a set of strategies to address the highest
priority barriers. Strategies will be implemented and refined one at a time using a rapid cycle improvement
process, with a final set of 2-3 refined strategies combined and piloted together in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will
measure the acceptability of the package of strategies to patients and hospital staff as our primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes will include uptake, experience of barriers and facilitators to HIV care engagement, and
disruptions to HIV and cancer care. We will compare secondary outcomes in Aim 3 participants to Aim 1
participants in a quasi-experimental pre-post study design. These aims constitute the mentored research
component of the candidate’s career development plan. In parallel with this research, the candidate will pursue
additional training in implementation science, qualitative methods, and the design and evaluation of clinical
care interventions, supported by an exemplary team of experienced HIV and cancer investigators in the United
States and Zimbabwe. The proposed work will address a critical gap in provision of clinical care for people with
HIV and cancer in Zimbabwe, and substantially expand Dr. Montaño’s methodological expertise, providing the
training, experience and data for her transition to independence."
10813837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is a threat to the success of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) and a major
barrier to the elimination of AIDS as a public health problem. Persons with HIV who develop virological failure
(VF) during ART are at high risk of developing HIVDR and transmitting a drug-resistant virus to others while
persons primarily infected with a drug-resistant virus are at high risk of developing VF and a further increase
in HIVDR. Comprehensive, accurate, and publicly available HIVDR data are essential for population-based
monitoring of acquired and transmitted HIVDR, for the management of HIV-infected patients, and for
identifying overall drug-development needs. A public database that curates, annotates, synthesizes, and
disseminates data from HIVDR studies will make it possible to identify and characterize the HIVDR mutations
most relevant to surveillance, clinical management, and drug development, and will expedite research into
the mechanisms of HIVDR and the predictors of response to the newest ARV regimens.
The Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (HIVDB) provides a unique conceptual framework for
addressing data-intensive questions about the main molecular targets of HIV therapy: reverse transcriptase,
protease, integrase, and capsid. HIVDB’s sequence analysis programs have also become integrated into the
workflows of many research laboratories worldwide. Accomplishing the Aims of this proposal will assist
researchers engaged in HIVDR surveillance, ART clinical trials, and ARV development by enabling them to
identify gaps in the published literature, incorporate contributions from HIVDB into novel analyses, and
discover new knowledge.
Our first Aim will involve expanding HIVDB as a resource that provides the scientific foundations of the clinical
and epidemiological significance of HIVDR mutations and that address gaps in HIVDR knowledge including
the correlates of resistance to recently approved ARVs, established ARVs used for new indications, and the
long-acting ARVs that will be used for prevention and treatment. We will implement strategies to increase
data sharing to help ensure the long-term sustainability of this project.
Our second Aim will involve extending the logic of HIVDB’s genotypic resistance test interpretation program
to predict the virological response to ARV combinations and common ART regimens. We will demonstrate
and promote the use of our sequence analysis software for the analysis of other pathogenic viruses for which
antiviral therapy is available.
Our third Aim will involve converting HIVDB into a fully open source and transferable project. Accomplishing
this aim will support researchers using HIVDB to advance their research by enabling them to seamlessly
integrate HIVDR data into their research. Accomplishing this aim will also foster the long-term sustainability
of the HIVDB project."

This commercialization readiness pilot (CRP) by care.coach corporation (Millbrae, CA) requests funds for late-
stage research and development and technical assistance for a conversational technology driven by artificial
intelligence (AI) that was developed with and for older adults, especially those aging with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD). Past work has resulted in a socially assistive robot (SAR) and virtual health
assistant overseen by humans that improves health outcomes and reduces loneliness in older adults at a lower
cost of care. Customer loyalty is world-class and far exceeds net promotor scores (NPS) for well-known
conversational agents, attesting to the product’s commercial potential. Moreover, active Phase II funding
(5R44AG0620-14-03) has resulted in an automated speech recognition (ASR) engine that is more accurate in
understanding truly natural speech by older adults, including those with ADRD, than major conversional AI
platforms. This is significant given the inherent challenges that the speech of older adults, especially of those
with ADRD, poses to conversational AI due to normal age-related neurological changes or brain pathology
associated with ADRD.
Leveraging these advances and innovations, care.coach is preparing for rapid growth and has attracted
considerable interest from insurers, corporate development arms of large insurers, and traditional investors.
To successfully scale, we propose to re-platform our current system on top of an enterprise-grade, integrated
knowledge solution enabled by KIE, an opensource platform powered by KIE’s Drools/jBPM rules and process
engines. The KIE platform has revolutionized enterprise operations, and has been adopted in healthcare to
drive quality and efficiency with applications ranging from the adjudication of health insurance claims to the
implementation of clinical decision support systems. In addition to business process automation, the cost of
goods sold (COGS) will come down with full conversational automation in allowable use cases by training and
using a large language model. Both capabilities will be developed in the proposed CRP using state-of-the-art
technical approaches, and will be evaluated for performance and acceptance in a replication study with ADRD
patients in partnership with a health plan and medical providers that serve a large, diverse elderly population.
This technical assistance and late-stage development will deliver a state-of-the-art, consumer-facing conversa-
tional agent and virtual health assistant driven by a technology platform with industrial production and automa-
tion methods that ensure consistent and scalable digital health service delivery and manufacturing, and that
meet the highest security and consumer satisfaction standards. The overall goal is to improve the health and
wellbeing of millions Americans within 5 years, including those aging with ADRD."

 Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to chronic diseases and
conditions including breast cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and infertility. Timing of exposure, especially
during pregnancy, may have a lifelong impact on the fetus. Tools and services are urgently needed to allow
individuals to learn about their personal EDC exposures and how to reduce them. Million Marker (MM) is a
precision health company that was formed to fill this need.
 Our mission is to crowdsource and scale the biomonitoring of environmental chemicals and provide
actionable results to consumers in a timely manner in order to empower individuals to proactively assess,
track, and reduce their exposures and live a healthier lifestyle. Starting with a few biomarkers of common
EDCs, our ultimate vision is to discover all possible (“a million”) biomarkers of EDC exposure to inform and
improve individual health outcomes and advance precision medicine. MM is uniquely capable of carrying out
this mission, with our team of multidisciplinary scientists who are highly trained in environmental epidemiology,
toxicology, analytical chemistry, biostatistics, data engineering, and business.
 In Phase I of this study, we developed and tested the FIRST mobile EDC intervention service (app and
exposure report-back) for its efficacy in increasing EH literacy (EHL), readiness to reduce exposures (i.e.
readiness to change, RtC), and system usability among reproductive-age participants recruited from the
Healthy Nevada Project (HNP), one of the largest population health cohorts in the world. We found a general
trend of decreased EDC exposure with the intervention, as well as increased RtC. However, some participants
did not increase their RtC and had difficulty carrying out the intervention on their own (which resulted in no
decrease in EDC exposure). The reasons for these less optimal results were the difficulty in the EHL subject
matter–participants still felt ill-prepared to apply their knowledge to making healthier lifestyle changes.
Therefore, in this Phase II proposal, we will address these perceived limitations by 1) developing and 2) testing
a self-directed online interactive curriculum with live counseling sessions and individualized support modeled
after the highly effective Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Omada Health (which provides a digital
interactive DPP).
 We plan to develop an EDC-specific online intervention curriculum (Aim 1); test the effectiveness of our
intervention programs (Aim 2); and determine changes in EDC exposure before and after each intervention
program (Aim 3). For Aim 1, we will recruit 15 men and 15 women of child-bearing age from HNP, our Phase I
collaborator to participate in the intervention. For Aims 2 and 3, we will recruit and randomize 300 women and
300 men of reproductive age (total n=600) from HNP. Our target population is adult men and women of
reproductive age (18-44 years old), who are also our target population (as stated in our Commercialization
Plan). At the conclusion of this project, we will be well-positioned to begin Phase IIB and will scale our products
and services to clinics and the general public, with the eventual aims of FDA approval, insurance coverage,
and incorporation into routine clinical care."

Brain metastasis is the development of secondary tumors within brain tissue which are typically derived from
melanoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The prognosis for patients with brain metastasis is devastatingly
poor with a median survival of less than six months. To reduce brain metastasis incidence and cancer
mortality, rationally-designed therapeutic approaches targeting the mechanistic underpinnings of brain
metastasis progression is imperative.
 It is increasingly appreciated that the immune cells within the brain metastatic niche have indisputable and
ubiquitous roles in regulating brain tumor progression. Yet, the regulation of CNS immunity by peripheral and
systemic factors during brain metastatic colonization and outgrowth are not completely understood. The gut
microbiota composition plays a crucial role in regulating the host’s peripheral immune system, correlates with
anti-cancer immunotherapy efficacy and has a profound influence on brain behavior and function by reshaping
the brain immune niche. In this study, we aim to identify how gut microbiota modulation reshapes the brain’s
immune landscape and subsequently influences the metastatic niche and progression of brain metastasis.
Antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis led to a significant increase in brain metastasis burden in contrast
to a vehicle-treated control group, suggesting that gut microbiota dysbiosis remodeled the brain metastatic
niche to a tumor-promoting environment. Using single-cell analysis, we revealed compositional and
transcriptional differences of immune cells within the brain metastatic niche of mice with and without gut
dysbiosis. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis affects specific immune cell types to promote brain
metastasis outgrowth. Here, we propose to dissect the roles of these immune cell types in promoting brain
metastasis outgrowth under gut dysbiosis conditions. Furthermore, we will elucidate the spatial distribution of
effector immune cells within the brain metastatic niche and functional impact of gut-derived signaling molecules
in brain metastasis outgrowth. Understanding the constituents and host-intrinsic regulators of the brain
metastatic niche shaped through gut-brain communication will guide the development of novel and feasible
brain metastasis prevention strategies through gut microbiota modulation."

Center (JJPVAMC). This is her first RCS Award renewal application.
 Schizophrenia (Sz)-spectrum disorders and suicidal behavior are major public health problems affecting
Veterans. Each year, the VA provides care to approximately 100,000 Sz patients, accounting for nearly 12% of
the VA’s total healthcare costs. In 2019, Veteran suicides were double that of civilians in the United States.
The PI’s ongoing clinical cognitive neuroscience research at the VA uses neuroimaging and psychophysio-
logical approaches and primarily focuses on these two areas: elucidating the neurobiology of Sz and suicidal
behavior. Identification of promising new targets for intervention in Sz and suicide prevention are critically
important goals of the VA. The PI’s track record of federal funding and peer-reviewed publications in these two
areas has helped advance the field.
 Suicidal behavior in Veterans: Dr. Hazlett’s current VA Collaborative CSR&D/BLR&D Merit Award
investigates the underlying neurobiology of impulsivity in Veterans at low and high risk for suicide. Using task-
based fMRI, she examines the correlates of motor and cognitive impulsivity in healthy-control (HC) Veterans
and pathological severity of impulsivity in Veterans with major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without a
history of suicide attempt(s) (SA) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In all, five groups of Veterans are
being studied: HC, SA-mTBI-, SA+mTBI-, SA-mTBI+, SA+mTBI+. Our collaborative VA sites are studying an
animal model of mTBI (East Orange, NJ VA), collecting identical behavioral impulsivity data in acutely suicidal
inpatients (Indy VA), and assisting with rigorous diagnostic/symptom severity assessments (Denver VA). Blood
is being studied (Indy VA) in participants to examine inflammation and epigenetics related to suicidal behavior.
This work promises to help uncover the mechanisms by which biological and psychological factors give rise to
suicidal behavior and may aid in prospectively identifying Veterans at greatest risk for suicide. The second
component is funded by a new VA RR&D SPiRE grant and aims to collect pilot data to test the feasibility and
acceptability of an adjunctive neuroplasticity-based Cognitive Remediation (CR) intervention on key treatment
targets delivered via telehealth in a sample of 36 Veterans with MDD and a history of SA. It will test the effects
of an evidence-based CR therapy augmented with manualized “Bridging” sessions on transfer and practice of
cognitive control and decision-making/problem-solving strategies for real-world situations and problems,
including those that trigger suicidal thoughts. This is the first implementation of this intervention in Veterans
with MDD and suicidal behavior. Consistent with the SPiRE mechanism, this study is high risk, but it has high
potential impact and promise to help improve quality of life for Veterans at high risk for suicide. If results are
encouraging, Dr. Hazlett will submit a multi-site VA RCT Merit in the Spring of 2023.
 Schizophrenia (Sz)-spectrum disorders: Dr. Hazlett’s current NIMH R01 and supplement grants
involve the first longitudinal design to study schizotypal personality disorder (SPD)—a disorder similar to Sz but
with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important, yet understudied intermediate Sz-
spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics,
treatment, and risk factors associated with psychosis. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal-
MR imaging across the continuum of Sz-spectrum disorders from HCs to SPD to Sz and examine changes in
neural circuitry in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition, and functional outcome.
 Impact: This Research Career Scientist Award will allow the PI to augment her highly collaborative VA
research with VA clinician-scientists and mentoring of promising VA MIRECC Fellows. The PI’s goal is to
further expand her MRI research program in Sz and suicidal behavior at the JJPVAMC and beyond."

The Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD (KBASE) is a comprehensive
prospective cohort study launched at Seoul National University (SNU) in 2014 using a similar design and
methods as the North American Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The KBASE cohort
consists of well-characterized participants including cognitively normal (CN) controls with a wide age range (20
to 90 years), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia (AD). A unique aspect of KBASE is the
systematic longitudinal collection of comprehensive clinical, cognitive and lifestyle data, multimodal
neuroimaging (MRI/MRA, DTI, rsfMRI, amyloid, tau and FDG PET), and bio-specimens in Korea for the first five
years (“KBASE1”). Some KBASE data have been analyzed and reported but much of the extensive KBASE data
set and samples await comprehensive analysis. The proposed project (“KBASE2”) represents a collaboration
between the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) and partners, Indiana University (ADNI
Genetics Core, Indiana NIA-designated ADRC, and IU Network Science Institute), the KBASE team at SNU in
Korea, University of Southern California (USC), and the University of Pennsylvania. Over 1000 whole genome
sequences (WGS) of Korean participants will be contributed to the ADSP, and the extensive ADSP multi-ethnic
data set will be analyzed. WGS data will be harmonized by the NIA Genetics and Genomics Center for AD
(GCAD) and shared via the NIA Genetics of AD Data Storage Site (NIAGADS). The Laboratory of Neuroimaging
(LONI) at USC will support sharing of MRI and PET and related endophenotypes, as it does for ADNI. KBASE2
will continue longitudinal data and sample collection and provide high throughput WGS and RNA-Seq as well as
data harmonization and sharing (Aim 1), perform intensive brain network-based analyses of longitudinal amyloid,
tau, neurodegeneration and vascular (A/T/N/V) imaging biomarkers in relation to clinical data (Aim 2), employ
integrative systems biology and functional genomics methods to analyze multi-omics data for association with
A/T/N/V biomarkers for AD, and provide new insight into AD biomarker-related dysregulated gene modules and
pathways (Aim 3). The overarching concepts driving this multidisciplinary international collaborative project are
that 1) development of precision medicine for AD and related disorders (ADRD) requires systematic multi-modal
biomarker collection in diverse cohorts during early at-risk stages of disease to identify robust diagnostic,
prognostic and therapeutic targets and 2) sophisticated analytic strategies that address the complexity of multi-
layer multimodal data and heterogeneous and diverse participant cohorts are essential. We hypothesize that
integrative longitudinal analysis of genetic and -omics networks with structural and functional brain networks will

10888275,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Public health faces threats from a multitude of pathogens on an ongoing basis, yet pathogens
associated with different diseases are typically compartmentalized with respect to surveillance,
management, and research. This compartmentalized approach ignores the many ways that
pathogens interact, in some cases leading to the exacerbation of their collective burden on
public health. These interactions can be biological (e.g., cross-reactive immunity), behavioral
(e.g., prompting adherence to good hygiene), or clinical (e.g., misdiagnosis). Modern, data-
driven approaches to mathematical modeling have the potential to resolve the dynamics of co-
circulating pathogens by accounting for these interactions. In doing so, modeling also has the
potential to improve pathogen-specific disease forecasts by borrowing information across
surveillance data for different diseases. To date, this potential remains largely untapped. In this
project, I will develop a generalizable framework for modeling the dynamics of co-circulating
pathogens. The first component of this framework will use Bayesian hierarchical modeling to
fuse mechanistic descriptions of pathogen transmission dynamics with statistical descriptions of
surveillance processes, allowing for maximal leveraging of heterogeneous data streams to
inform biological inferences. The second component of this framework will involve validating
model inferences through forecasts of future disease dynamics. Both components of this
framework will involve the use of multiple models that represent competing hypotheses about
pathogen interaction, as well as other forms of model uncertainty. This framework will be
applied in two settings: mosquito-borne viruses in Brazil and respiratory pathogens in Indiana. In
both of these settings, co-circulation of recently emerged and endemic pathogens poses new
challenges for surveillance and control activities, making the development of new modeling tools
to address these challenges especially timely."
10925272,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE ABSTRACT
 The overarching goals of the Administrative Core are to coordinate and integrate all activities of the Center,
including core reporting, P/F administration and enrichment activities. Towards these goals the WU-RDRRC
proposes the following:
 1) Promote awareness of the resources within the Center to foment interest in rheumatic diseases research
 through collaborative, trans-disciplinary activities across the WU community, organize and align Core
 laboratories and services to provide state-of-the-art technologies and specialized resources in line with
 members’ needs.
 2) Enhance synergies between RDRRC and other WU funded Centers conducting rheumatic disease-
 related research as well as extramural institutions in the Midwest.
 3) Identify and nurture the careers of junior faculty interested in rheumatic diseases research.
 4) Establish a Multidisciplinary Research Expert Panel to provide guidance for new and junior faculty in the
 planning and execution of research projects.
 5) Support educational seminar series that bring together scientists within and outside WU campus to
 communicate their newest ideas or research in rheumatic diseases.
 The leadership of the WU-RDRRC will provide consistent and strategic oversight guided by an Internal
Executive Committee (IEC) and a Center Advisory Committee (CAC) comprised of internal and external board
members. We will use formal metrics to measure Core performance and WU-RDRRC impact through the
evaluation of scientific network activities, outputs and implementation.
 For this competitive renewal, the WU-RDRRC core leadership has been adjusted to 1) replace outgoing or
retired/retiring members, and 2) as a deliberate effort to promote the advancement of junior faculty. In addition
to promoting the advancement of junior faculty the WU-RDRRC will collaborate with the Physician Scientist
Training Pathway in the launching of a post-baccalaureate program aimed at preparing underrepresented
candidates for a career as physician-scientists."
10704150,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer outcomes are disproportionately poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
compared to high-income countries. Low breast cancer survival rates in LMICs are primarily attributable to
advanced stage presentation and limited diagnostic and treatment capacity. Although national clinical practice
guidelines for breast cancer in Tanzania recommend that all breast cancer patients receive hormone receptor
(HR) testing, current pathology capacity is unable to meet this need. Pathologic diagnosis, including HR testing,
is critical to determining the presence of cancer, extent of the disease, and planning treatment. However, HR
testing is available at only two public hospitals in Tanzania. As a result, patients encounter turnaround times of
weeks to months, with only a subset of eligible women receiving HR testing and guideline-concordant treatment.
To reduce this evidence-to-practice gap, we propose to systematically identify the most effective
implementation strategies across all public referral hospitals with pathology services in Tanzania to guide
development of a multi-faceted and adaptable intervention (set of implementation strategies). We hypothesize
that this intervention will increase the proportion of women who receive HR testing and guideline-concordant
endocrine therapy, resulting in improved cancer care, quality of life, and overall short term survival of patients.
 First, we will conduct a formative evaluation to determine the organizational readiness for change and
to identify barriers and facilitators to routine HR testing using mixed methods. Then, we will determine the
optimal implementation strategies for the barriers and facilitators identified in the formative evaluation, and
develop a multi-component intervention with methods informed by organizational theory. Finally, we will
iteratively pilot test the multi-component intervention and will modify the intervention components based on
outcomes measures.
 These studies will be led by Dr. Dianna L. Ng, a junior faculty member in the Department of Pathology
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) with an interest in developing and testing theory-driven,
multi-level interventions to increase integration of evidence-based cancer diagnostics in low-resource settings.
The research will be carried out under the multidisciplinary mentorship of Dr. T. Peter Kingham (surgical
oncologist, global oncology research), Dr. Jamie Ostroff (clinical psychologist, implementation science), Dr.
Edda Vuhahula, (pathologist, capacity building in East Africa), and Dr. Britt-Marie Ljung (pathologist, resource-
stratified diagnosis). MSK offers an outstanding environment for cancer care delivery and health services
research. To achieve her goal of becoming an independent researcher, Dr. Ng has developed a structured
career development plan aimed at advancing her knowledge and advanced skills in implementation science in
global health."

The Developmental Research Program (DRP) promotes new and innovative Head and Neck Cancer (HNC)
“pilot” projects. The goal is to fund projects with high scientific merit that will greatly impact HNC research and/or
have the potential for translation to the clinic and population and thus reduce the burden of HNC. A core priority
will be to identify and support junior or mid-career investigators. The DRP will encourage projects with a) high
perceived impact, b) translational potential that may be integrated into full projects within the SPORE, c)
innovative ideas and approaches that generate new hypothesis and preliminary data that support new R01-type
grant applications, d) new collaborations to develop novel research and research tools and/or e) high risk/high
return projects that move the HNC field forward for basic science and/or clinical interventions. DRP projects will
be funded through the SPORE budget and institutional matching funds. With the approval of the SPORE's
External Advisory Board (EAB) and the NCI Translational Research Program (TRP) Director, DRP studies have
the opportunity to become full projects as part of the flexibility option as long as they have translational research
potential within the SPORE. Solicitations for DRP projects are made within UCCC covered institutions including
University of Colorado campuses (Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Boulder) and Colorado State University.
The SPORE Administrative Core will ensure that DRP resources are used effectively to cultivate our HNC
research. An efficient process is in place for successful review, selection, and monitoring of DRP projects. The
influx of research from HNC investigators or those with expertise outside of HNC that will develop innovative,
high-risk research will catalyze significant advances in the understanding and treatment of HNC."

 The goal of this project is to develop a new tissue assay method that permits single-cell resolution
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiling of macromolecular drugs in the spatial context of
the organ-specific tissue microenvironment in both healthy and diseased states. With the integrated 3D
microscopy, we will 1) map blood vasculature and transvascular transport of macromolecular drugs; 2) image
the distribution and interaction of macromolecular drugs with multiple cell types in the tissue microenvironment;
3) determine cellular responses to macromolecular drugs in sub-microenvironment regions at the molecular level.
This high-resolution 3D multiplex microscopy method will advance “Spatial Pharmacology” in the pharmaceutical
sciences by enabling the mapping of the transport, distribution, and biological actions of macromolecular drugs
in tissue specimens at the tissue-wide, cellular and molecular levels. The maps will provide new insights into
transvascular transport of macromolecular drugs, drug-cell interactions, and biological responses of various cells
to drugs in different sub-microenvironment regions of an organ. The collection of the maps, The Atlas of Spatial
Pharmacology, will be a solid standard reference in the research and preclinical development of macromolecular
drugs."
10917076,"Abstract
Genome-wide screens in mammalian cells have emerged as a powerful tool for determining the relationship of
individual genes to a chosen biological phenotype. However, biological systems often rely on the concerted
action of multiple genes at once to elicit phenotypes. Nowhere is this more evident than in cellular differentiation,
where cell state transitions often involve the modulation of 5-7 master regulatory factors. Consistent with this
observation, successful efforts to reprogram cells, from Yamanaka on, have generally found that simultaneous
expression of 3-5 transcription factors are needed to elicit cell state or type changes (similar to an “AND-gate-
like” genetic circuit), and others have improved the efficiency or accuracy of these transitions by further perturbing
other factors such as epigenetic remodelers. Given these observations, we posit that the ability to carry out highly
combinatorial forward genetic screens for cell state phenotypes would produce a “sea change” in our ability to
engineer cells with highly specific properties, transforming the quality of cells available for research and cell
therapy applications. To this end, we propose an iterative platform that leverages a large multiplicity of
perturbation (MOP) per cell, intelligent structuring of engineered perturbation libraries, and machine learning
approaches to both identify combinations of perturbations most likely to elicit specific cellular phenotypes, and
to engineer maximally informative new perturbation libraries. We have piloted this platform on a simple “toy
model” wherein the simultaneous expression of 6 different proteins (across a total universe of 30 different
potential factors) are required to elicit a phenotype. By overloading cells with ~14 perturbations per cell,
structuring a library of ~80 perturbation combinations, then identifying further observations that would provide
maximal information about the causative perturbation combination, we were able to confidently uncover this six-
input “AND-gate” underlying state logic. While this initial ability to “solve” highly polygenic phenotypes is exciting,
challenges to extending our platform to primary human cells include identification and minimization of dominant
negative perturbations, identification of optimal MOP for each biological question, perfection of methods for high
MOP of primary cells, exploration and optimization of the direction and mechanism of gene expression
perturbation, and the engineering or selection of state changes sufficiently durable for therapeutic utility. We plan
to initially apply this platform to the trans-differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory T cells and the generation
of inexhaustible T-cells for cell therapies, with an eye toward establishing collaborations to deploy this platform
to develop diverse cell types with regenerative or therapeutic value. In short, we posit that complex,
therapeutically relevant phenotypes demand a polygenic design language that reflects the combinatorial
vocabulary and grammar of human biology. We anticipate that our cell engineering platform will provide the first
native implementation of this language."

 Food allergy (FA) has rapidly increased over 2 decades affecting 32 million Americans, with annual costs
of $25 billion. FA anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition, increased 200-400% in children from
toddlers to teens.10 Peanut/ tree nut and sesame allergy often co-exist, last a lifetime, cause severe reactions,
and there is currently no cure. Common treatments, either prophylactic i.e., food avoidance, or therapeutic i.e.,
food allergen oral immunotherapy are limited and impractical. Safe, effective, and non-food restricted
therapeutics are needed. FA is primarily mediated by food protein specific immunoglobulin E. Persistent IgE
caused by long-lived plasma cells (IgE+LPC) is a significant barrier to FA mitigation. General Nutraceutical
Technology LLC (GNT), a NY-based biotechnology startup, is building on groundbreaking research for FA
started at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Our oral product “NIT-X” contains the small molecule
compound berberine captured by nanoparticles. It significantly increased bioavailability, showed excellent
preclinical safety and nearly 100% reduction of PN-IgE and protection against anaphylaxis in animal model of
peanut and tree nut allergies, associated with suppressing IgE+ plasma cells/B cells, reducing IL-4, increasing
IFN-γ, inducing a distinct B cell transcriptomic profile. We hypothesize that by restoring balanced immunity.
NIT-X will be a potentially novel non-food restricted therapeutic for severe and multiple FAs. The goals of this
SBIR Phase II are generating robust NIT-X Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC), along further
preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicology and pharmacology data, and file the phase Ia clinical study. We
will conduct 4 Specific Aims: #1 Generating NIT-X CMC data, characterization of product and preclinical PK
profile; #2. Further generation of data on NIT-X preclinical toxicology; #3. Investigate dose efficacy of NIT-X in
murine models. #4. File phase Ia clinical trial as a sub-program to an ongoing parent botanical IND. Solid SBIR
phase I feasibility data and strong team and design for phase II study enable GNT to generate rigorous date for
CMC, preclinical PK, safety, and efficacy for obtaining approval of IND for a subproject to the current IND for
clinical trials with NIT-X, towards commercialization for treating FA."
10828915,"Dysregulation of mitochondrial (mt) electron transport is a well-recognized feature of the aging
process and promotes cellular injury, inflammation, and organ fibrosis. Many chronic diseases,
including chronic kidney diseases, are associated with mt electron transport dysfunction,
underscoring its importance in organ pathogenesis. In addition to ATP production via electron
transport-linked oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria operate as signaling organelles, in
which electron transport intersects with multiple metabolic pathways including the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, amino acid, fatty acid, glucose and one carbon metabolism. Furthermore, mt
electron transport generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as signaling molecules
that regulate important cellular pathways, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent
oxygen sensing. Although highly relevant to many age-related and chronic diseases, in vivo
studies investigating the mechanisms by which mt electron transport dysfunction contributes to
organ pathogenesis have been confounded by the lack of adequate genetic animal models. In
particular, the interconnections between mt electron transport and TCA cycle metabolism and
their impact on aging and chronic disease development are only incompletely understood. The
focus of this exploratory research grant application is on the development and characterization
of novel genetic mouse models that address these knowledge deficits.
Our laboratory has shown that mt electron transport disruption in kidney suppresses TCA cycle
flux, amino acid metabolism and synthesis of macromolecules, impacting on differentiation and
proliferation of renal epithelial cells in a nephron-segment specific manner. Under this grant we
develop nephron segment-specific knock-out models to dissect the mechanisms by which mt
electron transport dysregulation promotes kidney injury and fibrosis. Specifically, we focus on
the role of mt electron transport-dependent TCA cycle dysfunction in kidney pathogenesis.
Under aim 1, we characterize nephron segment-specific genetic models of mt electron transport
disruption due to inactivation of subunit VII of the mt ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex
(mt complex III), which is known as ubiquinone-binding protein Q-binding protein QPC. Under
aim 2, we reactivate mt electron flux and restore TCA cycle function in Qpc-deficient renal
epithelial cells by cell type-specific expression of an alternative electron-transporting oxidase
(AOX). This model will be used to characterize the pathogenic role of TCA cycle dysregulation
in renal epithelial cells with mt dysfunction due to mt complex III disruption."
10884190,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prevalent disease with little understanding into the underlying mechanisms
behind the development of the disease. Diastolic dysfunction has been shown to be an independent risk factor
for the development of cognitive impairment. Patients with both diastolic heart failure (dHF) and AD represent a
population where therapeutic options are highly needed, but which unfortunately have minimal therapeutic
options due to a poor understanding of both diseases. Vascular dysfunction has been implicated in dHF and
AD. Due to a chronic inflammatory state, vascular endothelial dysfunction can occur, driving dHF/AD
pathologies. But little is known regarding the vascular endothelial mechanisms that contribute to cognitive
impairment. Specifically, adenosine kinase (ADK) plays an important role in regulating blood flow under
hypoxic conditions largely via its receptors (A1R, A2A/A2BR, and A3R). Pathologically, increased ADK is
implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in the vascular contributions underlying dHF/AD
pathologies is unknown. Thus, I hypothesize that augmented ADK activity impairs, whereas ADK
inhibition restores, cerebral parenchymal arteriole vasodilator function, mitigating the dHF-induced
worsening of cognitive decline and AD-related pathological outcomes. The goal of this project is to
examine the role of adenosine kinase in vasodilator function in a mixed dHF and AD pathology and to further
elucidate the underlying mechanisms of endothelial ADK in vasoreactivity. I will study this through the following
two Specific Aims. Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that increases in cerebrovascular ADK activity impair vasodilator
function of parenchymal arterioles, worsening cognitive dysfunction in mixed dHF/AD pathologies. Aim 2. Test
the hypothesis and mechanisms by which cerebrovascular endothelium-selective deletion of ADK restores
vasodilator function of small parenchymal arterioles in mixed dHF/AD. Through these aims, I will be able to
better elucidate the underlying vascular contribution in mixed dHF and AD pathologies as well as
mechanistically probe for the role of ADK in microvascular dysfunction and eventual cognitive impairment."
10894312,"Summary
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal of all brain tumors. Despite extensive efforts
to improve treatment, current GBM therapy only marginally prolongs median survival from about 12 months to
over 14 months. A variety of strategies have been attempted to improve treatment, but all have proven to be only
incrementally better than the current standard of care. Without the discovery of unique properties of gliomas that
could make them effective targets for treatment, GBM will continue to have an extremely poor prognosis. The
long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand the fundamental role of GTP metabolism in cancer growth using
GBM as a model system. To that end, we published in Molecular Cell (2016) the discovery of lipid kinase
PI5P4Kβ as an intracellular GTP sensor regulating the cells needs for GTP. In the course of investigating GTP
metabolism, we further published in Nature Cell Biology (2019) that increased GTP synthesis is directly linked
to the aggressive nature of GBM tumor proliferation. The GTP metabolic reprogramming is induced by
upregulation of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase-2 (IMPDH2), activating de novo GTP biosynthesis for
the promotion of ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Importantly, a unique feature of treatment resistant
GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) is exclusive dependence on de novo GTP synthesis. In unpublished preliminary
studies, we have discovered that IMPDH2 is markedly resistant to the damaging effects of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). Importantly, ionizing radiation exerts its cell killing effect on tumor through DNA breaks directly
and secondary to the generation of ROS, which accounts for 60-70 % of DNA lesions. This high ROS
resistance appears to a critical and specific feature of IMPDH2. The central hypothesis guiding this proposal is
that IMPDH2 promotes GBM growth by i) being resistant to the damaging effect radiation induced ROS, ii)
inducing de novo GTP synthesis required for GSCs survival. We will test this by exploring the molecular
mechanisms of the ROS resistance using the structural and molecular analyses of IMPDH2 and its mutants.
(Aim 1) and GSC’s high dependence on de novo GTP biosynthesis (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will use the IMPDH2
inhibitor, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its prodrug, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on in vivo GBM models
tracking tumor growth and GBM microenvironments with a secondary objective to determine if these inhibitors,
by virtue of their anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties, reduce the cerebral edema commonly seen
in GBM (Aim 3). Completion of these aims will identify the mechanisms through which IMPDH2 regulates de
novo GTP synthesis thereby driving on GBM tumor growth. These insights, when combined preclinical data on
MMF, a drug already approved for its immunosuppressive effects, has the potential to result in rapid translation
to human GBM.

10923807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly all (95%) patients diagnosed with lung cancer report perceiving stigma, defined as a perception and
internalization of negative appraisal and devaluation by self and others attributable to a lung cancer diagnosis.
Prior research indicates that 48% of patients with lung cancer experience stigma during clinical encounters
with their oncology care providers (OCPs), which may be potentially triggered and/or exacerbated by OCPs’
routine assessment of smoking history. Perceived stigma has negative effects on patients’ psychological well-
being as well as their medical outcomes. Promoting empathic communication appears to be a potentially
effective intervention target to help reduce patients’ perceptions of stigma within clinical encounters; however,
no formal trainings exist that focus on teaching empathic communication to OCPs. To address this key need,
we developed an Empathic Communication Skills (ECS) training focusing on the communication challenges
inherent in OCPs’ discussions of smoking behavior and history with lung cancer patients. Building upon
favorable findings from a prior R21 (R21CA202793), our goal is to conduct a national trial of ECS training to
facilitate improvements in the medical and psychosocial care of lung cancer patients through de-stigmatizing
interactions with OCPs. We will conduct a cluster randomized trial at 16 lung cancer care delivery sites,
comparing ECS training (intervention group) with a Waitlist Control Group (WLC) among 160 OCPs (thoracic
oncology physicians and advance practice providers) and 960 lung cancer patients (6 patients per clinician).
The ECS training will be offered remotely and include all the didactic and experiential training materials that
were developed for the pilot trial. To increase the real-world generalizability of our trial, we will leverage two
national networks of community oncology practices, the Care Continuum Centers of Excellence coordinated by
our lung cancer patient advocacy partner, the Go2 Foundation for Lung Cancer and the Extension for
Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) sites for lung cancer care, supported by an American Cancer Society
ECHO Hub. The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate the impact of the ECS training on OCP primary outcomes
(communication and empathic skill uptake) and secondary outcomes (training appraisal – relevance, novelty,
clarity; self-efficacy, attitude towards communication with patients); (2) to evaluate the impact of the ECS
training vs. WLC on patients’ reported primary outcomes (lung cancer stigma), and secondary outcomes
(perceived clinician empathy, satisfaction with communication, psychological distress, social isolation, and
patients’ experience of clinical encounter). Additionally, acceptance of referral to tobacco cessation (for current
smokers) and relapse prevention (for former smokers) will be explored; and (3) to examine potential
moderators of OCP and patient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that the ECS training will demonstrate
significant improvements in clinicians’ uptake of empathic skills and self-efficacy and will be superior to WLC
with regards to patient reported measures of stigma, clinician empathy, satisfaction, and overall experience."
10870070,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of human dementia that progressively worsens with
age. Sporadic late-onset AD accounts for more than 90 percent of Alzheimer’s cases without clear documented
familial history of the disease. However, the vast majority of existing transgenic and knock-in models incorporate
disease-causing familial mutations in one or more genes associated with dementias, representing a major
limitation. The RFA-AG-21-003 [New/Unconventional Animal Models of Alzheimer’s Disease] highlights the
need to develop and characterize naturally occurring “non-murine models of AD that may represent improved
translational potential by better replicating pathological features of the human disease”. We respond to the RFA
to apply single cell epigenomic and transcriptomic technologies developed by our team to create cell-type-
specific epigenome and transcriptome maps in frontal cortex and hippocampus that are associated with AD-like
pathogenesis in two naturally occurring AD animal models: Octodon degus and Canis familiaris. These animals
show age-dependent neuropathology and cognitive impairment similar to those observed in human AD, thus
they are natural AD models. As both degus and mice are rodents, the studies of long-lived degus will be
particularly valuable for a within-mammalian order comparison of which AD gene regulatory pathways are
common to spontaneous AD-like features in degus versus different transgenic mouse models. While we
generate the resources in alignment with the RFA goals, the proposed research will allow us to develop a
comparative analysis to determine conserved epigenetic alterations in the unconventional animal models and
bridge our existing databases of mouse models and humans. Maladaptive changes in accessible chromatin
accessibility, chromatin organization and gene expression in disease relevant cell types will reveal species-
specific and cross-species conserved mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, as well as new targets for AD prevention
and treatment. This will provide new insights into the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis in humans. In addition
to genome data sharing at the designated NIH depository, resources will be shared and curated at our UCI
Center for Neural Circuit Mapping."

Metastasis continues to cause the vast majority of breast cancer related deaths because the metastatic
process is poorly understood and therapies for effectively inhibiting it do not exist. Women with BRCA1
mutations develop the most aggressive, and highly metastatic basal-like breast cancer at a high rate. Despite
resembling basal epithelial cells, recent studies have identified the luminal progenitor as the cell type which
undergoes malignant transformation in basal-like breast cancer. Preliminary sequencing data included in this
proposal, from same-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility epigenetics assay in a mouse model of
basal-like breast cancer, reveal the presence of several differentiation states of luminal progenitor cells within
the tumor. Additionally, several tumor cell states appear to have unique DNA copy-number mutational
signatures. These observations prompt the questions of whether a particular differentiation state is involved in
metastasis and if mutations drive the differentiation and metastasis trajectory.
To investigate the metastatic potentials of the cellular differentiation states and mutational cell subpopulations
in the tumors, the proposed study will consist of the following methodological steps: 1) harvesting
spontaneously generated Brca1&p53-mutant mouse tumors, 2) injection of tumor cells into mice to generate
metastasis replicates, 3) isolation of metastatic cells using mouse strain-specific antibodies, 4) splitting of
metastatic cells and original mammary tumor cells for parallel single cell profiling with a) gene expression and
chromatin accessibility assay and b) custom-built high-resolution mutation panel, 5) data integration to
incorporate the contribution of mutations, epigenetic chromatin states, and gene expression, 6) computational
comparison of metastatic cells to original tumor cells. This study is expected to reveal the molecular markers
which define metastatic cells in Brca1&p53-mutant tumors to inspire metastasis inhibiting therapy.
This study will be carried out by a student with substantial training in molecular pathology and systems biology
who wishes to further her cancer genomics and bioinformatics training. Laboratory animal personnel will assist
with animal work, the bioinformatics director will guide the computational analysis and statistical tests, and the
faculty advisor/sponsor will oversee experiments and interpretations of results. The student will work closely
with the sponsor and the bioinformatics collaborator to learn the proper use of cutting edge genomics and
bioinformatics tools to advance the breast cancer metastasis field. Additionally, the student will be given
professional development opportunities such as attending conferences, mentoring undergraduates, and
teaching a summer course to prepare her for a post-doctoral position in a cancer-related field."
10835420,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Recent decades have been marked by a revolution in single-cell analytical techniques, instruments and
software tools that have markedly improved our understanding of biology. A high-profile example has been the
emergence of single-cell sequencing to move from bulk genomic and transcriptomic analysis to single-cell
resolution that reveals the heterogeneity of individual cells. Similar trends have been observed in protein
analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and other disciplines.
However, there remains a critical unmet need in understanding individual cellular function, movement,
interactions, and other measures of performance. The genesis of cells as living drugs requires the
development of technologies that can characterize the function and performance of massive numbers of cells
at single-cell resolution to support development of new therapies and clinical biomarkers. Unfortunately,
existing technologies are either not scalable, are cell-destructive and so cannot evaluate cells and their
interactions over time, or do not provide single-cell resolution.
CellChorus® evaluates the performance and interactions of thousands of individual cells by applying Time-
lapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids (TIMING™) with neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) to
identify, track, and characterize behaviors and interactions of disease cells together with T-cells and other
effector cells. The platform has been validated technically and commercially in an academic setting and an
early access laboratory, but this model does not scale.
We will develop and rigorously validate a Chronos™ instrument that delivers dynamic single-cell analysis
based on the TIMING platform and applying our existing AI software and algorithms. The Chronos instrument
will allow scientists, researchers, and manufacturing experts to apply dynamic single-cell analysis to catalyze
development and manufacture of novel therapies in infectious diseases, oncology, and other medical sciences."

Center is a dynamic collaboration between the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health (LRCBH) in Las 
Vegas, Nevada (NV), and the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). Our research center is very significant for 
the demographic evolution of Southern NV. This is evidenced by the fact that State Officials strongly support our 
project and interact regularly with AC leadership to inquire about progress and need for support. 
 During CNTN Phase 1, the work accomplished by AC has transformed the translational neuroscience 
research environment in Southern NV. The significant achievements of AC are: 1- the investment in cutting-edge 
infrastructure for neuroscience and NDD research; 2- the mentoring of six Junior Investigators (JIs) who 
graduated with independent positions; 3- the creation of a Clinical and Translational Research Core (CTRC) to 
build and deeply phenotype a new longitudinal cohort of patients suffering NDD; and 4- the establishment of a 
Data Management and Statistics Core to securely store and manage large biomedical datasets and assist CNTN 
investigators with statistical analyses. AC has utilized the data compiled from innovative methods developed by 
the Assessment Unit to monitor the operations of CNTN Cores and projects. 
 For Phase 2, the AC intends to exploit the data from the Assessment Unit for decision-making. The data will 
be scrutinized to strategize on how to optimize the development of research infrastructure that will support new 
projects, the career development of CNTN investigators, and sustainability beyond the COBRE support period. 
The first step in our strategy is the augmentation of the AC leadership with two co-Directors (Drs. Sabbagh and 
Kinney) and one Assistant Director (Dr. Cummings) to efficiently manage the rapid growth of the CNTN 
enterprise. Our new AC leadership ambitions to accomplish five specific aims during Phase 2. First, AC will 
enhance the coordination of CNTN Cores, projects, and advisory Committees. Second, the AC will advance 
scientific research by increasing the size of our cohort and fortifying fundamental research projects, including 
the projects by junior and pilot project investigators. Third, the AC will enhance the career development of all 
CNTN personnel. Fourth, the AC will foster a robust assessment process of CNTN activities to further use the 
data for decision-making. Fifth, AC will utilize COBRE, institutional, industry, and philanthropic support to 
accentuate the sustainable future of neuroscience research in Southern NV. Therefore, AC leaders are fully 
committed to develop the translational neuroscience research ecosystem in Southern NV and assist State 
Officials with finding an impactful response to curb the upcoming NDD pandemic in NV."

Data Management and Statistics Core (DMSC)
The Data Management and Statistics Core (DMSC) is an integral component of the Center for
Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience (CNTN), providing each project and core with the digital
infrastructure for accurate data capture, secure storage, access to high-quality integrated datasets, and expert
statistical consultation. Through these resources, the DMSC directly facilitates the CNTN goals of advancing the
careers of junior investigators, expanding the neuroscience and research infrastructure in Nevada, and
enhancing the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). In Phase 1 of the COBRE award, the
DMSC adopted OpenClinica, an open-sourced electronic data capture platform, to construct a distributed cloud-
based data entry system that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. Throughout Phase 1, the Clinical and Translational
Research Core (CTRC) of the CNTN established a cohort of individuals with AD or PD, and a group of
demographically comparable cognitively normal (CN) older adults. A comprehensive data set generated by the
CTRC, captured using OpenClinica, and maintained by the DMSC serves as a gateway for NDD researchers
and collaborators who are not project leaders. Given the growth of the DMSC under the leadership of Joseph
Lombardo in Phase 1, we intend to expand this Core during Phase 2. Director Lombardo will continue to lead
the Core. Guogen Shan, PhD will serve as Associate Director for Biostatistics and will continue to work with
COBRE and non-COBRE researchers to develop novel statistical tools to analyze neuroscience data. Justin B.
Miller, PhD, a neuropsychologist with a deep interest in biomedical informatics, will be the Associate Director for
Biomedical Informatics for Phase 2. During Phase 1 of the award, Dr. Miller worked under the mentorship of
Gustavo Jiminez-Maggoria, Director of Informatics at the University of Southern California’s Alzheimer’s
Therapeutic Research Institute, and has functioned as a liaison between DMSC faculty, the CTRC, and project
leaders to ensure that the database functions smoothly for comprehensive data capture, organization, archiving,
analysis, and export to non-COBRE research communities. In Phase 2 of the award, Dr. Miller will continue to
work with project leaders and core directors to ensure that study data are of good quality, readily available, and
accessible to project leaders. Additionally, in Phase 2, members of the DMSC will work extensively with the
newly formed and recently integrated Brain Imaging Core (BIC). Phase 2 will require expansion and refinement
of the DMSC’s digital infrastructure to facilitate integration of both raw image data and structured quantitative
imaging data."

 Brain Imaging Core
This Center for Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience (CNTN) COBRE Phase 2 application seeks
the continuation of success achieved with the COBRE Phase 1 funding and includes a request to establish a
Brain Imaging Core (BIC). The primary goals of the BIC are to expand and improve imaging and analytic data
analyses methods, which will increase the success of the Phase 2 projects, generate new pilot projects, and
establish collaborations with researchers from University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) and other Institutional
Development Award (IDeA) state communities with interests in neuroimaging. Successful interaction of the BIC
with the other Cores (Data Management and Statistic Core [DMSC], Clinical and Translational Neuroscience
Core [CTNC]) and Phase 2 Junior Investigators (JIs) provides opportunity for advancement to independent
research careers, build neuroscience infrastructure in Nevada, and advances the understanding of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Expert imaging and analytic capability is essential for supporting
research and training and provides a foundation for transition of the BIC to a self-sustaining core. The major
goals of the BIC are to provide support for JIs in neuroimaging research and to further characterize patients and
cognitively normal controls using imaging and analytic data analyses. Furthermore, the BIC will develop tutorials
for training on imaging and data analysis methods and will advance novel methods to better characterize patients
with neurodegenerative disorders resulting in improved assessment, diagnosis, classification, and prediction
accuracies, as well as tools for translational discovery. Imaging and data analysis approaches will be
strengthened for all COBRE projects and the availability of analytical methods and training will provide significant
support to JIs and other researchers throughout the COBRE system. Robust interactions between the brain
imaging group that will comprise the BIC and collaborators in Phase 1 supports the creation of this new core in
the CNTN."

 PROJECT R-2 
Ethnoracial Characterization of Patient-Centered Outcomes (Dr. John) 
Both African American and Hispanic older adults are at greater risk for the development of Alzheimer’s disease 
and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). Improving the identification and measurement of NDD within 
ethnoracially diverse patients is therefore a public health priority. Neurodegenerative disorders manifest 
differently across diverse, multicultural groups as a result of disease comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and 
exposures to discrimination and developmental disadvantages. However, accurate measurement of disease is 
a necessary precursor for investigating treatment efficacy. Use of patient-centered outcomes can increase the 
likelihood of minority patient engagement and retention in research. Patient-centered outcomes also increase 
treatment adherence and improve quality of life. Research in NDD has been slow to embrace and prioritize 
patient-reported outcome measures. Instead, studies of NDD rely on clinical outcome measures of cognition, 
behavioral symptoms, and independent functioning, which may be reported only by a caregiver and interpreted 
by a healthcare provider. Patient and caregiver perceptions of current NDD outcome measures are not well 
researched, and this is particularly true for ethnoracial minorities. Even among common clinical outcome 
measures, minimal research exists examining the validity and efficacy within ethnoracial minority samples. The 
proposed project will utilize an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to evaluate common clinical trial 
outcome measures and patient-centered outcomes in NDD within Hispanic and African American participants. 
We will first evaluate the measurement properties of existing clinical trial outcome measures to ensure that they 
do not disadvantage ethnoracial minorities. This will allow us to assess the comparability of existing measures 
across diverse groups. We will then conduct focus groups with ethnoracially diverse patients and community 
older adults to identify culturally sensitive healthcare concerns and prioritized patient-centered outcomes. Finally, 
we will evaluate these perceptions and preferences in greater detail through a survey administered to a larger 
sample of racially diverse community participants and current CNTN patients to evaluate the presence of any 
group differences that may exist by ethnoracial identity. The findings from these analyses may have profound 
impact in clinical trials and outcome measurements among older adults with NDD. The study goals outlined 
above will generate pilot data for future research and will help support the project leader in her application for 
independent research funding."
10919797,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are aggressive brainstem tumors in children with no curative therapies
available. DIPGs are canonically driven by recurrent mutations in the histone 3 gene (H3K27M). This substitution
imparts broad dysregulation of the histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate the recruitment
and initiation of transcriptional machinery. Processive transcription, or the mechanics of RNA Pol II as it actively
transcribes across chromatin, is both dependent on and actively propagates chromatin states such as dynamic
accessibility and transcription-associated PTMs (tPTMs). Disorders of transcription dynamics have
demonstrated pathogenic roles in cancer development, and inhibition of transcription machinery is an effective
therapy in these models. We have recently shown that the H3K27M mutation activates regulators of
transcriptional elongation, including CDK9. We have demonstrated that inhibition of CDK9-dependent
transcriptional elongation is an effective therapy in DIPG, but the contribution of processive transcription to DIPG
oncogenic transformation is unknown. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the H3K27M mutation
promotes CDK9-dependent nascent transcription, which in turn contributes to both the establishment of an
oncogenic chromatin state as well as the adaptive response to standard-of-care radiation therapy. Using a
combination of CRISPR-edited model systems, patient derived cultures, and both patient-derived xenograft and
syngeneic engineered mouse models, we will test this hypothesis by 1) defining the role of processive
transcription in H3K27M-mediated oncogenesis, 2) determining the impact of CDK9 inhibition on processive
transcription, and 3) characterizing the role of transcriptional induction in response to ionizing radiation.
Successful completion of the proposal will allow us to comprehensively map the impact of the H3K27M mutation
on the nascent transcriptional landscape. This data will enable us to define a novel transcriptional framework for
understanding DIPG’s chromatin-mediated oncogenesis, and it will demonstrate how exploiting this
transcriptional dependence may be leveraged to improve the patient benefit derived from radiation therapy.
The proposed career development plan leverages these studies to provide advanced training in the conduct of
rigorous hypothesis-driven research, the molecular study of transcriptional regulation, and representative pre-
clinical cancer modeling. The mentorship team reflects nationally-recognized senior scientists who possess both
focused expertise in these areas of study as well as a strong commitment to my career development. The training
plan outlines how I will refine my expertise through a combination of didactic course work, focused workshops,
national meetings, and mentorship guidance. Collectively, this training platform will facilitate my transition to
independence as a basic-translational researcher with a long-term goal of applying novel chromatin- and
transcription-based strategies to improve patient outcomes in DIPG."
10897744,"MICROBIAL GENOMICS BIOMEDICAL CORE (MGBC): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mission of the Columbia University O’Brien Urology Research Center is to identify genetic factors and
congenital malformations, such as vesicoureteral reflux, that predispose individuals to urinary tract infections
(UTI) and to explore host-bacterial metabolic processes, such as heme pathways, that enable or prevent
infection. UTI represent one of the most common infections, affecting 150 million people per year worldwide. In
support of the goals of the Columbia O’Brien Urology Research Center the Microbial Genomics and Biomedical
Core (MGBC) will provide high quality services for biobanking, extended bacterial culture, microbial genomics
(microbiome analyses, comparative genomics), microbial genetics, consultation for study design and outreach
for novel investigations into the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections. The MGBC will enable Columbia O’Brien
Center investigators to have access to specialized genomic technologies and coordinated expert consultations
for improved rigor and reproducibility in genomics and precision medicine. In recognition of the increasing impact
of antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract infections the MGBC has established a biorepository of multi-drug
resistant UTI isolates. The services and biorepository are specifically designed to meet the needs of two of the
Research Projects of the Columbia O’Brien Center and Opportunity Pool Awardees and will be available to the
wider urology research community. The MGBC will accomplish these goals through the following aims: 1)
Expand a biorepository of multi-drug resistant UTI isolate to multiple sites across New York City, establish a
urine biorepository from clinically well-defined patients with different UTI symptoms and perform extended urine
culture for organism identification; 2) Provide Microbiome and metagenome analyses and Hi-C/MetaPore-C
sequencing; 3) Facilitate whole genome sequencing of dominant UTI pathogenic clones to elucidate bacterial
determinants of UTI symptomatology; 4) Generate bacterial mutants in multi-drug resistant clinical UTI isolates
leveraging a highly efficient CRISPR-Cas system; and 6) Provide consultations and support of study design for
the Research Projects. Importantly, the MGBC will serve as a national resource for members of other George
M. O'Brien Cooperative Research Centers and other NIDDK Urologic Research Programs. In close collaboration
with the Administrative Core the MGBC will ensure adherence to all fiscal, administrative, and resource sharing
policies. The MGBC will also contribute to the goals of the Educational Enrichment and Opportunity Pool
Programs through lectures, student mentorship, and guidance on experimental design related to microbial
genomics for Opportunity Pool awardees. Taken together, the Columbia O’Brien U54 MGBC will enable state-
of-the-art characterization of microbes in UTIs, with a focus on evolving multi-drug resistance, by providing a
complementary set of tools harnessing molecular biology, genetics, and ‘omics technologies."
10897749,"PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genomic technologies such as exome sequencing and GWAS have not been systematically applied for most
benign urological phenotypes prior to our work at the Columbia O’Brien Urology Research Center. We have
already successfully applied genome-wide association study (GWAS) and rare copy-number variant analysis to
identify novel genes and loci associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
Here we propose to perform exome sequence of VUR patients to identify diagnostic rare single nucleotide
variants and perform an exploratory VUR whole exome association study. In collaboration with the Microbial
Genomics Biomedical Core we will conduct 16S rRNA sequencing from urine samples of a set of these patients,
with both VUR and urinary tract infections (UTI) to generate urinary microbiota profiles. We will then and analyze
microbiota profile associations with phenotypic variants and outcomes and with rare genetic variants, and
perform a microbiota-common variant genome-wide association study (mGWAS).
To extend these genomic studies to other important benign urology phenotypes we will perform a GWAS of
common lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) phenotypes, followed by phenome-wide association study to
uncover risk factors and comorbidities with common genetic etiology.
Our proposed studies will leverage existing data and biospecimens from four NIDDK-funded national cohorts,
the RIVUR (UTI with VUR), CUTIE (UTI without VUR), CKiD (pediatric chronic kidney disease, including reflux
VUR) and LURN (LUTS) study cohorts; as well as two large population cohorts that combine electronic medical
records and genomics, from the UK Biobank and the NHGRI-funded eMERGE network. The proposed studies
will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of disorders of high relevance to benign urology and also facilitate
introduction of genetic testing into the practice of Urology."
10897757,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mission of the Columbia University George M. O’Brien Urology Cooperative Research Center is to
advance the understanding of benign genitourinary diseases/disorders. The Center consists of an
Administrative (Admin) Core, a Microbial Genomics Biomedical Research Core, and three Research Projects
that include preclinical and clinical studies. Our focus includes: (1) the intersection of the host genome and the
urinary microbiome; (2) the transcriptional regulation of urothelial differentiation during homeostasis and repair
in response to UTI; and (3) how the regulation of urinary chemistry and urothelial iron metabolism (“iron-heme
machine”) is a component of the urothelial response to UTI. We anticipate that the proposed studies will
provide new insight into the pathogenesis of disorders of high relevance to benign urology and also facilitate
introduction of genetic testing into the practice of Urology and even suggest new treatments. We will examine
the interactions between host and invading bacteria, and the role of nutrient iron in shaping the outcome of UT
infections; we will undertake a new GWAS analysis to search for mutations that lead to LUTD, including
incontinence, obstruction and pelvic floor prolapse, we will analyze the urinary microbiome of patients with
lower urinary tract disfunction (LUTD), and we propose to identify pathways that program urothelial cell types
that may be used to treat benign urothelial abnormalities associated with disease. The most important goal of
this center is to utilize the expertise and experience of the urological community to increase the scope of our
studies and to help direct the kinds of questions we will address. We have directly integrated members of the
P20/U54 community as well as clinicians and scientists in the benign urological community. Co-investigators
on our projects include Indira Mysorekar (P20), an expert in UTI and urothelial biology who will work with Dr.
Mendelsohn and Dr. Barasch, Chad Vezina (Wisconsin U54) and collaborating scientists and clinicians from
the benign urological community, (Lori Birder, Gerry Apodaca, Doug Strand). In addition, we have invited
outside experts to join our work, for example, the heme biologist, Iqbal Hamza (University of Maryland). We
are also highly focused on education and outreach: Our summer program has trained 73 students since our
center has been established, including undergraduates, fourth year medical students and urology residents. we
have provided opportunity pool funds to Dr. Putonti (Loyola University) and Dr. Catherine Brownstein, (Harvard
University). We held a Symposium in October of 2019 that was extremely successful ""The problem of UTI: The
microbiome of the Urogenital Tract and its immune Defense"" bringing together a dozen experts with >138
members of the Urological community."
10897761,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Urinary tract infections are the most common urogenital abnormality worldwide affecting multiple organs of the
urinary tract including the urethra, bladder, prostate, ureter, and kidney. To establish a urinary tract infection,
bacteria must obtain nutrients in order to undergo continuous replication. These nutrients derive from the urine
and the epithelia of the urinary tract. Iron is a “precious metal” for bacteria because metabolic processes including
energy production and cell division require ~100,000 atoms of iron per bacterium. Yet it is the most difficult
nutrient to obtain because the common form, called ferric iron, is insoluble in water (Ksp=10-12M). Gram-negative
organisms have devised methods to obtain iron even with these vanishing low concentrations. They do this by
the production of a series of small molecules known as siderophores, each with astronomical affinity for iron.
One type of siderophore, called Enterochelin is the most prevalent. Yet, the epithelial cells of the urogenital tract
recognize this threat and rapidly produce a protein called NGAL (Lcn2) in great abundance. NGAL captures
Ent:Fe and prevents its iron from reaching bacteria. We discovered that the urothelium and the tracts up into the
kidney expresses NGAL. While most of our studies have focused on NGAL:Ent:Fe, there must be alternative
nutrient pathways and alternative mammalian defenses. We propose that bacterial heme transporters also steal
our iron and that epithelia in turn capture and metabolize heme. By adapting a novel method to analyze
“snapshots” of nascent RNA, we found that bladder urothelia and collecting ducts express heme capture, heme
metabolism, and iron sequestration and transport proteins, which compete with bacteria for heme. Most intriguing
is our finding that upon infection, the urothelial “heme machine” is activated and releases a byproduct of heme
metabolism, called Carbon Monoxide, a bacteriostatic agent. Moreover, the heme machine is the core complex
of the Circadian Clock, which is regulated by CO. Here we test the basic tenets of our hypothesis. We carefully
document heme and iron transport and metabolism in the urothelium to test the notion of that the urothelium and
bacteria compete for heme. We suggest that these mechanisms are re-purposed for “nutritional immune
defense” from the daily defense against the lysis of RBC that traverse the bladder each day. To investigate these
mechanisms, we have invented novel methods of RNA isolation, imaging tools to detect bacterial responses, a
method to detect and capture CO in vivo, novel mouse ko’s, and bacteria isolated from our patients with UTI’s
carrying mutations in siderophore and heme pathways. We are working with a leading microbiologist
(Uhlemann), animal geneticist (Mendelsohn), UTI specialist (Mysorekar) and the leading scientist in heme
biology (Hamza). Taken together, our studies demonstrate that rather than a passive barrier, the urothelium is a
metabolically active cell layer, that uses iron biology to detoxify hematuria and defend itself from UTI."
10897306,"In patients with epilepsy, central nervous system hyperexcitability and synchrony contribute to seizures and cognitive comorbidities. Systemic treatments with anticonvulsant drugs do not adequately control seizures and are often accompanied by severe side effects, where approximately 30-40% of the estimated 65 million epileptic patients worldwide are drug refractory. Consequently, new therapies are needed. Recent advances in optogenetics have demonstrated seizure suppression through precise cell type specific directional control of neural activity. While closed-loop optogenetic interventions provide strategies to identify networks to curtail seizures, the use of implanted fiber optic waveguides and transgenic mice precludes usage as a therapeutic tool. To overcome challenges associated with optogenetics as a clinical modality, this proposal will test the hypothesis that recently discovered supersensitive and red-shifted Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) can enable transcranial and cell type specific termination of spontaneous, recurrent seizures. The hypothesis will be tested by developing noninvasive viral-targeting strategies to restrict expression of these new ChRs to therapeutically- relevant interneuron subtypes followed by transcranial closed-loop optogenetic control in mouse models of focal epilepsy in the cortex and hippocampus. Chronic seizure suppression will be performed to test the long- term stability of this approach in wild-type animals. Further refining stimulation to specific projections will minimize off-target effects. By overcoming long standing hurdles of optogenetics, including invasiveness, viral- targeting of neural subpopulations, and scalability, this transcranial optogenetic platform will identify new opportunities for the treatment of epilepsy and may be extended to manage other neurological disorders.  During the proposed research and career training plan, I will be mentored by an experienced team of experts in systems neuroscience, optogenetics, animal models of epilepsy and behavior, electrophysiology and computational analysis. This team will advise my research project and professional development through training in new techniques, manuscript and grant writing, public speaking, advising of mentees, and collaborations within the tremendous scientific environment at Stanford University, which offers several core facilities, career development centers, and formal coursework to support my work. Upon completion of this mentored research project, I will gain a strong technical and conceptual foundation to bridge my background in engineering with systems neuroscience, which I will use to establish an independent research career to develop and apply methods to study the neural mechanisms that underly neurological disorders and to develop treatment concepts for them."
10928128,"This project proposes to investigate neurophysiological circuit mechanisms supporting spatial cognition and episodic memory. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is critical in these cognitive processes as RSC dysfunction is associated with spatial disorientation and learning and memory deficits, as well as Alzheimer’s disease pathology. One prominent idea is that RSC facilitates spatial transformations between coordinate systems, wherein egocentric spatial information encoded relative to the animal itself is related to allocentric spatial information encoded relative to the external world. This computation is required for navigation and episodic memory, as both require information experienced via sensory organs to be represented relative to the broader environment. RSC possesses the requisite anatomy and activity patterns to facilitate spatial transformations, but there has been no direct evidence of the computation occurring within the region. This gap at least partly arises from a general lack of knowledge regarding RSC base function; it is unknown if the region is flexibly recruited as a consequence of ongoing behavior, where functionally-defined RSC sub-populations project, or how afferent inputs contribute to known forms of spatial coding within the area.  I will learn techniques for high-density extracellular recordings, in vivo neuroimaging, and projection- specific optogenetics to test the role of retrosplenial circuit dynamics in spatial transformations. First, I will provide the first characterization of spatial coding differences and task-based recruitment of distinct RSC sub-regions that have biased projections to egocentric and allocentric spatial processing streams. From these large populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, I will test for intra- and extra-regional internal network states that reflect computation of spatial transformations. Next, I will utilize in vivo imaging of large RSC populations longitudinally to examine if neurons are prewired or learn their spatial receptive fields as a function of task demands. I will utilize projection-specific imaging to test if specific spatial signals are transmitted to specific efferent targets in support of spatial transformations. Finally, I will pair the aforementioned methods for observing activity of large neuronal populations with projection-specific optogenetic circuit manipulations to test the role of different afferent inputs on different forms of RSC spatial coding.  By utilizing innovative experimental approaches, these projects will provide important insights regarding the function of RSC in spatial transformations underlying spatial navigation and episodic memory. Results from these studies will establish RSC circuit mechanisms that mediate these cognitive processes in both healthy and pathological states. The scientific expertise and career/laboratory management tools that I will develop during the mentored phase of this award will be vital for my success as I transition into a faculty position and pursue my own independent research program."
10908431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are lung-resident macrophages. They are one of the cell types that first
encounter inhaled fungal pathogens. Currently, the role of AMs in fungal infections is still elusive; some articles
reported AMs to be protective, but others showed them detrimental. The challenge to study AMs is that
identification and evaluation of AMs in vivo require technologies such as; multi-color flow cytometry, reporter and
fate-mapping (FM) mouse systems, and single cell-level of gene expression analyses. By using these
technologies, we will elucidate the biological functions of AMs during pulmonary fungal infections.
 We recently demonstrated that AMs are the bona fide immune sentinels that respond to fungal infections
and also elicit heterogeneous immune responses. In particular, fungal infections generate pro- and anti-
inflammatory AM subpopulations simultaneously, and AM subpopulations with distinct functions co-exist in the
infected lung. Such heterogeneity within the AM population cannot be elicited by pulmonary instillation of Toll-
like recent ligands, suggesting possible specificity in fungal infections, likely through C-tyle lectin receptor
signaling.
 The central hypothesis of this proposed study is: AMs develop into pro- and anti-inflammatory AMs in
vivo at the level of transcriptional and epigenetic regulations, respectively. The generation of AM subpopulations
with dichotomous functions is considered to maximize fungal clearance and minimize collateral damage in the
lung. The objective of this proposed study is to identify the biological implication of functionally distinct AM
subpopulations and to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism by which the heterogeneous AM
subpopulations are generated, maintained, and lost during fungal infections in vivo."
10925281,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cellular Imaging Core
Advanced cellular microscopy is a powerful tool for biological research and has an important role to play in
the study of disease pathogenesis, which may translate eventually to novel treatment approaches for
rheumatic diseases. Imaging technology has evolved rapidly over the last decade leading to improvements
in resolution, sensitivity and speed which have created fundamentally new opportunities for studying
processes across many orders of magnitude and in real-time in living cells and animals. At the same time,
the costs of increasingly sophisticated equipment are substantial and the expertise to efficiently use, maintain,
and develop this equipment is not common in most labs. There is therefore a significant gap between the
availability of these powerful tools and the ability of investigators to access and use them efficiently. The
Cellular Imaging Core (CIC) was originally created in response to feedback from Washington University
Rheumatic Diseases Research Resource-based Center (WU-RDRRC) members to leverage the significant
institutional investment in the newly created Washington University Center for Cellular Imaging (WUCCI) and
provide an integrated approach to investigate the structure and dynamic behavior of cells and tissues in
rheumatic disease-related model systems. The overall objective of the core is to provide access to and
technical support in using advanced cellular microscopy tools to accelerate the pace, expand the scope, and
improve efficiency of rheumatic diseases research. The core services meet the unique requirements of
numerous investigators over a wide range of basic and translational research, attracting new investigators
into rheumatic diseases research areas. Importantly the users benefit from the in-depth technical expertise of
the Core Director and technical staff in the time spent in consultation for experimental design and
interpretation of data. During the past funding cycle, the core served 28 WU-RDRRC investigator research
laboratories, who expensed $520,699 in core recharges, which represented approximately 12% of all WUCCI
activity. Fourteen WU-RDRRC investigator laboratories received micro-grant funding through the WU-
RDRRC Imaging Core Scholarship program, 5 of which were junior faculty members. Given the broad usage
of core over the past funding cycle, and the establishment of new imaging technologies (e.g. cryoEM and
lattice lightsheet), sample preparation services (e.g. tissue clearing), and analysis approaches (e.g. AI-based
IHC and IF image analysis), it is anticipated that requests for CIC services will continue to be robust given the
overwhelming need for advanced microscopic imaging and image analysis approaches, thus accelerating the
research endeavors of WU-RDRRC members throughout the next funding cycle."
10701095,"Upon return from 1991 Gulf War (GW), many veterans began suffering from a wide range of health symptoms
of unknown etiology. These symptoms encompass 6 major domains including cognitive and sleep, pain,
neurological and cognitive, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin manifestations, which have come to be
categorized as Gulf War Veterans’ illnesses (GWVI). GWVI is a multisystem disease estimated to affect 25% of
GW Era veterans. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration have been postulated to underlie GWVI
symptoms. A need in the field is to better define GWVI, and distinguish symptom clusters within GWVI, in order
to develop targeted treatments. Our central hypothesis is that a comprehensive neurosensory testing
protocol can be applied to the study of GWVI to distinguish GWVI case groups from controls and to
identify sub-groups within GWVI. This protocol consists of applying quantitative sensory testing (QST)
strategies to evaluate the integrity of sensory processing mechanisms (Aim 1), examining trigeminal neural
circuit responses to light using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Aim 2), and examining neuro-
inflammatory signatures in blood (Aim 3) in individuals with GWVI and appropriate controls. The combined
results of these three aims will allow us to examine which neurosensory metrics, in isolation or combination, are
most useful in predicting GWVI phenotypes. Along with forwarding our understanding of GWVI pathophysiology,
these data can be used to develop tests that can be used in the clinical arena to sub-group individuals based on
underlying mechanisms, an important first step to developing targeted therapies."
10701094,"Personalizing Veteran's Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-specific mortality in United States, including among Veterans. Annual
lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk individuals has been
demonstrated to save lives in two large, randomized-controlled trials and is recommended by the US Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) for individuals aged 50 to 80 with at least 20 pack years of smoking and who
currently smoke or quit in the past 15 years. Yet, individuals eligible under these criteria would only capture 45-
65% of all lung cancers. In this proposal, we seek to personalize lung cancer screening and diagnosis.
Veterans are at great risk for lung cancer given the higher prevalence of tobacco smoking and service-connected
exposures, including agent orange, asbestos, burn pits, and ionizing radiation. These hazardous materials and
exposures, frequently encountered in the military, are associated with lung cancer but are not part of current
recommended eligibility criteria. Furthermore, lung cancer screening results in an increase in the detection of
indeterminant pulmonary nodules. Our teams' data suggests that two candidate biomarkers could mitigate
sending Veterans with benign nodules for invasive procedures and shorten the time to lung cancer diagnosis.
First, an artificial intelligence model (Lung Cancer Predictor Convolutional Neural Network, LCP-CNN)
significantly improves discrimination between benign and malignant nodules on LDCTs. Our LCP-CNN algorithm
generates accurate reclassification of up to 30% of intermediate risk nodules (10-70% risk for cancer) to lower
or higher risk levels, thus, decreasing the number of invasive procedures and shortening the time to diagnosis.
The other biomarker is CYFRA 21-1, a serum protein cancer biomarker for which we developed a high sensitivity
assay. Based on these preliminary data, we propose to answer the following clinical question: Can we safely
offer lung cancer screening to Veterans who are at greater risk beyond their age and smoking history
but due to their personal and service-related exposures while improving the rate of early and non-
invasive detection of lung cancer?
Aim 1: In a prospective cohort of 800 Veterans at Nashville, Denver and Louisville between 50-80 years of age
who ever smoked cigarettes, we will evaluate if a new, personalized lung cancer screening eligibility criteria that
incorporates military exposures, COPD, personal history of tobacco-related cancer, and family history of lung
cancer results in at least the same number of lung cancers detected compared to the standard of care USPSTF
screening criteria in use by our Lung Precision Oncology Program lung cancer screening programs.
Aim 2: Among a cohort of Nashville Veterans with positive screenings (n=520), we will test the hypothesis that
the LCP-CNN in combination with hs-CYFRA 21-1 reduces the number of invasive procedures and shortens the
time to lung cancer diagnosis versus the Brock Model. We will manage positive screens from Aim 1 and test the
combined biomarker approach proposed in Aim 2 to rule in cancer early and rule out benign lung nodules.
Impact: We will safely personalize lung cancer screening in the Veteran community to improve the number of
cancers detected early, reduce the rate of invasive procedures, and avoid a missed chance for cure for early
detected lung cancers. This project will provide proof of principle for personalizing lung cancer screening criteria
among Veterans and test the clinical utility of a combined biomarker-based approach to manage screen-detected
indeterminate pulmonary nodules. The proposed research will provide actionable evidence for Veterans with
military exposures and would impact VHA policy. Our team is poised to conduct a rigorous and necessary
evaluation and the findings will inform the development of a larger, national randomized-controlled CSP trial to
test if LDCT screening among Veterans meeting expanded and personalized criteria results in improved survival."
10925275,"Project Summary/Abstract—Biobank & Phenotyping Core (BPC)
Translational research will continue to play a central role in the 21st century research and clinical practice, but
substantial barriers exist to accessing clinical data, biospecimens, and cutting-edge genomic and proteomic
technologies and analytics.
The Washington University Rheumatic Diseases Research Resource-based Center (WU-RDRRC) Biobank and
Phenotyping Core (BPC) eases the high hurdle of executing rigorous translational research by streamlining and
accelerating the process from clinical data and biospecimen access and collection to full analysis. The goals of
the BPC are to 1) improve access archived clinical data and biospecimens and assist with the prospective
collection of the same, 2) access cutting-edge technologies including next-generation sequencing platforms,
mass cytometry including imaging mass cytometry, and spatial transcriptomics, and 3) provide sophisticated
informatics and biostatistical support and education for the integration of registry data along with molecular data
generated in #2. These services also interface with other WU-RDRRC Cores such as the Genome Engineering
Core and the Cellular Imaging Core to provide preclinical functional testing. We accomplish the goals of the WU-
RDRRC BPC through the following three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Facilitate the collection of rigorously phenotyped clinical data and high-quality biospecimens using the
BPC-Biobank. The BPC-Biobank provides WU-RDRRC members a unified mechanism to access archived
samples and simplify the prospective collection of data and samples for investigators, preventing duplication of
complicated logistics and providing substantial cost savings.
Aim 2. Support state-of-the-art proteomic, genomic, and transcriptomic methods to interrogate human
biospecimens and murine samples: The BPC Biospecimen Analytics Core (BAC). The BPC-BAC integrates
cutting-edge technologies to extract molecular features from biologic samples in a streamlined pipeline that
dramatically reduced the learning and access to execute impactful translational research. Both proteomic and
genomic features (including spatial transcriptomics) are obtained using highly streamlined workflows
individualized to each investigator’s needs at discounted rates for WU-RDRRC members.
Aim 3. Provide integrated bioinformatics and analytics support for complex datasets: the Integrative Informatics
Core (IIC). The BPC-IIC maximizes research potential by directly and simply addressing the “last mile” problem
in translational research. By easing access to high-level complex analytic pipelines, the IIC provides “one-stop
shopping” for WU-RDRRC members to leverage the wide array of advanced analytic pipelines and expertise
with complex datasets by providing informatics and biostatistical services and education that enable the
integration of individual-level clinical, demographic, SDOH, and PRO data collected in Aim 1 with proteomic and
NGS molecular datasets in Aim 2."
10909387,"All health care delivery organizations measure care quality and outcomes, increasingly via electronic clinical
quality measures 1 and dashboards 2,3. However, these organizations lack evidence-based strategies for putting
their quality and outcome data to work to improve performance 4,5. The most common approach is audit and
feedback (A&F), the delivery of clinical performance summaries to providers, which demonstrates potential for
large effects on clinical practice 6–8. But A&F too often produces negligible effects 5,9, creating little more than
distraction for providers who are fatigued by information chaos 9–11. As currently implemented, A&F is a blunt,
“one size fits most” intervention. Each provider in a care setting typically receives identical metrics in a
common format, despite a growing recognition that “precisionizing” interventions holds significant promise to
improve their impact 12–15. A precision approach to A&F would prioritize display of information in the single
metric that, for each recipient, carries the highest value for improving performance, such as when the metric's
level drops below a peer benchmark or minimum standard for the first time, revealing an actionable
performance gap 16–19. Furthermore, precision A&F would employ an optimal message format (including framing
and visual displays 20–24), based on what is known about the recipient and the intended gist meaning being
communicated, to improve message interpretation while reducing cognitive processing burden 25–28. Well-
established psychological principles, frameworks, and theoretical mechanisms provide a knowledge base to
achieve precision A&F 16–19,29–33. From an informatics perspective, precision A&F requires a knowledge-based
system that uses psychological theory at its core, but which enables mass customization by giving precedence
to configurable knowledge about recipients at the group and individual levels. A precision A&F service employs
this knowledge as requirements (necessary characteristics for message acceptability) and preferences (the
relative importance of message characteristics) to generate messages that are more likely than a “one size fits
most” report to positively influence clinical decision-making and practice. An equally important informatics
challenge is to enable widespread improvement through a service for precision A&F at scale. A scalable
precision A&F service must function as infrastructure compatible with a wide range of computing environments
and supporting a wide range of clinical domains. In his previous NLM K-award, the principal investigator
developed and tested a prototype knowledge-based system for precision A&F in email messages in anesthesia
care. Preliminary data show that provider preferences are not uniform, suggesting that a platform for
computable knowledge is necessary to support scalable precision A&F. The Knowledge Grid platform,
developed at the University of Michigan, has been shown to support “precisionizing” for clinical decision
support systems 34–36. Based on our prior work, the proposed project will advance the creation of more general
services for precision A&F, applying the service in anesthesia care as a demonstration domain."
10926842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer sequencing projects have demonstrated that tumors are tremendously heterogeneous,
reflecting the large diversity of perturbations in the cellular machinery that promote tumor growth
and metastasis. Tumors from different patients with the same type of cancer have a diverse
collection of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic aberrations. Moreover, a tumor from a
single patient is a mixture of cell types including normal cells, stroma, and multiple subpopulations
of cancerous cells. We propose a Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) that will develop and
apply novel computational approaches to address the challenges of inter-tumor and intra-tumor
heterogeneity. This GDAC will integrate data from multiple genome characterization platforms,
multiple sequencing technologies -- including bulk, single-cell, and spatial sequencing
technologies – and leverage prior knowledge of pathways and interaction networks to explain
clinical phenotypes and inform treatment strategies. The GDAC will perform pathway and network
integration of genome characterization data, spatial analysis of tumor microenvironment, and
temporal analysis of intra-tumor heterogeneity, tumor evolution, and network rewiring. These
analyses will enable more precise translation of cancer genome characterization efforts into
clinical utility for a larger fraction of cancer patients. The GDAC will continue the ongoing
contributions of the PIs to the current Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) and previous
efforts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC) projects."
10923863,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
 The goal for our Center of Innovation for Brain Tumor Therapeutics is to develop effective novel therapeutic
strategies for glioblastoma (GBM). The primary strategy pursued is focused on optimal integration of novel
DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitors with standard-of-care genotoxic agents to potentiate the effects of
proven therapies. The overarching framework applied to this problem incorporates fundamental tumor biology
of DNA damage signaling integrated with cutting edge pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
evaluation of spatial drug distribution and effect and systems analysis of drug perturbation of signaling
networks to develop optimized therapeutic strategies. Pre-clinical studies will be performed using a large,
highly characterized panel of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and results from these studies will be
used to guide development of pilot clinical trials in both Projects. The Therapy Evaluation Core will support the
execution of these animal and human studies, and the Pharmacology Core will support the PK and PD
analysis of specimens obtained in these animal and human studies. The highly integrated analyses planned
across the two Projects and two Cores will be organized and facilitated by the Administrative Core. The
Administrative Core also will facilitate the connection of the Center team with the broader Glioma Therapeutics
Network. Functions for the Administrative Core can be broadly characterized as five specific aims:
Aim 1: Provide overall leadership for the Center
Aim 2: Guide scientific planning and evaluation of Projects and Cores
Aim 3: Foster integration and communication of Project and Core teams
Aim 4: Administrative management of the Center
Aim 5: Facilitate interactions with the Glioma Therapeutics Network and external collaborators"
10928137,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 continues to have a detrimental impact on society, even after the
rapid development of safe and effective vaccines. The worst phases of the pandemic caused systemic
and cultural shifts in education, work, commerce, social ties, and even the process of grieving. The
SARS-CoV-2 virus has taken 6.5 million lives worldwide, over 1 million lives in the US, and nearly 23,000
Veterans receiving care in the VA system. The highly infectious Omicron variant has caused the largest
surge of cases yet, with a peak in mid-January 2022. This variant causes milder symptoms but is more
resistant to current vaccines. While the most severely affected COVID patients are rightfully the focus
of many investigations, patients with milder disease may show lasting changes as well. An important
study by Al-Aly, Xie, and Bowe (2021) identified all non-hospitalized Veterans who had at least one
SARS-CoV-2 positive test and who survived 30 days after diagnosis. Six months later, those who had
COVID had an excess burden of respiratory conditions, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular conditions,
insomnia, fatigue, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders, and neurocognitive disorders. Follow-up
studies found that many of these conditions can persist for at least one year (Xie et al., 2022a,b). In
addition, the risk of adverse health outcomes increases in Veterans with multiple infections (Al-Aly et al.,
preprint). Although epidemiological studies have been helpful in identifying population-level trends, a key
missing perspective can be provided by Veterans’ ratings of their own mental and physical symptoms.
This is critical because future interventions require a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by
Veterans with post-COVID conditions. The unique needs of Veterans include higher rates of the
comorbidities commonly associated with a greater risk of negative COVID outcomes (diabetes,
hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions). Ongoing cognitive issues after a COVID infection can also
have a negative impact on employment and daily functioning. Cognitive dysfunction was the third most
commonly reported symptom in a survey of the Long Covid community (Davis et al., 2021), yet ""brain
fog"" remains scantly investigated, especially in Veterans. The proposed observational study will have a
two group, prospective, repeated measure (3 time points) design with a study group and a closely
matched healthy comparator group. The study group will be Veterans (n=300) who had a positive test for
SARS-CoV-2 within the last 3-24 months but were not hospitalized. This population comprises the
majority of VA patients with positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (approximately 85-90%). Their results will
be compared to healthy Veteran controls matched on demographic variables, pre-existing psychiatric
conditions, and major comorbidities (n=300). Follow-up tests will be conducted six months and 12
months later. The project will obtain objective measures of cognitive performance over time and
explore their relationship to mental health (anxiety, depression, PTSD) and other persistent post-acute
sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) symptoms (insomnia, fatigue) in COVID-19 survivors. Covariates will
adjust for baseline scores, number of vaccines, and time since diagnosis. We will also examine the
impact of multiple infections on mental health and cognitive outcomes. A validated web-based testing
platform will obtain objective and reliable measures of sustained attention, executive function, episodic
memory, and working memory. A better understanding of specific weaknesses in cognitive function over
time is necessary to identify future intervention targets in the Veteran population with persistent post-
COVID conditions. Our study will also establish the importance of monitoring the mental health of
Veterans who have recovered from COVID-19. Those with persistent symptoms can be referred to
appropriate services to improve their quality of life."
10835053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Decades of modulating the anti-cancer activity of fluoropyrimidine drugs (FPs) thru schedule optimization,
biochemical modulation, and drug combinations have provided a significant, but limited, survival advantage for
treating colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease (mCRC). However,
outcomes remain poor for patients with mCRC and since targeted therapies and immunotherapies provide only
a limited benefit to a sub-set of CRC patients, new approaches are urgently needed. Deep Creek Pharma
together academic partner Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) is developing CF10, the first DNA-based
FP polymer, as an improved treatment for CRC. In pre-clinical studies through Phase 1 STTR support, we have
demonstrated that CF10 is much more potent than 5-FU to CRC cells and demonstrated improved survival
relative to 5-FU in multiple colon tumor models in rodents. Further, CF10 displayed reduced systemic toxicities
relative to 5-FU making it a strong candidate for clinical development. We have also established CF10 displays
distinct pharmacological and mechanistic properties relative to conventional FP drugs. Based on these findings,
DeepCreek Pharma and WFSM/Gmeiner Lab propose to jointly investigate CF10 as a candidate for clinical
development.
A major unmet need is treatment of mCRC that is refractory to FOLFOX (5-FU, Leucovorin (LV), oxaliplatin), and
other front-line therapies for mCRC. The proposed research in phase II will therefore focus on (Aim 1) Developing
CF10 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and testing for improved activity, including in a therapy-resistant CRC liver
metastasis model. LNP formulation has proven to be a robust delivery strategy for multiple nucleic acid drugs,
and identifying a preferred LNP formulation will promote CF10 clinical development. In Aim 2 of the Phase II
studies we will perform safety pharmacology studies of CF10 and CF10:LNPs in rodents while in Aim 3 we will
evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in non-human primates (NHPs). Studies in NHPs accurately
reflect human physiology and metabolism and are particularly important for regulatory apprval. Collectively, our
Phase II STTR studies will provide critical data for to advance CF10 into clinical trials and ultimately its
commercialization."
10825600,"Hepatoselective Dihydroquinolizinone (HS-HS-DHQ) Molecules for Treatment and Prevention
 of Hepatitis A Virus Infection
ABSTRACT
This is a Phase I proposal to develop Harlingene’s hepatoselective dihydroquinolizinones (HS-
DHQs) for treatment and prevention of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. This will be the first
antiviral therapy to treat HAV infection, which, despite vaccines to prevent disease, causes
thousands of hospitalizations and many deaths each year in the U.S. DHQs, exemplified by the
Roche compound, RG7834, have been shown to be effective antivirals for hepatitis B virus (HBV)
and have been under development for HBV by a number of small and major pharmaceutical
companies. We are pioneering development of DHQs for treatment and prevention of hepatitis
A. We have shown DHQs are highly active against HAV in cell culture and in mice. DHQs inhibit
the nucleotidyltransferases TENT4A/B, also called PAPD7/5, which play a role in cellular mRNA
“quality control” and noncoding transcript metabolism and are necessary for efficient HBV and
HAV RNA functions. However, their mechanism of action against HBV and HAV are distinct: while
DHQs promote degradation of HBV mRNAs, they do not affect HAV RNA stability. Instead DHQs
suppress HAV RNA synthesis. The selective sensitivity of viral over host transcripts to DHQs
offered a new strategy of antiviral therapy with low risk for resistance. However, DHQ
development has been slowed and even suspended because of neurotoxicity concerns in long-
term animal studies. We therefore produced a family of hepatoselective HS-DHQs that use
receptors enriched on hepatocytes to achieve a liver-selective distribution. Our lead HS-DHQs 2
and 3 have been shown to have nano-molar activities against HAV in cell culture and they target
hepatocytes in culture and are enriched in the liver in mice. We have now synthesized a family of
HS-DHQs to optimize their PK profiles. Our mouse studies suggest effective therapy for hepatitis
A will require only brief antiviral therapy, and we propose that our HS-DHQs with less plasma and
other tissue exposure will carry a low risk of neurotoxicity when used in this context. In this STTR
Phase I application, we will perform lead optimization to advance HS-DHQs based not only on
anti-HAV efficacy in tissue culture and PK study results, but also a neurotoxicity screen using an
in vitro assay with primary rat neurons and in vivo distribution to neuronal tissues. The best HS-
DHQs will be further studied for their efficacy in treating and preventing HAV infection in mice.
HS-DHQs with the best antiviral, PK, and PD performance in murine models of HAV will then be
advanced through preclinical studies in Phase II necessary to support a human clinical study."
10899721,"Project Summary
Over the past ten years, we have established a training program focused on regenerative medicine as it relates
to musculoskeletal disease. Projects undertaken by trainees have addressed mechanisms underlying
musculoskeletal cell commitment and differentiation in development and disease, reconstitution of injured or
missing musculoskeletal tissues with cells, scaffolds and bioactive molecules, use of bioinformatics to address
musculoskeletal diseases and treatment, and strategies to combat implant infections. One of the most unique
attributes of our program is the development of a training experience for orthopaedic surgery residents that
enables them to complete a laboratory-based research project connected to a clinical/ translational extension
of the project within the confines of the residency program. This led to the development of another unique
aspect of our program, a mentoring team for both MD and PhD trainees comprised of an extramurally-funded
basic or translational scientist, a funded clinician scientist and a practicing academic surgeon mentor.
These new components have been highly successful, leading to substantially increased interest among faculty
and trainees and increased interaction between MD and PhD trainees. We propose to expand from four trainee
positions to five owing to a tripling in the number of qualified applicants applying to the program in the last
three solicitations. The Chair of the UCLA Department of Orthopaedic Surgery has pledged funds to cover
operational costs of this expansion and to enrich the overall training experience. Grounded in a pilot study
performed in the current funding period, we propose to improve our evaluation of trainees and mentors by
using quantifiable metrics around standardized survey-based instruments that track the longitudinal progress of
training team members. Based on input from advisory boards and trainees, we diversified our training faculty to
include expertise in health services/outcomes and engineering. Finally, with an eye on succession planning,
we added a third MPI Nicholas Bernthal, MD, a young faculty member who has succeeded in establishing an
extramurally-funded bench research program while maintaining a clinical practice.
Our translational research structure is supported by a robust collection of didactic curricula and seminar series
designed to introduce and refine the skills needed by postdoctoral trainees to understand, design, compose,
undertake and earn extramural financial support for a research project in regenerative medicine. Increased
focus will be placed on exposure of PhD trainees to highly relevant clinical challenges and exposure of
surgeon scientists to basic research in the field of regenerative orthopaedic medicine. The T32 research and
didactic training program is designed to provide individual trainees with 2-3 years of funding in preparation for
their transition into more specialized training and to serve as a source of mentoring support that extends
beyond their term of appointment to the T32."
10902088,"Project Summary
 At the heart of angiogenesis and biomaterial vascularization lies the inflammatory response, orchestrated
primarily by macrophages, which dramatically shift phenotype over time in response to microenvironmental cues.
In the normal response to injury, macrophages are initially pro-inflammatory (aka M1), and at later stages they
are replaced by a mixed population referred to collectively as M2 that upregulate factors associated with
resolution of the wound healing process. The extent of the diversity of this M2 population in particular is not
known. At later stages of angiogenesis and biomaterial vascularization, M2 macrophages are generated 1) via
transition from M1 macrophages, or 2) from direct differentiation of newly arriving monocytes. The differences
between the M2 macrophages arising from each population have not been investigated. Preliminary data
suggest that M1-derived M2 macrophages possess enhanced angiogenic functionality, and that biomaterials
that transiently stimulate the initial M1 phase may enhance the subsequent response to M2-promoting
biomaterials to achieve enhanced vascularization and healing. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that
biomaterials that promote sequential M1 and M2 activation of the same population of macrophages will enhance
vascularization. To test this hypothesis, this work has the following goals: 1) Determine the effects of M1 pre-
polarization on the functional phenotype of M2 macrophages in crosstalk with blood vessels in vitro, using
primary human macrophages, gene and protein expression profiling, and tissue-engineered models of
angiogenesis. 2) Determine the effects of pro-inflammatory pre-treatment on the regenerative effects of IL4-
releasing biomaterials in vivo, using biomaterials that temporally control the phenotype of host macrophages in
a murine hindlimb ischemia model. 3) Determine the angiogenic effects in vivo of a biomaterial-mediated
macrophage cell therapy strategy that intracellularly directs a single population of macrophages from M1 to M2.
This latter strategy may result in particularly beneficial biomaterials for patients who suffer from impaired
leukocyte trafficking, including patients with diabetes, autoimmune disease, or those undergoing
chemotherapeutic treatment for cancer. This work will advance our understanding of how biomaterials can be
designed to leverage both the inflammatory and regenerative functions of macrophages to enhance
angiogenesis, which will allow us to develop new strategies to treat numerous diseases characterized by
pathological angiogenesis, including heart and brain ischemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, among many
others. In addition, this project proposes a novel approach to direct tissue revascularization by controlling the
actions of both recruited and exogenously administered macrophages using biomaterials."
10892237,"Project Summary
The pathways that regulate processes necessary for wound healing, such as proliferation and migration, are
often co-opted by tumors, leading to their description as wounds that do not heal. Therefore, identifying novel
genes involved in wound healing and understanding how they are dysregulated in cancer may provide new
targets for therapeutic efforts. We recently discovered thousands of small open reading frames that encode
proteins <100 amino acids, dubbed microproteins. Among these was a 10 kDa microprotein encoded on the
lncRNA Terminal Differentiation-Induced non-coding RNA (TINCR), which is a critical inducer of terminal
differentiation in the epidermis and regulator of cancer cell proliferation and migration. TINCR microprotein
(TINCR-MP) is highly conserved across mammals, strongly suggesting that it is functional. Compelling
preliminary data demonstrate that in human skin models TINCR-MP downregulates signaling pathways involved
in wound healing, and that it interacts with histone modifying enzymes that have functions in differentiation and
cancer. Furthermore, while TINCR-MP is expressed during epidermal differentiation, it is unnecessary for
differentiation, making its function separate from the differentiation promoting activity of TINCR RNA. The central
hypothesis is that TINCR-MP acts as a brake for proliferation and migration during wound healing through
alterations to the epigenetic landscape, and that this function is hijacked in cancer cells to promote tumor
progression. The goals of this proposal are thus: 1) to determine the role of TINCR-MP in cutaneous wound
repair processes, and establish whether TINCR-MP effects on wound healing are driven by epigenetic
modifications, 2) to determine the extent to which TINCR-MP regulates proliferation and migration in prostate
and breast cancer cell lines, and establish its effects on epigenetic and subsequent gene expression changes,
and 3) to identify additional microproteins regulated during differentiation that affect cancer proliferation.
Successful completion of these aims will reveal an important microprotein that functions in wound healing and
tumor progression, as well as new microproteins to investigate. The candidate, Dr. Thomas Martinez, plans to
develop an independent research program focused on characterizing microproteins that function in both
differentiation and cancer. The opportunities offered by this Career Development Award will allow Dr. Martinez
to deepen his knowledge of developmental biology, epigenetics, and cancer biology. He will also gain experience
utilizing 3D ex vivo skin models, in vivo mouse models, and techniques for analyzing the epigenetic landscape.
Dr. Martinez will conduct these studies under the mentorship of Dr. Alan Saghatelian, expert on peptide biology,
as well as co-mentors Dr. Diana Hargreaves and Dr. George Sen, experts on chromatin remodeling complexes
in disease and epidermal homeostasis, respectively. Dr. Martinez’s Advisory Committee will also help foster his
scientific and academic career goals. The Salk Institute provides an ideal environment with expertly run core
facilities and ample seminars and workshops to prepare trainees for independent academic careers."
10888899,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Here we develop a platform for protease-activated peptide prodrugs. We initially focus the effort on
antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which have a broad spectrum of cell-penetrating, antimicrobial and cytotoxic
activities. However, they have multiple limitations, including off-target cytotoxicity and proteolytic instability. To
circumvent these unwanted effects, linear protease-activated prodrugs have been employed. Although effective
at enhancing the activity of the active payload, it does not adequately address the side effects stated above. To
mitigate the side effects of the traditional protease-activated prodrug approach, the proposed research strategy
herein seeks to design a branched protease-activated prodrug by coupling a cleavable linker to the sidechains
of amino acid residue that significantly impacts antimicrobial peptide activity. As a proof-of-concept, bombolitin
(an AMP that is cytotoxic to mammalian cells) will be used as the payload, masked with caspase-3 and fibroblast
activation protein (cancer biomarkers) substrate-specific linkers. By modifying the sidechains of Lys, Ser, Thr,
and Tyr with these linkers, we hypothesize that the physicochemical properties of bombolitin will be significantly
altered, thus reducing peptide-membrane interaction until activation. In this research, we propose to 1) design
and synthesize single and double-branched protease-activated prodrugs cleaved in the presence of either
caspase-3 and/or fibroblast activation protein to yield the active peptide, 2) confirm caspase-3 and fibroblast
activation protein cleavage of linker from prodrugs by performing in vitro enzymatic assays and biophysical
analysis, and 3) perform cell-based assays to validate prodrug cleavage, target specificity, activity enhancement,
and reduction of off-target effects."
10909937,"Project Summary
Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 687,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2015
and that the HAI prevalence on a given day was one in 30 patients. An estimated 72,000 patients died with
HAIs during their hospitalization. In addition, outbreaks in hospitals remain a serious problem but the vast
majority of hospitals use antiquated and ineffective methods to detect them. We established the Enhanced
Detection System for Healthcare Acquired Transmission (EDS-HAT) (R01AI127472), which combines bacterial
whole genome sequencing (WGS) surveillance (as opposed to reactive WGS) to detect outbreaks with data
mining (DM) of the electronic health record (EHR) and machine learning (ML) to identify the responsible
transmission routes. We have demonstrated that EDS-HAT detects both serious outbreaks that were otherwise
unrecognized and novel transmission routes. Despite this success, additional research is needed to improve
upon EDS-HAT and further increase capacity to detect and interrupt hospital outbreaks. For example, hospital
outbreaks of respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are well documented, but this area of
infection prevention is understudied. The addition of respiratory virus surveillance to EDS-HAT would improve
detection and prevention of these costly HAIs. In addition, readily-available clinical microbiology data can be
incorporated into EDS-HAT algorithms to reduce reliance on WGS surveillance. Finally, WGS surveillance
analysis based entirely on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can falsely cluster patients.
Therefore, research to investigate the contribution(s) of the accessory genome is necessary to improve
discriminatory power of EDS-HAT. In this R01 renewal application, we propose to leverage the success of
EDS-HAT by developing additional innovative methods for identification and interruption of hospital-associated
transmission. In aim 1, we plan to use WGS surveillance and EHR DM/ML to study hospital transmission of
respiratory viruses from retrospective (aim 1a) and prospective collections (aim 1b) of respiratory virus positive
specimens at two large academic hospitals (EDS-HAT RV), one for adults and the other pediatric. In aim 2, we
will develop advanced analytic methods to create a version of EDS-HAT that relies primarily on DM/ML of the
EHR (EDS-HAT Lite) (aim 2a) and improve the discriminatory power of WGS to correctly classify patients who
are part of an outbreak (aim 2b). EDS-HAT RV and EDS-HAT Lite will undergo clinical and budget impact
analyses to determine the number of cases prevented and healthcare costs averted. These aims will be
accomplished by a team with expertise in infectious diseases epidemiology, outbreak investigation, infection
prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, and economic
analysis and modeling. Our proposed research will lead to improved patient safety and can serve as a model
for how outbreaks are detected and interrupted in hospitals."
10903916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Annually 4.3 million premature deaths are attributable to household air population (HAP) from solid fuels used
for cooking. In Nigeria, 90 million households cook with solid fuels. The use of clean (i.e. high-efficiency and low
emission) cookstoves can reduce HAP and improve health outcomes. In our RCT of 271 women in Nigeria, use
of “clean fuel-clean-stove” (CF-CS) vs. kerosene-based stoves led to significant blood pressure (BP) reduction
and an 80% adoption rate. However, its widespread adoption is sub-optimal in Africa because these countries
often lack expertise needed to coordinate system changes to implement evidence-based practices without
assistance. Community mobilization (CM) strategy may overcome this barrier because it builds community
readiness and support for normative changes. Thus, CM may enhance the demand for CF-CS use by modifying
community barriers to its adoption. In collaboration with the Lagos State ministry of health (MoH), we will develop
a context-specific CM strategy, and evaluate its effects on adoption and sustainability of affordable bioethanol-
based CF-CS use in Lagos, Nigeria. The CM strategy includes: (1) Community advisory board (of local
organizations, government officials, and residents), that will provide leadership support and buy-in for adoption
of CF-CS use; (2) Trained community health extension workers [from the MoH], who will facilitate proper
household use of CF-CS through community action teams (CATs); and (3) Community dialogues that are
focused on shared concerns regarding CF-CS use in households. Using a focused) implementation research
framework, the EPIS (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment) model, in a type-2 hybrid
design, we will conduct this study in 3 phases: 1) A pre-implementation phase that will explore barriers and
facilitators of CF-CS use, and develop a CM strategy for CF-CS use; 2) An Implementation phase to compare in
a cluster RCT the effect of CM vs. a self-directed condition (i.e. receipt of information on CF-CS without CM) on
adoption of CF-CS use; and systolic BP reduction; 3) A post-implementation phase that will compare the effect
of CM strategy vs. self-directed condition on sustainability of the CF-CS use in periurban communities in Lagos.
AIM 1: To conduct a needs assessment on community readiness for the adoption of CF-CS use in periurban
communities in Lagos; develop and pilot test a culturally-tailored CM strategy. AIM 2 will compare in a cluster
RCT of 32 periurban communities, the effect of CM vs. self-directed condition on adoption of CF-CS use in 640
households; AIM 3 will compare the effect of CM vs. self-directed condition on systolic BP reduction; and AIM 4
will evaluate the sustainability of CF-CS use one year after completion of the trial. The primary outcome is
adoption of CF-CS use defined as utilization of CF-CS for more than 50% of cooking activities in the household,
measured with iButtons stove usage monitors. The secondary outcomes are mean change in systolic BP from
baseline to 12 months; and sustainability of CF-CS use [maintenance of adoption at 24 months], one year after
the trial."
10948888,"Project summary - Connecting structure and fitness landscapes to overcome antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance is a pressing, multifaceted challenge. Pathogen evolution is outstripping the supply of new
compounds and analogues, threatening a global health crisis. New approaches to understand adaptation are
clearly necessary, but this is a difficult problem. The mechanisms of resistance are often unknown, as well as
the overall combination of changes that produce overall microbial fitness changes. Technical developments in
high-throughput biochemistry have allowed massive variant libraries to be assayed, which opens the door to
constructing predictive models of resistance, but these have until our recent work ignored complex mutations,
specifically insertions and deletions, which play a massive role by producing major changes to underlying
fitness landscapes with small mutations. To study how, we will combine experimental evolution, deep
mutational scanning, and multitemperature crystallography to produce an integrated model for how insertions
and deletions permit rapid changes to protein function.
We will use the Streptogramin A family as our model antibiotic. These are ribosome-targeting compounds
produced by Streptomyces. Resistance occurs through Vat proteins, which specifically inactivate
Streptogramin A (SA) via acetylation. A collaboration with the Seiple lab at UCSF has led to a modular
synthesis of SA that allows variants to be simply produced, as well as several novel compounds with
demonstrated reduced acetylation in vitro. We will determine how adaptation to these novel compounds
proceeds, and how indels within a key variable substrate-binding loop modulate it.
In my first aim, I will use experimental evolution to uncover how Vat proteins adapt to streptogramins, and how
the addition of insertions and deletions within this loop change the adaptive potential. In my second aim, I will
conduct high-throughput stability measurements to determine the mechanistic basis for resistance changes,
and then use deep mutational scanning to measure the mutational accessibility and biophysical basis for an
evolved adaptive trajectory. In my third aim, I will use cryo- and multitemperature crystallography to determine
the static and dynamic basis for indel-potentiated changes to substrate specificity towards new SAs.
The completion of these aims will produce an integrated picture of microbial adaptation and essential new
insight into how complex but understudied mutations radically shift the adaptive potential of genes. The cross-
disciplinary nature of the project will expose me to a number of techniques and approaches that will provide me
with excellent training opportunities under the mentorship of field-defining experts. The new frameworks and
techniques I will develop will help establish my scientific maturity as I pursue my goal of an independent
research position studying the mechanistic basis of molecular protein evolution at a university."
10699041,"Opera Bioscience proposes to develop a platform based on the type III secretion system of Salmonella enterica
typhimurium, which transports proteins from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space in a single step, to produce
cost effective growth factors and recombinant proteins for therapeutic use. Recombinant proteins underlie all
facets of biomedical research and therapeutic development. Advancements in genomics, bioinformatics, and
tools for genetic manipulation have led to an exponential growth in demand for recombinant proteins to study
disease phenotypes, develop therapeutic candidates, and support cell culture for live cellular therapies. Growth
factors are in demand for the latter application, especially because of the recent promise of therapies such as
CAR-T cells. Many growth factors are expensive to produce with current technologies, leading to increased
manufacturing costs for treatments. A novel protein expression system that lowers costs and simplifies the
production process would decrease the cost of therapeutic development and manufacturing and expand access
to these life-saving products. Bacterial expression systems are preferred for their low cost, high yield, and genetic
tractability, but traditional expression strategies require cell lysis and expensive downstream purification
processes to recover the product. Non-native proteins often accumulate in insoluble aggregates, which increases
cost and complexity by requiring extensive process optimization to recover a soluble and active product. Bacterial
protein secretion combines the advantages of traditional bacterial protein expression with the significant benefit
of recovering the product from the cell culture medium without cell lysis. This improvement creates high purity
proteins that significantly reduces downstream recovery costs and complexity. Secretion also improves product
yield by enabling continuous manufacturing technology, which is not currently used in bacterial expression
systems. Opera’s platform produces titers on the order of hundreds of milligrams per liter and generate soluble,
active enzymes, antibody fragments, and antimicrobial peptides. In this Phase I proposal, Opera outlines an
approach to adapt its platform for commercial use. In Aim 1, Opera describes a strategy to create an optimized,
safe production strain by removing unnecessary and pathogenic elements to increase safety and initial protein
purity and improve strain performance in suspension culture. In Aim 2, Opera Bioscience will unravel the T3SS
response to environmental stimuli by defining an optimal growth environment (dissolved oxygen and shear
stress, growth medium composition, and temperature) that maximizes secreted protein titer and yields operating
parameters Opera can use to scale the technology. The successful outcome of this proposal will be a
streamlined, optimized strain with a process environment that promotes secreted titers of growth factors that
match or exceed published values for bacterial expression. The proof-of-concept provided by this Phase I work
will create a path for regulatory approval and expand Opera’s optimization efforts to larger-scale bioreactors,
fed-batch and continuous fermentation, and a broader selection of recombinant growth factors in Phase II."
11177990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 10% of new cancer diagnoses in the United States are hematological malignancies that include
a spectrum of blood cancers and related disorders. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myeloid
neoplasms, somatic hotspot mutations frequently occur in five RNA splicing factors (SFs): SF3B1, SRSF2,
U2AF1, ZRSR2, and genes encoding the U1 snRNA. These mutations drive aberrant splicing of mRNAs to
promote leukemogenesis. Recently, a novel class of RNAs called circular RNA (circRNA) was found to be
aberrantly expressed in many types of liquid tumors. Unlike mRNAs that form through normal splicing to produce
linear RNAs, circRNAs are produced through backsplicing that results in RNA circularization. Because of
advances to detection and annotation methods, circRNAs are now known to possess functional and clinical
significances, suggesting a novel role in cancer biology. However, to date, their precise role in hematological
malignancies, namely leukemia, remains undefined. The long-term goal is to investigate the functions and
therapeutic potentials of circRNAs. Moreover, the role of SF mutations (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and
genes encoding the U1 snRNA) in the aberrant expression of circRNAs remains unknown. Thus, the overall
objective is to link SF mutations to aberrant circRNA expressions. To this end, I hypothesize that mutations in
SF3B1 and other SFs such as SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and genes encoding the U1 snRNA upregulate circRNA
abundance to promote leukemogenesis. The rationale for this research is that linking SF mutations to aberrant
expressions of circRNAs would define a novel regulatory axis, unlocking new therapeutic opportunities for
treating leukemia. Preliminary data from CLL patient B cells and cell lines showed that mutant SF3B1 promoted
aberrant expression of circRNAs in biological important molecular pathways such as protein transport and cell
cycle regulation. To identify circRNAs critical for cell survival, I have validated the emergent CRISPR CasRX
technology as a tool for screening circRNAs. I have also prototyped an experimental workflow for validating the
functions of these circRNAs. Additionally, to further determine the role of SF mutations on circRNA biogenesis,
cell lines with somatic mutations for SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and genes encoding the U1 snRNA have
been established. Finally, I have engineered cell-based and minigene-based reporter systems to investigate the
mechanisms of backsplicing. Using this collection of tools, I propose the following aims: to identify and validate
the functional impact of SF mutation-associated circRNA in leukemia (Aim 1) and to determine the
mechanism of backsplicing (Aim 2). I expect the findings from this proposal will define a novel regulatory axis
linking SF mutations and circRNAs aberrant expressions to leukemogenesis."

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting as many as 50 million people
worldwide with more than 80% of them living in developing countries. Despite the fact that ~70% of people
with epilepsy (PWE) respond to medication therapy, epilepsy remains untreated in up to 9 in 10 patients in
Africa, leading to brain damage and associated sequelae. In addition, epilepsy bears a heavy psychosocial
burden due to its stigma, preventing many PWE from seeking care and leading to significant personal,
social, and economic harm. Interestingly, genetic causes of epilepsy are being increasingly recognized,
driven by the boom in next generation DNA sequencing (NGS). However, the vast majority of genetic
research has ignored populations in sub-Saharan Africa. In this project, we propose a multi-pronged
approach to tackling epilepsy in Mali. 1) Educate front-line healthcare providers to recognize and treat
epilepsy in an effort to decrease the massive treatment gap in Mali. 2) Carefully phenotype PWE in order
understand the landscape of epilepsy in Mali. 3) Engage PWE to understand the burden of the disease
through the use of quantitative and qualitative tools. 4) Obtain DNA samples from PWE with specific
phenotypes for NGS, and analyze the data to identify candidate causative genes. 5) Test these genes in a
vertebrate model system, Xenopus tropicalis. In addition, this project has a key component for 6) Malian
students to visit Yale University and train in NGS analysis/bioinformatics and X. tropicalis experiments.
Finally, 7) a team from Yale will make scheduled site visits to Mali to lend their expertise to expand local
bioinformatic capacity and to establish a X. tropicalis facility for vertebrate experiments. This broad
approach, with clinical, epidemiologic, genetic, and basic science aspects, will serve the single goal of
better understanding epilepsy in Mali in order to improve the care and quality of life of Malian PWE."

 The disproportionate rise in nursing home (NH) use among Black and Latino persons living with dementia
(PLWD) reflects the inadequacy of existing programs and policies to support aging in place for the most
vulnerable. Enabling aging in the community and preventing avoidable NH placements is widely considered a
priority by federal, state, and local entities along with families and older adults. Yet, it is unclear what is needed
to support Black and Latino PLWD to remain in the community. While there are many plausible next steps to
addressing this poorly understood problem, developing an instrument to identify which unmet needs are
disproportionately driving avoidable NH placements is an important actionable step in reducing disparities among
Black and Latino PLWD. The objectives of this 5-year proposed project are to 1) develop and test the feasibility,
acceptability, reliability, and validity of an assessment instrument aimed at addressing the unmet needs that
drive Black and Latino PLWD to experience avoidable NH placements at greater rates than their White
counterparts using an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design, and 2) translate preliminary
findings onto the public agenda as a policy issue. Aim 1 will use qualitative interviews to describe the unmet
needs driving these placements. An integrative analysis of qualitative findings derived from Aim 1 will inform an
unmet needs assessment instrument, IN-HOME (Identifying Needs to Help Older adults Maintain Everyday
community living), that will be developed, refined and piloted in Aim 2 and psychometrically tested in Aim 3.
Preliminary findings from this study will be used to generate actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations
to address disparities in NH placements. Aligned with NIA’s strategic priorities to address disparities experienced
by minority older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease or Related Dementias (ADRD), this study will form the basis
for a subsequent R01 that will tailor IN-HOME for community-dwelling Black and Latino PLWD and investigate
which actionable unmet needs place them at greatest risk for NH placements.
 The candidate, Dr. Jasmine Travers, PhD, MHS, is a gerontological nurse practitioner and assistant
professor at New York University (NYU) Rory Meyers College of Nursing. The long-term goal of Dr. Travers is
to build an independent research career focused on developing innovative approaches to eliminate disparities
in access to and quality of person-centered long term care experienced by Black and Latino PLWD through the
use of mixed methods. Under a team of exemplary mentors and scientific advisors with expertise in gerontology,
ADRD, mixed-methods, policy, survey design, and psychometric evaluation, Dr. Travers will build on her
preliminary work on disparities in access to community long-term care to accomplish training goals in primary
research involving vulnerable PLWD, mixed methods, policy, and leadership development. NYU provides an
exceptional environment for the completion of the proposed research and for Dr. Travers who has already begun
to emerge as a leading disparities researcher in the field of aging and long-term care."

Project Summary
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is the chronic use of opioids that causes clinically significant distress or impairment.
Most hospitalized patients admitted to the trauma unit or intensive care unit (ICU) receive opioids, commonly as
part of analgesia and sedation regimens. Repeated opioid exposure produces behavioral sensitization that
contributes to drug craving, opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), and withdrawal symptoms. Opioid dependence
can be expected in hospitalized patients who have received lengthy opioid dose regimens, and patients are at
significant risk of continuing opioid use following discharge. Inpatient stays are often extended to taper dosages
and wean patients off opioids, yet these patients remain at increased risk of opioid dependence, withdrawal, and
OUD. This cycle of opioid treatment, opioid dependence, opioid tapering, and potential for developing OUD upon
discharge represents an urgent unmet medical need that contributes to the opioid pandemic. A small molecule
therapeutic that prevents opioid dependence would reduce the length of hospital stays, improve patient
outcomes, reduce the risk of OUD, and significantly reduce the cost of care. Vivreon Biosciences intends to
address this unmet need by developing a non-opioid new chemical entity (NCE) for prevention of opioid
dependence to combat OUD.
Tissue damaging microgliosis, the shift of quiescent CNS microglia towards inflammatory behaviors in response
to specific signals such as opioid receptor (OR) activation, is documented to be associated with OUD.
Therapeutic prevention of inflammatory microgliosis is an innovative approach to preventing the development of
opioid dependence. Central nervous system microglial cells are activated by ORs and support inflammatory
microglial polarization. We have demonstrated that our candidate therapeutic blunts multiple dimensions of
morphine-induced behavioral adaptations. In this Fast Track SBIR project Vivreon will build a full preclinical
development program around our Lead VV molecule to treat OUD. In Phase I we will develop dose-response
metrics in a mouse model of opioid dependence with multiple readouts and dose-range finding studies to
establish therapeutic window indices for two therapeutic compounds. This will allow selection of the most
promising Lead compound for further development. Successful Lead selection will justify entering full
development studies in Phase II. These studies will encompass standard small molecule Investigational New
Drug (IND) efforts including ADME/PK, toxicology and manufacturing studies to de-risk the Lead. Successful
conclusion of the project will yield an attractive package that is enticing to third party investors able to provide
the financial support required for advancement of the Lead into clinical validation."
10912698,"Robust evidence demonstrates that early integration of palliative care in patients with metastatic cancer improves
outcomes throughout the disease course by reducing symptom burden and increasing health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with care. Early palliative care also increases hospice enrollment and reduces
aggressive treatments and admissions to the ED and ICU at the end of life. Early integration of palliative care
concurrently with disease-modifying treatments in patients with metastatic cancer is now recommended by the
American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network. However, most
patients still only receive palliative care late in the disease continuum, at or near end of life, and significant
disparities persist in access to palliative care. Hispanic/Latino patients with metastatic cancer are less likely to
receive palliative care and have worse HRQoL and symptom burden than non-Hispanic/Latino White patients.
Hispanics/Latinos also are more likely to experience significant challenges to patient activation, including low
health literacy, language barriers, and structural and perceived discrimination. Little is known about how to
effectively activate patients and families so that they are empowered participants in conversations about
palliative care and no previous study has developed a patient activation intervention for Hispanics/Latinos with
metastatic cancer. The overarching goal of this proposal is to: a) identify barriers and facilitators to patient
activation in Hispanic/Latino patients with metastatic cancer, and; b) develop an individualized, culturally-adapted
intervention that increases patient activation and facilitates early integration of palliative care. We will use an
innovative approach that embeds our intervention within the healthcare system and incorporates EHR-integrated
systematic symptom monitoring. This approach allows us to tailor our patient activation intervention based on
patients’ symptom profile and to help patients and providers center discussions of palliative care on patients’
unique care needs. In order to increase patients’ preparedness and engagement in conversations about palliative
care, we will use a web-based platform to deliver a psychoeducational resource that provides accessible, easy-
to-understand information about palliative care (individualized based on symptom profile) and patient activation
tips. The aims of this mixed-methods study are: Aim 1) identify barriers and facilitators to patient activation and
early integration of palliative care through patient and provider focus groups (N=20 each); Aim 2) create an
individualized, culturally-adapted patient activation intervention and conduct patient usability testing (N=10); and
Aim 3) evaluate the effect of our intervention on proximal outcomes in the early phases of palliative care
introduction and referral, including HRQoL, patient-provider communication, shared decision-making, and
beliefs/attitudes regarding palliative care (N=50). The impact of this study will be to empower Hispanic/Latino
patients in conversations about palliative care and to develop a novel patient activation intervention that can be
tested in a future, full-scale randomized controlled trial."

 Our overall aim is to define the mechanisms underlying the circadian regulation of acute lung injury
and subsequent recovery. Our published work shows that circadian rhythms confer a time of day specific
protection from Influenza A Virus (IAV) infection. Mice infected at dawn had 3-fold better survival than those
infected at dusk. While, we cannot clinically control the time of exposure to IAV, these data suggest that
altering the circadian health of the host could affect outcomes. In fact, disrupting circadian rhythms genetically
in mice, by deleting the core clock gene, Bmal1, worsened mortality from IAV. Further proof of the translational
relevance of our mechanistic work came from our analyses of the UK biobank which revealed that disrupted
circadian rhythms was an independent risk factor for Influenza related hospitalization. Severe influenza
infection is characterized by extensive immunopathology and dysplastic lung repair and regeneration, often
independent of viral burden. Both vaccines and anti-viral agents have limited efficacy. The current proposal
addresses this need in the field by exploring a novel target—circadian rhythms as determinant of outcomes in
IAV. Since the last submission, we have generated exciting preliminary data that shows that disruption of the
AT2 clock is associated with (a) worse acute mortality, immunopathology and necroptosis and (b)
delayed recovery in vivo and poor regeneration on organoid assays. Our overall goals are to:
 (1) Test the hypothesis that the disruption of the AT2 clock leads to a pro-inflammatory state at
baseline that is further exacerbated by IAV infection, thereby worsening necroptosis.
 (2) To test the hypothesis that the circadian clock contributes to lung regeneration through Wnt-
responsive regulation of the cell cycle via the Axin2+ epithelial niche.
 Our approach employs tissue specific circadian knock-out models induced in adulthood, circadian sampling
throughout 24hrs, other genetic/environmental models of circadian disruption and tools form lung regenerative
biology, customized to the circadian context. I have also gathered an outstanding team of collaborators and
consultants with expertise in cell death, circadian bioinformatics, lung regeneration and virology. Elucidating
these mechanisms is the critical next step towards modulating the host circadian rhythms for therapeutic
purposes. While, we use influenza as our model, the principles uncovered thus, should be generalizable to
other viral conditions of the lung."
10905016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
African Americans (AA) have a higher incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) compared to European Americans
(EA) due to genetic predisposition, environmental exposure or both. MM is preceded by two precursor phases,
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM) that are also
increased in AA. We have shown using European MM samples that there is a long lag period between the
genetic initiation of the disease and the time at which precursor clinical stages are detectable. It is critical to
understand the genetic basis of these early evolutionary steps if we are to truly understand the excess risk of
MM in AA. During the evolutionary progression of MM after genetic initiation, genetic hits are accumulated
providing a unique archeological fingerprint of the mutational signatures or “mutographs” over time. Using
whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyzed with advanced computer algorithms based on a-priori knowledge
of the timing of acquired genetic variants we have been able to extract mutographs active at different time
points. This analysis has shown in EA that MM is shaped by mutational processes variably active during the
early, intermediate and late evolutionary phases of disease. A key finding of our pilot data is the identification
of a mutograph occurring as a consequence of the immune response in the germinal center reaction and this
differs by race. We will address the hypothesis that a major contributor to the observed excess of MM in AA
compared to EA is due to an excess immune response that can be recognized by a GC mutograph that is
active in the early evolutionary phases of disease. To accurately extract early mutographs sequential samples
from the same individual cases are needed. SMM, which transforms to MM at a rate of 10% per annum,
provides a system where samples can be obtained at different time points in the absence of treatment. To
address our hypothesis we will generate mutographs from new WGS data from AA SMM and compare them to
existing datasets of EA with SMM as well as from a large pre-existing set of MM from which we will infer
ancestry directly. We will also establish a longitudinal cohort study of SMM cases and study mutographs over
time and compare the profiles between AA and EA. In addition to genetic mutographs we will characterize and
compare immunological mutographs of T-cell response in the bone marrow immune microenvironment
identified using a flow-cytometric approach. To provide a link to the external environment we will characterize
bacterial species signatures derived from 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut flora, and link findings to the genetic
and T-cell mutographs. This study will identify genomic, immune and environmental signatures responsible for
the higher risk of MM observed among AAs and will provide new insights into the immune response in MM
pathogenesis, opening the way for the generation of effective intervention strategies.

Cancer-related death is the second most common cause of death in the US, and the most
promising strategy to reduce cancer-related deaths and cancer incidence is through cancer
prevention. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of preventing cancer using
vaccines or cancer preventive drugs. However, the use of these agents is limited due to their
side effects. Clearly, safer and more effective cancer prevention interventions that are
acceptable to healthy individuals are urgently needed. Thus, the overarching goal of this
application is to bring a team of basic, translational, and clinical researchers together to identify
novel strategies to prevent cancer, test them in cancer prevention clinical trials, and ultimately
bring safe, efficacious, and acceptable preventive therapies to general use in individuals at high-
risk of this disease. To achieve this goal, we formed an international consortium (the iCAN-
PREVENT consortium) comprised of cancer prevention experts, clinical trialists, molecular
biologists, translational researchers, pathologists, statisticians, and bio-informatics experts, to
develop and conduct early phase cancer prevention trials. Our clinical research team has vast
experience in conducting both early and late phase clinical trials, and has conducted 18 Phase I
and II cancer prevention clinical trials through our previous chemoprevention clinical trial
consortia. Here, we propose two aims to test the hypothesis that we can conduct trials of drug
and vaccine therapies and demonstrate that these preventive therapies will safely modulate
critical tumor promoting pathways. Results from these early phase clinical trials will support the
advancement of these interventions to Phase III testing, and ultimately support the FDA-approval
of these interventions for cancer prevention. We will 1) conduct 5 to 10 early phase clinical trials
testing the safety and activity of a series of promising cancer prevention drugs, vaccines, and
immune modulating interventions in individuals at high-risk of cancer, and 2) develop and
implement novel methods to enhance recruitment and retention of patients in prevention trials
using social media, electronic news-blasts, and mobile messaging. To demonstrate our ability
to develop novel cancer prevention trials, we provide two sample trials: a Phase I trial of a novel
DNA-based vaccine encoding novel frameshift antigens that develop in individuals with Lynch
Syndrome, and a Phase II trial testing the ability of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to alter breast
tissue biomarkers in individuals with prior triple-negative breast cancer. The results of these
early phase trials will advance cancer prevention drug development, and will ultimately help
reduce cancer incidence and mortality through prevention."

Social dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia. Many individuals with schizophrenia experience social
disconnection, a lack of social contact with friends and family. Social disconnection is associated with reduced
quality of life and many negative health effects, but most current treatments do little to address it. The
development of new interventions is currently hindered by a lack of scientific understanding about how
differences in the way individuals’ brains process information contribute to social disconnection, and a lack of
biomarkers associated with social functioning. Recent research in non-clinical social neuroscience points to a
compelling model that may help to explain social disconnection in schizophrenia and would provide the basis
for a new biomarker of social dysfunction. Specifically, research using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis methods shows that people whose brains tend to respond
more normatively to dynamic, naturalistic stimuli (e.g., video clips) tend to have more social connections,
perhaps because more other people experience the world in a similar way, whereas people with less normative
responses tend to have fewer social connections. Converging evidence suggests that many individuals with
schizophrenia are likely to have less normative responses to such naturalistic stimuli, which could help to
explain why social disconnection is common in the disorder. However, the ISC method has not yet been used
to study social dysfunction in schizophrenia. This project will fill this research gap by translating ISC research
methods from non-clinical research in order to investigate how ISCs relate to social disconnection in
schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia (N=200) and matched healthy controls (N=100) will each
complete one fMRI scan during which they will view naturalistic video stimuli and complete two established
paradigms that assess important domains of social processing: social cue perception and mentalizing. We will
characterize ISCs based on responses to the naturalistic video stimuli and characterize brain activity related to
social cue perception and mentalizing using standard analyses. The study will test whether ISCs differ between
the two participant groups and evaluate to what extent group ISC differences relate to individual differences in
social connection. We will also characterize ISC normativity for each member of the schizophrenia group,
using the control group as a reference, to assess whether brain response normativity is associated with social
disconnection, and whether individuals’ degree of social disconnection can be predicted from it. The project will
also test whether an ISC-based measure is more sensitive to individual differences in social disconnection than
established fMRI measures. Results from this project will improve understanding of how brain activity relates to
social dysfunction in schizophrenia. ISC measures are also expected to constitute a biomarker of social
dysfunction that may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk of social disconnection, targeting
treatments toward individuals most likely to benefit from them, or assessing outcomes in future clinical trials."
10926884,"Project Abstract/Summary
The identification of targetable driver oncogenes, such as EGFR, has been a revolutionary
advance in the treatment of lung cancer and other malignancies. In tumors with such genetic
drivers, the vast majority of cells are dependent on specific oncogenes for survival (commonly
referred to as oncogene “addicted” or oncogene-dependent). Effective inhibitors can dramatically
improve clinical outcomes for patients but most of the times these drugs do not completely
eradicate tumors leaving residual cells that are not killed by the initial treatment. These cells,
termed drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPCs), may remain quiescent or clinically invisible for
prolonged periods of time and eventually progress to become resistant cells with enhanced
metastatic potential. My laboratory research efforts over the past decade have been focused, in
large part, on elucidating mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and
developing strategies to overcome resistance, efforts that have been translated into new drugs
and combinations into the clinic (e.g. poziotinib, Axl+EGFR inhibitors, VEGF+EGFR inhibitors,
etc). Dr. Monique Nilsson has been leading some of these studies including the identification of
stress hormones and IL-6 as drivers of EGFR TKI resistance and the characterization of the
YAP/FOXM1 axis as a critical pathway in the development of EGFR TKI resistance. She also
identified novel targets for EGFR mutant TKI resistant tumors such as aurora kinases. More
recently she was able to demonstrate pre-clinically the mechanisms underlying the VEGF
dependency of EGFR mutant lung tumors. Importantly, Dr. Nilsson’s studies led to several new
clinical trials that are currently ongoing in our institution. In order to prevent the emergence of
drug resistance of EGFR mutant tumors, Dr. Nilsson’s goal in this proposal is to identify novel
treatment strategies to eliminate DTPCs in the early stages. There is little known about the
signaling pathways and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of DTPCs and we aimed to perform a
deep analysis at the single cell level of a large collection of preclinical models that my laboratory
and Dr. Nilsson have developed during the past years. We believe that these studies will also
help to advance in the understanding of other molecularly defined oncogene-driven lung subtypes
and other solid tumors."

roadmap developed at this meeting was published in Gastroenterology (1). Specifically, this proposal is part of
a cluster of CMAs that are aimed at advancing our knowledge about the emerging role of gut microbiome for a
better understanding of the pathophysiology of Veterans service and deployment related GI and liver diseases
including the more prevalent disorders associated with the GWI and PTSD, and to develop potential
biotherapeutics to alleviate the disease symptoms. In this regard, the importance of an altered diversity of the
gut microbiome in the development and progression of gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is supported by a range of evidence including patient-based studies and mouse modelling of the
disease. The overall incidence of IBD among Veterans has increased 2-3 folds however the underlying
mechanism(s) are unclear. The Veterans’ health care system has noticed a similar rise in the cases of the PTSD
and GWI. An association of the altered gut microbiota has also been reported in the Veterans suffering from
PTSD and GWI. However, there are no systematic studies focusing on the role of the gut microbiome in service
and deployment-related increases in IBD risk in the Veterans. Our hypothesis in this CMA is that, in Veterans,
PTSD-associated gut microbiota synergizes with gut barrier dysfunctions to promote risk for IBD and/or disease
severity. A collaborative approach using the gut microbiome from Veterans with PTSD, metagenomics, and
state-of-the-art mouse models and technologies will be employed to test this hypothesis in following proposed
studies: Aim-1. To examine whether PTSD-associated Gut dysbiosis in a humanized mouse model promotes
susceptibility to colitis and/or disease severity; Aim-2. To investigate if mouse models mimicking barrier protein
defects, as seen in preliminary data, are at higher risk of developing PTSD & associated risk of colitis, and possible
mechanisms; and Aim-3. To determine the causal link between PTSD-associated gut microbiota and mucosal
injury/repair in specific contexts of epithelial intrinsic and in vivo settings of colitis. Specific role of gut barrier
proteins will be examined in ‘pore’ and ‘leak’ pathways and colitis associated injury/repair. The outcome from
proposed studies should help establish the causal relationship between PTSD-associated microbiome and an
increased risk for IBD in Veterans and thus may aid in development of novel strategies in mitigating such risk."

disease in the United States. Control of hypertension is critical to improving the length and quality of life in the
United States and for addressing racial disparities in cardiovascular disease. Yet, national progress in
controlling hypertension has stalled. The current model for hypertension care in the United States, which relies
nearly exclusively on clinician-driven office visits, has proven inadequate. There is an urgent need for team-
based, patient-centered models of care. Team-based home blood pressure monitoring (TB-HBPM)
represents an evidence-based practice that is widely underused in primary care. Strategies are needed
to promote its adoption in primary care. Based on published barriers to adoption of TB-HBPM, successful
strategies must engage patients and clinicians in the implementation process, and provide patients and their
care teams with the knowledge, skills, resources, and data needed to implement and sustain TB-HBPM.
Notably, strategies must address financial sustainability. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify
and rigorously evaluate translatable strategies for implementing and sustaining TB-HBPM within
primary care. To accomplish this aim, we will recruit seven practices from a single site where hypertension
control is suboptimal. These practices serve predominately low-income and minority patients. In phase1 (R61),
we will convene a steering committee that includes patients, practice staff, and clinicians to guide planning,
implementation, sustainability, and evaluation (Aim 1). During phase 1, we will assess the specific barriers and
facilitators to implementing TB-HPBM within these practices. Based on these practice-specific barriers, we will
operationalize strategies using the Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability Model (PRISM). In
phase 2 (R33), we will deploy these implementation strategies using a hybrid type-2, stepped wedge cluster
randomized trial (Aim 2). Implementation strategies will include patient and team training, actionable data
provided to the teams, and adoption of new billing codes. We will assess the impact of implementation
strategies using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework (Aim 3). Our primary
outcomes will be HTN control and patient use of HBPM. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of
patients with uncontrolled BP who are seen within 60 days, establishment of team charters by teams
(adoption), and financial sustainability based on a cost analyses (maintenance). We will use realist evaluation
to test theoretical assumptions underlying the implementation strategies (Aim 4). This mixed-methods
approach will allow us to develop transferable lessons for other settings. Our findings will advance the science

Delayed gastric emptying is a common and serious complication among patients with long standing and poorly
controlled diabetes. Current prokinetic therapies are limited and elicit serious side effects. An improved
understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis is critical to the development of new
approaches in the treatment of this difficult disorder. Gastric emptying is a complex process that is tightly
coordinated. Fundic accommodation, peristaltic and tonic antral contractions, and antral-pyloric coordination all
play important roles in regulating gastric emptying. Because of technical limitations, we still do not know to
what extent gastric emptying is produced by each of these gastric motor components. To address these
deficiencies, we developed a robust strategy to image and characterize gastric motility and emptying in rats
and humans based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-assisted image
processing. This novel technology not only shows gastric anatomy, but also captures and quantifies stomach
emptying, intestinal filling, antral contractions and pylorus opening with fully automated image processing.
Based on our pilot investigations and studies derived from computational modeling and simulations of gastric
flow, we hypothesize that proper coordination of gastric motor function is required for optimal emptying. Fundic
motor events, antral contractions, and opening of the pylorus are closely coordinated. Abnormalities in these
events can result in delayed gastric emptying. To test this hypothesis, we plan to perform gastric MRI studies
in healthy and diabetic rats and humans. We have 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop and perform gastric MRI to
examine gastric motor events under postprandial conditions in rats and healthy subjects. This will define
normal gastric MRI profiles and elucidate how each component of the gastric motor events contribute to
emptying in health. Aim 2: Apply MRI technology to study gastroparesis in STZ-induced diabetes in rats and
investigate how vagal stimulation might improve antral duodenal coordination and enhance gastric emptying.
Aim 3: Employ MRI technology to study gastric motility and emptying in diabetic patients with gastroparesis.
We will examine how abnormalities of different components of gastric motor function contribute to delayed
gastric emptying. In separate studies, we will investigate the mechanisms by which prucalopride improves
gastric motility and emptying. Gastric MRI profiles will be compared between prucalopride responders and non-
responders to elucidate which components of the gastric motor function are modified by prucalopride resulting
in improved emptying. These gastric MRI studies may provide novel information to identify new strategies to
improve gastric emptying in diabetic gastroparesis."
10702075,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondria are dynamic signaling organelles that constantly undergoes fission (fragmentation) and fusion
(elongation) to adapt its structure to the demands of the cell. DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1) is a GTPase that
plays a crucial role in mitochondrial fission. Patients with de novo heterozygous missense mutations in the gene
that encodes DRP1, DNM1L, present with neurodevelopmental symptoms. To interrogate the molecular
mechanisms by which DRP1 mutations cause neurodevelopmental defects, we are utilizing patient-derived
fibroblasts and iPSC-derived models from patients with mutations in different domains of DRP1 who present with
clinically disparate conditions. The G32A mutation lies in the GTPase domain of DRP1 and is associated with
microcephaly. The R403C mutation lies in the stalk domain of DRP1 and causes progressively severe epilepsy.
Specific Aim 1 presents the progress thus far to uncover the impact of DRP1 mutations on mitochondrial structure
and metabolic function using patient-derived fibroblasts. Patient cells display elongated mitochondrial structure
and impaired coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain (ETC). Specific Aim 2 (the F99 phase of this
proposal) will explore the consequences of these findings in neurodevelopment using patient-derived induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models: three-dimensional cerebral organoids and two-dimensional neural
progenitor cultures. Confocal imaging and mass cytometry (CyTOF) will be used to determine if patient mutations
lead to change of cell fate in early corticogenesis. Further, multi-electrode array (MEA) technology will be
leveraged to examine the development of neuronal network activity in patient-derived brain organoids.
Understanding the mechanism by which these mutations cause neurological pathology will give insight into the
role of mitochondrial dynamics in neurodevelopment. Specific Aim 3 (the K00 phase of this proposal) will develop
the applicant into an independent academic researcher investigating the interactions between metabolic
signaling and neurodevelopment. The K00 phase will provide the applicant with training in metabolic analysis
using carbon tracing and in vitro biochemical assays as well as the professional development and networking
necessary to run an independent research laboratory. Overall, the work outlined in this proposal will equip the
candidate with both the technical expertise and professional skills to make great strides in the field of metabolism
in neurodevelopment."

This is a competing continuation of the UCLA training program to prepare physician and social/behavioral
scientists for academic research careers focused on integrated biomedical-behavioral (i.e., biobehavioral)
approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention in diverse global settings. Despite remarkable advances in prevention of
new HIV infections and treatment of HIV disease, significant challenges remain that highlight the need for
integrating behavioral science and biomedical approaches. The renewal of our highly successful training
program will help ensure that a new generation of scientific leaders is prepared to take us forward into the next
era of HIV research, specifically by providing training to integrate behavioral and biomedical approaches to
preventing HIV/AIDS globally. To reflect our biobehavioral approach, each year one new trainee will be a
physician specializing in adult or pediatric infectious diseases (i.e., an ID fellow), and one a social/behavioral
scientist with a doctoral degree from a relevant field such as public health, sociology, or public policy. We will
ensure all trainees receive rigorous social-behavioral science training and in use of biomarkers and conducting
research with clinical context and relevance. All trainees will be provided training and support to launch their
careers as independent investigators in HIV/AIDS prevention research. A successful graduate of the training
program will have: The option of securing a master’s degree; Completed at least one major HIV prevention
research project; Participated in several other research projects; Presented in at least one major scientific
conference; Published as a first author in leading scientific journals; and Secured funding from the NIH or other
agencies to take into a first faculty. These program goals are achieved through a variety of seminars, mentoring,
secondary data analyses, and the design and implementation of original data collection conducted in our
collaborating field sites. A new focus of our program will be integration of multidisciplinary training activities for
all of the MD and PhD trainees to foster biobehavioral approaches for solving the major problems that preclude
halting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Our program is especially designed to prepare young scientists for the future of
the HIV/AIDS funding environment that will require competency in biobehavioral approaches and we will model
this integration in our co-leadership and our research settings that emphasize Team Science as a building block
for success."
10886574,"Ocular hypertension in glaucoma arises from increased drainage resistance for aqueous humor in the
conventional outflow pathway, which includes the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm’s canal (SC).
Unfortunately, the cellular mechanisms responsible for resistance generation are largely unknown. Our previous
funding cycles have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is a key regulator of outflow resistance and intraocular
pressure (IOP). Moreover, we have shown that shear stress stimulates NO production by SC endothelial cells,
like vascular endothelia. Further, the magnitude of shear stress acting on SC cells depends on IOP, due to
pressure-induced narrowing of the SC lumen. As NO is known to decrease outflow resistance, shear-induced
NO production may act as a “fast” homeostatic signal to oppose the source of IOP elevation and help to maintain
IOP in a narrow range. This “fast” homeostasis is sensed by SC shear stress and operates over time scales of
seconds to minutes, and contrasts with the “slow” IOP homeostasis that is sensed by TM stretch that stimulates
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling over several days. These “fast” and “slow” mechanisms are
complementary because they allow the outflow pathway to sense and respond to perturbations in outflow
function over a range of temporal scales, from acute outflow obstruction to chronic remodeling of ECM. Our
recent data provide further insight into the homeostatic role of NO and how NO maintains the health and function
of the conventional outflow pathway. For example, our data show that NO production by SC cells is amplified by
pulsatile shear stress, which arises due to the ocular pulse and results in an immediate pulsation-induced
decrease in outflow resistance. We also show that NO contributes to the clearance of particulate matter, such
as pigment and cell debris, that would naturally accumulate in the juxtacanalicular TM. Thirdly, our modelling
studies suggest that elevated TM stiffness (as occurs in primary open angle glaucoma; POAG) eliminates the
“fast” IOP homeostasis by suppressing pulsation-induced shear stress in SC. Consequently, this desensitization
allows debris to accumulate unchecked in the TM, leading to eventual outflow dysfunction and IOP elevation.
Taken together, our central hypothesis is that NO has two critical roles in maintaining IOP homeostasis over
short time scales: (i) as a key signaling molecule in a mechanosensitive feedback loop potentiated by pulsatile
shear stress in the SC lumen, and (ii) as a modulator of inner wall permeability and TM contractility to flush cell
debris/pigment from the juxtacanalicular TM. We test our hypothesis with three Specific Aims (SAs).
SA1: To determine how the ocular pulse modulates outflow facility through NO signaling.
SA2: To determine how NO contributes to IOP homeostasis in response to particulate load in the TM.
SA3: To determine how NO regulates inner wall permeability, enabling particulate clearance from the TM.
Impact: Outcomes from this study will dissect the multifaceted role of NO signaling in IOP homeostasis, allowing
us to exploit this knowledge for the development of targeted, SC-based therapeutics for patients with POAG."

 Key questions of the 21st century in medicinal and biochemical areas are focused on the intimate operation
and functionality of biomolecule at the molecular level. By understanding the physical properties of
biomolecules at the nanoscale we can envision how to control them and use them for various applications.
The proposal below is aimed to promote these key questions via the use of nanoscale electrochemistry. I
am very excited to share with you some of our preliminary results and future vision dealing with both the
applied and fundamental sides of Bioelectrochemistry. The first part of the proposal is focused on merges
the lab expertise in nanoelectrochemistry and charge transport phenomena and focuses on an innovative
method to measure the electronic response of individual enzymes during catalysis. By that, we hope to
unravel by electronic means the way that enzymes operate and fluctuate with respect to their catalytic
activity at the molecular level. Gained information can guide us towards the control and design of enzymes
both from fundamental aspects and industrial applications.
 The second part of the research program offers a template for a paradigm shift in the way we think about
electrochemical biosensors. We propose to construct a chemically amplified electrochemical system that
enables the detection and analytical sizing of insulating materials, one at a time. We plan to use this
experimental approach for designing a sensor for rapid pathogen detection. The main goal here is to
innovate a sensor that can be used in a personalized fashion, without the need of complex device operation.
Realization of such sensor can potentially mitigate the number of unnecessary antibiotics given at the point
of care."
10913442,"Project Summary/Abstract
More than 10% of the U.S. population seeks care for spine pain each year with rates of surgical procedures on
the rise. One of the most challenging yet common sequelae of lumbar spine surgery is chronic post-surgical
pain (CPSP). CPSP is associated with poor physical function and remains difficult to treat. Indeed, it is
frequently treated with opioid medications, despite evidence that long term opioid use for the treatment of
chronic pain may not be effective and may increase the risk of overdose-related death. Therefore, the need to
prevent the transition from acute to chronic post-surgical pain is great, especially for patients undergoing
lumbar spine surgery. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychosocial intervention that has
been effective in improving physical function and quality of life among patients with chronic pain as well
treating opioid use disorders. Thus, it stands to reason that ACT may be a promising tool for the prevention of
CPSP and long-term opioid use. It has also been modified into brief formats in order increase adherence and
minimize treatment barriers such as cost and access. The present study aims to adapt and modify a brief
presurgical ACT intervention aimed at preventing the transition to CPSP and reducing long-term opioid use.
We will then assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the finalized intervention to
prevent the transition to CPSP and reduce post-surgical opioid use six months following lumbar spine surgery.
Finally, we will identify psychosocial and psychophysical phenotypes associated with response to this
intervention. Together, this study will afford me the opportunity to gain training in treatment development
and implementation and development and execution of clinical trial while advancing my long-term goal of
developing mechanistically-based nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent the development of CPSP and
reduce the risk of long-term opioid use."
10703725,"Synapses are the basic unit of neuronal communication, and consequently their location, number, and properties govern the function of neural circuits and nervous systems. How synapses form remains a fundamental question in contemporary neuroscience. A wide variety of synaptic cell adhesion molecules (syCAMs) are capable of initiating synapse formation. Downstream of these diverse connections, however, common pre- and post-synaptic specializations are formed. On the presynaptic side, an “active zone” structure is formed comprised of large multi-valent scaffolding proteins. The active zone coordinates the central functions of the presynapse by tethering and priming synaptic vesicles, clustering calcium channels, and aligning with the postsynapse through transmembrane connections. Recently the candidate showed conserved C. elegans active zone scaffolds SYD-2/Liprin-α and ELKS form liquid-liquid phase separated condensates at developing synapses, and this activity was required for active zone assembly. This work positioned active zone phase separation as a central assembly hub in the presynapse. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to determine molecular mechanisms and novel components that drive active zone phase separation, and thus presynapse formation. In Aim 1, phosphorylation will be investigated as a mechanism that controls active zone phase separation. Preliminary data suggest SAD-1 kinase phosphorylation of SYD-2 controls its activity. This phosphoregulation will be investigated with live animal in vivo imaging at single-synapse resolution in combination with in vitro phase separation assays. In Aim 2, the connection between synaptogenic syCAMs and active zone phase separation will be investigated. Multiple syCAMs have been identified to build local F- actin networks, which may link these upstream molecules to active zone phase separation. The requirement and sufficiency of F-actin networks in active zone formation and phase separation will be determined with optogenetic methods in vivo, and reconstitution of syCAM signaling and active zone phase separation in vitro. Finally, automated forward genetic screens will be performed to identify novel regulators of active zone formation. As all synapses across the diversity of neurons build a conserved core active zone, these studies have the potential to uncover common synapse assembly pathways. A fundamental understanding of synapse assembly will yield insight into synapse regeneration and future treatment of synaptopathies and is of primary relevance to the NINDS mission. The candidate will perform the K99 phase at Stanford University under the mentorship of Dr. Kang Shen, an expert in molecular and developmental neuroscience. This award will support the candidate’s career development with personalized training in research methods (genetic screening, phosphoregulation, and in vitro reconstitution) and career development (scientific writing, teaching, and management). This training will enable the candidate to successfully complete the proposed research and transition to an independent position investigating synapse formation."
10912480,"The objective of this proposed research is to develop a noninvasive, challenge-free, and widely available method for quantitative mapping of cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). As the brain continuously consumes 20% of the total oxygen supply, oxygen deficiency easily causes severe brain tissue damages as in hypoxia in ischemia in stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Regional OEF is an essential, direct biomarker for tissue viability and function and highly desired for evaluating and stratifying treatments in these neurologic disorders. Widely distributed MRI provides the potential to overcome the 15O PET, the current reference standard but clinically not used due to its limited availability. In MRI, quantitative mapping of OEF requires estimating deoxyheme concentration [dH] from the MRI signal. Three major approaches have been proposed to estimate [dH] from MRI magnitude signal. However, they commonly suffer from poor sensitives and burdensome data acquisition schemes as the MRI magnitude signal which they utilize has a complex dependence on [dH]. Consequently, no MRI-based OEF mapping has been routinely used in clinical setting. Furthermore, none of these methods have been validated against the current reference standard, 15O PET.  Recently, we developed a promising, novel, non-invasive MRI-based OEF method that requires no vascular challenge and utilizes a single routine MR sequence. By integrating quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) modeling of often neglected MRI phase signal and quantitative blood oxygenation level dependent (qBOLD) modeling of MRI magnitude signal, our model (QSM+qBOLD=QQ) can distinguish deoxyheme iron in venous vasculature from diffusive other susceptibility sources. In our preliminary data, QQ has been validated against 15O-PET in healthy adults and showed OEF abnormalities in ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumor. However, for clinical use, data acquisition and processing scheme of QQ should be improved to ensure the accuracy of OEF as a lack of data at short echo time and a non-optimal signal modeling with gradient-based solvers in current setting hinders the accurate OEF estimation.  In this K99/R00 project, we will establish a clinically readily applicable MRI toolset for quantitative OEF mapping, which is validated and available to every MRI scanner, by improving QQ. We will achieve this through 4 specific aims. Aim1. Develop optimal data acquisition for MRI-OEF mapping. Aim 2. Develop data processing algorithms for robust OEF estimation. Aim 3. Perform technical validation of MRI-OEF against 15O PET. Aim 4. Perform clinical validation of MRI-OEF in patients with intracranial stenosis. Our experience and preliminary data give us confidence that we will very likely succeed this this proposed project. In a timely fashion, the project will lead to a novel, validated, non-invasive, challenge-free, routinely usable and quantitative MRI OEF mapping, offering the potential to replace invasive, complicated current standard 15O PET OEF. This tool will lead to better understanding and management of neurovascular disorders, e.g. stroke."
10927295,"ABSTRACT (Project 1)
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a prevalent and almost uniformly fatal malignancy. Human PDAC
genome sequencing has identified recurrent mutations in Kras and several major tumor suppressor genes
(TSGs), but the impact of these alterations in the initiation and evolution of human PDAC development remain
poorly understood at the molecular level. Understanding the basis of tumor initiation and development has critical
implications for improving early diagnosis and therapy. While PDACs were originally thought to arise from ductal
cells, evidence from mouse models suggests that acinar cells can give rise to PDACs through a regenerative,
transdifferentiation process known as Acinar to Ductal Metaplasia (ADM). ADM is stimulated by chronic
pancreatitis, a known risk factor for PDAC, and generates premalignant Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasias
(PanINs), which lead to PDAC. Our preliminary data suggest that the p53 TSG can inhibit ADM and that p53
inactivation in acinar cells expressing oncogenic KrasG12D drives PDAC. However, expression of oncogenic
KrasG12D and p53 inactivation in ductal cells can also induce PDAC, suggesting alternate routes of PDAC
carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we find that acinar cell-derived and ductal cell-derived tumors resemble the
classical and basal-like subtypes of human PDAC, respectively. These results underscore the unique value of
mouse models in uncovering the determinants that dictate different paths of PDAC evolution to provide insight
into human PDAC. The roles of other common PDAC TSGs in early stage pre-neoplastic lesions, including
whether they normally function in acinar cells and/or ductal cells, however, remains unclear. Furthermore,
oncogenic Kras mutations are diverse in PDAC, yet it is unknown whether different mutations have distinct
impacts on PDAC development from different pancreatic epithelial cell types. We hypothesize that the cell type
of origin and tumor genotype cooperate to drive different paths of PDAC development, and to test this idea, we
will systematically inactivate several major PDAC TSGs and express different Kras alleles in both putative cell
types of origin. We will characterize the transcriptomes and the cellular milieu of early lesions and tumors and
employ innovative approaches like somatic genome editing and molecular barcoding. We will compare our
studies in tractable mouse models to studies of human PDAC development. Together, these transformative
studies will establish how genetic determinants and cell-of-origin influence the molecular pathways and the
cellular microenvironment during PDAC evolution in mice and humans, critical knowledge for better clinical
management of this deadly disease."
10927305,"ABSTRACT (Project 3)
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), an aggressive malignancy that is poorly responsive to treatment,
is characterized by a prominent infiltration of immune cells. In particular, macrophages are abundant within the
tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC and contribute to disease progression and treatment resistance.
However, the factors affecting the recruitment and distribution of immune cells, including macrophages, in
PDAC remain largely unknown. Recently, our collaborators in Project 1 found that tumors differing in their
Trp53 status exhibited different immune profiles. Our collaborators further observed that the cell type of origin
(acinar or ductal) influenced the tumor molecular subtype (classical or basal-like), which is also known to be
shaped by the immune composition of the tumor. We postulate that somatic alterations in cancer cells, the cell
type of origin, and tumor molecular subtype influence the immune landscape within the TME and throughout
the host during PDAC progression. To test this hypothesis, we will determine immune cell frequency,
distribution, and function in the TME and throughout the host using high-dimensional analytical tools (CODEX
and CyTOF) on genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC that vary in their driver mutations
and cell type of origin (developed by Project 1). Additionally, we will use molecular methods to identify
immunomodulatory factors regulating immune cell recruitment in the context of different genetic mutations and
cell type of origin, and we will use genetic, pharmacological, and neutralizing antibody-based approaches to
confirm the functional effects of these factors in driving PDAC progression. Importantly, we will validate
findings from these studies in human PDAC specimens and in cell lines derived from human pancreatic ductal
cells. Finally, we recently found that the pattern recognition receptor, Dectin-2, is expressed on tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs) in an aggressive, transplantable model of PDAC. Notably, administration of
natural Dectin-2 ligands induces sustained PDAC regression in a T-cell dependent manner by reprogramming
immunosuppressive TAMs into immunostimulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We hypothesize that
PDAC can be effectively treated by reprogramming Dectin-2+ TAMs into immunostimulatory APCs. We will
treat autochthonous tumors arising in the GEMMs developed by Project 1 with Dectin-2 ligands to test this
hypothesis. Furthermore, to identify mechanisms by which Dectin-2 stimulation is therapeutically efficacious,
we will use CODEX and CyTOF to observe changes to the immune landscape occurring within the TME and
throughout the host upon treatment. Molecular approaches will be used to identify immunomodulatory factors
responsible for mediating therapeutic efficacy. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of how
the immune system is altered during PDAC development in the context of variation in genetic mutations, cell
type of origin, and molecular subtype, and in response to TAM reprogramming."

The goal of this research program is to provide tools for the discovery of transcriptional networks that control
cell fate decisions. Cell fate decisions driven by cell state transitions underlie essential cell processes from
development to cellular reprogramming. There is an opportunity to make use of publicly available genomic data
to develop predictive computational models of cell state transition dynamics. The methods proposed will offer
means to gain insight into cell fate decision-making and how it is transcriptionally regulated, given specific cell
fate decision points and suitable data. Examples of such decision points include control of epidermal
regeneration, or the maintenance of balance among myeloid cell fates during hematopoiesis. In order to bridge
the gap between genomics and cell dynamics, statistical and computational modeling challenges must be
overcome. Two key challenges form the basis of this research program: 1) developing statistical methods to
infer regulatory networks while accounting for the levels of variability between single cells, and 2) developing
computational models to couple gene regulatory dynamics within cells and cell-cell communication between
cells. To address the first challenge, we will develop machine learning models to predict gene expression
dynamics from time-series data. These models will be able to classify genes by their temporal patterns, and
the results will inform gene network inference. We will then develop methods for network inference that
integrate muti-modal data (single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing) as well as cell-cell signaling information to
learn networks that control specific cell state transitions. To address the second challenge, we will develop
differential equation-based multiscale models of the gene regulatory network dynamics coupled with the cell-
external signaling dynamics. This will allow us to capture both molecular and cellular dynamics in high
resolution, and thus identify which parameters exert key control over the system. We will use Bayesian
methods for parameter inference to fit models to data and perform model selection, adapting methods where
needed for multiscale model inference. Models will be rigorously evaluated through their application to specific
systems, including cell differentiation (e.g. myeloid fate decisions during hematopoiesis) and development (e.g.
nephron progenitor cell fate decisions). In each of these organ systems, models predictions will be tested
experimentally via collaborations. Following iterative testing, open-source, validated methods will be made
widely available for the study of the dynamic processes of cell fate decision-making."

10900684,"Project Summary: Serotonin based therapeutics in cerebral palsy
 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a relatively common nonprogressive disorder causing lifelong motor dysfunction. The most
prevalent type, spastic cerebral palsy, is characterized by muscle hypertonia, weakness, hyperreflexia, less voluntary
(and more involuntary) activation of motor units, thinning of the corticospinal tract, and decreased numbers of motor
units. While weakness and hypertonia in muscles have been well documented in spastic cerebral palsy, the
etiopathogenesis is almost completely unknown.
 Previous work and our preliminary data from preclinical models of CP show that motoneurons (MNs) show
excessive activity after perinatal injury, particularly in response to serotonin (5HT). This is likely causing or contributing
to hypertonia since blocking 5HT receptors can alleviate hypertonia. During development, spontaneous neural activity
is largely responsible for establishing connectivity within spinal circuits and between spinal MNs and developing
muscles and establishing numbers of MNs that survive past natural developmental cell death. This proposal focuses
on blockade of spinal 5HT receptors at a critical developmental time point in order to restore normal MN activity /
motor unit function, and alleviate weakness, hypertonia, and hyperreflexia. In this study we will utilize a larger animal
model of CP (prenatal hypoxia-ischemia [HI] at 70-80% gestation in rabbits), which shows robust motor dysfunction
and has recently been demonstrated to have clinical features of CP including thinning of CST and cortical damage,
hyperreflexia, muscle pathology, and reduced numbers of MNs.
 Aim 1: Identify postnatal milestones in motor units following prenatal HI injury. From birth to 31 days
of age in rabbit kits of both sexes, we will quantify aberrant development of motor units, specifically 1) motor
behavior in awake kits, including joint torque, 2) in vivo recording of motoneuron / motor unit firing patterns,
motor unit contraction force, and H reflex and 3) anatomical development of motor units. Significance: Timing
of treatment (Aim 3) will be delivered motor unit maturation, either perinatally or postnatally.
 Aim 2: Identify 5HT receptor(s) mediating hypertonia. In newborn rabbit kits of both sexes (sham and
HI), we will assess receptor pharmacology and dose dependency in vitro and in vivo using a variety 5HT
receptor agonists and antagonists. Significance: Findings will guide choice of drug treatment in Aim 3.
 Aim 3: Evaluate treatment with a 5HT antagonist. We will compare effects of perinatal and postnatal
treatment with a serotonergic antagonist and agonist on sham and HI kits based on results of Aim 2. Treatment
coincides with maturation of motor units. We will examine the outcome in kits as described in Aim 1.
Significance: This aim provides a preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutic for reduction of spasticity in CP.
 We will use the rabbit model of CP to evaluate potential therapies to reduce spasticity after prenatal injury.
Several FDA-approved serotonergic drugs could be investigated to improve outcomes in kids at risk of CP."
10914047,"Major advancements in stem cell biology have paved the way for innovation in organoid engineering. Organoids
are 3D tissues derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generated by reprogramming patient-
speciﬁc adult cells, such as ﬁbroblasts. While organoids show great promise as testbeds for investigating devel-
opmental biology, current methods for organoid production are limited by their reliance on external inputs, such
as growth factors and small molecules, which affect cells imprecisely and give rise to immature organoids that do
not faithfully recapitulate in vivo physiology and functionality. The resulting organoids are size-constrained, lim-
ited to a small set of cell types, and do not generally develop mature tissue that exhibits the functionality of fully
developed organs. While we have previously demonstrated genetic programs that enable organoids to generate
all requisite cell types in liver, variability in cell ratios remains an open challenge for achieving reproducible, high
quality organoids. Further, progress is blocked by the inability to reliably guide multi-lineage speciﬁcation, the lack
of precise timing of multistep differentiation, and the inability to make robust bifurcation decisions that determine
the ratios of the resulting cell types.
To overcome these obstacles, we will combine synthetic biology, developmental biology, and control theory to
design novel open and closed loop genetic controllers that individually guide differentiation from within each cell
to form unique new 3D tissue: vascularized pancreatic organoids with deﬁned ratios of endocrine and exocrine
cells. We will demonstrate how these new organoids can serve as more sophisticated and comprehensive models
for investigating developmental biology principles. This work will spearhead a transformation in organoid synthesis
by shifting the ﬁeld from manual addition of inductive chemical signals to cell type conditional, self-timed ectopic
expression of transcription factors that induce differentiation. Building upon the premise that 1) gene sensors can
detect cell types speciﬁc to differentiation stages, and 2) at least in certain important cases, regulated expression
of lineage-specifying transcription factors can guide differentiation to the next stage, our main hypothesis is that
feedback regulation of cell lineage bifurcation decisions can lead to more robust and reproducible sub-population
ratios in organoids in comparison to open loop approaches. Our organoids will contain synthetic developmental
programs that are self-timed and globally-orchestrated, with cells working together to generate the requisite ratios.
We will create a platform for programmed bifurcation decisions that can be used for other differentiation steps
in the pancreas, and more broadly to other organoid and tissue types. We will use this platform to perform
novel developmental studies to systematically vary the ratio of endocrine to exocrine cells and measure the
consequences on exocrine/endocrine cells and their differentiation and function. The ability to precisely vary the
ratio while studying gene expression proﬁles, the organoid secretome, and its affects on target cells will provide
invaluable beneﬁt in the investigation of pancreas development and dysfunction."
10898821,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is the most common intellectual disorder affecting millions and also is a form
of early-onset Alzheimer Disease (AD). Understanding of DS pathology has been hindered by the complexity
caused by overexpression of the ~250 genes on chromosome 21 (chr21). Many reports describe a diverse range
of developmental and functional pathologies in the DS brain. However, there is conflicting evidence even as to
which brain regions or cell types are impacted. Furthermore, few studies address when pathology arises and
when it remains reversible. Therefore, better understanding of the exact impact of DS on brain development and
function, when said effects occur, and identification of mechanistic causes in specific brain cell types is critical.
Reports from mouse models, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and post-mortem DS brain samples
regarding the impact of DS on brain development and function are conflicted. Furthermore, when during
development the impacts of DS occur and which chr21 genes are responsible are unknown. Preliminary results
show that the clonal variability between isogenic disomic and trisomic cell lines was too great to establish any
neurodevelopmental effect of trisomy even when organoids variability was well controlled. Surprisingly, AD-
related Aβ pathology was still observed. To circumvent variability between cell lines our strategy will be to
manipulate over-expression of chr21 in several trisomic cell lines. By inserting an inducible XIST transgene into
the extra chr21, our lab has demonstrated comprehensive chromosomal silencing using endogenous machinery
for dosage compensation. Our XIST-inducible system for “trisomy silencing” reduces variability by allowing the
study of nearly identical cells, with or without extra chr21 expression. Using this system, the Lawrence lab has
demonstrated that DS potentially delays neurogenesis by prolonging neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate during
neuronal monolayer differentiation. Prolonged NPC cycling is known to alter cell fate and therefore we will
examine later stages of neurodevelopment that may alter brain cell-type composition. At the same time, we will
examine if trisomy silencing can correct an established AD-related cell pathology in DS organoids.
We will also use these approaches to examine the impact of trisomy 21 on global transcription in specific cell
types relating to cell pathologies. A current theme in DS research is that trisomy 21 causes very broad changes
in expression of non-chr21 genes. Through transcriptomics many studies have reported that genome-wide
impacts may alter specific genes/pathways, impacting both the development and activity of different neural cell
types. However, work in our lab suggests other differences between samples, not due to trisomy, may account
for much of this “global perturbation”. The hypothesis for this proposal is that trisomy 21 alters the relative
proportions of neural cell types in the brain during development and/or disrupts pathways in specific neural cell
types. Using the XIST-system I will better determine how and when trisomy 21 alters the development and
transcriptome of specific neural cell types in DS, while providing mechanistic insights into genes involved."
10876949,"Chronic pain is a complex neurological disease that adversely impacts function and quality of life.
Brain structure and function are altered when an individual is in the chronic pain state.
Furthermore, chronic pain is associated with disruptions in functional brain connectivity. Spinal
cord stimulation (SCS) is a clinically available non-pharmacological therapy that is used in the
management of chronic pain. Although SCS is effective for many, there are individuals who do
not benefit. Therefore, in order to better understand brain mechanisms that underlie SCS
treatment of chronic pain and to develop brain biomarkers of SCS efficacy, we propose to evaluate
functional brain changes in response to SCS. Finding a brain signature of pain relief in response
to SCS would improve understanding of how SCS alleviates chronic pain and may help to identify
those most likely to respond. The main objective of this study is to assess changes in brain
connectivity in response to SCS in individuals with chronic neuropathic pain. We will study two
cohorts: Cohort 1 – naive to SCS patients who are undergoing SCS trial period; Cohort 1 – long-
term SCS users (≥6 months post implantation). We aim to identify neurophysiological brain
signatures of pain relief in these two populations using resting state Near Infrared Spectroscopy
and Electroencephalography (rs-fNIRS/EEG).
Study Design: We will enroll veterans with refractory chronic neuropathic pain who are currently
receiving clinical care within the medical center. Cohort 1: Individuals with chronic neuropathic
pain who are naïve to SCS and were selected for SCS trial period as part of their clinical care will
participate in two study visits: before the beginning of the SCS trial and the end of the trial period.
Data collection will be consistent across all data collection timepoints (T1 – T3) and include rs-
fNIRS/EEG and clinical pain measures. Cohort 2: Participants with effective implanted SCS ≥ 6
months will participate in three study visits conducted 24-48 hours apart. Data will be collected
during SCS use and following an SCS washout period. Data collection will be consistent across
all data collection timepoints(T1-T4) and include rs-fNIRS/EEG and clinical pain measures. Both
cohorts will receive paresthesia based SCS.
AIM 1 is to characterize neurophysiological (rs-fNIRS/EEG) brain signature of pain relief during
the SCS trial period for patients with chronic neuropathic pain who are naïve to SCS. AIM 2 is to
characterize neurophysiological (rs-fNIRS/EEG) brain signature of pain relief in patients with
chronic neuropathic pain who have utilized SCS for ≥6 months. Outcome Measures to address
both aims include rs-functional connectivity (rs-fNIRS/EEG); and a composite clinical pain
assessment that will include Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Patient Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System-29 profile v2.1(PROMIS-29); EQ-5D-5L; Patient Global
Impression of Change (PGIC); painDetect; and activity monitoring.
Significance: Studying changes in brain connectivity in response to SCS will provide insight into
the treatment mechanism of SCS. Use of neuroimaging methods such as rs-fNIRS/EEG that can
be easily applied in the clinical setting to further refine patient selection for SCS may improve
outcome in SCS therapy. This grant will provide preliminary data for future studies aimed at
developing biomarkers of pain-relief with SCS treatment."
10816520,"Project Summary
In 2021, 80,816 US residents died from an opioid-related overdose death—an astounding 100-fold increase
since 1999. The opioid crisis continues to evolve with changes in the drug supply, drug demand, and policy
intervention. Since 2019, the crisis has shifted into a ‘fourth wave’ of high mortality, characterized by the
mixture of synthetic opioids with stimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Synthetic opioids,
specifically fentanyl and its analogs, are still the major driver of overdose deaths. We can identify the role of
synthetic opioids because we have national data to track deaths by substance, age, race, ethnicity, gender,
and geographical location. What we don’t have is timely national data signaling the increased role of stimulants
in opioid overdose deaths. Largely, we were unaware that the opioid crisis had shifted nationally because data
were not released until two years after the onset of lethal fentanyl cocktails that included a stimulant. Moreover,
we know very little about the personal details of individual decedents. If we want to curb opioid overdose
deaths and respond to the escalating use of stimulants in fatal drug combinations, we need to understand the
context in which those deaths occur sooner along with precipitating events, personal and medical history, prior
treatment attempts, interactions with the criminal justice system, toxicology results, drug sources, drug forms,
routes of administration, and other correlates of opioid overdose deaths. These data exist, but currently they
are not publicly available, centralized, or usable in their current state. The proposed study will solve this key
data limitation in opioid research. To inform prevention and mitigation strategies, we will leverage critical, time-
sensitive information from medicolegal investigations of fatal drug overdoses. These investigations produce
data from death certificates, law enforcement, toxicology, and coroner/medical examiner reports. The reports
contain both structured and unstructured narrative data, which describe the circumstances around each death.
Currently, researchers can only access these reports for suicides and homicides through Restricted Access to
Data agreements with the federal government. While useful, suicides and homicides caused by opioid
poisoning account for only 6% of opioid overdose deaths. To obtain detailed information on the remaining 94%
of “unintentional” opioid overdose deaths, we need the same data elements and narratives from individual
state governments. We will secure both intentional and unintentional overdose records, integrate, and mine
these data to identify previously unexamined precipitating events, personal histories, and circumstances
surrounding drug overdose deaths. Furthermore, we will quantify demographic and regional variation in the
types of substances involved in opioid overdose deaths. These objectives will inform prevention and mitigation
efforts, including critical intervention points and changes in the drug supply. The database we create will not
only allow us to achieve these objectives to address the escalating opioid crisis that involves fentanyl and
stimulants but will lay the foundation for extensive future research."
10869948,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and escalating health care costs within the VA. The
type of HF that is increasing disproportionately is HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), commonly
caused by hypertension and left ventricular (LV) pressure overload. An estimated 10% to 20% of hypertensive
patients have resistant hypertension (RHTN), defined as having controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure with
the use of ≥ 3 medications that includes a diuretic. We previously reported significant LV hypertrophy and
diastolic dysfunction with normal systolic function in persons with RHTN. Hypertension among Black adults in
the US has one of the highest prevalence rates in the world and is related to adverse changes in LV structure
and function. Hypertension is an underlying factor in >50% of Black adults with HF and is the strongest risk
factor for HF in that population.8 Black adults have a 50% increased incidence of HF, due in large part to the
greater prevalence and severity of hypertension, and HF occurs 8 years earlier in Black adults as compared
with Whites. Although Black adults have the highest death rate for HF, they are consistently underrepresented
in clinical trials. The greater HF burden among Black adults calls for further work to discover effective
preventive and therapeutic strategies for this higher-risk population. The greater HF burden among Black
adults calls for further work to discover effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for this higher-risk
population. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an effective strategy to improve the health of African
American Veterans with HFpEF. We have recently reported increased plasma xanthine oxidase (XO) activity
and mtDNA damage associated molecular products (DAMPs) levels in Black adults with RHTN, compared with
White adults with RHTN. This supports the general consensus that oxidative stress is higher in black adults.
XO oxidizes hypoxanthine and xanthine to generate hydrogen peroxide and superoxide as a byproduct. These
products damage mitochondria leading to bioenergetic dysfunction and further amplification of oxidant
generation and production of mtDNA DAMPs. mtDNA DAMPs are potent activators of the innate immune
response through several pathways including activation of TLR (toll-like receptor) with promotion of pro-
inflammatory cytokine release. We have shown diastolic blood pressure (r=0.876, p<.001), LV end-diastolic
mass index (r=0.503, p=0.012), fractional shortening (r=-0.546, p=0.006), wall thickness (r=0.428, p=0.001),
mid-wall radius to wall thickness ratio (r=0.354, p=0.008), and early diastolic filling rate (r=-0.422, p=0.04) were
related to XO activity at six months among the Blacks but not White RHTN patients. Given the higher level of
XO activity and mtDNA DAMPs in blacks, we hypothesize that inhibition of XO improves LV diastolic
function in Black African Americans with RHTN. We will address this hypothesis in the following Aims.
Aim 1. Impaired LV diastolic function is a major cause of symptoms in HFpEF. Therefore, we will test the
hypothesis that allopurinol improves LV diastolic function using CMR as previously performed in our lab. Aim
2. Impaired LV diastolic function is linked to decreased exercise capacity and quality of life. Therefore, we will
test the hypothesis that Allopurinol therapy will improve exercise capacity in a six-minute walk test and quality
of life using the Kansas City Heart Failure Questionnaire."
10923869,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT – THERAPY EVALUATION CORE
 The goal of our Center of Innovation for Brain Tumor Therapeutics is to nominate only the most promising
novel treatment strategies for late-stage clinical testing. This will be accomplished through careful pre-clinical
evaluation of potential drug candidates for adequate brain tumor distribution, optimization of dose and schedule
for combinatorial regimens, and rigorous efficacy analyses. Combined with careful evaluation of
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), these studies will be used to establish a PK→PD→efficacy
model to predict whether the novel regimen is likely to have adequate distribution and efficacy in human GBM.
These predictions then will be tested in Phase 0/I clinical trials in which the safety, tolerability, drug distribution
and on-target effects will be tested. Integration of human PK/PD data into our model then will be used to help
inform decision making for whether to move specific novel therapies into more advanced Phase II or III clinical
trial testing. To accomplish this, the Therapy Evaluation Core and the Pharmacology Core will work closely to
support the research being performed within the Projects and the broader Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network
(GTN). The scope of work for the Therapy Evaluation Core can be categorized in the two aims described below.
 Specific Aim 1: Develop, manage and execute in vivo studies in tumor-bearing animals
 Specific Aim 2: Develop and manage early-phase clinical trial studies"
10923875,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT – PHARMACOLOGY CORE
 The Pharmacology Core will work closely with the project teams and the Therapy Evaluation Core to provide
comprehensive pharmacology support for all proposed studies. The studies supported by the Pharmacology
Core will address key pharmacologic issues and will inform crucial “go-no go” decisions in novel drug
development for GBM, including issues surrounding blood-brain barrier (BBB). Understanding the ability of drugs
to distribute across the BBB into tumor tissue and surrounding ‘normal’ brain infiltrated by GBM cells is critically
important for the development of effective therapies, especially those treatments that could lead to long-term
survival. The proposed Center projects are focused on developing combinatorial regimens using DNA damage
response (DDR) inhibitors targeting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)
signaling pathways (Project 1) or the p53/murine-double minute 2 (MDM2) pathway (Project 2). Efficacy of these
combination strategies is dependent on adequate drug exposure at optimal times throughout the tumor volume,
including the infiltrative regions. Further, both projects will use a rigorous spatial evaluation of pharmacokinetic
(PK) processes and resulting pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of these drugs within normal brain and throughout
brain tumor tissues to design and implement the most efficacious combination regimens. The Pharmacology
Core is led by Dr. William Elmquist, who is a Professor of Pharmaceutics at the University of Minnesota and a
world expert in the PK of drug distribution across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into normal brain and brain
tumors. His key co-investigators include Dr. Forest White from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr.
Nathalie Agar from Harvard University. These three research groups have an extensive collaborative history,
and many of the strategies planned have been rigorously validated through this close collaboration across the
three laboratories. The specific functions of this Pharmacology Core can be divided into three specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Pharmacokinetic and CNS distribution analyses of novel therapeutic agents
Specific Aim 2: Support the development of pharmacodynamic biomarkers
Specific Aim 3: Support human Phase 0/1 clinical trial development"
10923879,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Alkylating chemotherapies are part of the backbone of standard-of-care therapy in newly diagnosed disease,
and they are also used in the recurrent setting. We and others have demonstrated that these agents each induce
unique spectra of DNA damage, which engage specific DNA damage response (DDR) pathways depending on
the status of key DNA repair pathways. The most commonly used agents are temozolomide (TMZ), a
monofunctional alkylator that induces methyl-adducts on discrete DNA base sites, and lomustine and
carmustine, which are bifunctional alkylators that induce both mono-adducts and DNA cross-links. The different
DNA lesions induced by these and other alkylating therapies trigger distinct DNA damage responses critically
modulated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM/Rad3-related (ATR) kinases, which orchestrate the
cellular response to a broad array of genotoxic insults. Over the past few years, we have collaborated with the
NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and multiple pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Vertex, Merck
KGaA, Bayer) to evaluate multiple highly brain penetrant ATM and ATR inhibitors in combination with radiation
therapy and alkylating chemotherapies. Our preliminary data demonstrate robust synergy between TMZ and
ATR inhibitors, specifically in GBM models lacking. Mechanistically, unrepaired O6-methyguanine lesions
induced by TMZ cause replication stress and activation of the ATR signaling axis. In contrast, synergistic
interactions of ATR inhibitors with lomustine were independent of MGMT status, which reflects a distinct set of
alkylation lesions that are relatively unaffected by MGMT repair activity. Overall, our extensive preliminary data
support the fundamental scientific premise that monofunctional and bifunctional alkylator therapies trigger distinct
functional and temporal activation of DNA damage response pathways governed by ATM and ATR.
Understanding these relationships can be used to define optimal combinations of ATR or ATM inhibitors with
various alkylating agents for GBM."
10923884,"Project Summary – Project 2
 Disruption of tumor suppressor p53 function is the most common alteration in cancer and results in
dysregulation of DNA repair following genotoxic insults. Use of small molecule inhibitors blocking the
interaction of p53 with murine double minute 2 (MDM2) prevents MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 and is
the most clinically advanced strategy to target this critical DNA damage response pathway. In this project, we
introduce the highly potent MDM2 inhibitor BI-907828 as a novel therapeutic approach against glioblastoma
(GBM). This best-in-class MDM2 inhibitor is highly potent in vitro in GBM PDXs at single-digit nanomolar
concentrations. BI-907828 monotherapy has significant anti-tumor activity against orthotopic GBM PDXs with
corresponding robust evidence of on-target pharmacodynamic drug effects – stabilization of p53 and increased
p53-mediated transcription of pro-apoptotic genes. Further, combined therapy with BI-907828 and radiation
markedly enhances induction of pro-apoptotic genes in both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and
combined radiation/BI-907828 therapy in orthotopic PDXs results in profound extension of animal survival in
two GBM PDXs. This activity in orthotopic PDX models known to have an intact blood brain barrier is
especially interesting since BI-907828 has relatively limited distribution into normal brain. In contrast to
modulation of mitogenic signaling or many other DNA repair targets, which require sustained, high-level
suppression of optimal effects, MDM2 tightly regulates p53 stability in a negative feedback loop. Thus, we
hypothesize that even short-term inhibition of MDM2 activity can lead to increased expression of p53 sufficient
to activate pro-apoptotic effects of p53. Defining the differences in pharmacologic effect when targeting distinct
types of regulatory circuits (e.g., positively cooperative signaling networks vs. negative feedback transcriptional
networks) represents a key innovation of the planned project. The specific Aims of the project are:
Aim 1: Develop a PK→PD→efficacy model for BI-907828 monotherapy in GBM PDXs
Aim 2: Conduct a phase 0 trial to evaluate the distribution and pharmacodynamics of BI-907828 in GBM
Aim 3: Determine the tolerability of BI-907828 combined with radiation in patients with newly diagnosed GBM
Aim 4: Evaluate combinatorial strategies for BI-907828 with other anticancer therapies for GBM"
10912642,"Abstract
Aerosol inhalation therapy is one of the cornerstones of respiratory therapy. The size of airborne
particles determines their deposition pattern within the lungs and therefore, the efficacy of
inhalation therapy. In this Phase 2 SBIR project, BridgeSource Medical (BSM) proposes to
develop a breath-adaptive nebulizer with variable aerosol droplet sizes and actuation times.
This can be used to administer precise doses of pharmaceutical drugs to the pulmonary system
with much greater efficiency than currently available aerosol delivery devices like small-volume
adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) nebulizers that require strict patient breath timing, but do not
vary droplet size. The nebulizer would be particularly beneficial in the administration of
medications to treat elderly patients with respiratory conditions such as pulmonary hypertension,
where long treatment times and strict requirements on patient breathing lead to poor
compliance. The ultimate goal will be to develop a clinical tool that would be approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an effective system to nebulize several drug
formulations targeted for patients who cannot easily comply with strict breathing maneuvers,
such as the those with advanced lung disease such as pulmonary hypertension."
10833655,"Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 global pandemic have continued to alter the delivery of, and access to,
healthcare across the nation. The resulting unmet health needs have had a disproportionate effect among older
Americans as they continue to be at the highest mortality risk for the latest variants of COVID-19. Additional
health disparities due to race, gender, residential location, and income have been exacerbated by COVID-19,
further limiting equitable access to healthcare across the lifespan. These and other challenges have hastened the
shift to other modes of healthcare such as telehealth. Yet, while Zoom and other apps have facilitated remote
patient-clinician videoconferencing as the most common forms of telehealth, they do little to provide direct
physical examination needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions,
or guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation
practitioners. This is especially true for obtaining measures of joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance,
strength, and function from osteoarthritis (OA) disorders; cornerstones for planning therapeutic interventions
and guiding exercise compliance. Our team of biomechanists and computer vision engineers will continue our
Phase I partnership with orthopedic and geriatric rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) to advance the development of an augmented reality (AR) platform that enables clinicians to visualize
key rehabilitative outcome measures to augment remote telehealth interactions during a video conference with
their patient. Our Phase I work demonstrated the proof-of-concept that standard 3D-cameras available in
common consumer devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets/PCs) when coupled with post-processing body
tracking algorithms can deliver accurate rehabilitation outcome measures from patients with knee OA during a
simulated telehealth visit. In Phase II we will expand our 3D body tracking algorithms and AR Platform
architecture to support a broader set of assessment protocols that accommodate a diverse array of human and
home environment factors (Aim 1); enable real-time cross-platform deployment for HIPAA-compliant
communication and presentation of outcomes on a clinician’s screen (Aim 2); and validate the prototype during
sessions involving clinic-based physical therapist and a person with knee OA remotely located in their home
across urban, suburban, and rural locations (Aim 3). Stakeholders will complete self-report questionnaires for
usability, acceptance, and perceived value followed by brief guided interviews and focus group evaluations.
Our milestone is a clinically viable and operationally effective prototype AR Telehealth Platform that is
favorably rated by clinicians and patients for use in the home. The long-term impact will expand access to
rehabilitation specialists using telehealth tools that provide evidence-based evaluations of musculoskeletal
deficits needed for guiding therapeutic interventions among at-risk segments of the population."
10840378,"Project Summary
There have been long-standing discussions about the role of NGS (next-generation sequencing)
versus real-time PCR in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and screening. NGS offers unrivaled
discovery power and represents the ultimate in multiplexing capability. NGS, however, is
expensive and often requires complex workflows with a long turnaround time. Real-time PCR, in
contrast, is comparatively inexpensive and can be fully automated for operation at the point-of-
care with a fast sample-in-result-out time. But real-time PCR can only detect known sequences
and has a very limited multiplexing capability (typically 4-6 colors).
In a clinical diagnostic, prognostic, and even screening setting, it is often sufficient to query a
known panel of genes or mutations. When limited multiplexing is required, such as 4 or 5 colors
in a single reaction, which can be the case in companion diagnostics, real-time PCR has been
very successfully deployed. But at present, it is more difficult for real-time PCR to penetrate
diagnostic or screening assays that require panels with sizes in the tens or hundreds range. For
the larger panels, NGS is often used despite its more complex workflow, higher cost, and longer
turnaround time.
To address the above described unmet need in clinical diagnostics, this project aims to develop
a new approach to achieve highly multiplexed PCR assays, for both real-time PCR and digital
PCR. Given the important role PCR plays in molecular diagnostics, when successfully
completed, this project is expected to greatly expand the utility and accessibility of highly
multiplexed PCR assays in disease diagnosis and screening."

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease. Epide-
miology and population genetics suggest that sporadic PD (>95% of cases) results from a complex interaction
between genetic risk, aging, and environmental factors. A detailed understanding of the genetic risk is the first
step to elucidating this complex interaction. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numer-
ous risk variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) present in 78 genomic regions associated with
an increased risk of developing PD. However, there is little insight regarding which and how these SNPs mech-
anistically contribute to the development and progression of PD. Since most of the functional SNPs are highly
enriched in non-coding regulatory DNA elements such as distal enhancers, the prevailing theory is that cis-
acting effects of the functional non-coding SNPs on gene expression play a significant role in the development
of complex diseases. To compile a list of probable causal SNPs in brain enhancers, we integrated GWAS-iden-
tified PD-risk variants with epigenomic data identifying brain-specific enhancers and gene expression datasets
in primary brain tissue. This analysis revealed multiple candidate PD-risk variants in a microglia-specific en-
hancer element in the glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) locus. GPNMB is a type 1
transmembrane protein known to be upregulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Very little is known re-
garding its molecular function and how the dysregulation of GPNMB contributes to PD. Our preliminary analy-
sis of changes in the cellular transcriptome after GPNMB gene deletion in hPSC-derived microglia identified
alterations in expression levels of multiple key genes associated with CNS inflammation (i.e. NLRP2,
NLRP12). In addition, there is compelling evidence indicating a role for GPNMB in autophagy (macroautoph-
agy, mitophagy, and CMA). Based on previous literature and our preliminary data, I speculate that the cis-act-
ing effect of a PD-risk associated sequence variant in a microglia-specific GPNMB enhancer leads to in-
creased GPNMB expression, resulting in autophagy dysregulation and ultimately culminating in the activation
of inflammatory pathways in microglia which contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in PD. To test this
hypothesis this project aims to: (1) to identify the causal risk variant present in this upstream enhancer of
GPNMB and characterize the molecular mechanisms by which the causal risk variant dysregulates GPNMB
expression in microglia using CRISPR/Cas9-risk variant edited hPSCs, (2) characterize the functional effects
of gain and loss of GPNMB on microglial inflammation associated with microglial activation and neurodegener-
ation associated-inducers, and (3) characterize the functional effect of GPNMB on autophagy and determine if
autophagy is an intermediate mechanism by which GPNMB influences inflammation. This work will provide in-
valuable insight into the novel link between non-coding PD risk variants, GPNMB, autophagy, and inflamma-
tion."
10902070,"Older people living with HIV (PLWH) disparately experience an increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and develop exacerbated age-related cardiometabolic comorbidities compared to 
uninfected individuals. Multiple risk factors in older people living with HIV including 
aging, HIV alone, antiretroviral therapy, microbial translocation, traditional CVD risk 
factors, lifestyle, opportunistic infections, and substance abuse create the ""perfect storm"" for 
increased immune activation, systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and CVD. Indeed, 
studies suggest the features driving an elevated risk of CVD include both HIV-specific, and 
traditional and non- traditional CVD risk factors. Yet, therapeutically targetable biological 
mechanisms driving an exacerbated HIV- related CVD burden remain unclear. Our previous work 
identified immunometabolism dysfunction as a mechanism linked to age-related comorbidities in 
PLWH. Targetable immunometabolic features and immune cell types differentially dysregulated in 
older PLWH linked to increased CVD risk remain undefined. With a multidisciplinary team 
including expertise in immunometabolism, cardiology, radiology, and infectious disease, we are 
uniquely positioned to uncover immunometabolic changes as a key mechanism linking HIV-mediated 
immune activation and inflammation to CVD comorbidity burden. We will leverage an established 
cohort of older PLWH at WCM and enroll 100 HIV+ participants (age > 50 years) all on suppressive 
ART with undetectable plasma HIV RNA in a longitudinal study with three study visits to assess 
inter- and intraindividual variability in immunometabolic study measures. We will apply a 
state-of-the-art single cell immunometabolism assay of fresh immune cells obtained from 
participants in real-time at three time points to overcome artifacts of 
cryopreservation, profile validated inflammation and cardiac injury biomarkers, and 
acquire longitudinal advanced cardiovascular and vascular bed CT imaging at baseline and a 36 
month follow up time point. Our central hypothesis is that the synergistic effects of HIV and long 
term ART on CVD comorbidity burden is driven by an exacerbated metabolic reprogramming of monocytes 
and T cells towards glycolysis in older PLWH on ART. The specific aims are Aim 1: To longitudinally 
assess the immunometabolic state of monocytes and T cells at single cell resolution, peripheral 
inflammation, and cardiac injury markers in 100 PLWH > 50 years on stable ART. Aim 2: To quantify 
the change over time in the degree of subclinical plaque burden across the vasculature in 100 
PLWH > 50 years on stable ART and evaluate associations with immunometabolic states of 
monocyte and T cell subpopulations. The results of this longitudinal study will enhance our 
understanding of inter- and intraindividual immunometabolism dysfunction in older PLWH linked to 
subclinical atherosclerosis, provide a roadmap for early detection of CVD based on the individual 
level and type of risk, and lead to the development of new therapeutics based on exploiting the 
specific metabolic programs of distinct immune cell populations to mitigate CVD risk in older PLWH."

Interpersonal and structural discrimination can be transferred from mother to child by heightening maternal stress
during a child’s early sensitive developmental windows: in-utero and early childhood. As Latinx families
acculturate to the US, maternally experienced discrimination may become biologically embedded in a mother’s
young child, increasing her child’s vulnerability to chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., depression, obesity)
across the lifespan. Dysregulated immune pathways may provide biological explanations for early childhood
health conditions that increase intergenerationally, including chronic childhood diseases and socioemotional
difficulties. Yet, the multi-level contextual influences, such as cumulative discrimination, which may drive a
trajectory of worsened maternal and child health remain elusive. This proposed study will examine the degree to
which maternal experiences of discrimination may induce a pro-inflammatory state in both mother and child via
immune dysregulation—a critical pathway linking stress to chronic disease. This proposal integrates theoretical
frameworks (Biological Embedding of Childhood Adversity Model and Social Safety Theory) to understand the
relationship between discrimination and immune pathways during pregnancy and early childhood through two
specific aims: Aim 1a: Determine the extent to which interpersonal and structural discrimination is associated
with maternal immune profiles (20 inflammatory plasma proteins) during pregnancy; 1b: Explore if maternal
acculturation moderates the relationships between interpersonal and structural discrimination and maternal
immune profiles. Aim 2a: Explore whether maternal experiences of interpersonal and structural discrimination
are associated with a child’s immune regulation (DNA methylation of immune-regulatory genes, TNF-a, IL-6,
NR3C1) and socioemotional functioning at 3-5 years old; 2b: Explore whether maternal social support moderates
relationships between maternal interpersonal and structural discrimination and child immune regulation and
socioemotional functioning. The accompanying career development plan will provide a foundation to a)
advance my knowledge in early child socioemotional development; b) develop skills and knowledge integrating
biological mechanisms within social contexts related to human development; c) develop skills in community
engagement strategies and primary data collection in Latinx populations; d) develop advanced skills in
quantitative analytical methods. My strong mentorship team will guide me throughout this award. Collectively,
the career development and research plan will support my growth as an independent nurse scientist examining
social and biological determinants of maternal and child health in Latinx families. This proposal aligns with NINR’s
Strategic Plan to identify multi-level social determinants of health that disadvantage specific population groups.
Understanding interactions between biological mechanisms and social contexts early in the developmental
cascade may inform preventive interventions that counteract the emotional and biological sequalae of
discrimination in Latina mothers and their young children."

secure centralized system to house, share, and manage data; designing robust studies; and analyzing clinical,
mechanistic, and high-throughput data for the three PPG projects. DMAC will work with the cores and projects
to ensure that analyses resulting from clinical and mechanistic study data are performed with integrity and rigor,
using compatible definitions and metrics for smooth integration to provide interpretable findings and advance
clinical and mechanistic research for the program. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1. Provide a state-of-the-art
secure, integrated and interactive database of high-quality data generated by projects in the program that
enables wide access to study investigators. The DMAC will build a system in Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) to house study data that extends the Parker Center's state-of-the-art biospecimen management
software platform to provide a PPG platform that integrates data from Projects 1-3 and the HEMC. REDCap will
integrate data from biospecimens collected for this program project with secured, associated patient metadata
for research on human tissues. DMAC will conduct quality control for all PPG data and analyses to ensure data
elements are clean. Aim 2. Design scientifically sound and robust studies across projects in the program. The
DMAC consists of personnel with expertise in designing clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and studies that
include mechanistic endpoints. The core will leverage such expertise using a team science-based approach and
refining questions and hypotheses that are feasible to develop scientifically sound analysis plans using the most
modern statistical tools that lend themselves to interpretable and meaningful findings, and to justify the number
of samples and participants necessary to address scientific questions by considering resources available during
the specified study timeline. Aim 3. Conduct analyses of clinical, mechanistic, and high throughput data. The
DMAC will develop long-term collaborative relationships with PPG investigators by embedding core members
into investigators' research teams to lead the data science component of studies. Using a well-established team
science-based approach, core members will develop and implement statistical analysis plans to address project
aims to assure findings are reproducible. The DMAC will educate PPG investigators in biostatistics and
bioinformatics most pertinent to their research to promote effective collaboration in the production of
interdisciplinary research publications. Together with the HEMC, the DMAC offers some of the most innovative
tools for bioinformatic and statistical analysis of large data sets to make the broadest and most transformative
impact in understanding clinical phenotype associations with mechanistic studies in air-pollution-associated
pathology."
11086432,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1
Air pollution, particularly particulate matter <2.5µm (PM2.5) comprising a variety of organic molecules produced
by combustion, is a significant driver of chronic lung disease (e.g., asthma). PM2.5 enters pulmonary alveoli
during chronic and acute PM2.5 exposure, releasing proinflammatory and vasoactive factors that contribute to
pulmonary pathology. Recently, the cytokine IL-1β and the inflammasome pathway have been implicated in
mechanisms underlying air-pollution-induced immune system activation and inflammation. Our proposal, for
the first time, brings together a unifying hypothesis that pollution mediated heart and lung disease occurs
through a shared IL-1β inflammasome pathway. This is not to say other factors are not relevant and we will
concurrently test oxidative stress and other pathways through high dimensional, rigorous, and validated
assays. We have shown that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation during air pollution exposure
indicate extent of exposure and can be linked to lung diseases. Although such advances have been made in
pollution-caused lung diseases, specific mechanisms of action have been elusive, driving an unmet need for
new approaches to protect individuals at risk and to reduce the detrimental effects of PM2.5 exposure. We
hypothesize that air pollution exposure induces circulating and cellular cytokines such as IL-1β and other
pathways through epigenetic mechanisms and immune cell activation, leading to direct and indirect activation
of lung epithelial cells, contributing to chronic lung disease. We will perform immune, and epigenetic studies in
blood samples derived from highly characterized cohorts with individual estimate exposures to air pollution. We
collected samples over time; therefore, we have samples from cohorts in a clean air environment (i.e. health
control). Our project on stem-cell-derived lung tissues harmonizes with studies on stem-cell-derived cardiac
tissues, along with novel aims specific to mechanisms in immune and lung tissue. We will share data across all
Projects and Cores to synergize findings across immune, lung, and heart areas of study to achieve our
overarching goal of uncovering the mechanisms of IL-1β and other pathways dysregulation in inflammation-
associated cardiopulmonary pathology in response to chronic and acute air pollution exposure. Understanding
the contribution of IL-1β and other markers will likely lead to the development and application of new ways to
prevent and treat diseases associated with public health issues associated with air pollution, like asthma. Our
study includes longitudinal and repeat measures within our cohorts of individuals (same individual over time is
tested) with diverse ethnicities, some of which represent underserved populations. Our analyses will control for
confounders (age, sex, body mass index, medications, other) and will address heterogeneity by similar
matching of characteristics of the cohorts (two test cohorts and validation cohort)."
11086433,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2
Lung and cardiac diseases are complex disorders with underlying chronic inflammation, which can be induced
or worsened by exposure to air pollution. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which air pollution
activates the immune system and inflammation is essential to developing therapies. The recently reported
association of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, with air pollution-linked pulmonary and cardiovascular
inflammation presents the hypothesis that IL-1β could be the common mediator of downstream inflammatory
immune responses linked to air pollution. Project 1 directly tests the hypothesis that IL-1β or other pathways are
induced by air pollution, and examines the effect of air pollution and IL-1β or other pathways on immune cell and
lung cell function using blood samples from three well-characterized cohorts that had been exposed to air
pollution. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that IL-1β or other pathways are involved in immune signaling in
cardiovascular tissue by directly by studying engineered heart cells' function after exposure to plasma samples
from the same three cohorts. In Project 2, we will synergize and harmonize our studies with Projects 1 and 3
by developing hypotheses using specific systems biology approaches to understand the molecular circuitry
induced by IL-1β in response to chronic and acute air pollution. There will be no redundancy with Project 1 and
3 or core laboratory experiments because we plan to perform unique-omics level experiments on blood samples
from the three cohorts. We hypothesize that IL-1β or other pathways induce a gene/protein/metabolite
expression response that plays a role in the pathophysiology of air pollution-linked immune system activation.
Our results in Project 2 could provide a comprehensive, global view of IL-1β−related and IL-1β non-related
responses in blood, lung, and/or cardiac tissues with fine-scale characterization of time-dependent and cytokine-
specific response patterns. To characterize this response, we will perform assays to identify abundances of
transcripts, proteins, and metabolites in samples from the three cohorts exposed to air pollution. We plan to
identify networks of molecules associated or not associated with IL-1β pathways, which are differentially
expressed in chronic versus acute air pollution. Our aims are Aim 1. to determine whether IL1α, IL1β, and IL36γ
and other markers are upregulated in individuals exposed to air pollution vs healthy control (e.g. cohort with no
air pollution exposure time point) in blood, lung, and cardiac tissues; Aim 2. to determine whether ATPases,
glucokinase, HSP70, and MAPkinases and other pathways are upregulated in air pollution exposure in blood
sample; and Aim 3. to determine whether the metabolites associated with lipid metabolism and lipogenesis are
upregulated in air pollution exposure. We expect that our data will generate hypotheses about pathological
mechanisms that can be shared collaboratively with Projects 1 and 3 and the core HEMC to test biomarkers
and drug targets for the PPG"
10877852,"ABSTRACT
Cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (CMBC) develops in up to 24% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Systemic therapy often has limited efficacy in such cases, and surgery and radiotherapy offer only transient relief
and their use may be limited in the CMBC population due to the side-effects involved and the extent of cutaneous
lesions. CMBC can cause infection, bleeding, malodor and disfigurement and can progress to occupy large areas
of the body. Kintara proposes a photodynamic therapy (PDT) known as REM-001 Therapy, wherein a
photosensitive drug is injected into the body to collect at tumor sites, and is activated by a specially-designed
laser focused on the selected lesions. The activated drug destroys tumors with minimal effects to surrounding
tissue. REM-001 has been proven to be effective for many conditions, including CMBC. However, previous trials
using a higher-than-threshold dose also reported high rates of unwanted side effects and longer healing time. In
previous trials, symptoms such as eschar and ulceration increased recovery time and caused patients to leave
studies but was not associated with better lesion outcomes. This project will reduce the treatment dosage to the
previously identified threshold level – which demonstrated a 79% response rate in an initial study – in an effort
to reduce side effects while still treating lesions. Kintara will test the reduced dose on 15 patients with
symptomatic cutaneous lesions and stable systemic disease who are unable to receive surgery or radiotherapy
at the time of treatment. These patients will be administered a single dose of REM-001 followed by light treatment
and will be monitored for efficacy (lesion shrinking or disappearing, as well as pain and itch subsiding and
improved quality of life) and safety/tolerability (eschar and ulceration, and bleeding and discharge from the
lesions, treatment related photosensitivity, as well as standard clinical side-effect monitoring). Patients will
continue on their existing standard of care systemic therapy and will receive it throughout the trial. If this trial is
successful – the treated lesions shrink or disappear with the reduced treatment dose – Kintara will continue to a
multi-site Phase III trial for CMBC and explore the use of REM-001 photodynamic therapy in other dermal
indications."

One in four people with HIV (PWH) report hazardous drinking [i.e., >7 (14) drinks per week or >3 (4) drinks per
occasion for women (men)]. Of this population, 65% report depressive symptoms or smoking, and 21% report
all three- constituting an alcohol-associated syndemic (i.e., interaction of 2+ conditions to increase risk for poor
outcomes). This syndemic is associated with increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). The
gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a strong candidate mechanistic pathway for the syndemic-related excess
CVD risk, through GI dysbiosis, microbial translocation (MT), and systemic inflammation. Dysbiosis is
characterized as a decrease in beneficial bacteria and increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. GI dysbiosis
leads to MT, in which tight junctions of the GI lumen are compromised, driving systemic inflammation- a
leading cause of CVD. HIV, hazardous drinking, smoking and depression are independently associated with GI
dysbiosis, MT and inflammation. Beneficial butyrate producing bacteria, which downregulate pro-inflammatory
mediators, are depleted in hazardous drinking PWH. In humans with alcohol use disorder, probiotic use
attenuates MT and inflammation. Among PWH, probiotic (e.g., butyrate producing bacteria) with prebiotic use
(nutrients for bacterial growth), a combination known as “synbiotic”, favorably alters the GI microbiome within
4-16 weeks. We hypothesize that the alcohol-associated syndemic is associated with GI dysbiosis and
subsequent CVD related biomarkers and that targeted supplementation may restore GI microbiome
homeostasis and reduce inflammation. With a transdisciplinary mentoring panel at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center (VUMC), my career development plan will advance skills in clinical investigation of alcohol
syndemic phenotypes; microbiome structure, function, diversity and immunology; clinical & translational
research; and primary data collection, responsible conduct of research, and leadership. Aim 1 will identify
changes in the GI microbiome among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, Aim 2 will
determine changes in biomarker profiles related to GI permeability, MT, and inflammation among PWH with the
alcohol-associated syndemic over 12 months, and Aim 3 will evaluate the a) feasibility of administering a
butyrate supplement pill followed by a multi-strain synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic) pill and b) treatment effects
on GI microbiome structures and CVD-related biomarkers among PWH with the alcohol-associated syndemic
(n=40). Aims 1 & 2 leverage secondary data from an NIAAA-funded microbiome study of 200 PWH with
existing GI microbiome data, sero-biomarker data, and validated self-reports of alcohol use, smoking, and
depressive symptoms. Aim 3 utilizes the infrastructure of the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research at VUMC,
which has a strong record of supporting Early Career Faculty. This award will facilitate my transition to an
independent investigator with expertise in alcohol/CVD epidemiology, microbiome structure and function, and
clinical trial development among PWH, and will also provide informative data for an R01 application."
10916553,"ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and worldwide. The efficacy of
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with metastatic non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) prompted the
clinical investigation of these agents in the early-stage operable setting. Several theoretical advantages exist
when we administer ICIs before surgery (neoadjuvant) rather than postoperatively (adjuvant), including an
opportunity to address micrometastases early in the course of treatment, and may impart immunologic memory
to prevent tumor recurrence. Indeed, the results from our preclinical models of resectable NSCLC demonstrated
that combined neoadjuvant ICIs resulted in fewer lung metastases, greater immune infiltration of tumors, and
longer overall survival compared with mice treated with monotherapy or adjuvant combined ICIs. Those results
informed the first reported randomized phase 2 study testing neoadjuvant ICI combinations in patients with
resectable NSCLC using major pathologic response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor) as a surrogate endpoint for
clinical efficacy (NEOSTAR, PI: Cascone). Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has been shown to be highly
promising for resectable NSCLC, and is now being tested in one of the phase 3 randomized studies in patients
with operable NSCLC (CheckMate-77T, Lead PI: Cascone). However, a major shortcoming of all of the
neoadjuvant trials, is that no validated biomarker exists that can be used to stratify patients. Consequently, many
of these patients on these trials do not achieve an MPR at surgery, indicating that limited benefit may be gained
from induction ICIs. By delaying surgery in patients who may not benefit, the risks of disease progression and of
eliminating a chance to offer potentially curative surgery upfront occur. The ongoing evaluation of molecular
biomarkers of clinical benefit to ICIs has proved disappointing as evidenced by the significant intertrial variability,
possibly related to intratumor heterogeneity. By contrast, radiologic imaging provides a holistic view of tumor
characteristics and interactions with the adjacent tissue. Built on our promising preliminary data, we propose to
spearhead radiographic and radiogenomics strategies to address this unmet clinical need. We hypothesize that
imaging phenotypes reflect tumor microenvironment, and quantitative imaging phenotyping will shed light on our
understanding of the mechanisms of response to ICIs and yield surrogates of clinical efficacy. We will leverage
the parallel assessment of well-curated data from unique clinical trials and immunocompetent mouse models to
develop new imaging biomarkers and validate their clinical and biological relevance. The strength of this proposal
is our interdisciplinary team with the requisite expertise and ability to treat patients, obtain and analyze high-
quality, longitudinal imaging and biospecimens and rapidly evaluate putative imaging biomarkers for therapeutic
response and clinical outcomes. The advent of imaging biomarkers will: 1) identify those patients most likely to
benefit from neoadjuvant ICIs, 2) maximize the clinical effectiveness, and 3) lead to the development of new
therapies that will improve outcomes for a greater number of patients with resectable NSCLC."
10911326,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goals of this proposal are to uncover how pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear speckles are controlled by
the kinase TAO2, and to determine why TAO2 is required for successful Influenza virus (IAV) replication.
Recent work has identified the understudied protein kinase TAO2 as a host factor essential for splicing and
speckle localization of the IAV M RNA. A pool of TAO2 localizes to nuclear speckles and its loss, by
chemical inhibition or protein depletion, alters nuclear speckle composition, splicing and export of IAV M
RNA, and therefore impairs IAV replication. Inhibition of TAO2 also disrupts splicing of a subset of host
mRNAs, without altering bulk host mRNA. These data uncover a new cellular activity for TAO2 and identify
inhibition of TAO2 as a potential approach for controlling IAV infection. Preliminary data suggest that TAO2
interacts with several splicing factors and other RNA binding proteins. The work outlined in this proposal
seeks a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear activities of TAO2 in human cells and the functional
consequence of these activities for host and viral RNA expression. Specifically, a three-pronged approach
will be taken to: (1) characterize functional TAO2 interaction partners and substrates of phosphorylation
amongst nuclear proteins and determine if IAV infection alters these interactions or if TAO2 interacts
directly with any IAV-encoded proteins; (2) define the role of TAO2 in maintaining the integrity of nuclear
speckles and (3) characterize the global impact of TAO2 on the human splicing machinery and the
consequence of this function for alternative splicing. These goals will be achieved through a combination
of genetic manipulation of cells, biochemistry, mass spectrometry and microscopy. Importantly, the
conclusions obtained from these studies will have implications for general mechanisms of RNA splicing
and nuclear speckle formation and function and will further inform the understanding of host requirements
and vulnerabilities for influenza infection."

IPUMS is a key component of the world’s population health data infrastructure, and it is urgently needed. The
extraordinary growth and redistribution of the human population is reshaping the planet with profound
consequences for population health and health behaviors. Unless we understand the processes of change, we
cannot hope to plan adequately. To meet the challenges created by rapid demographic, economic, and
environmental change, researchers must have open access to the best possible information. Over the past two
decades, IPUMS has created a vast archive of census and survey microdata covering 100 countries over multiple
decades. There has been explosive growth in the number of researchers using the database, the amount of data
they request, and the number of high-impact publications they produce. The massive growth of the database
has created new challenges, however, for data discovery, processing, and management that will require creative
new technical solutions. There is also high demand to further expand, improve, and support the database.
The proposed continuation project will expand the database, enhance the data and metadata, improve key
elements of the infrastructure, and support the research community. Aims 1 and 2 focus on acquiring, preserving,
and processing microdata from Asia and Europe. Aims 3 and 4 will provide infrastructure and outreach that will
benefit all IPUMS microdata efforts. Aim 1: Data acquisition and long-run preservation. The IPUMS International
team will obtain and preserve census and survey microdata from Asia and Europe, including the newest
microdata from household surveys and older data at risk of destruction. Aim 2: Data processing. The project will
expand the IPUMS database by adding data for at least 120 million individuals included in at least 60 censuses
and surveys, focusing on recent data from Asia and Europe. This will require data cleaning, development of
comprehensive machine-processable metadata, spatial data ingest and harmonization, and variable
harmonization. Aim 3: Data, metadata, and infrastructural improvements. This project includes dozens of
improvements to IPUMS data and metadata while adding new capabilities to IPUMS data processing and
dissemination systems. Aim 4: Dissemination and outreach. The project will continue to provide user support,
training, and outreach and will develop new online training capabilities as well as promoting scientific discovery
through surveys, workshops, and online interaction. Most critically, IPUMS will maintain collaborations with the
national statistical agencies who provide the source data. The improved and expanded IPUMS database will
allow investigators to make comparisons across the world over multiple decades of social and economic
upheaval, creating a resource of unprecedented power for understanding ongoing transformations of
demographic behavior and population health."
10685448,"Two cases of virus eradication (the “Berlin patient” and the “London patient”) demonstrated that a cure for HIV
infection is feasible. Meanwhile, the burden of the HIV epidemic, which spreads unabated, as such that for every
person living with HIV (PLWH) that starts antiretroviral therapy (ART), two new people become infected, fuels
the global consensus that a cure for HIV is needed to curb the epidemic. Limitations towards eradication are: (i)
HIV persistence in latently infected cells invisible to immune responses, (ii) inability of a damaged/exhausted
immune system to eliminate HIV-infected cells, and (iii) a state of chronic inflammation (INFL) that persists
despite ART. A better understanding of HIV reservoir seeding, maintenance and reactivation will identify new
strategies for effective virus eradication. We reported that diet may interfere with SIV replication, immune
activation (IA)/INFL, microbiome, basic metabolic features, and disease progression. Diet impacts directly and
indirectly the host metabolism, modulating immune responses and the prognostic of HIV infection. We also
reported a major impact of cell metabolic programing on all the key aspects that drive HIV persistence: (i)
susceptibility to infection of HIV targets, persistence of infected cells, and the establishment of latency. (ii) Quality
and magnitude of the immune responses to HIV. (iii) INFL associated to HIV infection, that contribute to reservoir
maintenance (through continuous proliferation of latently infected cells) and its replenishment in tissues. Finally,
we reported that metabolic alterations of the immune cell programing can preferentially occur in the gut.
Altogether our results studies define an axis (diet→microbiome→nutritional metabolism→immunometabolism)
that can dramatically impact HIV pathogenesis and shape HIV reservoir seeding, maintenance and reactivation,
and which can be fueled by diet. Fasting and dietary interventions are being currently explored, alone or in
combination with metabolic inhibitors in multiple other pathological conditions. We will probe the hypothesis
that administration of a Western diet (WD, i.e., rich in fat and sugars) to rhesus macaques will fuel SIV
reservoir formation, maintenance, and reactivation, through changes in T cells from the gut and related
lymphoid and AdTs. We will assess the overall impact of the WD on host microbiome, metabolism, immune
cell metabolic programing, immune responses, IA/INFL, and we will correlate these parameters with reservoir
seeding, maintenance and reactivation. We will further determine whether gut T cells are responding to either a
change in dietary sugars and lipids, plasma sugar and lipid increases trigerred by the WD, or to known changes
in gut microbiome driven by WD. We will also therapeutically revert the WD-related processes with statins. Since
the key alterations reported in our preliminary studies appeared to be centered by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,
the main site of HIV replication and CD4+ T cell depletion, we will focus on the gut and the adjacent lymphoid
and AdTs. Blood will be used as a systemic comparator to alterations in the GI area. These studies may identify
new strategies to curb the HIV reservoir, reverse the metabolic dysfunctions and control residual INFL."

In tandem with recent improvements in anti-cancer treatment efficacy, cancer treatment-related cardiotoxicity
has become a serious clinical problem. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) is one of the most common
chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicities. Here, combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with
large-scale CRISPR screening, nanotechnology, and engineered 3D cardiac microtissue technology, we will
develop a pipeline which enables us to identify therapeutic targets and potential chemical compounds that
protect cardiomyocytes from DIC. First, we will perform genome-wide perturbation screening in doxorubicin
resistance using CRISPR technology. It will enable us to identify druggable genes that are causative for DIC or
essential for resistance in DIC. Second, we will perform high-throughput screening of chemical compounds
using nanoparticles. It will enable us to identify cardioprotective chemicals and compile a Cardioprotective
Drug Repurposing Library. Third, we will develop a 3D cardiac microtissue platform that can detect
cardioprotective effects of the candidate therapies. The 3D cardiac microtissue will consist of iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, reflective of complex cell-cell interaction and
microenvironment. The goal of this proposal is identify cardioprotective therapy for DIC and to develop
platforms that are expandable to other cancer treatment-related cardiotoxicities."
10839885,"Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently experience insomnia, which is linked with delayed TBI
recovery, more severe functional impairment, and exacerbation of disabling TBI sequelae such as depression,
chronic pain, and fatigue. Current research suggests that TBI can impact numerous systems involved in sleep
regulation, suggesting that insomnia may manifest from various etiologies and that a “one-size-fits-all”
approach to treatment is likely inadequate. As such, it is necessary to differentiate Veterans who may benefit
from standard evidence-based treatments, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia, from those who
may require enhanced treatments targeting specific underlying mechanisms.
 An emerging body of evidence has established a link between circadian rhythm disruption and post-TBI
insomnia. A mismatch between circadian and desired sleep timing (i.e., “circadian misalignment”) is common
following TBI, as evidenced by perturbations of key circadian rhythms involved in sleep regulation (e.g.,
melatonin production), as well as the manifestation of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Importantly,
circadian-driven sleep disturbances require specialized treatments that target circadian rhythms (i.e.,
“chronotherapies”), such as timed sleep windows or enhanced light exposure, as standard treatment
approaches can fail to address or even exacerbate the underlying circadian misalignment. Thus,
circadian misalignment represents a novel and modifiable treatment target and has the potential to
improve functional outcomes in Veterans with TBI and insomnia.
 Detection of circadian misalignment and optimal use of chronotherapies require the ability to measure
circadian phase (i.e., timing of the central circadian clock). However, current sleep medicine in TBI is
hampered by a lack of pragmatic options for measuring circadian phase. This is because laboratory dim
light melatonin onset (DLMO), the gold standard measure of circadian phase, is time and cost prohibitive,
requiring specialized sample (e.g., saliva) collection facilities and placing substantial burden on the patient.
Recently, novel methods of DLMO measurement have been developed that may enhance the accessibility and
practicality of circadian phase assessment, although, as of yet, they have not been used in Veterans with TBI.
The proposed single-arm, longitudinal study seeks to evaluate the feasibility of two methods of
measuring DLMO in the home environment of Veterans with TBI and insomnia: 1) direct measurement
of self-collected salivary melatonin; and 2) indirect estimation of DLMO using activity and light-
exposure data collected through actigraphy. Additionally, this study seeks to explore the relationships
between circadian misalignment, sleep disturbance, and functional impairment in Veterans with TBI.
 The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1) evaluate the feasibility of two methods of home DLMO
measurement (i.e., self-collected salivary melatonin and actigraphy data) in Veterans with TBI and insomnia;
and Aim 2) examine associations between circadian misalignment (i.e., the difference in timing between
DLMO and attempted sleep onset), sleep disturbance, and functional impairment. Veterans with TBI and
insomnia will be asked to wear a wrist-based actigraphy device for one week, which will collect data on light
exposure and sleep-wake states. They will then be asked to self-collect seven hourly saliva samples under dim
light conditions in their own home and mail them to a testing facility using a provided pre-paid shipping label.
Saliva samples will be used to directly measure DLMO and actigraphy data will be used to indirectly estimate
DLMO using established mathematical models of the human circadian pacemaker. Evaluating the feasibility
of home DLMO measurement is a crucial first step for enhancing precision sleep medicine for Veterans
with TBI and insomnia. Findings will inform the development and testing of tailored sleep interventions
for use with this patient population."
10847512,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Meeting targets set to end AIDS as a major public health threat by 2030 requires reaching all populations,
particularly those with the highest burden, such as people who inject drugs (PWID). PWID continue to
experience some of the fast-growing HIV epidemics globally. Injection drug use is increasingly accounting for
new HIV infections in both low- and middle-income countries and countries that once saw notable declines in
HIV incidence among PWID. Even in countries with notable declines in HIV incidence among PWID, such as
the United States, the rise of prescription opioid use has resulted in increased heroin injection, increased
overdose rates, and outbreaks of HIV. Despite decades of investigation into the behavioral drivers of HIV
incidence, accurately predicting who is at the highest risk of becoming infected with HIV remains challenging.
Yet, this information is critical for preventing outbreaks and tailoring interventions. These tools are even more
critical at the final stages of disease control, elimination, or eradication programs which require
disproportionately more effort and resources than in preceding stages to identify those at risk, especially in a
setting of dwindling resources and emerging pandemics. As we rapidly approach the ambitious 2030 targets,
the same will be true of HIV, even more so among hard-to-reach populations such as PWID, and we need
early warning systems to guide a more targeted public health response
We previously demonstrated that PWID accumulate blood-borne nonpathogenic viruses in the plasma before
hepatitis C virus infection. We also have early data showing that sequences of these nonpathogenic viruses
reveal epidemiologic links. This study builds on these findings to explore whether the plasma virome in PWID
can be further used as a bioindicator of HIV risk and whether it can be leveraged to interrupt HIV outbreaks
before they occur. To test this, we utilize a rare set of longitudinal social (injection partner) and spatial (injection
venue) network data along with detailed individual-level risk factors and HIV sequences from a high-incidence
cohort of over 2,500 PWID in New Delhi, India. To date, this cohort has observed over 159 HIV
seroconversions. We plan to characterize the plasma virome using baseline specimens from participants who
later acquired HIV to determine if virome richness independently predicts HIV incidence and to assess the
added value of a bioindicator over established risk prediction tools. Additionally, we plan to sequence
participants comprising complete contact networks and leverage next-generation sequencing approaches that
capture the diversity of nonpathogenic viruses circulating within and between hosts to employ phylogenetic
methods aimed at determining whether plasma virome sequences can accurately infer transmission networks.
By using routinely collected samples, this work could lead to more robust molecular surveillance methods that
can guide public health officials in targeting interventions to prevent HIV outbreaks and focus limited resources
for the greatest impact."
10702081,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY:
Patients who survive an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization will likely experience new or worsened physical,
mental, and/or cognitive impairments (termed Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS)). The most vulnerable to
long-term physical and cognitive impairments are older adults (>60 y) because of pre-existing age-related
physical frailty or cognitive frailty. Both of which increase a survivor’s likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s
diseases and related dementias. However, although advances in critical care treatments have reduced mortality
rates among older adult ICU survivors, roughly 67% suffer PICS. Yet, identification of at-risk older adults during
admittance is likely difficult because of the 1) homogeneity in the clinical presentation of patients with pre-existing
age-related physical frailty and critical illness compared to those suffering from only critical illness and 2) many
patients arrive severely debilitated making administration of physical function or other volitional assessments
difficult. Therefore, it is essential that new biomarkers to guide early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease
monitoring are identified. To this point, tryptophan derivatives, particularly kynurenines and nicotinamide family
(e.g., NAD+), have been shown to mediate the relationship between chronic inflammation and physical
impairment or signal accelerated aging, respectively. However, it remains unknown if similar associations exist
in older adult ICU patients and the prognostic utility of elevated neurotoxic tryptophan metabolites relative to
neuroprotective tryptophan metabolites to predict adverse health outcomes while in the ICU. Thus, to fill this
knowledge gap I have design three studies to explore the associations between tryptophan derivatives,
musculoskeletal health, and cognitive function pre-, intra-, and post-ICU stay. Skills gained during this fellowship
will provide be a better understanding of frailty and muscle-brain crosstalk, via the kynurenine pathway, that
occurs during an ICU stay and how it may influence long-term physical and cognitive health."
10700573,"The overall goal of the proposed exploratory project is to help develop novel approaches to rehabilitating
visually impaired Veterans. While the current rehabilitative approaches can be effective, there is indisputably
much room for improvement. Apropos to which, recent research has provided new insights into how the brain,
healthy and diseased alike, ‘makes up’ for what is impaired in one sensory modality (e.g., vision) by recruiting
compensating information from another sensory modality, e.g., active (or haptic) touch. The proposed bench-
to-bedside translational project seeks to evaluate the feasibility of leveraging these crossmodal research
insights to help develop the next generation of rehabilitative therapies for visually impaired Veterans.
 The research insight most directly relevant to the present project is this: At any given time, there will be
multiple different objects around us. In recruiting haptic information to help compensate for gaps in the visual
information, the brain (healthy or otherwise) must have a way of deciding which haptic object corresponds to
which visual object. It turns out that the brain infers that a given visual object corresponds to a given haptic
object if the two objects meet one or both of the following two ‘crossmodal recruitment criteria’ (CRC): (i) The
brain receives information about the two objects from the same location in the outer world, and/or (ii) It
receives the information from both sources at the same time. We hypothesize that, by appropriately
manipulating the given CRC, it should be possible to ‘coax’ the brain to better recruit the haptic information to
better compensate for vision loss, a proposition supported by our preliminary results.
 Each of the two Specific Aims of the proposed study seeks to characterize the efficacy of one of the above
two CRCs. Each Aim will test the hypothesis that optimal values of the corresponding CRC can help optimize
crossmodal integration for each Veteran in an evidence-based fashion customized for that Veteran.
 To help make the proposed study directly relevant to the healthcare of Veterans, we will carry out the study
procedures in older Veterans (≥50 years) with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the most
common causes of vision loss in Veterans in this age group. As visual and haptic stimuli, we will use the actual
objects that are currently in active use at our VA to rehabilitate Veterans with visual impairments.
 We will use a random controlled trials (RCT) design, whereby Veterans will be randomly assigned to a
Treatment or a Control Group. Patients in either Group will continue all their regular medical treatments
unrelated to the present study, but subjects in the Treatment Group will additionally receive study-related
visual-haptic Rehabilitative Training. All subjects in either Group will also receive periodic, study-related
Outcome Testing consisting of custom-designed object recognition tests, and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to help characterize the underlying neural correlates of rehab-dependent changes, if any. We
will systematically compare the various outcome measures (i) between the Treatment vs. Control Groups, and
(ii) before vs. after the rehabilitation for either Group. As detailed in the Research Plan, we will use the
standard outcome metrics for feasibility studies used by US Government agencies to assess the effectiveness
or lack thereof of the proposed Rehabilitative Training approach proposed in this feasibility study.
The proposed study is highly innovative, in that it represents a novel application of the neuroscientific
principles of optimal visual-haptic crossmodal integration to rehabilitation medicine in general, and to the
rehabilitation of visually impaired Veterans in particular. The successful completion of the proposed study is
also likely to be highly impactful because it will constitute a proof of the principle that visual-haptic
rehabilitative training with CRC manipulation can be an effective tool for rehabilitating Veterans with AMD,
and will help lay the groundwork for future larger-scale studies to develop and standardize the next generation
of rehabilitative therapies for Veterans."
10701783,"Abstract
Nearly one quarter of the 1.1 million individuals living with HIV in the US are women, and there is a
disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minority women in the Southern US. Reproductive age women living
with HIV (WLH) are highly affected by poor HIV outcomes, likely due to structural, psychosocial, and biological
factors. Unfortunately, despite experiencing poor outcomes and facing unique challenges, reproductive age
WLH are grossly underrepresented in HIV research. The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) is a large,
comprehensive, prospective cohort study which began in 1993 and comprises almost 4,000 WLH who undergo
biannual study visits with detailed structured interviews, physical and gynecologic examinations, laboratory
testing, and specimen biobanking. The WIHS has 5 sites located in the South (Atlanta, Birmingham/Jackson,
Chapel Hill, Miami, and Washington DC). This year, the WIHS combined with the Multicenter AIDS Cohort
Study (MACS) of gay and bisexual men, to form the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). The
Women HIV Cohort Study (WHCS) will be conducted in these 5 Southern MWCCS (previous WIHS) sites and
will leverage the MWCCS structure, including access to participants, standardized assessments, specimen
collections, data management, leadership committees, community advisory boards, and scientific working
groups to address the following specific aims. First, we will recruit and retain 2,000 reproductive age WLH
representative of the Southern epidemic into a longitudinal cohort study that will address the effects of HIV and
HIV treatment in this age group. Second, we will use the scientific strength of WIHS to integrate high priority
science in key thematic areas that are highly relevant for reproductive age WLH. We will provide rigorously
collected sociobehavioral, clinical, and outcome data and biological specimens to scientific experts across all
WIHS sites to promote multidisciplinary HIV/AIDS research. Third, we will utilize this cohort to implement
unifying multidisciplinary research that is responsive to the unique health needs of reproductive age WLH. To
do so, we will implement science in the area of depression, a critical mediator of health and HIV treatment
outcomes of particular relevance to reproductive age WLH, and in the area of oral health. Through this
science and the described plan for engagement of scientists across a broad range of relevant disciplines, the
WHCS has the potential to ultimately improve the health of young WLH, optimize the gains of ART, and
contribute to ending HIV across populations in the United States."

10904604,"Project Summary / Abstract - Overall
The central goal of the Cincinnati Rheumatic Disease Resource Center (CRDRC) is to promote studies that
advance the understanding of pediatric rheumatic diseases and lead to new therapies for these diseases. The
Cincinnati Rheumatic Disease Resource Center has two specific aims. Aim 1: Provide resources that will
enhance the scope and breadth of the research community to advance the central focus of understanding
inflammation and biological mechanisms contributing to the development of rheumatic disease in children and
adults. Aim 2: Foster collaborations and interdisciplinary approaches to promote laboratory discoveries and
generate translational research opportunities that lead to important patient-oriented outcomes. The Cincinnati
Rheumatic Disease Resource Center includes an Administrative Core and four Resource Cores:
 · Pediatric Rheumatology Tissue Repository (PRTR) Leader, Grant Schulert, MD, PhD
 · Integrative Cell Phenotyping Core (ICPC). Leader, Sherry Thornton, PhD
 · Functional Genomics Core (FGC). Leader, Leah Kottyan, PhD
 · Bioinformatic and Modeling Core (BAM). Leader, Matthew Weirauch, PhD
Collectively, these resources form a powerful infrastructure that fosters development of precision and predictive
medical approaches based on genomics and disease mechanisms. The CRDRC will support disease-based
research across the continuum of discovery, where laboratory findings generate translational studies that lead
to clinical trials. In addition to advancing knowledge of pediatric rheumatic disease, the goals of the CRDRC
include recruitment of established investigators to bring new expertise to the field, cultivation of collaborations
within the local and national research community, and encouragement of young investigators committed to
pursuing research careers focused on pediatric rheumatic disease. These goals of the CRDRC are particularly
well supported by a Pilot Study Program that includes funding of work within the P30 cores and extends to
institutional cores to broaden impact and support new areas of investigation. The CRDRC also will strengthen
the research community through an enrichment program of local seminars, workshops, and symposia. A highly
accomplished and collaborative community of researchers is already in place with expectations of major growth
through new recruitment. An innovative Visiting Scholars program will aid in the dissemination of innovative
approaches and the enrichment of faculty and trainees who are from groups historically underrepresented in
medical research. Together, these attributes create fertile ground for accomplishing the goals of the CRDRC,
and ultimately to accelerate research to benefit pediatric rheumatic disease patients in their care."
10904605,"Project Summary / Abstract – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core will serve as the executive, coordinating and oversight component of the Cincinnati
Rheumatic Diseases Resource Center (CRDRC). The Admin Core will provide executive, administrative
(including fiscal), and personnel services to the CRDRC, as well as scientific oversight of the resource cores.
This includes coordination of resources within the Research Cores to enhance ongoing studies and promote
new projects. The Administrative Core will monitor progress and evaluate all aspects of the CRDRC’s operations,
including appropriate expenditures by the Resource Cores and Enrichment Program. The Administrative Core
will prepare required progress reports and regulatory documentation. Leah Kottyan, Ph.D., is the proposed
Director of the CRDRC, and Alexi Grom, M.D. is proposed as Associate Director. Dr. Grom will function as
Medical Director of the CRDRC by providing the liaison to the rheumatology clinic and the fellowship training
program. The CRDCC’s chief executive and administrative body will be a four-member Executive Committee,
which consists of the Director, Associate Director, and leaders of each Research Core. An Advisory Committee
will provide advice to the Director and Executive Committee and will include local and external leaders with
expertise to provide meaningful guidance to CRDRC leadership and Research Core directors. Members will
include individuals experienced in core and center administration who are independent of the CRDRC, but who
are part of, and familiar with, the academic setting within which the CRDRC resides or offer experiences of other
comparable academic centers. Members will include individuals who complement the expertise of and utilize the
Research Cores, and local leaders of programs that synergistically interact with the CRDRC. An Enrichment
Program will be offered that includes research seminars, education relevant to technologies of the resource
cores, and strategic planning of research goals. A novel and innovative P&F Program is proposed and will be
managed by the Administrative Core to extend impact of Center resources to a larger number of investigators.
This program will focus on advancing utilization of CRDRC cores or institutional cores to provide access to key
technologies that might otherwise be cost-prohibitive. Projects will be solicited from the research community and
the larger academic health center. A P&F Study Committee will assist in the selection of new P&F Studies and
monitor progress of ongoing P&F Studies. This program will provide a valuable mechanism for advancing new
investigators and new projects in the field of pediatric rheumatology. A Visiting Scholars program will fund travel
grants to bring trainees and faculty underrepresented in medical research to Cincinnati to learn from our
Resource Cores. These grants are intended to provide opportunity and training while expanding the diversity of
future research trainees, physicians, and faculty in the Research Community. In summary, the Administrative
Core will enable the success and create fertile ground for accomplishing the overall goals of the CRDRC."
10831058,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained an ongoing housing crisis across cities and towns, leaving unprecedented
numbers of people homeless and creating poor health conditions in precarious, concentrated homeless
encampments. In Boston, Massachusetts, an October 2021 public health emergency declaration preceded a
January 2022 massive relocation campaign that moved over 200 people from a large street encampment into 5
novel “harm reduction housing” (HRH) programs. The area is known for its proximity to area hospitals, its
open-air drug market, and violence related to drugs and crime. These programs provide housing units with
access to harm reduction supplies like sterile syringes and other safer use materials, naloxone, and low-barrier
medication treatment, and staff provide these services according to policies that champion the principles of
“meeting people where they are”. But the HRH sites differ in ways that may affect resident outcomes, and
uptake of services vary. Data suggest that housing interventions may tragically increase isolation and thus
overdose risk; others claim lives will be saved and life-saving treatments will start because of their improved
access at the HRH sites. An initial case-crossover analysis of those recently relocated echoed a mixture of
positive and negative effects. Lacking clear-cut, scientifically rigorous processes that consider both intended
and unintended consequences of these actions, we propose a rapid, mixed methods study to efficiently examine
the immediate effects of the relocation efforts and the longer-term impacts of living in the novel HRH.
Specifically, this time-sensitive study will collect survey, interview, and drug supply data from the community
of people who are homeless and use drugs in the concentrated area of Boston who have been affected by these
recent actions. The study will help to determine short and long-term impacts of: a) rapid relocation and how
residents successfully navigated it; and b) co-provision of harm reduction services and housing on individual-
level behaviors and local drug supply outcomes. Specific aims are to: Aim 1) Develop a measure of harm
reduction services and policies to inventory their provision and use in HRH sites for studying continuity,
uptake, and evolution of care. Aim 2) Enroll an observational cohort following 100 HRH residents for 12
months to catalogue relocation effects and understand how harm reduction services use changes drug use, HIV
and drug risk behaviors, treatment uptake, and the local drug supply. Data specific to new HRH resident cohort
members will augment our prior case-crossover analysis of relocation impacts. Aim 3) Conduct repeat,
longitudinal one-on-one interviews with 25 cohort members to gain greater insight into the nuances of
relocation and HRH residence, including health and safety impacts, changes in collective efficacy, and gender
considerations. Findings will contribute to harm reduction science and will be directly relevant to jurisdictions
considering HRH, adapting housing contracts to incorporate harm reduction services, and planning public
health-directed mitigation plans for housing relocations or disaster responses."
10900735,"Project Summary/Abstract
The good news is that increasingly, patients who experience an ischemic stroke survive. Unfortunately, survivors
are rarely unscathed — stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. Interventions are limited in
part due to a lack of insight into secondary processes post-stroke. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have demonstrated
therapeutic benefit in stroke recovery. But key questions remain that if answered, could enhance clinical use.
NSCs normally migrate to the lesion, secrete pro-reparative factors, differentiate, and reduce secondary damage.
Central to these benefits is the ability of NSCs to send and respond to specific environmental cues. Our data
show NSC function is influenced by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), a multifunctional
receptor that modulates cell signaling via multiple mechanisms. Despite an expansive role in signal modulation,
the importance of LRP1 in NSC biology is virtually unstudied. We knocked-out LRP1 in adult NSCs and subjected
mice to middle-cerebral artery occlusion. We found LRP1-KO in NSCs ablated migration to ischemic lesions.
We also discovered that functional impairment and lesion size were reduced. This observation is somewhat
paradoxical-physical localization of NSCs to lesions is often considered important to neuroprotective efficacy.
We also found that LRP1-KO ablates expression of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor which is essential for
migration to ischemic lesions. Thus, we seek to better understand how impaired LRP1 expression in NSCs is
neuroprotective, and similarly to understand the mechanisms underlying LRP1 regulation of CXCR4. Our overall
hypothesis is that LRP1 promotes NSC migration toward ischemic lesions through CXCR4 regulation,
yet also limits the endogenous NSC-neuroprotective response. Our data suggest that LRP1 is a major driver
of NSC response to signals. This proposal investigates LRP1, CXCR4, and NSC function in stroke using surgical
models, in vivo, and in vitro approaches. We utilize a Nestin-CreERt2 mouse model to direct knock-out of LRP1
and/or CXCR4 in NSCs and to track these cells with expression of red fluorescent protein. Aim 1 tests the
hypothesis that NSC-mediated neuroprotection is due to loss of LRP1, which promotes recovery
independent of effects on CXCR4 by measuring post-stroke outcomes after rescuing expression of CXCR4 in
mice with LRP1-KO in NSCs, or ablating LRP1 in mice with CXCR4-KO in NSCs. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis
that loss of LRP1 (or CXCR4) is neuroprotective by enhancing post-stroke NSC neuroprotective
response by interrogating the effect on NSC post-stroke response and survival, both in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3
tests the mechanism by which LRP1 regulates CXCR4 expression by rescuing LRP1 with domain-specific
constructs and elucidating the effect on transcription, signaling, trafficking, and degradation of CXCR4. Data
from these studies will define the value of NSC-LRP1 as a therapeutic target, identify discrete mechanisms of
LRP1-mediated neuroprotection, and define the mechanism by which LRP1 regulates CXCR4 expression."
10701222,"Over 79,000 people will develop kidney cancer, also known as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and almost
14,000 patients will die from this disease in the US this year. Risk factors such as tobacco smoking, obesity
and exposure to organic solvents, heavy metals, herbicides, and petrochemicals, all play a major role in
the development of RCC. Members of the military and their families are at risk of developing RCC because
of exposure to these risk factors: 1) Cheap tobacco prices have been identified by enlisted personnel and
Department of Defense health policy experts as promoting a culture of tobacco use in the US Military.
Smoking doubles the risk of RCC in the members of the military; 2) Higher incidence of RCC in men versus
women (2:1 ratio); 3) Incidence of RCC in veterans of Operation Ranch Hand, the unit responsible for
aerially spraying herbicides in Vietnam. 4) Obesity among the non-active duty; 5) Military families are at
risk because of environmental exposures. In terms of treatment, traditional radiation and chemotherapies
are ineffective and ~50% of patients develop metastatic disease, for whom the 5-year survival rate is only
~10%. Such grim statistics point to an urgent need for deeper understanding of the RCC biology and also
for developing better therapeutic strategies. Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common
type of renal cancer, is resistant to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This subtype of kidney
cancer uses aerobic glycolysis to convert glucose to pyruvate and then lactate, a phenomenon known as
the “Warburg effect”. Lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) is the key enzyme in converting pyruvate to lactate
in order to speedily produce ATP. LDHA has Althouwith gh been shown to be an attractive target in ccRCC
therapy, LDHA inhibitors have yet to see meaningful clinical advancement. This is in part due to a lack of
LDH isoform selectivity. We have recently reported that the tumor suppressor FLCN function as an intra-
cellular specific inhibitor of LDHA but not LDHB. Our data has shown that a MAPK signaling pathway is
responsible for FLCN phosphorylation, inactivation and dissociation from LDHA. This is important for the
hyperactivity of LDHA and conversion of pyruvate to lactate. However, the detailed mechanism of this
process in ccRCC remains elusive. Additionally, we have created a cyclic decapeptide derived from the
FLCN which is protected from cellular proteases, but without losing its inhibitory activity towards LDHA.
This peptide readily enters cells, inhibit LDHA and cause apoptosis in ccRCC. The long-term goal of this
project is to improve outcomes for patients with ccRCC by developing therapeutic strategies that targets
LDHA. The overall objective is to determine the signaling networks involved in FLCN inactivation, disas-
sociation and hyperactivity of LDHA in ccRCC. The central hypothesis is that MAPK mediated phosphory-
lation of FLCN leads to its inactivation, disassociation and hyperactivity of LDHA. The rationale of this
proposal is that by dissecting these regulatory networks, we could design a strategy to specifically inhibit
LDHA. Biochemical, biophysical, cell-based assays, and patient derived ccRCC tumor xenograft model as
well and the ccRCC tissue array will be used to test the hypothesis in the following specific aims; Aim 1:
Determine the mechanism of MAPK mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of FLCN in ccRCC. Aim 2:
Determine the mechanism of MAPK activation by pyruvate stress in ccRCC. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of
FLCN mediated inhibition of LDHA in ccRCC patient-derived xenograft model. We expect that data gener-
ated here will determine the molecular mechanism of the tumor suppressor FLCN inactivation and LDHA
hyperactivity and the Warburg effect in ccRCC. We also expect to demonstrate cyclic-FLCN decapeptide
as potent specific inhibitor of LDHA in ccRCC. The outcome of this research will allow us to design new
therapeutic strategies in treating Veterans with kidney cancer and potentially other cancers that experience
the Warburg effect."
10909011,"Project Summary
Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 24 million people worldwide and can lead to
emotional distress, disability, and reduced lifespan. Cognitive dysfunction is the best predictor of patient outcome
in schizophrenia, yet current pharmacological treatments often fail to treat cognitive symptoms such as working
memory deficits. In addition, it is not yet understood how certain biological abnormalities associated with
schizophrenia – for example, decreased cortical expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors – lead
to changes in brain circuit function, especially when these abnormalities progress over the course of the lifespan
and may be affected by in vivo compensatory mechanisms in the brain. My proposed research seeks to
investigate the effects of chronic NMDA receptor loss upon synaptic function and architecture in the prefrontal
cortex, and its potential implications for neural network activity and working memory deficits. Specifically, this
computational psychiatry project will focus on examining functional and structural abnormalities at excitatory-to-
excitatory synapses, which produce the reverberant neural activity that allows information to be retained in
working memory and are particularly vulnerable to disconnection in schizophrenia. I will measure functional
changes in excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic strength using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in prefrontal cortex
pyramidal neurons, and I will examine structural changes in dendritic spine morphology and density in the same
neurons using confocal imaging. I will then leverage insights gained from these electrophysiology and imaging
experiments to build and test predictions regarding stability and synchrony of brain activity in a spiking network
model."

The Biospecimen/Pathology Core (BPC) is the central repository of specimens established to provide support to
the Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) SPORE to aid in the successful execution of the proposed studies. Through
the BPC we will establish a comprehensive resource of tissue specimens, body fluids, and tissue isolates
(DNA/RNA) that will support the SPORE and can be used by extramural investigators to improve our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the onset, development, and progression of head and neck
cancer and improve treatment options to aid the clinician in patient management. The main goals of the BPC
are to procure, characterize, analyze and process, and distribute specimen. The provision of these services
takes advantage of a close working relationship with the existing facilities, infrastructure, and personnel for
biobanking and histology operations of the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Biobanking and
Processing Shared Resource and the University of Colorado Biorepository Core Facility. Specimens are
collected as archival tissue or SPORE trial associated specimens that are obtained under IRB approved
protocols. The BPC will also collect correlative clinical and biologic information that can be included in specimen
distributions. The BPC provides histologic interpretation, performs immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
quantification of IHC by image analysis, prepares biospecimen isolates (RNA, DNA, protein), and provides
molecular analysis on selected specimens required by the SPORE projects. This includes histologic review and
classification by up-to-date published WHO classification systems by the pathologist leadership of the core. The
core designs its activities to meet the needs of each of the SPORE projects as outlined in the proposal. In order
to meet the tissue needs and achieve the goals of the projects, the BPC collects and processes tissues in a
specific manner as determined via collaboration with project investigators. The BPC also collaborates in the
performance of project related studies in which expertise of BPC personnel can benefit study design, data
generation, and data analysis. The BPC will provide the necessary experience and expertise to be able to
develop CLIA certified testing to translate research findings into clinical utility."
10915622,"SUMMARY, Project 1
Treatment resistance remains a challenging problem for high-risk head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients.
Current trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded sub-optimal response rates. This could be due to
TME factors that substantially modulate the immune landscape’s composition, phenotype, and function.
Preferential recruitment of unique immunosuppressive cell subtypes to the tumor bed may play an important role
in contributing to the promotion of tumor growth and progression. The tumor endothelium can act as a selective
barrier that regulates entry, stability, and activation status of immune cells, but the mechanistic underpinnings
remain poorly understood. The EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand EFNB2 define novel molecular
targets. Although they have been studied in cell migration and angiogenesis in early embryonic development,
little has been published on their role in modulating the cancer immune microenvironment. Our preliminary data
show that HNSCCs are enriched in regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), both
of which contribute to resistance after RT. EFNB2 is upregulated on tumor vasculature after RT whereas EphB4
is expressed on Tregs and TAMs, and among all immune cells, Tregs and TAMs are most sensitive to either
pharmacologic inhibition with TNYL-RAW or genetic knockdown of endothelial EFNB2 in the context of RT. We
therefore hypothesize that RT upregulates EFNB2 on tumor vascular endothelial cells, which acts
preferentially to recruit EphB4 expressing Tregs and TAMs. Blockade of EphB4-EFNB2 signaling at the
tumor endothelial barrier will hinder Tregs’ and TAMs’ ability to infiltrate and promote cancer cell survival
or suppress Teff function. In Aim1, we will analyze the mechanistic outcome of the interaction between immune
cell EphB4 and endothelial EFNB2 on immune trans-endothelial trafficking, survival, polarization, and
differentiation of immune cells as well as vascular normalization of endothelial cells in response to RT. We will
use pharmacological inhibitors as well as GEMMs with EFNB2 deletion on endothelial cells or EphB4 deletion
on Tregs or TAMs. Aim 2 will study the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by the interaction between
endothelial EFNB2 and EphB4-expressing immune cells on immune cell processes in response to RT using
endothelial-immune cells co-culture assays. Targeted inhibition of STAT3, AKT, and Erk pathway will be done
with pharmacological inhibitors based on our preliminary data. Aim 3 will use tissue from a human clinical trial
with sEphB4-HSA (an inhibitor currently in Phase I and II trials) before and after drug alone or drug and
chemoradiation alone. This will serve to identify the molecular mediators that drive the anti-tumor immune
response to this therapy. These studies will also collectively elucidate the molecular and cellular parameters of
EphB4-EFNB2 inhibitors and will allow for the identification of potential predictive markers for this using EphB4-
EFNB2 inhibitors."
10915627,"SUMMARY, Project 2
Radiation therapy (RT) is commonly used for locally recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCCs), yet no standard concomitant systemic therapy exists, and RT resistance rates are high. Antibodies
against programmed death-1 (PD-1) are FDA approved for treating relapsed/recurrent HNSCCs, but the
response rate is low. RT induces anti-tumor immunity by causing DNA damage and tumor cell killing that release
neoantigens to trigger an “in situ tumor vaccine” and activation of STING (stimulator of IFN genes) for local and
systemic immune activation. Conversely, RT also induces transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), an immune
suppressor, and PD-L1, a ligand of PD-1. These RT effects make dual TGFβ/PD-L1 inhibition a rational
combination being tested in this project. We have reported that TGFβ1 is elevated in >60% of tobacco-associated
HNSCCs. TGFβ1-mediated DNA repair contributes to RT resistance. TGFβ1 also contributes to RT-induced
toxicity, e.g., oral mucositis and fibrosis. Using our mouse HNSCC models, we found that TGFβ/PD-L1 dual
inhibition eradicated SCCs better than anti-PD-L1 alone in tumors with high TGFβ1 levels and high numbers of
PD-L1+/CD11b+ cells. We also found that TGFβ inhibition reduced metastases in athymic mice correlated with
reduced CD11b+ myeloid cells. We hypothesize that in advanced HNSCCs, TGFβ/PD-L1 dual inhibition
enhances RT-induced in situ vaccination, reverses immune suppression, and overcome RT resistance
via T cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We will test this hypothesis with experimental
therapeutics, mechanistic studies and analyses of HNSCC patient specimens. Aim 1 will determine if TGFβ/PD-
L1 dual inhibition enhances RT-induced in situ vaccination and systemic immune activation in oral SCC mouse
models. Experimental therapeutics of RT plus TGFβ/PD-L1 dual inhibition will be performed using mouse SCC
lines transplanted orthotopically to syngeneic mice, and T-cell dependent anti-tumor mechanisms will be
analyzed at the cellular and molecular levels. Aim 2 will determine how RT regimens in combination with
TGFβ/PD-L1 inhibition target tumor epithelial death and myeloid cells in mouse and human HNSCC models. T
cell-independent therapeutic benefit of RT in combination with TGFβ/PD-L1 inhibition will be analyzed. Aim 3
will conduct a Phase Ib trial for RT with M7824 (TGFβ/PD-L1 bidirectional inhibitor) in locally recurrent and
oligometastatic HNSCC patients and identify cellular and molecular markers as therapeutic targets. By
performing the proposed studies, we aim to bring a therapeutic intervention in real time to simultaneously
enhance immunotherapy and reduce RT resistance in HNSCC patients with poor prognosis. Additionally,
identifying predictive markers to the proposed treatment will lead to a true biomarker-driven Phase II trial with

GTN will be critical for the success of this network. The infrastructure, expertise, and experience of the
individuals at Mayo Clinic with national coordination of translational and clinical neuro-oncology research is
extensive, making this group well-positioned to function as an outstanding NCC for the GTN. The leadership of
this proposed NCC bring with them complementary and deep experience and background across these key
aims and have worked extensively with multi-institutional trials, consortia, and networks as well as cooperative
groups in research leadership, trial coordination and implementation, data structures, and importantly
development of SOPs and guidance for newly formed collaborative research networks across multiple
institutions. Beyond the experience and expertise, the Mayo Clinic NCC also leverages institutional
infrastructure and resources to adapt and evolve as the GTN develops and grows through the expected and
necessary collaborations across all U19 centers and project leaders."

services for biostatistics, informatics, bioinformatics, and other data science related analyses. The DSC staff is
comprised of five Ph.D. and one Master’s level researchers who collectively offer substantial expertise in clinical
trial design and analysis; statistical genetics, multi-omics data analysis; software development; predictive
modeling; and cancer-focused bioinformatics. The core includes a comprehensive team of biostatisticians,
bioinformaticians, and an epidemiologist, that form a hub of researchers with the common denominator of being
engaged in HNC research through exisiting collaborations. The DSC has the overarching objective to build a
community of practice related to HNC data science. All staff are operationally managed and overseen by the
DSC Director, Dexiang Gao Ph.D, and like all faculty in the CO HNC SPORE the DSC faculty are members of
the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC), specifically the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics shared
resource (BBSR). The BBSR has a long-standing history of collaboration with the Head and Neck research team
over the past 10 years. Faculty biostatisticians and bioinformaticians are engaged in the development of novel
methods and tools that enhance the HNC SPORE. Since 2015, faculty within the DSC published ~20 peer-
reviewed manuscripts (with an additional 5 in preparation) and collaborated on 9 peer-reviewed extramural R01
grants with HNC SPORE investigators, 4 of which are active awards. By harnessing these established
collaborations, the DSC can effectively and efficiently support CO HNC SPORE projects. Integrating personnel
within a Core to support all SPORE programs will maximize available resources to increase the DSC’s scientific
impact. Specifically, the DSC will provide assistance with research hypotheses formulation, clinical trial designs,
sample size determination, analytical and database design, data collection, analyses, management and storage.
This support will continue through management and coordination of accumulating research and clinical data
analyses, assistance with manuscript preparation and clinical trial reports in relation to key quantitative findings
and rigorous scientific conclusions. Thus, the DSC will play a critical role in clinical trials, as well as basic science
and translational studies."
10702078,"Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) affects 4-9% of the general population and up to 60 % of the Veteran
population. There is also a high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in patients with subacute and chronic
spinal cord injury (SCI), and the frequency of SCI is approximately 3 times greater in the Veteran population.
Close to 90 % of individuals with cervical SCI demonstrate central sleep apnea (CSA). The presence of CSA is
often accompanied by cardiovascular disease and hypertension. A common underlying mechanism could be
responsible for this coupling. An intriguing possibility is that reductions in central nervous system serotonin,
and/or modifications in serotonin receptor sub-types, that might underlie mental health disorders (e.g. post-
traumatic stress disorder), or be altered in response to SCI, could be responsible for the coupling of central sleep
apnea and heart failure. Thus, our general hypothesis is that depletion of serotonin, induced either genetically
or because of SCI, causes increases in the severity of CSA (i.e. frequency and duration of events). This increase
is coupled to increased sympathetic outflow and ultimately heart failure that manifests with age. To test this
general hypothesis, we will explore in Aim 1a if SCI in young and elderly tryptophan hydroxylase 2 wild type
(TPH2+/+) and knock-out (TPH2-/-) mice leads to more frequent and prolonged apneic events coupled to reduced
arousal and chemoreflex responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Aim 1b will explore if modifications in central
nervous system serotonin or its receptor sub-types induced genetically or via spinal cord injury also leads to
increased sympathetic outflow and left ventricular hypertrophy with conserved ejection fraction in young male
mice. We propose that with age these modifications will ultimately lead to heart failure characterized by a reduced
ejection fraction. Lastly, we will determine if treatment with a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (i.e.
paroxetine) will lead to reductions in the number and duration of apneic events along with reductions in lumbar
sympathetic nerve activity and left ventricular hypertrophy coupled to an increase in ejection fraction.The findings
from this proposal will be a significant step toward determining if modulation of serotonin in the central nervous
system is an important mechanistic link between CSA and heart failure in SCI Veterans. The findings will also
provide the rationale to therapeutically modulate serotonin levels to mitigate centrally modulated apneic events
and cardiac dysfunction in intact or SCI Veterans."
10911262,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many groups are investigating why some lung cancer patients respond well to radio- and immuno-therapies and
some do not. One variable is tumor hypoxia, and many groups have shown it can significantly inhibit the
effectiveness to these therapeutic modalities. Clinical studies have identified hypoxia as an independent
prognostic indicator of poor patient outcomes, but even though this connection has been known for decades, no
FDA-approved intervention exists to clinically overcome hypoxia. Some investigators have tried to deliver more
oxygen to the tumor, but this approach remains constrained due to the poorly formed tumor vasculature. We
have taken an innovative approach and asked if we can reduce demand for, rather than increase supply of,
oxygen to reduce hypoxia. We have found that the FDA-approved vasorelaxant papaverine (PPV) has an off-
target ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex 1, and reduce oxygen consumption rapidly, in low micromolar
concentrations in every cell line tested in vitro. We have also shown that PPV can enhance the effectiveness of
radiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical models of lung and other cancers, without
sensitizing well-oxygenated normal tissue. Reducing hypoxia reverses immune privilege, decreases terminally-
exhausted T cells, and increases progenitors that are responsive to PD-1 blockade. We have more recently
developed new derivatives of PPV that have lost their vasorelaxant capability and increased their duration of
action so that they can be improved immuno-sensitizers. We now propose to test the hypothesis that PPV can
effectively enhance the radio- and immuno-therapeutic treatment of preclinical models of lung cancer, and that
it is feasible to add PPV to standard of care therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have
examined TCGA databases and found that lung cancer driver mutations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway lead to
high levels of mitochondrial gene expression that can cause elevated oxygen metabolism contributing to hypoxia.
In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of oncogenic NRF2 activation human and murine cells and model tumors
to determine the dependence of these cells on mitochondrial function, how increased oxygen metabolism
contributes to tumor hypoxia, and if therapy-refractory tumors are sensitized by PPV or its derivatives. In Aim 2,
we will examine the effect of tumor hypoxia on the migration and activation of T-cells in model tumors and how
the immune infiltrate changes after reduction of hypoxia with PPV or its derivatives. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
perform a phase 1 clinical trial to determine if the addition of PPV is feasible for patients receiving standard of
care chemoradiation followed by immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC. We will look for effectiveness in changing
tumor oxygenation using paired blood level oxygen determination (BOLD) MRIs, and for changes in immune
populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These studies will let us know if, and how, to use PPV or its
novel derivatives in future clinical trials for the treatment of NSCLC."
10901975,"Project Summary/Abstract
Driven by new and emerging technologies for data acquisition, integrative genomic studies are revolutionizing
the way we approach the study of cancer and charting the way to novel treatment regimens. They require the
high-throughput generation and analysis of multiple and often complex types of genomic data. To address this
challenge, and in active collaboration with end users, we developed, and released in 2008, a broadly applicable
Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). IGV is an interactive, high-performance, user-friendly tool launched millions
of times a year by investigators and clinicians worldwide. The goal of this project is to ensure that IGV continues
to track and respond to advances in genomics technology and changing user needs, and maintains its high level
of utility for the cancer research community. We will accomplish this through our three specific aims.
Aim 1. Evolve IGV to keep pace with the needs of the cancer genomics community. We will continue to
evolve IGV to leverage recent and future advances in genomics technologies and methods that are key to moving
cancer research and treatment forward. We will add new visualizations and features to better enable
interpretation and validation of complex variants from both short and long read data. Through collaborations with
other projects we will add new capabilities to better assess and interpret single nucleotide and structural variants.
Responding to IGV’s increased use for review of variants in patient tumors, we will enhance support for this task.
Aim 2. Maintain IGV to ensure continued high levels of utility, usability, and reliability. We will continue to
provide frequent software releases to address feature requests, bug reports, and other suggestions from IGV’s
community of both users and developers. Based on community input, we will review the IGV user interface to
improve usability. We will address the challenges and opportunities presented by the evolving computing and
software technology environment. We will continue to maintain the code base and downloadable installers and
update them for new releases of Java, JavaScript, external libraries, browsers, and operating systems.
Aim 3. Support the IGV user and open-source developer communities. We will continue to provide a high
level of support including rapid responses to help requests; in-depth documentation on software use; short videos
to walk users through tasks with high utility; training materials and exercises. For our vibrant, open-source
developer community that contributes to the IGV code base and uses IGV in their own applications or resources,
support includes: documentation and code examples for integrating and extending IGV; guidance on new
development through our GitHub forums; prompt review of contributions; and acknowledgement of their work.
We have extensive software engineering experience, developing and distributing IGV and other software tools
used by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers and clinicians worldwide. IGV’s success, user-driven
development approach, collaborative tradition, and flexible architecture make us well poised to accomplish our
aims to further transform data visualization and accelerate the pace of biomedical discovery."
10863907,"The aims of this project are to develop new technologies to identify and track sleep and wake
abnormalities present in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as to test a sleep enhancement
technology for applications in AD animal research. Signal Solutions, LLC, has previously developed and
commercialized a piezoelectric based system for noninvasive, high-throughput sleep and wake monitoring of
rodents. Automated scoring of sleep and wake allows for simultaneous recordings of many animals over longer
periods, with little burden on the researcher, rivalling EEG/EMG methods that are more complicated and
expensive to perform.
 Behavioral changes in sleep and wake can precede memory loss in the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Clinical studies suggest sleep disturbances are exhibited in a high percentage of AD patients.
Animal models of AD also display sleep disturbances and some models show changes in wake behaviors
before the molecular hallmarks and memory problems appear, as clearly occurs in human AD. In the treatment
of AD, a potential therapeutic target is preventing the aggregation of pathogenic forms of amyloid-beta (A-beta)
and tau. Waste clearance in the brain has been shown to be increased with increased sleep, including
clearance of A-beta. Recently, non-pharmacological approaches using mechanical devices for rocking have
shown promise for sleep enhancement, which could be applied to AD research.
 The specific aims of this project are to 1) Develop advanced sleep/wake tracking technology: Add a
new multipoint touch sensor to our current piezoelectric technology that together will identify specific behaviors
associated with AD progression, tested with AD mouse model 3xTg. 2) Develop Sleep Enhancement
Technology: Modify our current MouseQwake sleep-disruption system for mechanical sleep-enhancement,
with companion sleep and wake tracking capabilities.
Anticipated Outcomes: The envisioned product is a home cage sensor and software that will allow
researchers to accurately measure changes in sleep and wake during long-term AD disease progression, as
well as track subtle changes in behavior in AD model mice. This system will minimize the amount of work, time
testing behaviors, and time for analyzing the videos or electrophysiology that is currently a major bottleneck.
An expanded MouseQwake system will provide a tool for sleep manipulation of both sleep enhancement and
disruption as well as simultaneous sleep/wake and behavioral recording. If successful, a Phase II investigation
will involve large scale studies of multiple AD rodent models, and continue iterative improvements to both
hardware and software developed in phase I."
10760251,"Abstract:
Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 15% of American adults and current treatment protocols are often guided
by limited and archaic diagnostics. Not all types of sensorineural hearing loss are identical in physiology and a
major priority of current auditory research is to innovate in the space of precision auditory diagnostics and
treatments. Understanding how specific patterns of damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve variably impair the
perception of different sound features is critical to improve treatments for hearing-impaired individuals. The
history of auditory research has led to considerable insight as to how anatomic components of the auditory
periphery, namely inner hair cells (IHCs), outer hair cells (OHCs), and the cochlear synapse function together to
transduce, amplify, and code simple sounds. However, there exists considerable gaps in our knowledge of how
these peripheral components are responsible for maintaining the fidelity of more complex auditory phenomena
and perception. Pitch, the perceived “highness” or “lowness” of a given sound, is an example of a complex
psychoacoustic phenomenon. Pitch cues are used to listen to and compose music and to process vowels, identify
talkers, and convey emotion. Without intact pitch perception, conversation becomes emotionless, a symphony
becomes a cacophony. While pitch has been extensively studied perceptually, our knowledge of the underlying
neurophysiology of pitch remains mostly hypothetical. Three categories of pitch theories attempt to explain pitch
coding in terms of the tonotopic organization of our auditory system (place), the temporal information present in
neural firing patterns (time), or a combination of these (place-time). We plan to assess these theories in the
context of cochlear pathologies that are expected to differentially alter place and timing cues, hence developing
a more comprehensive understanding of pitch. Based on the literature, our central hypothesis is that deficits in
time and place coding both affect the neural coding and perception of pitch, but with distorted place coding
playing a stronger role. We will test this hypothesis by using animal models of OHC, IHC, cochlear synapse
damage, and Distorted Tonotopy to investigate SNHL effects on pitch-related electrophysiology (Aim 1). OHC
damage primarily disrupts place cues, while IHC and cochlear synapse damage alter timing cues. We will then
compare this animal electrophysiology to identical measures in humans with normal and impaired hearing,
evaluating the implications on behavioral pitch discrimination (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop four statistical
models to identify how variations in pitch coding and perception are predicted by non-invasive assays of hearing
loss and profiles of SNHL (Aim 3). This cross-species approach moves the field forward by testing well-
established pitch theories in the context of SNHL and by opening doors to better identifying the functional
consequences of individual variations in hearing ability. Overall, the cross-species design of the proposed work
will develop my potential as a physician-scientist, strengthening my ability to design translational experiments
that use ideal laboratory models of neurological disorders to predict clinically relevant outcomes."
10865070,"SUMMARY
New variants, especially in non-coding regions, are expected to be discovered through the ongoing AD
Sequencing Project (ADSP). This proposal will investigate circular RNAs (circRNAs) and RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) that regulate or are regulated by these circRNAs. Recent genomic studies have discovered thousands
of circRNAs produced from both protein-coding genes and non-coding regions of the genome via a process
known as back-splicing. CircRNAs are more enriched in neuronal tissues and are often derived from genes
specific for neuronal and synaptic function. The discovery of these circRNAs demands a coordinated
investigation of RBPs that interact with the circRNAs. Mutations in and dysfunction of RBPs are known to be
major mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology in frontotemporal dementia, ALS and AD. However, the
contributions of the circRNA:RBP network to these disease mechanisms are largely unknown. The novel
biology of circRNAs opens an entirely new window into mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ADRD. CircRNAs
could contribute to neurodegeneration by acting as sponges that sequester miRNA/RBPs away from normal
mRNA targets, altering splicing or expression. RBPs also regulate circRNA production by binding to the
flanking intronic sequences of circRNAs which contain many conserved binding sites of splicing factors/RBPs.
Thus, sequestration of RBPs in protein aggregates could cause dysfunctional regulation of circRNAs. The
history of genomics indicate that discovery of each new nucleotide species expands our understanding of
disease mechanisms. The discovery of circRNA presents a major unexplored avenue of RNA metabolism that
demands investigation. We hypothesize that changes in the levels of circRNAs contributes to the
pathophysiology of ADRD, and that discovery of key circRNAs or circRNA-RBP interactions in aging
human brains could uncover novel biomarkers, disease mechanisms or therapeutic targets. In this
proposal, by leveraging large public and our own RNA-seq data (rRNA-depleted), we will apply several
methods to detect and characterize AD-related circRNAs from multiple human brain regions, and integrate
them with ADSP genetic findings (Aim 1). In Aim 2, aside from discovering AD-related RBPs from human brain
RNA-seq, proteomics and ADSP WES/WGS data, we will leverage the ENCODE CLIP-seq data for RBP
binding to identify putative RBP-circRNA interactions with AD, i.e. AD-related functional RNA elements. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will select the top 10% of the circRNAs (~200) and RBPs (~150) for further high-throughput
functional evaluation with a novel, powerful 3D human organoid model of ADRD, termed AstAD that exhibits
the full range of tau pathology and neurodegeneration. We anticipate that our integrative analyses of ADSP
genetics, circRNA, mRNA, RBP and the high-throughput AstAD functional screen readouts can help generate
testable hypothesis for future molecular mechanisms experimental design."
10864942,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly populations. The development of
effective treatments for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder has been hindered by our lack of
understanding of the disease. AD is classically characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles,
and brain-wide neuroinflammation which ultimately result in synaptic loss, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive
impairments. With our incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these pathological
hallmarks, we must focus on understanding the different aspects of disease pathology to successfully create
therapies treating AD. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated microglia, the tissue-resident
macrophages of the brain, as mediators of disease pathogenesis. Microglia actively maintain tissue homeostasis
in the healthy brain including the regulation of lattice-like extracellular matrix (ECM) structures called
perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs enwrap the soma and proximal synapses of different neuronal subsets and aid
in learning/memory consolidation. While PNNs are naturally lost with age in wild-type (WT) mice, this loss is
exacerbated in AD. Interestingly, when microglia are eliminated in the AD transgenic 5xFAD mouse model, 1)
plaques fail to form and 2) PNN loss is prevented, altogether suggesting PNNs play a protective role. However,
the consequences of PNN loss in AD remain unknown. To that end, we have developed two approaches to
ablate PNN structures both before and after the onset of plaque deposition in order to determine their role in
plaque formation, synaptic loss, and neuronal loss. In this proposal, I will determine the impact of PNNs in AD
pathology by pursuing two important questions: 1) does the loss of these ECM structures facilitate plaque
formation and 2) does PNN loss make neurons more susceptible to damage? Collectively, this proposal will
elucidate the role of PNNs in AD – before and after the onset of plaque pathology – by exploring how their
experimental ablation will affect plaque deposition, synaptic loss, and neuronal loss. Establishing whether PNNs
can prevent plaque deposition as well as determining whether PNN loss in AD renders neurons more susceptible
to damage is highly relevant and could lead to new therapeutic avenues that target genes/ proteins involved in
PNN synthesis and degradation."
10898279,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, X-linked recessive disorder with no known cure that afflicts 1
in 5,000 newborn males. Patients carry a mutation in the dystrophin (DMD) gene, resulting in aberrant or absent
expression of the dystrophin protein. Affected individuals experience progressive wasting of skeletal muscles
and cardiac dysfunction leading to loss of ambulation and premature death, primarily due to cardiac or respiratory
failure. Only palliative treatments are available, although gene therapy approaches for DMD have been
effectively applied in dystrophic animal models by either directly targeting a class of mutations (as with exon
skipping or gene editing) or by delivering a synthetic version of the dystrophin gene. The lack of scalable, human-
based pre-clinical screening models is a significant roadblock to developing new therapies for these patients.
Simple single molecule assays can be readily scaled, but lack the complexity needed to model muscle
contraction which relies on a symphony of many biological systems working in concert to produce movement. At
the other end of the spectrum, animal (particularly mouse) models have generated much that is known about the
disease, but they are costly, slow, and in notable instances have given false positives for new treatments that
failed to translate to humans. In this FastTrack SBIR proposal, Curi Bio and its partners will develop a novel
preclinical screening platform for DMD that directly measures the contraction of stem cell-derived muscle tissue
constructs from both human and murine cells. Because the contractility of tissue constructs is directly measured,
therapies can be tested in the complex context of the mosaic of phenotypes that constitute muscle contraction.
Further, the use of both murine and human cells will allow direct comparison of results to understand species-
specific biology as well as to translate past results from animal models. Successful completion of this proposal
will validate the platform’s ability to model contractile dysfunction in the dish, and to measure the degree of
recovery after application of a novel therapeutic strategy that has been shown to restore the expression of healthy
dystrophin in patient cells. The company will also leverage this platform by measuring the therapeutic effect of a
revolutionary adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy that will be superior in both safety and efficacy
compared to current approaches. The deliverables of this project will greatly improve the field’s ability to
preclinically test novel therapeutics and will speed to market new lifesaving drugs for devastating diseases."

The Development and Evaluation of Portable Compendium of Psychophysical and Physiological Tests for
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is a project to develop an inexpensive, user-friendly,
digital chemosensory-sensorimotor acquisition and processing device, with cross-cultural validity for home or
office use for automated (a) staging of severity of age-related cognitive decline, (b) prognostication of people
with subjective cognitive impairment at risk for progressive neurodegenerative diseases, and (c) remote
surveillance of trajectory in motor and chemosensory markers of ADRD progression in elderly populations.
Given that some decline in cognition is expected with advancing age, it is very challenging for elderly people to
determine if their cognitive challenges are normal for age, or pathological. Similarly, our stakeholder survey of
physicians who treat geriatric populations revealed that <10% of these physicians expressed self-efficacy in
identifying early pathological cognitive decline in elderly patients complaining of subjective memory concerns,
whereas more than 95% feel comfortable with diagnosing moderate or severe dementia. This is problematic,
because, following onset of defining symptoms of dementia, ADRD progresses relentlessly, and no
intervention has proven to reverse, or even slow the progression of dementia; whereas early identification may
offer a more realistic opportunity for disease-modifying interventions to slow AD progression. Science has
shown that AD presents early (even preclinically) with motor and sensory impairments, particularly olfactory
dysfunctions. Therefore, an alternative approach to classification and prognostication of AD is to use precise
quantitative measurements of sensory and/or motor dysfunctions. Indeed, psychophysical tasks of olfaction,
such as odor identification tasks, have been found to predict AD development in normal aging, and to predict
AD progression in mild cognitive impairments (MCI). But these olfactory cognitive tasks have not been adopted
in practice or research for AD classification because of low specificity, challenges with interpretation,
susceptibility to education, culture, and language biases, and absence of defined cut-off scores for classifying
normal cognitive aging from MCI, or for prediction of MCIs who would soon develop dementia. Evon Medics, a
small business specializing in olfactory neurostimulation, tested various olfactory tasks in their prototype – the
Evon Medics Rapid Smell Test (EMRAST) – and determined that an olfactory sensorimotor impairment marked
by loss of reflex reduction of sniff magnitudes to intense or unpleasant odorants, differentiated progressive MCI
from normal cognitive aging, and quantitatively predicted MCI subjects that transitioned to dementia over 6-
month follow-up. The goal of this SBIR Fast-Track proposal is to refine and evaluate composite scores derived
from an extended portable version of EMRAST with psychophysical and physiological tasks of olfaction and
measures of motor and sensorimotor functions, for prediction of ADRD among elderly people with memory
concerns, prognostication of incipient dementia among people with MCI, and for remote monitoring of ADRD,
which is a reimbursable service and a powerful incentive for adoption by health providers. The remote
monitoring component also alleviates anxieties of family members of elderly persons who live independently.
In the Phase I, we will (1) integrate all physiological sensors for olfactory sensorimotor and finger movements
into the EMRAST prototype; (2) conduct a pilot testing on normal aging, MCI and early dementia patient
populations for development of classification and prediction functions and algorithms; (3) integrate the Evon
Medics HIPAA-compliant mobile App and cloud infrastructure into the product to enable seamless
communication of data from the device to the user’s physician for remote monitoring of AD and modifiable
health determinants of AD; and (4) examine fidelity of use and user/provider satisfaction. In Phase II, we will
conduct large clinical validation testing to fine-tune the classification algorithms derived from Phase I. This will
lead to automated interpretation, which the physicians desire. We will also advance regulatory pathway to
clinical practice and establish the cost-effectiveness of use of EMRAST-Extended for remote monitoring of
ADRD and associated comorbidities. Project success will be enhanced through strong collaborations between
Evon Medics, Howard University and Johns Hopkins University investigators and AD stakeholders. The
investigative team has significant experience in product and business development, ADRD clinical research,
public health, and development and evaluation of olfactory devices. Completion of grant activities will lead to
an optimized product to allow (1) clinical screening for early detection and prognostication of progressive
neurodegenerative disease in people presenting with subjective cognitive complaints or age-associated
memory complaints, (2) prediction of incipient dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment, and (3) broad
international use as a language- and culture-independent tool for ADRD diagnosis and research."

Air pollution, particularly particulate matter <2.5µm (PM2.5), penetrates into lung passageways and enters the
bloodstream, causing respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular damage. Recent studies suggest that
oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and inflammation to be the central mechanisms by which PM2.5 induced damage.
However, there are still many knowledge gaps of the intricate signal pathways and mechanisms that are involved
in the cellular responses to PM2.5. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of the PM2.5-induced
structural and functional remodeling in human cardiac cells will allow us to develop novel medical approaches
that could prevent or reduce air pollution-related cardiovascular risks. Moreover, by utilizing human samples of
different race, ethnicity, and gender, this study will reveal how genetic variations affect the toxicity response to
PM2.5, further facilitating personalized medicine. In this project, we will use human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) and 3-D engineered heart tissues (EHTs) that provide innovative opportunities for disease modeling and
drug discovery. Therefore, our specific aims are to: Aim 1. establish EHT models for the study of air pollution-
related cardiovascular risks from a racially diverse group of individuals; Aim 2. elucidate the pathological
remodelling mechanisms of EHT in response to PM2.5 treatment with functional and omics analysis; and Aim 3.
perform drug testing on EHTs and validate the effects of FDA approved drugs in prevention of air pollution-related
cardiovascular risks."
10699539,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disease of motor neurons. There is no effective
treatment for ALS and the determinants of disease onset and progression remain poorly understood. ALS
affects veterans disproportionately over the civilian population, and thus is a major research priority for the VA.
There are two major gaps of knowledge in ALS that this application will address: (1) The pathogenic role of the
peripheral neuromusuclar system in the initiation of disease and progression, and (2) The lack of plasma
biomarkers that can aid the clinician in diagnosis, progression rate, and prognosis.
 Skeletal muscle and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are the “end organs” of motor neurons and have
been a growing focus as important contributors to ALS pathogenesis and disease progression, but there
remains a large knowledge gap. The earliest pathological findings in ALS are in skeletal muscle including
mitochondrial dysfunction, retraction of motor neuron termini and degeneration of the neuromuscular junction.
In normal states, there is ongoing cross-talk between muscle fibers and motor neurons that maintain the health
of each, including the release of growth factors by muscle such as NT-4, BMP4 and IGF1. In ALS, this
homeostasis is disrupted by the degenerative process coupled with the infiltration of immune cells into the
neuromuscular system. Using skeletal muscle of ALS patients, we have characterized a molecular network of
biomarkers that is induced and activated in the earliest preclinical stages of disease and progressively
increases with disease progression. This network centers around elements of the TGFβ/BMP/Smad signaling
axis and prominently includes Smad8, TGF-β1, 2, 3 and BMP4. In parallel with this axis is a dysregulated
microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome which we characterized by miRNA sequencing of human ALS skeletal
muscle from patient biopsies. In our preliminary studies, we have discovered that Smad8 signaling regulates
many of the components of this aberrant miRNA/mRNA network and that the predicted effect, based on in
silico analysis, would be impairiment of muscle homeostasis, muscle regeneration, NMJ reinnervation and
promotion of neuromuscular inflammation. In other work, we have shown that ALS patients have extensive
infiltration of myeloid cells, including mast cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, in muscle and peripheral nerve
that accelerate disease progression. This background and preliminary data form the basis of our overarching
hypothesis that BMP/TGFβ/Smad signaling in ALS muscle promotes disease progression through a
dysregulated miRNA transcriptome which is sustained by a paracrine loop with infiltrating immune cells.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that components of this molecular network reflect disease progression and thus
may serve as plasma biomarkers that can be used in the clinic to monitor disease progression. We propose 3
aims: (1) Characterize the link between activated Smad8 and dysregulated miRNAs in ALS muscle, (2) Assess
the impact of muscle-based Smad8 signaling on the clinicopathological phenotype of ALS using a muscle-
specific knockout of Smad8, and (3) Assess components of the dysregulated BMP/TGFβ/Smad8 pathway for
their potential as clinical biomarkers of disease activity. Signficance: This bedside-to-bench proposal
represents a novel direction with compelling translational implications. It vertically integrates basic and clinical
approaches that will provide insight into the contribution of the peripheral neuromuscular system to ALS
disease progression."
10911813,"Abstract:
The number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) continues to increase in the United States.
Alcohol consumption is a significant barrier to both achieving the goal of ending the HIV
epidemic and preventing comorbidities among PLWH, as it contributes to both HIV transmission
and HIV-related complications. Recent advances in data capture systems such as mHealth
devices, medical imaging, and high-throughput biotechnologies make large/complex research
and clinical datasets available, including survey data, multi-omics data, electronic medical
records, and/or other sources of reliable information related to engagement in care. This offers
tremendous potential of applying “big” data to extract knowledge and insights regarding
fundamental physiology, understand the mechanisms by which the pathogenic effects of biotic
and abiotic factors are realized, and identify potential intervention targets. We propose to
integrate the disparate data sources maintained by our partners and then utilize the big data to
address research questions in treating HIV and alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.
Specifically, we will pursue the following three aims: 1) Integrate the disparate data sources
through standardization, harmonization, and merging; 2) Develop a web-based data sharing
platform including virtual data sharing communities, data privacy protection, streamlined data
approval and access, and tracking of ongoing research activities; 3) Provide statistical support
to junior investigators to use the data repository for exploratory data analysis and proposal
development. The proposed study will tap into disparate data sources, unleash the potential of
data and information, accelerate knowledge discovery, advance data-powered health, and
transform discovery to improve health outcomes for PLWH."
10909170,"Project Summary
This project is to reveal the mechanism of how voltage, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and
calmodulin (CaM) integrate to activate the IKs potassium ion channels in the heart. The IKs channel is important
for repolarization of cardiac action potentials and the control of heart rhythm. CaM and the membrane lipid PIP2
are important cell signals, and meanwhile these molecules are cofactors of the IKs channel required for channel
opening. These enable the IKs channel to play a critical role in the adaptation of heart rhythm to various
physiological conditions. Congenital and drug induced IKs malfunction is associated with cardiac arrhythmias.
Previous studies and our preliminary data indicate that the IKs channel is a novel target for antiarrhythmic therapy.
The significance of this study is to improve the understanding of molecular basis of cardiac electrophysiology
and antiarrhythmic drug development.
 At present how CaM and PIP2 interact with the IKs channel is not clear. This proposal is motivated by the
recently published structural data of the channel protein. Combining these data with other published and our
preliminary studies lead to an exciting hypothesis for how CaM, PIP2 and voltage integrate to activate the IKs
channels. Our specific aims are designed to examine three key aspects of this hypothesis. We will use
electrophysiological approaches, fluorescence spectroscopy, structure-informed mutagenesis and molecular
dynamic simulations to study the IKs channels expressed in exogenous expression cells including Xenopus
oocytes and mammalian cell lines. These studies will reveal the binding of PIP2 and CaM to the channel protein
and subsequent conformational changes that open the channel. These results will provide a molecular basis to
understand how heart rhythm is regulated by cell signals and multiple mechanisms for drugs to target and modify,
which may lead to the development of more effective and safe antiarrhythmic drugs."
10837145,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Within the past decades, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant (AMR) gram-positive infections have increased,
and gram-positive bacteria cause the majority of nosocomial infections. It was estimated that in 2019 there
were 4.95 million deaths associated with AMR and 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to AMR. In high
income countries, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent pathogen, accounting for 26.1% of the deaths
attributable to AMR. Two of the most prevalent and/or difficult-to-treat pathogens include methicillin resistant S.
aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE); both are on the list of WHO and CDC priority
pathogens which informs the vital need for new and effective antibiotics. Unfortunately, these pathogens
continue to develop new multi-drug resistance patterns reducing therapeutic options. Furthermore, the COVID-
19 pandemic has significantly increased the rates of antimicrobial resistance, and novel therapeutics will be
needed in the future to combat these serious and prevalent hospital acquired infections. AimMax Therapeutics
has discovered a novel antibiotic, AMX-2005, with broad spectrum and best-in-class activity against MRSA and
VRE with potency superior to linezolid and no cross-resistance to vancomycin. This antibiotic has
demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity in in vitro time-kill assays at concentrations as low as 2X the MIC as
well as bactericidal efficacy in the in vivo murine neutropenic thigh infection model. AMX-2005 shows the
potential to be a next generation therapeutic from a class with an established history of clinical safety and low
rates of resistance. Collectively, these data provide a strong foundation of support for this proposal.
The overall goal of this proposed Phase 1 SBIR application is to develop a novel intravenous formulation of
AMX-2005 and generate proof-of-concept data to support the development of a therapeutic for difficult-to-treat
indications with high unmet needs. In Aim 1, we will conduct further in vitro microbiology studies to investigate
activity and attributes essential to successful therapeutics for serious infections, including an evaluation of the
potential for resistance development. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel IV formulation of AMX-2005 through the
use of innovative modern excipients and formulation technology. Our top two formulations will then undergo
rigorous safety assessments including in vitro compatibility tests with plasma and blood, vein irritation study at
the injection site to ensure safety and tolerability of the lead IV formulation, followed by determination of
maximum tolerated dose in mice. The PK profiles of the top formulation will be assessed to determine the most
suitable dosing regimens for efficacy studies in Aim 3, where we will assess the activity and potency of
formulated IV AMX-2005 in mice models of septicemia and thigh infection against MDR strains of MRSA or
VRE. Finally, we will conduct a mouse PK study to assess tissue concentrations of AMX-2005. If successful,
these data will inform indication selection and a target product profile to support a subsequent Phase 2 SBIR
application in which both IV and oral dosage forms of AMX-2005 will be developed."
10839918,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY. The population of people with HIV (PWH) is aging, and are at higher risk
for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) than seronegative counterparts. Although physical
activity (PA) is a promising protective factor to mitigate ADRD risk, few well-powered PA intervention studies
have rigorously tested cognitive outcomes among older PWH, a population with rates of moderate to
vigorous PA well below recommended guidelines. Further, given that adherence to habitual PA diminishes
after supervised interventions, identifying mechanisms of adherence (MoA) to habitual PA among older
PWH is germane to develop effective and durable interventions to protect cognitive health. The proposed
R01 will leverage the High-Intensity Exercise Study to Attenuate Limitations and Train Habits in Older Adults
With HIV (HEALTH), a two-site RCT (University of Washington [UW], University of Colorado Denver [UCD]) of
100 older PWH examining: 1) if 4 months of supervised high-intensity interval training (HIIT) mitigates physical
function impairments and fatigue to a greater extent than continuous moderate exercise (CME); 2) the effects of
a 3 month text-messaging intervention on PA adherence. In contrast to CME, where aerobic exercise is
performed continuously for a specified duration, HIIT, which uses repeated alternating bouts of high-
intensity and lower intensity aerobic exercise, has shown superior efficacy in improving physiological
and cognitive outcomes, and is associated with superior enjoyment which may increase adherence to
PA regimens. The proposed R01 (HEALTH-COG) will leverage the two HEALTH sites, add a new racially
diverse UAB site, and add new measures (psychological MoA measures, cognitive function assessments,
biomarkers) and a few 12 month follow-up to the parent study. We estimate that of our planned sample of N=100,
n=50 will be enrolled at UAB and n=50 total at UW and UCD. Our primary aim is to compare the effects of a 4
month supervised HIIT or CME intervention on (1°) cognitive functioning and (2°) subjective cognitive symptoms.
Our exploratory aim is to evaluate putative biomarkers underlying the effect of PA on cognition (blood markers:
e.g., BDNF, VEGF, IL-6 and neuroimaging markers: cerebral blood flow, resting state functional connectivity,
and brain volume). Our secondary aim is to determine MoA to long-term PA maintenance at 12 months. This
aim will examine distal predictors of long-term PA, including sociodemographic, clinical, and intervention factors
(i.e., changes in parent R01 physical outcomes [cardiorespiratory fitness], condition [HIIT vs CME], [coaching vs
control]), as well as proximal psychological MoA assessed in real-time, using EMA (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived
benefits, motivation, social support). Testing efficacy and mechanisms of exercise interventions on cognitive
outcomes and understanding psychological MoA of habitual PA following supervised interventions will aid in the
development and implementation of personalized medicine approaches for the treatment and prevention of
cognitive impairment and ADRD in older PWH."
10810668,"Evaluating the Influence of Culture and Risk Perception on HPV Vaccination Intention among Haitian
Immigrant Women Living with HIV
PROJECT SUMMARY
Cervical cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths among women living with HIV. Haitian immigrant
women have one of the highest incidence rates of cervical cancer in the nation and are disproportionately
affected by HIV. The dual disease burden of HIV and cervical cancer that Haitian immigrant women experience
is critical to note as HIV significantly increases the risk of developing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer can be
prevented through immunization with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, however HPV vaccine uptake
in this community is excessively low despite their high risk. Research has noted a link between individuals’
perceived risk of cancer, and their intention of undergoing cancer prevention behaviors. Recent studies have
highlighted a key role of affect (i.e. emotions), feelings, and thoughts, which are influenced by cultural
worldviews, in the rapid, automatic formulation of cancer risk perceptions and cancer prevention behaviors.
Studies have continuously highlighted the disparities in cervical cancer incidence rates among Haitian
immigrant women, along with Haitian immigrant women’s low uptake of cervical cancer prevention measures.
However, literature has been limited to date in evaluating the psychosocial and cultural factors that influence
Haitian immigrant women’s intention of undergoing HPV vaccination. More specifically, cultural worldviews and
affective risk perceptions towards HPV and cervical cancer, and the influence these factors have on HPV
vaccination intention, are largely unexplored among Haitian immigrant women living with HIV. The aims of this
study are: 1) To qualitatively explore cultural worldviews and affective risk perception on HPV vaccination
intention. Cultural worldview items will be developed from qualitative data. 2) To examine whether predictors
of HPV vaccination intention (e.g. cultural worldviews, affective risk perception, individual level factors) will
differ among Haitian immigrant women based on HIV status 3) To converge qualitative and quantitative
findings to understand how affective risk perceptions and cultural worldviews influence HPV vaccination
intention among Haitian immigrant women. The contributions of the present proposal are significant as this
study will be one of the first to comprehensively assess the role of risk perception as a motivator of health
behaviors related to HPV vaccination in this high-risk community."
10775798,"Background: Chronic pain, and particularly high-impact chronic pain (that is, pain last three months or longer
that impacts daily functioning in one or more domains) is a leading cause of disability, often associated with
declining functioning, lost days of work, and worsened quality of life. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
identified both improved pain management and reduced opioid-related harms as national priorities, with an
emphasis on improving function and pain-related disability. Peer specialists may be an untapped and valuable
resource to support Veterans with chronic pain and enhance the effectiveness of pain treatment. Peer
specialists are individuals with lived experience who work with Veterans to encourage patient activation and
help patients manage chronic conditions. Peer specialists work in a variety of clinical settings, most commonly
mental health clinics, and are well-suited to help patients who are harder to engage in services or those
needing more support to promote self-management strategies. Peer support is particularly effective for patients
with more severe illnesses or higher levels of distress, and thus may be helpful for Veterans with high-impact
chronic pain.
Significance: Chronic pain is one of the most common and costly problems among Veterans using VHA
healthcare. VHA guidelines for pain management and opioid therapy encourage non-pharmacological pain
management strategies (NPMs) and non-opioid medications for chronic pain management. However, NPMs
that emphasize improved pain-related function are often underutilized. Addressing pain management and
opioid misuse are VHA priorities and this research directly aligns with VHA Rehabilitation Research &
Development (RR&D) priorities, including promotion of non-pharmacological activity-based interventions for
chronic pain, impacting outcomes such as pain; it also aligns with RR&D’s broader goal of maximizing
Veteran’s function and quality of life.
Innovation & Impact: The role of peer specialists in VHA is rapidly expanding beyond traditional mental health
settings, leading to an urgent need for additional research to understand how best to use peer specialists’
unique skills to enhance care for Veterans in a wider range of settings. No studies to date have evaluated the
use of peer specialists to support improvements in pain-related function among Veterans with chronic pain.
The current proposal is innovative because it proposes, for the first time, using peer specialists to focus on
pain management. If proven effective, this project could pave the way for widespread implementation of peer
specialists into new settings where they can support pain management.
Specific Aims: The specific aims of this project are to (1) Use intervention mapping (IM) to refine our
intervention, Peers Enhancing Engagement for Pain Services (PEEPS) and (2) Pilot test the feasibility and
acceptability of PEEPS and collect function-focused outcome measures for use in a rigorous prospective
study.
Methodology: After refining the intervention protocol using intervention mapping, we propose a single arm
pilot trial where we will enroll 24 Veterans with high-impact chronic pain to participate in PEEPS, collecting
data at baseline and three-months post baseline. Our primary focus will be feasibility and acceptability; we will
also collect data on pain-related function, activity (steps walked, using pedometers), and well-being/quality of
life.
Next Steps/Implementation: These data will inform the development of a larger proposal testing PEEPS in a
multicenter randomized controlled trial."
10702163,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dual sensory loss is defined as a combination of age-related vision loss, e.g., age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD) and age-related hearing loss (ARHL) that co-occurs in people age >65. AMD, dry and wet forms,
and ARHL are multifactorial diseases that share etiologies such as smoking and complement dysregulation.
Importantly, the amplification loop of the complement alternative pathway (AP) is crucial to control, as it is re-
sponsible for the majority of complement activation on cell surfaces and extracellular membranes. The AP is
inhibited by circulating complement protein factor H (fH). One of the mechanisms by which complement is acti-
vated is natural antibodies (nAbs) binding to neoepitopes, or damage-associated molecular patterns, on dam-
aged tissues in response to injury. The complement effector molecules and nAbs activate macrophages and
other immune cells, intensifying the inflammatory state that can lead to neurodegeneration. Two well-studied
fusion proteins, CR2-fH and B4-scFv-fH, will be used to target the inhibitory domain of fH to sites of tissue
damage. The complement receptor 2 (CR2) domain binds to complement fragment deposited sites, and the
single chain antibody B4 (B4-scFv) domain binds to modified annexin IV exposed on damaged tissues. Both
CR2-fH and B4-scFv-fH have been shown to be efficacious in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases
when administered systemically, or for CR2-fH locally and via gene therapy. Of interest is that complement and
macrophage activation are elevated in the subretinal space of wet AMD mouse models and in cochlear tissue
of aged mice. In addition, smoke-induced proinflammatory, neurodegenerative AP activation, and abnormal
macrophage activity, have been seen the eye and cochlea. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
vector driven CR2-fH and injected B4-scFv-fH localize fH to damaged nerve tissues and mitigate wet AMD and
ARHL pathology, in part by reducing macrophage activation, and thereby reducing the complement-
macrophage inflammatory feedback loop. I will test this hypothesis in two specific aims, the results of which will
transition to my postdoctoral research. Aim 1 will provide proof of concept that the C3 promoter is modulated in
a complement-dependent manner and that circulating B4-scFv-fH localizes to damaged cochlear tissue in
smoke-exposed ARHL mice. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that local delivery of AAV5-pC3-CR2-fH and
cochlear targeting of B4-scFv-fH can mitigate AMD pathology and prevent cochlear damage, respectively, in
part by reducing macrophage activation. In Aim 3, as a postdoctoral trainee, I aspire to train in a lab with exper-
tise in the aged human visual and auditory systems to expand my translational research in sensory loss. Over-
all, my goal for this proposal is to demonstrate that AP inhibition in dual sensory loss can ameliorate pathology
in part by reducing macrophage activation and reducing the proinflammatory microenvironment. My long-term
goal is to expand my research and research training in translational sensory neuroscience."
10702164,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder, where one-third of this
population is treatment-resistant. Depression is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, including deficits in
cognitive control, defined as flexible adaptation of cognitive and behavior commensurate with one’s current
goals. Application of deep brain stimulation (DBS), a common therapy used for treatment-resistant depression
(TRD), has previously shown enhancement in cognitive control during experimental tasks, but therapeutically
shown mixed results, and our understanding of the effect of DBS on neural dynamics in brain networks
associated with impaired cognitive dysfunction and control in neuropsychiatric disorders is not well-known. In
addition, our understanding of how the frequency of neurostimulation plays a role in modulating neural activity
and communication in cognitive control networks in depression is limited.
 To tackle these unknowns, in the F99 phase, Anusha will collect intracranial local field potential
recordings (LFP) through depth electrodes implanted across the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex,
amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in patients with TRD, recruited through a parent UH3 study
(UH3-NS103549). Participants perform a cognitive control behavioral task before, and during high-frequency
electrical stimulation delivered through DBS electrodes implanted in the ventral capsule/ventral striatum and
subcallosal cingulate. Additionally, Anusha will collect LFP recordings during stimulation experiments where a
range of electrical stimulation frequencies (6,50,130 Hz) are applied systematically during resting state through
DBS electrodes. Using the collected data, Anusha will characterize behaviorally defined cognitive control
subnetworks in participants with TRD, and explore the effect of low-frequency oscillations that are known to be
associated with conflict processing and cognitive control in healthy subjects. She will expand this work to
perform functional connectivity analysis during the behavioral task. Anusha will also apply these techniques for
analysis of data collected in stimulation experiments during resting state. Understanding cognitive control is
imperative to not only improving our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in depression, but is a step towards
individualizing and optimizing therapy around electrophysiological markers associated with behavioral
impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders, in lieu of or in addition to clinical evaluation of symptoms.
 In the K00 phase, Anusha will extend her research to more granular circuit dissection using rodent
models of psychiatric disease, and leverage her doctoral training in statistical and computational neuroscience
to analyze data from such studies, while continuing to perform research in human subjects to study cognitive
control. The proposed training during the F99 and K00 phases will ensure multidisciplinary training to reach her
career goal as an independent research investigator focused on using a multidisciplinary approach to help
achieve a comprehensive understanding of cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders."
10804654,"Allergic disease greatly impacts the quality of life in the United States and costs billions of dollars
annually on health care and lost productivity. IgE is the primary mediator for the immediate hypersensitivity
phase of the allergic response and can also drive life-threatening anaphylaxis. Allergen-specific IgE is
produced in germinal center (GC) reactions and requires help from IL-4-secreting T follicular helper (TFH)
cells. TFH cells localize to the GC, where they promote B cell clonal expansion and antibody affinity
maturation. A major unresolved question is what factors control the development of TFH cells that promote IgE
responses. High affinity IgE antibodies are formed in allergic responses which involve the development of IL-4-
expressing TH2 cells and IL-4-expressing TFH cells (sometimes referred to as TFH2 cells). However, the
developmental connection between TH2 cells generated in allergic responses and TFH2 cells is unresolved.
Additionally, IL-4-expressing TFH cells can develop without the production of significant IgE responses.
 In a recent study, using a food allergy priming model in mice, we characterized TFH cells that
developed under two different methods of priming using the same allergen and adjuvant, but varying in the
timing of the priming. We analyzed the TFH cells that developed under these two conditions and identified
significant differences in gene expression. In both priming conditions, IL-4-expressing TFH cells developed, but
IgE responses only developed in only one priming condition. We termed the TFH cells that promote IgE in this
system as TFH-IgE cells, to distinguish them from TFH2 cells.
 Our goal in this application is to define the requirements for TFH-IgE cell development. We have found
that Anxa1, a regulatory gene which is a known inhibitor of TH2 and IgE responses, is strongly down-regulated
in TFH-IgE cells compared to TFH2 cells. The role of Anxa1 in TFH cell function has not been previously
explored, however new findings reveal that Anxa1 expression is down-regulated by IL-4 signaling in activated
CD4 T cells. We therefore hypothesize that Anxa1 is a signal modulating protein that inhibits the development
of TFH-IgE cells, and that, in contrast to TFH2 cells, TFH-IgE cells are generated by IL-4-Stat6 signals which
critically down-regulate Anxa1 expression to allow full TFH-IgE differentiation (characterized by increased IL-4,
CD40L; decreased Fgl2 and Entpd1)."
10904788,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRP channel regulation of feeding behavior in Drosophila
Feeding is one of the most fundamental of all animal behaviors. In mammals, diverse signals, including
chemosensory responses to food properties and mechanical stimulation of the gut, regulate satiation and
feeding behavior. These mechanisms, or analogous systems, are well-conserved in invertebrates. Although
many neuropeptides and neurotransmitters have been identified that signal satiation or satiety, much less is
known about how gut stretch and other mechanosensory forces are signaled to regulate feeding behavior.
Due to the remarkable conservation in their basic physiological and neurological properties, studies in
Drosophila have revolutionized our broad understanding of animal behavior. Despite the successful use of
flies in investigating paradigms such as sleep, circadian rhythm, and memory, only recently have tools for
measuring fly food intake facilitated the study of feeding behavior. This project will use Drosophila
melanogaster to investigate the regulation of meal intake. New methods allow undisturbed real-time
measurements of food consumption in freely behaving adult flies that resolve with unrivalled accuracy the
effects of diet and hunger on meal size. An experimental framework is established for defining fly meals and to
show their basic regulation by manipulation of the diet, internal hunger state, and circadian rhythms. Using the
powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila, preliminary results reveal the involvement of transient receptor
potential (TRP) channels in the regulation of meal intake. TRP channels define a large family of sensory
receptors, and much is still unknown about how they function as chemo-, mechano-, and other types of
receptors. The proposed studies will dissect the role of TRP channel signaling in satiation and meal size
control, taking advantage of the tools available in the simplified Drosophila model. Given the increasing
importance of meal intake and patterning on physiology and health—regardless of total caloric intake—the
proposed studies have the potential to reveal key insights on the role of TRP channel signaling on regulating
prandial behavior, physiology, and metabolism. The proposed studies may also eventually inform the design
of pesticides targeting TRP channels or feeding behavior in other insects, including agricultural pests and
disease vectors such as mosquitos."
10898885,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Public financing of care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has historically favored
long-term nursing facility care over care provided in the community. Most individuals, however, express the desire
to remain in the community (rather than an institution) for as long as possible. The 1999 U.S. Supreme Court
Olmstead decision, and several Federal and state initiatives to encourage balancing of Medicaid-covered long-term
services and supports (LTSS) toward community settings, have led to a steady expansion of home- and commu-
nity-based services (HCBS), including medical and non-medical services to support nursing-home eligible individu-
als wishing to remain in the community. The quality of institutional care is lower, and the need for LTSS is greater in
Black and Hispanic adults with ADRD, and among people with disabilities. Yet the expansion has occurred without
substantial evidence regarding how HCBS compares to available alternatives and whether it does, in fact, reduce
inequities. Using a mixed methods sequential explanatory design and contemporary Medicaid data linked to Medi-
care data for dual-eligible beneficiaries, Project 1 will complete three aims: Aim 1. To identify administrative and
self-reported predictors of HCBS service receipt in a national sample of beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare
and Medicaid with claims-based diagnosis of ADRD between 2010 and 2024. Aim 2. To estimate the impact of dif-
ferences in HCBS service receipt on disparities in nursing home use, quality of life and function, adverse events
and social risks, end-of-life care, and mortality among dual-eligible beneficiaries with claims-based diagnosis of
ADRD between 2010 and 2024. Aim 3. To explore ADRD patient and care partner decision-making processes re-
garding HCBS use and Medicaid administrators, HCBS agency, and direct service providers’ assessments of barri-
ers and facilitators to HCBS expansion for beneficiaries with ADRD. By exploring state and Federal policies and
mechanisms that enhance or impede equity in LTSS access and outcomes, we will identify policy levers for reduc-
ing disparities by race, ethnicity, and disability among adults with ADRD. In addition to collaborating with Core B
and Core C in this Program Project Grant (PPG), this work will also benefit from data derived in Project 3 (estimates
of regional primary care quality for ADRD for Aim 1), collaboration with Project 4 to contextualize acute-care out-
comes in Aim 2, and partnership with Project 2 to recruit key informants for Aim 3. By exploring state and Federal
policies and mechanisms that enhance or impede equity in LTSS access and outcomes, this project will synergize
with the larger PPG to identify policy levers for reducing disparities by race, ethnicity, and disability among adults
with ADRD."
10898890,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
One quarter of the 2.9 million older people living in government-subsidized affordable housing in the U.S. have
claims-based evidence of ADRD. Resident services coordinators (RSCs) are staff assigned to subsidized
housing who manage and provide access to necessary supportive services in the community, provide case
management services, develop programs and assets that support wellness, and address social determinants
that would otherwise undermine successful aging in place. While myriad state and federal policies mandate
and/or incentivize affordable housing building upgrades that address hazardous building conditions, standard
financial models for affordable housing make funding for RSCs extremely challenging and fewer than half of
federally funded properties serving older persons currently have an RSC. This is counterintuitive since
evidence suggests that RSCs are valuable assets to both residents and property owners, benefiting occupancy
and rent collection and reducing evictions and maintenance costs. A HUD survey of property managers found
that they strongly believe RSC’s improve residents’ quality of life, promote independent living, and prevent
unnecessary institutionalization. Little is known about the influence of RSCs on the health and well-being of
residents with ADRD. Using linked data from the AASC (American Association of Service Coordinators), HUD
(U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development), CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services),
and semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled RSCs, we will explore the effects of RSCs on
utilization of services and outcomes for older residents with ADRD using a sequential mixed-methods
explanatory design. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Compare the effects of RSCs on disparities in use of health
services for residents with and without ADRD; Aim 2. Evaluate the effects of RSCs on inequality in use of
services promoting aging in place for residents with and without ADRD; and Aim 3. Further explore the
barriers and facilitators (including implicit and explicit biases) to aging in place for residents with and without
ADRD that are identified in the first two aims."
10898894,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Primary care clinicians serve as the predominant source of care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD). High-quality primary care plays an important role in the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of ADRD itself and in the management of the many chronic conditions that are prevalent among
those with ADRD. Little is known, however, about how access to high-quality primary care has changed in
recent years – including changes in access associated with the COVID-19 pandemic -- or about the policy-,
system- or practice-level factors that are associated with better quality of primary care for older adults with
ADRD. Drawing on a unique national dataset that includes annual information on the ownership and staffing of
all U.S. primary care practices from 2015-2024, linked Medicare claims data, and surveys of nationally
representative samples of these practices conducted in 2017 and 2022, we propose 3 aims. Aim 1: Examine
U.S. trends in access to primary care for older adults with ADRD using repeated cross-sectional studies of
primary and relevant subspecialty care for Medicare beneficiaries with and without ADRD diagnoses, and how
these trends varied for less advantaged populations. Aim 2: Use variations across states, delivery systems,
and physician practices in the implementation of initiatives intended to improve the quality of primary care in
order to identify policy-, system- or practice-level factors associated with better quality care for ADRD
patients. Aim 3: Develop practical recommendations on how to improve primary care for less-advantaged
patients with ADRD by purposively sampling respondents from Wave 2 of the practice survey that serve
economically less advantaged and minoritized populations and conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with
their leaders and staff. Findings across our three aims will be triangulated to develop recommendations that
can assist practice leaders, health system leaders, and policymakers in improving primary care for patients
with ADRD. Collaborating closely with Core B and C in this program project grant, this work will also contribute
to Project 1 and 2 by providing local measures of primary care quality and draw from these projects by
including measures of beneficiary access to Home and Community Based Services and Resident Services
Coordinators. The findings will identify opportunities to reduce the magnitude of the disparities in access to
high-quality primary care for older adults with ADRD."
10920402,"Project Summary/Abstract
Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse clinical outcomes. While isocitrate dehydrogenase
mutation (IDH-MT) and other genetic features of glioma have changed the landscape of diagnosis and prognosis
for lower-grade glioma, these same markers do not explain heterogeneity in treatment response and survival for
glioblastoma (GBM). Individual immune factors may play a role in glioma outcomes. To address this, we have
pioneered immunomethylomics, an approach that defines and quantitates an extended library of immune cell
populations (e.g., naïve and memory CD4, CD8 T-cells, and B cells, NK cells, monocytes, neutrophils) and
aberrant myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) from fresh or frozen peripheral whole blood.
Immunomethylomics is a powerful methodology based on DNA methylation patterns in the immune cell
genomes. In this renewal, we will use immunomethylomics to address high-priority and yet unresolved clinical
problems in GBM patient management using three aims. In Aim 1, we propose to develop an algorithm for
stratifying GBM patients according to expected survival. Historically, individual measures were used, i.e., age,
IDH-MT (<10% of GBMs), and DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation. Important gaps in this univariate
approach include the lack of assessment of corticoid steroid immunosuppression and the influence of MDSCs.
We will address these gaps by creating integrated IDH-Wildtype (IDH-WT) GBM survival models with longitudinal
immune profile data. In Aim 2, we will create a blood-based stratification of glioma subgroups by IDH status and
grade. The current lack of methods to identify tumor IDH status before surgery limits neoadjuvant and
intraoperative therapeutic strategies that are increasingly important in clinical trial design. Aim 2 addresses this
unmet need. In Aim 3, we will create predictive blood biomarkers for response to immunotherapy and radiation.
Non-invasive predictors are urgently needed to help distinguish radiologic evidence of early true progression
(~30% of GBM patients) from pseudoprogression (PsP; ~20-30%). Uncertainty about true progression vs. PsP
based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone results in patients being subjected to the risk and expense
of re-operation for further management. Our and others’ recent studies demonstrate that both PsP and GBM
survival are influenced by patient immunologic factors, specifically, the concentrations of MDSCs that
accumulate in peripheral blood. Aim 3A addresses this unmet need by creating a blood-based biomarker to
distinguish PsP from true progression in GBM patients after chemo/radiation. There are no standardized
comprehensive methods to assess the effect of the systemic immune system on response to immunotherapies.
In Aim 3B we test our methodology in four clinical trials representing two different immunotherapy modalities
(anti-PD1/PD-L1 and CART adoptive cell therapy). In summary, this project will continue to identify novel
prognostic and predictive factors for glioma through carefully conducted studies using the latest genomic
technologies and innovative bioinformatics techniques in combination with well-annotated patient clinical data."

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant glioma are mostly non-enhancing, which makes it difficult to distinguish
the boundaries of infiltrative lesions from normal tissue and edema in both newly diagnosed and post-treatment
settings. The standard efficacy endpoints of response rate or overall survival are also challenging for such slow
growing tumors. These limitations have led to the consideration of innovative imaging approaches to improve
the characterization of tumor burden and early assessment of treatment response. Expanding imaging
capabilities to include robust metrics to describe the biological properties of lesions could be important to assess
the population of IDH mutant glioma that are associated with specific metabolic reprogramming, slow growth
rate, and high risk of malignant transformation.
The proposed project will leverage our experience in the clinical implementation of hyperpolarized [1-
13C]pyruvate imaging for glioblastoma in the previous cycle to assess dynamic metabolism in IDH mutant glioma.
Metabolic reprogramming in IDHm tumors specifically results in the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate (⍺-KG) to
a novel oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), with a concomitant decrease in conversion of ⍺-KG to
glutamate. Dynamic metabolic conversions in IDHm glioma can, therefore, be measured using novel imaging
probes HP [2-13C]pyruvate and [1-13C] (⍺-KG). We will first establish the preclinical utility of using [2-13C]pyruvate
and [1-13C] ⍺-KG as a non-invasive imaging biomarker of treatment response and tumor burden in Aim 1. In Aim
2, we will take advantage of ongoing clinical trials at UCSF that specifically target the metabolism of IDH mutant
glioma to assess the impact of using dynamic hyperpolarized [2-13C]pyruvate imaging to assess early metabolic
changes in patients undergoing treatment. Aim 3 will improve the characterization of tumor burden in newly-
diagnosed and recurrent IDH mutant glioma patients using hyperpolarized [1-13C] ⍺-KG metabolic imaging with
correlation to tissue characteristics. Ultimately, we plan to translate dynamic, non-invasive metabolic imaging
biomarkers to enhance the evaluation of novel therapies and assist in the optimal management of IDHm patients."
10920410,"Project Summary/Abstract
The development of safe and effective chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-transduced T cell (CART) therapy for
glioblastoma (GBM) needs to overcome multiple challenges, including heterogeneity of antigen expression, on-
target off-tumor toxicity, and exhaustion of CART cells. To date, there are no GBM-specific antigens that are
uniformly present on all GBM cells. On the other hand, while non-mutant GBM-associated antigens (GAAs),
including Ephrin type A receptor 2 (EphA2) and interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2), are expressed in the
majority of GBM cells, they are also expressed in some non-central nervous system (CNS) organs, raising the
concern of off-tumor toxicity. As a way to safely and effectively target GAAs, we have adopted a novel synthetic
Notch “synNotch” receptor system and developed innovative “prime-and-kill” T cell circuits. In this system, the
first antigen, which is expressed exclusively on GBM or CNS cells, primes the T cells to induce the expression
of a CAR that recognizes IL-13Rα2 and EphA2, thereby eradicating GBM cells expressing either EphA2 or IL-
13Rα2. The first priming antigen should be restrictedly expressed on CNS cells but not on cells of any (non-
CNS) systemic organs. Then the system should be safe because, within the CNS, EphA2 and IL-13Rα2 are
expressed only on tumor cells and not on normal CNS cells. We found Brevican (BCAN), a proteoglycan localized
to the neuronal and glial cell surface, as the most promising priming antigen. When mice bearing well-established
day 9 intracerebral GBM6 PDX tumors received a single IV infusion of T cells engineered with the α-BCAN
synNotchα-EphA2/IL-13Rα2 CAR (B-SYNC) circuit, all mice demonstrated complete regression of tumor
without attacking EphA2/IL-13Rα2-positive cells outside of CNS. Furthermore, these B-SYNC T cells were
significantly more efficacious than conventional, constitutively expressed EphA2/IL-13Rα2 CART cells, with
superior CNS tumor-homing and less exhausted phenotype compared to control T cells. We will develop a phase
I study to evaluate our hypothesis that B-SYNC T cells can be safely administered as a single IV infusion in
patients with GBM and that B-SYNC T cells are able to infiltrate the GBM tissue, wherein they will be primed to
express the CAR against EphA2 and IL-13Rα2. Concurrently, using syngeneic mouse models, we will evaluate
our 2nd hypothesis that modulation of immunoregulatory mechanisms may further improve the function and
efficacy of B-SYNC T cells. We will evaluate the following two specific aims.
Aim 1. Determine the safety as well as the homing and priming status (i.e., expression of CAR) of the IV-infused
B-SYNC T cells in patients with GBM.
Aim 2. Assess potential resistance mechanisms and integrate mitigation strategies into the B-SYNC regimen in
preclinical syngeneic models. In a prior trial with anti-EGFRvIII CART cells, the CART cells infiltrated the GBM
and induced immunoregulatory molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)."

Aim 1 of Project 3; data analysis guidance (either by performing the analyses within the core or advising qualified
personnel within the projects), including the use of appropriate statistical models and appropriate applications of
statistical tests; and the development of novel methods to help interpret results from experiments. Under Dr.
Molinaro’s supervision, the Core built and will continue to expand and maintain the UCSF Brain Tumor Center
Database (BTCDB). The BTCDB will be the primary, centralized repository for annotated research and clinical
data used by all SPORE investigators. This unique and customizable resource will connect clinical information
to imaging, tissue, and genomic parameters generated by the SPORE projects. The Clinical Co-leader, John de
Groot, M.D., will interact with all Project leaders in planning and conducting clinical studies and assessing results
including review of the prognostic value of blood immunomethylomics from the population science studies in
Project 1 and evaluating the effect of novel metabolic imaging studies in patients in Project 2. Importantly, Dr. de

10830437,"Unnecessary discharges from a hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) are costly and may accelerate
patients’ functional losses and requirement for long-term institutionalization. Patients with Alzheimer's Disease
and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and other types of cognitive impairment are uniquely
disadvantaged by this status quo in that they are twice as likely to be hospitalized, four times more likely to be
discharged to SNFs with less than 50% returning to their homes. This situation can be addressed as it is the
product of a typically rushed discharge planning process with inadequate time to discover, much less address,
a patient’s barriers to home discharge. Recent reports suggest that as many as a third of patients dismissed to
SNFs, including those with AD/ADRD, could return directly home if their post-acute care (PAC) needs and
barriers were anticipated and addressed. Several key deficits prevent broad realization of a patients’ potential to
discharge directly home, or their Home PAC Potential (HoPe). These include a limited ability to: 1) quantify
factors that determine PAC needs, 2) identify and address remediable barriers to home discharge, and 3)
mobilize stakeholders for advancement of individualized discharge plans. Collectively, these deficits prevent
the timely initiation of acute care services that can realize a patient’s potential for home discharge, with PAC as
necessary. Rehabilitation-focused, hospital-Home Healthcare Agency (HHA) partnerships have established that
interdisciplinary care plans enacted early in a hospital stay with patient and caregiver involvement increase the
likelihood of a patient’s return home. Our team developed an Epic electronic health record (EHR)-based
discharge planning system that triangulates EHR, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and social determinants
of health data to identify HoPe barriers and direct needs-matched rehabilitation service delivery. A pilot of the
system among 358 patients increased the home discharge rate by over 25% and revealed high user
acceptability. However, the pilot also identified the need to improve addressing of cognitive impairments,
targeting of high-yield HoPe barriers, and engagement of non-clinical stakeholders. We propose to address
these limitations by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Develop a low-burden computerized adaptive test PRO to
assess the domains of functional cognition relevant to a safe home discharge; 2) Develop a machine learning
algorithm to prioritize actionable HoPe barriers and estimate the degree of change needed for home discharge;
and 3) Apply user-centered design principles to refine the EHR discharge planning system for optimal usability
and enhanced EHR portal patient, caregiver, and HHA staff access. Our goal is to both integrate and pilot
these deliverables in a mature and optimally usable EHR discharge planning system, and to evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of its implementation. We anticipate that the system will be scalable, and amenable
to inter-institution transfer for testing in a multi-site pragmatic trial."

Photoreceptors degenerate in numerous retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital
amaurosis, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The progressive death of cone photoreceptors
ultimately leads to vision impairment and blindness. Thyroid hormone (TH) regulates cell proliferation,
differentiation, and metabolism. In the retina, TH regulates retinal development and cone opsin expression,
and is associated with cone photoreceptor viability. Using mouse models of cone degeneration, we have
shown that suppression of TH signaling with anti-thyroid drug treatment or by targeting intracellular TH
components iodothyronine deiodinases and thyroid hormone receptor protects cones, whereas stimulation of
TH signaling deteriorates cones. The overall objectives of this project are to determine whether TH signaling
activity is elevated in degenerating cones/retinas; explore how TH signaling induces cone death, which is
essential to understanding how suppressing TH signaling preserves cones; and determine whether
suppression of TH signaling in the retina might be an effective strategy for cone protection. Aim 1 will
determine whether TH signaling activity is elevated in cone degeneration retinas, including AMD donor eyes.
We found that the expression levels of cellular TH components, including the iodothyronine deiodinases and
TH receptor, were higher in cone degeneration retinas, suggesting locally elevated TH signaling activity. We
will evaluate TH receptor transcriptional activity and TH-regulating genes/pathway activities in cone
degeneration retinas, using CUT&RUN-seq technologies and RNA-seq technologies, and assess the effects
of TH signaling suppression. Aim 2 will determine whether receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
kinase (RIPK)/necroptosis signaling contributes to TH-induced cone death. Treatment with triiodothyronine
(T3) induced cone death and increased expression of the necroptosis components in the mouse retina,
whereas suppressing TH signaling reduced these alterations. We will examine RIPK/necroptosis activity in
the mouse retina after TH signaling manipulation. The contribution of RIPK/necroptosis signaling to TH-
induced cone death will be evaluated using RIPK inhibitor/genetic deletion. Aim 3 will determine whether
changes in mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress/damage contribute to TH-induced cone death.
Treatment with T3 induced oxidative damage in the retina and increased expression of the mitochondrial
metabolism enzymes, whereas suppression of TH signaling reduced these alterations. We will examine
mitochondrial metabolism/activity in the retina after TH signaling manipulation and evaluate the effects of
antioxidants/metabolic modulators on TH-induced cone death. Completion of the proposed study will help us
understand regulation of TH signaling in cone degeneration retinas. This knowledge is essential for the future
development of cone protection strategies that act by targeting TH signaling locally in the retina."

Although modern antiretroviral (ARV) therapies have dramatically improved the outlooks for people living with
HIV, they are unable to cure infection. For people with HIV a cure would represent freedom from many burdens,
including stigma, expensive medications, and inflammation-associated co-morbidities. A cure would also have
public health benefits, comprising a powerful tool to help end the HIV epidemic. Developing a cure for HIV
requires developing an understanding of how the virus persists for years and decades in people, even when new
rounds of cellular infection (replication) are blocked by ARVs, and despite the ongoing presence of antiviral
immune responses. The dominant paradigm has been that the virus hides in a latent state in infected cells and
is thus invisible to immune responses. Efforts to cure infection have therefore focused on therapeutically
reversing HIV latency to expose these cells to elimination but have thus far yielded disappointing results. This,
along with several converging lines of evidence, have led to more recent hypothesis that hiding from the immune
system may not be the only mechanism by which HIV persists – but rather that these rare populations of infected
cells may have been selected for those that possess cell-intrinsic resistance to killing by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes,
even when they express antigen and are seen. This parallels recent findings from ImmunoOncology where it
has now been well established that some immunogenic tumors undergo selection for cell-intrinsic resistance to
CTL. For this project, we have assembled a team comprising a pioneer in establishing mechanisms of CTL
resistance in tumors, and two HIV experts who have advanced the idea of CTL resistance in this setting through
a series of ex vivo studies. By merging these areas of expertise, we Aim to comprehensively describe
mechanisms of CTL resistance in HIV-infected primary CD4+ T-cells and to discern which of these are at play in
real HIV reservoir cells from people with HIV. We will build from these results to select therapeutic targets and
identify combination approaches that integrate these with HIV-specific CTL and latency reversal strategies to
achieve specific elimination of HIV reservoir-harboring cells ex vivo. We will also leverage an innovative mouse
model to test whether engaging these therapeutic targets limits the seeding of HIV reservoirs in vivo. The results
of this project are thus expected to be: i) laying a broad foundation for understanding CTL resistance in the HIV
reservoir and ii) pre-clinical validation of multiple therapeutic targets with the potential to contribute to a cure for
HIV."
10781995,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Mucosal surveillance of the intestinal barrier by tissue-resident lymphocytes is critical for preventing the
invasion of enteric pathogens and a necessary component of protective immunity. A single layer of epithelial
cells lines the intestinal tract and provides a physical barrier between microbes, dietary antigens, toxins and
the rest of the tissue. Therefore, the reactivation of lymphocytes at the intestinal barrier must be tightly
regulated, as too robust of a response could result in destruction of the epithelium leading to microbial
translocation and eventual autoimmunity, as observed in inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease.
Tissue-resident intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the intestine provide a first line of defense against invading
microorganisms and the intestinal IEL compartment is composed of what has been termed induced and natural
IELs. Induced IELs are CD8ab+ TCRab+ tissue resident memory (Trm IELs) cells that are recruited to the
epithelial compartment following antigen exposure. In contrast, natural IELs are not MHC-restricted and include
CD8aa+ IELs expressing TCRgd (gd IELs). gd and Trm IELs represent the majority of the lymphocytes in the
intestinal epithelium and could serve both protective and pathogenic roles, yet mechanisms regulating their
activation during infection in vivo remain largely unexplored. CD103 (aEb7 integrin) is expressed by the majority
of gd and Trm IELs located in the intestine and at other barrier sites. CD103 binds to epithelial E-cadherin and
plays an important role in the recruitment and maintenance of tissue lymphocytes. However, the contribution of
CD103 to IEL functionality within the intestine during infection has not been addressed. Successful completion
of the proposed aims will provide fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms by which CD103 ligation
to E-cadherin promotes (1) the motility and activation of Trm and (2) gd IELs and the role of CD103 in
promoting protective responses to enteric infection. These studies will uncover novel mechanisms by which
direct interaction between IELs and epithelial cells contribute to host immunity and further define the molecular
cues regulating sentinel lymphocyte populations in mucosal homeostasis and infection."
10832473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Synaptic dysfunction is a major contributor towards the development of a large range of neurological
disorders. For proper formation, synapses require a series of signaling pathways to guide them, but
not all of those pathways are well understood. Rap Guanine Exchange Factors, or RapGEFs, are
signaling proteins that act to accelerate the rate of activation of GTPases that achieve downstream
functions. RAPGEF subfamily members are associated with multiple neurological disorders, including
schizophrenia. In murine models, disruption of RAPGEF6 function results in reduced anxiety
behaviors, like that observed in patients with schizophrenia, and increased long term potentiation. In
addition, they found no changes in gross brain morphology. Although these studies suggest that
RAPGEFs modulate synaptic function, the exact mechanism is currently unknown. To address
whether loss of RapGEF function influences synapses, mutations within pxf-1, a C. elegans RapGEF
orthologue were studied. When exposed to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, aldicarb, pxf-1 mutants
displayed decreased sensitivity indicating altered synaptic function. Additionally, pxf-1 and rac-2
GTPase mutants display decreased synaptic vesicle intensity in cholinergic synapses. Based on
these preliminary findings, the central hypothesis is that PXF-1 alters cytoskeletal reorganization
within neurons to influence synaptic formation and accomplishes this through activation of Rac
GTPase signaling. To test this hypothesis, this study will use the C. elegans neuromuscular junction.
C. elegans are an advantageous model system for the study of neuronal function due to their well-
defined genome, translucent body for imaging techniques, and overall ease of genetic manipulation.
The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism of PXF-1 function within the neuromuscular
junction through the following aims. Aim 1. To identify the downstream GTPase that PXF-1 is
activating in this pathway. Aim 2. To investigate whether inhibiting a GAP protein in the PXF-1
pathway can restore synaptic development and function. Overall, this research will provide insight into
the molecular mechanisms that govern synaptic formation and how their dysregulation may lead to
development of disorders. This research will support the development of future treatments for
synaptopathologies."
10934354,"Project Summary. Neurons and astrocytes have unique demands in regulating the quality of their proteome. A
key regulator of the proteome is autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway. During autophagy, cytoplasmic
components are packaged into autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for cargo degradation.
Autophagy is neuroprotective, as mutations in key autophagy genes cause neurodegeneration. Preliminary
studies show that autophagy is regulated differently in neurons and astrocytes in multiple paradigms of stress.
Despite the importance of autophagy, how it is regulated in neurons and astrocytes to facilitate cell-
type specific functions and stress responses is largely unknown. Thus, the goal for this proposal is to
define cell-type specific functions for the autophagy receptor p62 in neurons and astrocytes. P62 facilitates
selective forms of autophagy by binding to ubiquitinated substrates and the autophagy marker LC3, thereby
incorporating cargo into a forming autophagosome. P62 mitigates proteotoxic stress by targeting protein
aggregates to the autophagy pathway. Additionally, p62 mitigates oxidative stress by targeting Keap1, a
negative regulator of the antioxidant transcription factor NRF2, for degradation by autophagy. To examine
functions of p62 in each cell type, we established a robust system to coculture neuron and astrocytes. This
system recapitulates intercellular interactions found in vivo, and provides an easily manipulatable system for
studying cell-type specific p62 function with high resolution. Using the coculture, I found by immunostain that
metabolic stress (autophagy activator) induces formation of p62-ubiquitin positive structures (i.e., ubiquitinated
cargo) only in neurons. Moreover, blocking ubiquitination significantly reduces p62 puncta formation and
degradation in neurons as compared to astrocytes in basal and stress conditions. Astrocytes are crucial to
combating oxidative stress, but the role of p62 in this pathway in astrocytes is largely unknown. I found that
oxidative stress induces p62 levels selectively in astrocytes. Thus, I hypothesize that p62 functions
primarily in selective autophagy in neurons, and primarily in the antioxidant pathway in astrocytes.
Importantly, ALS-linked mutations in p62 fall in domains important for each function. But how p62 protects
against neurodegeneration in each cell type is not understood. I hypothesize that ALS-linked mutations in
p62 domains that are important for selective autophagy and antioxidant function will impair p62
function in neurons and astrocytes, respectively. To test these hypotheses, I will (Aim 1) define cell-type
specific functions of p62 in neurons and astrocytes, and (Aim 2) determine the effects of ALS-linked mutations
on p62 function in neurons and astrocytes. This study will elucidate cell-type specific contributions of neurons
and astrocytes to neurodegeneration. In turn, understanding cell-type specific contributions to ALS will enable
opportunities for more targeted and specified therapies to mitigate neurodegeneration."
10677791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals’ adaptive immune responses are central to the epidemiology and evolution of influenza and the
effectiveness of influenza vaccines. It is therefore surprising that despite nearly 70 years of study, major
questions about the immune response to influenza remain unanswered. In particular, it is unclear how well
natural infection protects from reinfection with the same or related types and subtypes, how vaccination affects
protection against symptomatic and asymptomatic infections over time, and how protection varies with immune
history, age, individual, sex, and other factors. The two main obstacles to progress have been a shortage of
observations from the same individuals over time and a lack of modeling approaches that can accommodate the
complex, stochastic dynamics of infection and immune response replicated across individuals. The proposed
research takes advantage of an extraordinary influenza cohort and new methods for longitudinal modeling to
understand how protection to influenza infections of varying severity arises, and especially how it is shaped by
infection and vaccination history. The ongoing Nicaragua Pediatric Influenza Cohort Study (NPICS) has followed
thousands of children since 2011 and recorded their antibody titers, infections, symptoms, and vaccination
history to influenza. We will use these data to fit and evaluate a large set of stochastic, individual-level,
mechanistic, dynamical models to estimate the duration of protection and its dependence on exposure history
and other factors. First, we will estimate the duration of protection against reinfection with the same type or
subtype and evaluate its dependence on the order of early exposures and host and viral characteristics. Next,
we will measure the strength and duration of cross-protection between type and subtypes. Finally, we will
compare the dynamics of protection after natural infection to those after vaccination, including repeat
vaccinations. Our flexible modeling approach takes advantage of diverse data types and inference techniques
while allowing precise formulation of biological hypotheses mathematically. Its recent success with similar
longitudinal datasets of PCR-confirmed viral infections and influenza serology demonstrates feasibility.
Preliminary results suggest a role of exposure history on heterosubtypic infection risk. This work is poised to
advance basic knowledge on influenza and the development of immune memory, and it will provide a new set of
dynamical modeling tools for longitudinal data. This project will thus achieve NIH MIDAS objectives by advancing
the development of inference techniques and software for an important and growing type of data and by
expanding knowledge of an important host-pathogen dynamic. This work also directly addresses priorities
established by the NIH Strategic Plan for the development of a universal influenza vaccine, especially identifying
factors associated with the severity of influenza (objective 1.2) and improving understanding of how and when
exposure to influenza antigens shapes the response to infection and vaccination (objective 2.1)."
10885090,"SUMMARY. The majority of cancer patients die of metastases originating from disseminated cancer cells
(DCCs), years and decades after treatment. This has been linked to the ability of DCCs to survive in a dormant
state and evade therapies. Our long-term goal is to understand dormancy of DCCs as a systemic disease
mechanism to target them and prevent relapse. Our overarching hypothesis is that complementary mechanism
between gene programs in primary lesions and target organs niche signals, converge to instruct DCCs in
target organs to enter dormancy via quiescence, pluripotency and survival programs. We further hypothesize
that such signals can be manipulated to suppress metastasis. Using epithelial cancer models we have
discovered that early dissemination spawns mesenchymal-like (M-Like) dormant breast cancer (BC) DCCs.
We also discovered that hypoxia in advanced primary tumors can prime DCC precursors to activate
quiescence programs and enter dormancy in target organs. Importantly, M-like early DCC precursors also
display a strong hypoxia response. Both early and late DCCs were found to respond to retinoic acid, WNT5A,
BMP7 and TGF2 signals derived from stromal target organ niches. These activate transcriptional programs
integrated by ZFP281 (a novel early DCC dormancy regulator) and NR2F1 to induce dormancy. Our new aims
build on these findings and explore three significant new discoveries: 1) Hypoxia signals in early and late
primary lesions turn on quiescence programs that epigenetically imprint DCC precursors to enter dormancy
when they arrive to target organs, 2) early or late DCCs that arrive to the bone marrow (BM) enter dormancy in
response to TGF2 and BMP7 produced by Nestin+/NG2+ mesenchymal stem cells (N+MSCs), which control
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) dormancy; loss of N+MSCs or TGF2 expression in these MSCs led to bone
metastasis and 3), in lungs, early and late DCCs reside in pro-dormancy niches orchestrated by alveolar
macrophages (AMs), which when depleted awaken dormant DCCs. We propose to study how signals from
primary lesion hypoxia along with BM and lung homeostatic niches are integrated to keep DCCs dormant. The
specific aims are: AIM 1. Determine how hypoxia primes DCCs for dormancy. AIM 2. Determine how
NG2+/Nestin+ MSCs orchestrate dormancy niches and how aging affects these mechanisms. AIM 3.
Determine how tissue resident lung alveolar macrophages (AMs) dictate DCC fate and how aging impacts the
function of these niches. Our proposal will integrate how primary lesions (early or late) may pre-program DCCs
for dormancy in defined target organ niches which further reinforce dormancy via specific cues, which may be
affected by aging. This approach will aid the design of rational methods to predict dormancy onset, monitor
residual cancer and develop therapies to induce and maintain dormancy or eradicate minimal residual cancer."
10854807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With a 5-year survival rate of only 47%, high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) remains the most lethal of all
types of ovarian cancer. This is a particular concern for women with familial histories or BRCA mutations, who
exhibit 20 to 35-fold higher risk of developing HGSC in their lifetime. The high mortality of the disease is largely
attributable to the fact that HGSC almost always remains undiagnosed until advanced stages when curative
surgery is no longer feasible. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that most HGSCs likely originate
in the fallopian tubes as precursor lesions called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) that progress
over a period of 6-7 years before rapidly metastasizing to the ovary and surrounding tissues. This suggests
there exists a critical window of time in which STIC lesions and early-stage tumors might be detected so that
tumor progression can be effectively intercepted before reaching an incurable stage. Recent studies have held
out hope by showing that STIC and tumor cells are able to freely travel from the fallopian tubes to the cervix
where they can be readily-detected in routinely-collected Pap specimens. Nonetheless, two notable challenges
to this approach remain: (1) issues associated with the sensitivity and specificity of current biomarkers that
undermine test performance and (2) a cost-effective diagnostic technology with sufficient sensitivity to detect
exceedingly-rare copies of biomarkers from early-stage HGSC in complex samples such as Pap specimens.
In the present proposal, we seek to address both of these challenges by developing a new type of HGSC
screening assay called PapDREAM that is based on the sensitive, cost-effective detection of a novel set of
epigenetic biomarkers that we have recently shown to be prevalently and specifically hypermethylated in both
early, precursor (STIC) lesions and later-stage HGSC tumors. The PapDREAM assay will employ a unique,
digital methylation analysis technique called µ-DREAMing (microfluidic Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by
Melt) that provides a simple, but highly-effective means of detecting and quantifying rare, aberrantly-
methylated DNA, even in challenging samples such as stool, liquid biopsies and Pap specimens. A user-
friendly workflow based on common laboratory instrumentation will be developed to enable PapDREAM to be
readily translated and performed in various research and clinical settings at a cost of only a few dollars per
assay. Ultimately, the PapDREAM assay can be used alone or in combination with other assays to provide an
ideal screening method for women at high risk for developing HGSC.
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise in gynecologic pathology, assay
development and DNA methylation bioinformatics to accomplish this goal by achieving the following aims: (1)
Evaluate and prioritize methylation biomarkers to be included in the PapDREAM assay, (2) Incorporate µ-
DREAMing assays into PapDREAM: a simple, multiplexed digital methylation assay for the detection of early-
stage HGSC, and (3) Assess the clinical performance of the PapDREAM assay in Pap specimens."

PPM1D encodes for a serine/threonine phosphatase that is recurrently amplified and mutated in a wide range of
cancers. We have shown that recurrent C-terminal truncations impair PPM1D degradation by the proteasome,
leading to increased protein levels and activity, and are common in clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid
malignancies after the receipt of chemotherapy. However, the role that PPM1D plays in hematopoiesis during
steady state and under conditions of stress, and the molecular mechanism by with PPM1D is degraded via the
C-terminus remains unclear. We developed two novel mouse models to study PPM1D and now propose in Aim
1 to use these models to investigate how PPM1D loss and PPM1D activation via C-terminal truncation affect
normal hematopoiesis and hematopoiesis in the setting of radiation and inflammation. I have also performed a
genetic screen and found that UBE3C, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates the levels of PPM1D and propose in Aim
2 to determine how UBE3C degrades PPM1D via interactions with the C-terminus and to define the broader
ubiquitin ligase complex regulating PPM1D ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Collectively, this
work will help explain the prevalence of PPM1D mutations in clonal hematopoiesis and therapy-related myeloid
malignancies, define the molecular machinery that regulates PPM1D levels, and shed light on PPM1D as a
potential therapeutic target. The applicant, Dr. Peter Miller, is an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI). He spends 80% of his time in translational research and 20% in clinical practice caring for patients with
cancer. He has outlined a five-year career development plan to meet his goal of becoming an independent
investigator in translational research. Dr. Miller has assembled an Advisory Committee of internationally
recognized experts to provide scientific and career mentorship. He has established collaborations with expertise
in hematopoiesis, mouse models, the ubiquitin proteasome system, mass spectrometry, and applied biostatistics
to provide experimental advice and specific training in the field. Dr. Miller will conduct this research at the DFCI
and leverage the exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI, Harvard, and the Broad Institute.
The DFCI, which harbors an outstanding research community and has a long track record for successful
mentorship of independent physician scientists, is an ideal environment for completion of these experiments and
the realization of Dr. Miller's long-term career goal of being an independent physician-scientist."
10894177,"HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is a key enzyme of the sterol pathway. HMGR undergoes feedback-
regulated degradation conserved from yeast to humans. We exploit this conservation to understand the
machinery and mechanisms at play in regulated degradation of the yeast Hmg2 isozyme. Degradation
occurs by the HRD ER-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control pathway, also responsible for the
degradation of misfolded ER proteins. Hmg2 ERAD is regulated by sterol pathway molecule GGPP.
GGPP accomplishes control by causing reversible misfolding that triggers HRD pathway degradation.
GGPP’s action on Hmg2 has many features of allosteric control; we have named this type of regulation
“mallostery” to combine the ideas of misfolding and allostery. In the proposed studies we will unravel the
mallosteric regulation of Hmg2, to better understand sterol pathway control, and for the high potential
mallostery holds as broadly applicable avenue of drug discovery. Specifically, we will : 1) Study the
features of Hmg2 that allow GGPP-dependent reversible misfolding: GGPP’s effect on the Hmg2
transmembrane regions is highly specific, and requires the broadly conserved sterol sensing domain
(SSD). We will discover the sequence features of Hmg2 responsible for mallosteric control by GGPP,
investigating the role of known Hmg2 motifs and discovering sequence features with unbiased genetic
approaches; 2) Explore the mechanism of GGPP dependent regulation of Hmg2- We will test the
hypothesis that GGPP is a high potency ligand for Hmg2, causing reversible misfolding through
development of direct interaction assays, analysis of GGPP analogues, and through in vitro reconstitution
of regulated ubiquitination of Hmg2 using a number tools and approaches developed in the last funding
cycle; and 3) Discover the role of INSIG proteins in GGPP-mediated misfolding of Hmg2- The INSIG
proteins are critical in mammalian lipid homeostasis, and are conserved in yeast (Nsg1 and 2). As in
mammals, yeast INSIGs function by transducing sterol signals. Yeast INSIG controls GGPP-dependent
Hmg2 misfolding in a manner dependent on the biosynthetic sterol lanosterol. Thus the yeast INSIGs
impose a second layer of regulation on mallosteric regulation by GGPP. We will use the tools, mutants,
and methods from both the previous funding period, and the above studies to explore the mechanism
and physiology INSIG function in Hmg2 regulated stability. We will also execute a genetic screen to glean
the broader biology of INSIGs, about which almost nothing is known despite the key and highly conserved
roles of these proteins in human lipid homeostasis and pathology."
10829467,"Optimizing Syngeneic Mouse Models to Target Mutant p53
Project Abstract
The tumor suppressor gene p53 is the guardian of the human genome. p53 is a transcription factor that
transactivates a battery of target genes in cells upon diverse stressors, including environmental carcinogens
and oncogene activation. Inherited mutations in the p53 coding sequence occur in ~80% of all families with Li-
Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder characterized by a high-penetrance
predisposition to multiple types of cancers. Somatic mutation of the p53 coding sequence occurs in about half
of all cancers. Most alterations in the p53 coding sequence, either germline in LFS patients or somatic in
cancer tissues, are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain that result in an oncogenic protein. Due to
its high mutation frequency and critical role in cancer initiation and progression, mutant p53 is a high-
priority target for the development of anticancer therapies. Several small molecules have been developed
to convert mutant p53 to a form that exhibits some wild-type properties (i.e., p53 reactivation). Such
compounds are in clinical trials, yet none of them have been approved by the FDA. There are several major
types of mouse models for cancer research, each with weaknesses and strengths: syngeneic, human cell line-
derived xenograft, patient-derived xenograft, genetically engineered, and carcinogen-induced. Most therapeutic
programs against mutant p53 use human cell line-derived xenograft, which is immunodeficient. Syngeneic
mouse models, also known as allograft tumor systems, consist of tumor tissues derived from the same genetic
background as a given mouse strain. Syngeneic mouse models with a functional immune system are superior
to human cell line-derived xenografts for immunotherapeutic development. Syngeneic mouse models are
instrumental in developing novel antitumor immunotherapies, yet there are no corresponding models to most
p53 hotspot mutations found in human cancers. In this project, we will study the potential vulnerability of
top somatic human p53 hotspot mutants using optimized syngeneic mouse models. Specifically, we will
knock the top ten human p53 hotspot mutations into representative syngeneic mouse tumor cell lines. We will
test monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the p53 mutants in mice with a functional immune system.
This work will define new uses of syngeneic mouse cell lines and test approaches to validate and credential
the optimized p53 experimental model systems. Our findings will have broad and far-reaching translational
significance by addressing the unmet clinical need for precision medicine against mutant p53."
10874428,"ABSTRACT Astrocytes are critical components of synapses, providing essential metabolic support, regulating
synapse formation, and modulating synaptic firing. The mechanisms by which astrocytes support synaptic
function are largely unknown. In response to neuronal activity, astrocytes produce local calcium spikes that
promote the release of neuroactive transmitters, such as ATP. ATP release from astrocytes is essential for
sustaining neuronal firing, synapse maturation, and plasticity. Prior work in monoculture astrocytes revealed that
lysosomes undergo robust exocytosis and release ATP in response to glutamatergic stimulation. How this
process of lysosome exocytosis occurs within astrocytes that are synaptically connected with neurons
remains unknown. Even less is known regarding the cytoskeletal organization that impacts the trafficking and
transport of lysosomes in astrocyte branches. However, perturbances in the cytoskeletal organization of
astrocytes impairs calcium responses and reduces ATP release, leading to impairments in neurodevelopment
and early onset neurodegeneration. These data suggest that the regulation of lysosome trafficking is
essential in maintaining astrocyte-neuron interactions. My preliminary data suggests that neuronal firing
restricts the mobility of lysosomes in astrocytes and may promote lysosome exocytosis in astrocytes in a non-
cell autonomous manner. Specifically, I find that in developing astrocytes, lysosomes display short-range
bidirectional motility that is dampened by synaptic activity. However, in mature astrocyte branches, lysosomes
are largely immobile, and their motility is insensitive to synaptic activity. Pharmacological perturbations to the
cytoskeleton revealed that this anchoring of lysosomes in astrocytes is likely due to a switch from microtubules
to actin filaments. Based on these data, I hypothesize that as astrocytes mature, lysosomes accumulate in
perisynaptic compartments due to a switch from microtubule to actin cytoskeletal tracks. This localization may
position lysosomes to undergo activity-dependent secretion, releasing contents that support the maturation of
synaptic compartments. To test this hypothesis, I will (Aim 1) define mechanisms of lysosome positioning in
astrocytic branches and (Aim 2) determine the impact of synaptic activity on lysosome exocytosis in astrocytes.
I will use a robust system to coculture neurons and astrocytes to investigate the dynamics of this process with
high spatiotemporal resolution using cutting edge methodology in live cell imaging. Combined, these aims will
define lysosomes in astrocytes as signaling organelles that play crucial roles in synaptic maturation. Knowledge
gained from this study will elucidate new molecular pathways for how astrocytes are key components of the
tripartite synapse and enlighten our understanding of how astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to synaptic
deficiencies in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders."

The clinical and biomedical research culture established in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) and the
Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) led to collaborations within and across institutions that advanced
diagnostic success and biological understandings. In order to provide access to this process for a broader
number of patients, the individualized translational research process developed in the UDN and UDP must be
scaled. The overarching goal of the Clinical Research Support Core of the Data Management Coordinating
Center (DMCC) for Diagnostic Centers of Excellence (DCoEs) is to expand this model. This will be
accomplished through implementation of computational models that predict likelihood of diagnosis, integration
with national and international matchmaking networks, and expanding membership in the undiagnosed and
rare disease ecosystem to include previously under- and unrepresented entities. To achieve this goal, the
Clinical Research Support Core will focus on the following three specific aims: 1) Establish and manage Case
Review Committee meetings and accelerate applicant evaluations, 2) Accelerate diagnostic success by
expanding access of DCoE and UDP investigators and clinicians to expert consultants in other matchmaking
networks unlimited by geography or institution and by automating and standardizing case status updates, and
3) Provide subawards to DCoEs and/or their collaborators to facilitate on-site coordination, data sharing, and
pilot research projects and document progress toward overall DMCC goals."
10911100,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) belongs to a family of pathogenic enveloped RNA viruses of the family Coronaviridae. The ongoing pandemic has caused a public health emergency worldwide, accompanied by dire health and economic consequences. There is evidence suggesting that CoV-2 may have relatively higher infection rates compared to previous epidemic strains of SARS and higher affinity to the receptor ACE2 than SARS-1. In addition, new CoV-2 variants have appeared recently with mutations that correlate with higher infection rates and the ability to escape specific immunity, causing major concerns. A major gap in knowledge remains as to how CoV-2 may have acquired the ability to spread more efficiently, and how new mutations may affect virus infectivity. The overarching goal of this proposal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate CoV-2 cell entry and replication, and how the appearance of new variants could lead to immune escape. We will focus on the role of the host Ubiquitin (Ub) system in promoting CoV-2 infection. This information could help predict appearance of more transmissible variants of coronaviruses, and to develop antiviral approaches by targeting specific steps of the ubiquitination process. Our data recently published in Nature, show that the envelope protein of flaviviruses is K63-linked polyubiquitinated, which enhances virus attachment to host cell receptors. Therefore, we asked whether a similar mechanism applies to SARS-CoV-2. Our preliminary data indicate that CoV-2 structural proteins are ubiquitinated on multiple lysine residue, some of which are not conserved in the original epidemic CoV strain. In addition, new variants of CoV-2 have appeared with mutations on these ubiquitination sites. Our data also suggest that ubiquitination of Spike (S) protein may play a role in stabilizing the CoV-2 S-ACE2 interaction, potentially leading to enhanced entry and pathogenesis. It is currently unknown whether any member of the Coronaviridae family, including SARS-CoV-2, utilize ubiquitination of viral structural proteins as a mechanism of virus attachment and entry. We have also identified E3-Ub ligases of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of proteins, which ubiquitinates viral structural proteins. Our general hypothesis is that the variants of CoV-2 that have gained specific lysine residues provide new Ub acceptor sites on structural proteins, which can enhance virus replication and immune escape. By using in vitro biochemical approaches, novel recombinant mutant viruses, and in vivo models, we will assess how ubiquitination of structural CoV-2 proteins contribute to CoV-2 infectivity. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanistic role of ubiquitination of the CoV-2 S protein in virus replication and antibody escape, and in Aim 2 we will determine the mechanistic role of ubiquitination of the CoV-2 Membrane protein in virus replication and IFN antagonism. The outcome of these studies may help explain how new more infectious viruses may appear by gaining ubiquitination sites and will provide the basis for the development of an antiviral approach that could be applied to a broad range of enveloped viruses."
10899559,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV), responsible for over
one-third of all HIV deaths worldwide. Tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT), which can reduce TB incidence
by 30-50%, is recommended for all PLHIV by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although a new 12-dose,
once-weekly regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) via directly observed therapy (DOT) is now available
and recommended, treatment completion remains a concern. Additionally, DOT is not a feasible strategy for
increasing TB preventive therapy uptake in high burden, low-income settings. To realize the promising
potential of 3HP to reduce TB mortality among PLHIV, there is an urgent need for studies that evaluate
approaches to support treatment completion with self-administered therapy.
The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether low-cost digital adherence technologies (DATs)
can be used to monitor and support completion of 3HP among PLHIV. Our central hypothesis is that a theory-
informed adaptation of DATs to fit users' needs will result in high levels of DAT adoption and implementation
fidelity. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data from my work in using human-centered design (HCD)
methods to adapt a DAT platform to address the adherence challenges faced by patients with active TB. In my
mentor's stepped wedge randomized trial, this adapted DAT platform had high levels of acceptability for
patients and providers, and improved completion of treatment for active TB. The proposed studies will build
upon this prior work to support the use of DATs for scaling-up TB preventive therapy to a key high-risk
population. To test this hypothesis in Aim 1 I will identify barriers and facilitators to the use of DATs for
facilitating 3HP completion among PLHIV. In Aim 2 I will then adapt two low-cost DATs to fit users' needs using
the human centered design methodology. Last, in Aim 3, I will conduct pilot trials to assess the preliminary
effectiveness and implementation of each adapted DAT among PLHIV initiating 3HP. The results will provide
the preliminary data needed for an NIH R01 application proposing a randomized trial to evaluate the
effectiveness, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of one or both contextually adapted DATs for supporting
completion of short-course TB preventive therapy among PLHIV.
The proposed research aims map directly onto my training objectives including designing implementation
interventions using mixed methods research (Aims 1 & 2), tailoring implementation interventions using human-
centered design (Aim 2), and evaluating implementation interventions (Aim 3). Rigorous implementation
science-focused training coupled with an interdisciplinary mentorship team committed to my success will
catalyze me towards my career goal to become an independent physician-scientist focused on improving
uptake of evidence-based interventions to reduce TB burden among PLHIV."
10895365,"Studying hypertension in African-American adults in 2020 is more important than ever in light of recent findings
that 54% of African American adults have hypertension, only 19% have their blood pressure (BP) controlled to
guideline recommended levels, and elevated BP and hypertension account for 33% of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events among African Americans. The 2030 American Heart Association (AHA) impact goal is to
increase the health-adjusted life expectancy of US adults by 3 years over the next decade. Health-adjusted life
expectancy is shorter in African Americans compared with white adults and our preliminary data from the
Jackson Heart Study (JHS) indicates its 7 years shorter among African American adults with versus without
hypertension. In this application, we propose the renewal of the JHS Hypertension Working Group (JHS–
HWG), which will address new high priority BP research questions in African Americans and also serve to
mentor early stage investigators (ESIs) in hypertension research. Given its large sample size and extensive
phenotyping, the JHS is the ideal setting for addressing several knowledge gaps in hypertension among
African Americans. Between 2000 and 2004, 5,306 African Americans were enrolled in the JHS and completed
a baseline study visit that included clinic BP measurements and questionnaires on social determinants of
health and health behaviors. Three study visits have been conducted at which time hypertension onset and
organ damage were assessed. Participants have been followed over 16 years for CVD events. Over the past
two funding cycles (7 years), 30 JHS-HWG ESIs, including 16 under-represented minority investigators, have
published 48 manuscripts with 6 manuscripts undergoing peer review. JHS-HWG ESIs have successfully
obtained grant funding including four R01 awards, seven career development awards (six from NIH and one
from AHA), three diversity supplements, and one pre-doctoral F31 award. For the next grant cycle, we
propose to conduct research in four core thematic areas: (1) social determinants of health and risk for
hypertension and BP control; (2) health behaviors and risk for hypertension and BP control; (3) comparative
research on hypertension in African Americans versus black Africans; and (4) the impact hypertension
prevention and BP control has on increasing health adjusted life expectancy. New training activities for ESIs
include an introduction to interdisciplinary team science, career development planning, grant writing
workshops, group peer mentoring, and writing accountability groups. Also, we will provide career training for
former JHS-HWG ESIs that are now mid-career. The JHS-HWG will be led by principal investigators, who have
a strong collaborative history, and an established track record of publishing high impact hypertension research
and mentoring ESIs. Through the JHS-HWG, we aim to identify approaches to prevent hypertension, improve
BP control and increase health-adjusted life expectancy among African Americans while providing innovative
training and career development opportunities for the next generation of hypertension researchers."

In order to advance science and discover cures for the myriad of human diseases, a workforce comprised of
diverse and academically strong physician-scientists trained in hypothesis-driven research, rigorous and data-
intensive methods, and evidence-based clinical practice is crucial. This cohort of trainees must have specialized
and focused training that integrates rigorous scientific education with state-of-the-art medical training. The overall
goal of The Ohio State University (OSU) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to provide MD-PhD
students with the rigor, depth, and breadth of both scientific and medical education in a way that melds both sets
of training to prepare them to be the future leaders of the biomedical workforce. The expectation is that graduates
of our program will become faculty members at academic, public, or private research enterprises and spend
most of their time conducting research relevant to the improvement of human health. Our program provides the
programmatic structure, curricular content, scientific and clinical guidance, mentoring, facilities, and stimulating
environment to catalyze the integration of research and clinical training essential for a student to become a
successful physician-scientist. We focus on imparting an understanding of the best practices in clinical skills and
research that lead to high clinical acumen, outstanding science that is both rigorous and reproducible, and the
responsible and safe conduct of research and clinical practice. OSU MSTP students will receive a unique blend
of competency-based training from the College of Medicine, the Graduate School, and specific graduate programs
that will synergize to increase the trainees’ ability to translate between the scientific and clinical worlds. As part of
our program, MSTP trainees will receive instruction in technical skills, grant writing, and written and oral
communication that will position them for success in the rapidly advancing academic research field. In addition to
technical training, students in our program receive extensive mentorship throughout their journey from a cohort of
faculty that have received training and embrace this important role. In prior funding periods, students have earned
their degrees in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BGSP), Neuroscience Graduate Studies Program
(NGSP), or Biomedical Engineering (BME). We now have students receiving PhD training in Public Health (PH)
and anticipate future PhDs across the University in carefully vetted affiliate programs. Because of our curricular
integration and careful oversight by MSTP Leadership, the large majority of our students complete their studies
in 8 years. Although our program has doubled in size in the past 10 years, continued growth of our applicant
pool and our faculty makes continued expansion appropriate, and we plan to increase our class from 10 students
per year to 12. In accordance with NIGMS guidelines, we also request an increase in funding to support 25% of
the students in the program. Our goal for this MSTP is to continue to recruit and train the best and brightest
students, developing future leaders who will enable the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to continue
towards its stated mission: To improve people’s lives through innovation in research, education and patient care."
10908389,"ABSTRACT
The potential for complement activation during organ recovery, ischemia reperfusion and antibody-mediated
rejection (AMR) is well-recognized. As a result, numerous therapeutic inhibitors of complement have been
developed and tested in the treatment of AMR. Inhibitors of the terminal complement component C5, and more
recently, C1 the first component of the classical pathway have been tested most extensively. Extensive evidence
indicates C1q functions as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that binds apoptotic cells and mediates a non-
inflammatory clearance by macrophages. In fact, C1q deficient patients and mice do not clear apoptotic cells
efficiently and develop florid autoimmunity. Remarkably little is known about the effects of C1q in transplantation.
However, in recent clinical trials, injury caused by delayed graft function has been diminished by treatment with
C1 inhibitor (C1inh), a serine protease inhibitor that terminates complement activation, but leaves C1q intact.
These results invite the obvious question: Does C1inh work because it truncates the complement cascade and
decreases production of downstream inflammatory mediators or does C1inh work because it leaves C1q intact
to modulate macrophages and cells that express C1q receptors? Of course, these are not mutually exclusive.
More is known about the functions of C5a in antibody induced inflammation. C5a is a potent chemoattractant
and activator of neutrophils and macrophages. However, platelets also express C5aR. We have demonstrated
that platelets accumulate within minutes after antibody binds and activates complement on graft endothelium.
We propose the hypothesis that C1q down modulates whereas C5a upregulates inflammatory responses in
transplants; therefore preserving C1q functions and inhibiting C5a functions will decrease AMR. We will test this
hypothesis in the following 3 specific aims: 1) Test the capacity of C1q to function as a PRR to remove potentially
immunogenic extracellular vesicles during reperfusion after transplantation and decrease the induction of allo-
and autoantibody responses. 2) Test the effects of C5a on neutrophil and macrophage functions in ischemia-
reperfusion and chronic AMR. 3) Test the effects of C5a on platelet functions in acute and chronic AMR. These
specific aims encompass and enhance common threads of our PPG that focuses on mechanisms underlying
AMR. The goal of this proposal is to provide the basis for rational therapeutic enhancement of the beneficial
functions of C1q in transplants and modulation of proinflammatory effects of C3a and C5a."
10819140,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is a mechanism that translates neural activity into either slow or fast
hemodynamic responses. This mechanism is critical for blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, and for maintaining healthy brain tissue. Also, disruptions to NVC
have been linked to an increased risk of cerebrovascular disorders, such as stroke. Despite the importance NVC
has in ensuring a functional brain, the exact process of this complex mechanism is poorly understood. Different
mediators responsible for the hemodynamic responses have been proposed. One of these proposed mediators
is nitric oxide (NO), a strong vasodilator. NO is catalyzed by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
in specific neurons. Our lab has identified a subset of cortical inhibitory neurons that co-express nNOS and
Tachykinin Receptor 1 (TACR1), also known as substance P receptor. These Tacr1 neurons have been
observed to be in proximity with the neurovascular unit. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of Tacr1 neurons
results in increased cerebral blood flow (CBF). Based on our findings, Tacr1 neurons mediate NVC. Even though
Tacr1 neurons express nNOS, whether NO is responsible for the observed changes in CBF during optogenetic
stimulation is unknown. Furthermore, no studies have investigated the cellular inputs that activate Tacr1 neurons.
Previous studies suggest that Tacr1 neurons are depolarized by substance P (SP), but where the source of SP
is coming from is unknown. One possibility is parvalbumin (PV) neurons, which are known to release SP.
Additionally, PV neurons are known to produce gamma-band oscillations, which are strongly correlated to the
BOLD signal . PV neurons may be providing a source of SP for Tacr1 neurons
during high gamma-band activity. As such, Tacr1 neuron activity may increase during high gamma-band activity
causing the release of NO. I propose to determine whether
My proposal comprises of the following aims: Aim 1: Determine the
molecular mechanism through which Tacr1 neuron activity increases cerebral blood flow (CBF). Aim 2: Examine
the cellular inputs that activate Tacr1 neurons. Aim 3: Characterize the endogenous activity of Tacr1 neurons
across brain states. Together, these experiments may reveal the circuitry underlying NVC and the association
with state-dependent changes. This knowledge is fundamental to our understanding of BOLD signal and
cerebrovascular disorders. Finally, in this proposal, I outlined a combination of rigorous mentored research
training, coursework, and professional and leadership development activities that along with this fellowship
training period will be instrumental in my development as an aspiring independent investigator.

10840800,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) driven by high-risk (HR) HPV strains
continues to rise. As HPV (+) disease is prognostic for good post-treatment outcomes and arises in relatively
young patients with fewer co-morbidities, clinicians now recognize it as a distinct clinical entity from tobacco-
associated HPV (-) disease. But despite improved survival following surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation
(CRT), many HPV (+) OPC patients suffer prolonged morbidity from severe treatment-associated toxicities.
This has led to many treatment de-intensification clinical trials, which seek to reduce toxic side effects while
maintaining historic survival rates. Ideally, high-risk patients would remain on standard regimens while low to
intermediate-risk patients would receive de-escalated therapy. However, there is a great clinical need for an
objective biomarker of risk to aid the subjective clinical assessments: pre-treatment imaging and postoperative
pathology. Liquid biopsies can offer such objectivity; they quantify cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shed by cancer cells,
called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), in biofluids like saliva or plasma. Further, in HPV (+) OPC, cell-free HPV
DNA (cf-HPV) parallels ctDNA as a measure of minimal residual disease (MRD). But plasma and saliva assays
lack sensitivity to detect this cf-HPV MRD after surgery. To this clinical challenge, we offer our novel liquid
biopsy assay of Jackson Pratt (JP) surgical drain fluid (SDF). We believe SDF will be enriched with cf-HPV
compared to plasma because it's more proximal to the primary tumor resection site and to the lymph nodes,
where locoregional micrometastases are seeded. Additionally, because the JP drains also capture lymph fluid
from the lacerated cervical lymphatic system, we also believe the SDF contains informative effector leukocytes
that were in transit to the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) of metastatic nodes and the primary tumor. To
begin to elucidate the prognostic potential of SDF, we have collected paired SDF, plasma, tumor biopsy, and
metastatic lymph node samples. First, using PCR and next-generation sequencing approaches we will quantify
the cf-HPV burden in paired plasma and SDF samples. Then we will compare cf-HPV in each sample type
individually to histopathological markers of risk (extranodal extension and tumor stage) and recurrences. We
will then track tumor-informed variants on ctDNA, isolated from plasma and SDF, to show that ctDNA levels
align with cf-HPV and further validate that cf-HPV is a good proxy for MRD. Lastly, we will use digital cytometry
tools and mass cytometry to immunophenotype the immune cells within the SDF to determine if they reflect
immune response gene expression levels in paired metastatic nodes and tumors. If confirmed, our study has
the potential to demonstrate that tri-biomarker analysis (immune cell, cf-HPV, and ctDNA) in a novel liquid
analyte (SDF) can provide precision risk-stratification to aid subjective clinical diagnostics."

During embryogenesis and in adult, the delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation of the diverse
cellular populations in the Salivary Gland (SG) must be tightly regulated to ensure normal tissue development
and homeostasis. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms driving the cell fate decisions and
lineage choices that anchor salivary gland morphogenesis will help identify pathways that are critical for tissue
regeneration following injury, damage, or during diseased states. Xbp-1, specifically the spliced and
transcriptionally active Xbp-1, isoform, has been implicated in Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), differentiation
and a host of other biologically important cellular processes. Our knowledge of Xbp-1 in context of the SG is
limited to scRNA-seq data showing Xbp-1 to be highly expressed in pro-acinar cells (the precursors to acinar
cells) as well as a previously uncharacterized acinar cell phenotype observed in Xbp-1 null mice. The highly
enriched expression of Xbp-1 in the SG and its association with super-enhancers as revealed by our analysis of
genomic and epigenomics datasets, has led us to hypothesize that Xbp-1 plays an important and molecularly
deterministic role in regulating cellular identity and function in the SG. However, the molecular mechanisms
through which Xbp-1, dictates cell fate decisions and controls specific gene expression programs during SG
development remains unexplored. To address these knowledge gaps, we will utilize conditional Xbp-1 knockout
mouse models and sophisticated genomic/transcriptomic approaches to study three independent areas of
interest. First, we will identify the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Xbp-1 in diverse SG cell types and
measure the relative abundance of unspliced and spliced isoforms through developmental stages and during
adult gland maintenance utilizing immunostainings and qRT-PCR (Aim 1). Second, we will use a conditional
knockout (cKO) mouse model to determine the role of Xbp-1, during SG development and adult homeostasis
(Aim 2). Such studies are necessary as they will identify, for the first time, the in vivo functional role of Xbp-1 in
the SG. Finally, we will perform mechanistic studies to identify critical target genes and pathways that are
governed by Xbp-1 and determine how the loss of Xbp-1 alters the gene expression program of the SG.
Importantly, by implementing scRNA-seq studies, we will evaluate effects of loss of Xbp-1 on cell fate trajectories
specifically during acinar development and maturation (Aim 3). Collectively, these studies will further our
understanding of the Xbp1-dependent transcriptional and cellular networks important for the biological function
of the SG particularly as it pertains to secretory acinar cell differentiation. Advances in our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms driving SG development can provide a paradigm for regeneration, identify potential
therapeutic targets to increase salivary flow in patients suffering from hyposalivation, and better inform therapies
to treat patients with developmental dysfunctions and diseases of the salivary gland."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) currently affects more than 4 million Americans and over
50 million individuals worldwide. The identification of prevention strategies for dementia is critical, particularly
due to the lack of effective treatments. In parallel, there is growing consensus that lipid metabolism is a major
contributor to ADRD and may be an important strategy for risk reduction and prevention. Antihyperlipidemic
agents (i.e., statins) are widely used, yet evidence on the relationship between antihyperlipidemic agents (i.e.,
statins) and ADRD has been largely inconclusive. One possible explanation for the mixed findings is
heterogeneity in study populations and their characteristics. For example, the effectiveness of statins is
evidenced to vary by age, ApoE4 status, and pre-existing disease status.34-36 Accordingly, there is a growing
need to identify the factors (i.e., effect modifiers) which influence heterogeneities in the effect of statins on
dementia. The objective of this study is to triangulate evidence on the identification and estimation of
heterogeneous treatment effects by using three causal machine learning methods, specifically the honest
causal forest/policy tree, doubly robust adaptive LASSO, and Bayesian Adaptive Regression Trees (BART), to
identify novel effect modifiers and optimal subgroups for the effect of statins on dementia. While traditional
parametric regression approaches are designed to test a priori hypotheses regarding effect modification, such
approaches are not suitable for yielding novel hypotheses. The causal machine learning methods described in
this proposal fill this gap; not only do such approaches help identify novel effect modifiers, but they can also
facilitate the subsequent identification of optimal treatment rules across those modifiers. In this study, I propose
to use a cohort of 307,719 individuals from the UK Biobank data who were at least 55 when they were initially
recruited from 2006 to 2010. The analytical sample will be large, allowing me to rigorously investigate
heterogeneous treatment effects across different subgroups. Specifically, in Aim 1, I propose to estimate the
real-world average treatment effect (ATE) of statins on ADRD across the entire sample. I will then, in Aim 2,
apply three causal machine learning algorithms to identify novel effect modifiers and corresponding optimal
subgroups for the effect of statin use on ADRD risk. Finally, in Aim 3, I will quantify the reduction in ADRD
cases that would result from implementing each of the optimal treatment rules generated under Aim 2 and
compare them to the reduction in ADRD cases observed under Aim 1. This F31 proposal application will
support my dissertation research, as well as my interest in gaining training in causal machine learning, as well
as substantive training in dementia, cognitive aging, and its psychometric methods. Under the guidance of my
mentorship team, I look forward to advancing dementia prevention research while also pursuing my goal of
becoming an independent investigator in research methods on cognitive aging."
10837841,"This is a first competitive renewal application for a thriving T32 Research Training Program in Cardiovascular
Surgery. Cardiovascular diseases and their complications are leading causes of death and disability in the United
States. The health implications of surgical cardiovascular disease create a strong need to ensure sustained
research by training future investigators in the field. Unfortunately, graduates of cardiac and vascular surgery
training programs face steep challenges to establishing research careers. Taking advantage of our position in
the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical complex in the world, our postdoctoral training program in cardi-
ovascular surgical research is designed to: (1) increase the pool of MDs and PhDs who enter cardiovascular
surgical research careers, and (2) provide our trainees with the skills necessary to be successful and productive
in cardiovascular research. We accept two trainees per year (MD surgery residents, other clinicians, or PhDs)
into three training tracks, each two years in duration: bioengineering and biodesign, basic and translational re-
search, and data science and health services research. Trainees can pursue diverse research career training
opportunities, yet in all cases the focus is on addressing a clinical problem relevant to cardiovascular surgeons.
To provide a range of training opportunities and mentorship, we have recruited 22 mentors from Baylor College
of Medicine (BCM), Rice University, and the University of Houston. Within the three training tracks, the 22 men-
tors are grouped into specific themes, such as “aortic disease,” based on their expertise and existing collabora-
tive relationships. Each track allows trainees the option of completing a degree, such as a Master’s Degree in
Bioinformatics; [all tracks include a mandatory Grant Writing course.] Our Program Director is Todd Rosengart,
MD, Chair of the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery at BCM; Co-Directors are Scott LeMaire, MD, Vice
Chair for Research, and Barbara Trautner, MD, PhD, Director of Clinical and Health Services Research. Our
leadership is supported by an Executive Steering Committee, a diverse panel of 11 local experts in research
education and mentoring. Program leadership is also guided by an External Advisory Committee composed of
five scientists who have all directed and/or served as a mentor in T32 training programs. Over the past five
application years, we received 91 inquiries about the program from across the United States, leading to 10
trainees entering the program, three of whom were from surgical residency programs outside Houston. Our
outreach through national professional organizations that support groups underrepresented in the scientific work-
force has been fruitful; [36% of our accepted applicants are from a group underrepresented in biomedical sci-
ences. Our three PhD graduates all secured an academic research position; our three MD graduates returned
to clinical training. Collectively our trainees have published 64 manuscripts with their mentors, and three trainees
secured external funding.] We look forward to the opportunity for our program to continue to grow the pool of
highly qualified MDs and PhDs contributing to the high-impact arena of research in cardiovascular surgery."

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Hispanic/Latinos are the largest
and fasting growing ethnic group in the US, and cancer is the leading cause of death among H/L in the US.
Therefore, we need to fully understand the full complexity of the molecular etiology of cancer in this ethnic group.
For instance, although incidence rates of CRC are lower among Latinos as compared to Whites or African
Americans, Hispanics with metastatic disease have shorter overall survival when adjusted for health care setting,
demographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors. H/L also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age
and with higher stage, and we have previously reported that Mexican H/L in California have the greatest
proportion of young (<50 years of age) diagnoses compared to other H/L subgroups. Moreover, Mexican H/L
showed higher prevalence of rectal cancer cases compared to other H/L and NHW. Although socio-economics
and access to care might influence these differences, we need to take a complete look at the biology of disease
in this ethnic group to determine once and for all if these clinical differences are related to differences in molecular
etiology. The Cancer Genome Atlas has provided a deep overview of the molecular taxonomy of CRC in 594
cases, however, less than 1% of the cases (n=5) were H/L. Therefore, it is imperative for us to take more detailed
assessment of the molecular genomic landscape of CRC in H/L. One of the major issues likely limiting our ability
to perform these large genomic initiatives in minority patients is that Patient or Participant Engagement practices
may not been investigated to identify best practices for accruing and consenting patients into clinical translational
biomedical research studies. This concept of Participant Engagement is critically important for both the patients
and the translational cancer research community. Optimizing and improving our approaches for directly
engaging patients at initial contact, throughout the course of a translational genomic study, and during the time
of return of results is likely to lead to stronger relationships between the medical community and patients, but
could also lead to significant improvement in outcomes for patients and for the cancer care community as a
whole. As such, we propose the creation of the USC Center for Optimization of Participant Engagement in
Cancer Characterization (COPECC) with a focus on optimizing the engagement of Latinos in CRC Genomic
Characterization research studies. USC COPECC would serve as a member of the NCI U2C Participant
Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network. Our investigative team includes experts in
all relevant areas of research for genomic characterization, participant engagement, and engagement
optimization. We have an established platform for consenting patients into cancer genomics studies that will
serve as a standard process. The overall goal of USC COPECC is to generate results on participant engagement
optimization and CRC genomic research that will be shared with the broader community to distribute best
practices for engaging Latinos in hopes of improving overall outcomes for CRC in this underserved population."
10894862,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by the accumulation of numerous
renal cysts leading to a progressive decline in kidney function which frequently culminates in end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). Aberrant tubular epithelial cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration, and tubulointerstitial
fibrosis are important contributors to PKD progression; however, factors promoting these events remain
undetermined.
 Systemic phosphate balance is tightly regulated, with renal excretion of phosphate being critically important
for the elimination of excess dietary phosphate. When functional nephron numbers are reduced, as in PKD,
phosphate excretion by residual nephrons is dramatically increased to preserve phosphate balance. Fibroblast
growth factor 23 (FGF23), a circulating hormone that induces urinary phosphate excretion, is elevated in early-
stage PKD and is primarily responsible for this maintenance of phosphate balance by the kidneys. Both high
dietary phosphate consumption and elevated FGF23 are associated with a more rapid decline in renal function
in chronic kidney disease (CKD), indicating that increased urinary phosphate excretion may contribute to
decrements in kidney function. We propose that high concentrations of tubular phosphate are nephrotoxic,
leading to progressive kidney injury, immune cell infiltration, and fibrosis. In preliminary studies, we observed
phosphaturic mouse models to exhibit evidence of early kidney injury and fibrosis. Moreover, additional
experiments revealed dietary phosphate restriction slows PKD progression in several mouse models of cystic
kidney disease.
 The kidney expression of osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular protein that is produced by tubular epithelial
cells and uses an ASARM peptide motif to enhance phosphate solubility in urine, is increased in rodent models
of both phosphaturia and cystic kidney disease. In addition to its function of inhibiting mineral aggregation,
OPN has established functions to stimulate cell proliferation and enhance macrophage recruitment to sites of
injury; thus, kidney OPN production in PKD may contribute to the pathophysiology of cyst formation and
associated pathology.
 We hypothesize that high concentrations of tubular phosphate in PKD contribute to epithelial cell injury and
OPN production, which together promote cyst epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage recruitment that
accelerate kidney disease progression. We will use the proposed experiments to determine: (1) the impact of
high urine phosphate on PKD progression, (2) the role of osteopontin in mediating the effect of high dietary
phosphate on cyst growth, macrophage recruitment and interstitial fibrosis, (3) if administration of a decoy
ASARM peptide can enhance the solubility of tubular phosphate and prevent PKD progression, and (4) the
prevalence, composition, and surrounding pathology of mineral aggregates in human and mouse PKD kidneys."
10837753,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epstein-Barr virus is an important cause of human Burkitt lymphomas (BLs), Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) and
diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), particularly in AIDS patients. Although the EBV protein EBNA2 (which
mimics Notch signaling) is required for EBV-induced transformation of B cells in vitro, cells that express EBNA2
have the “type III” form of viral latency, which is highly immunogenic. Thus, most EBV-infected human
lymphomas, including BLs, HLs and DLBCLs, do not express EBNA2, even in AIDS patients. There is currently
no in vivo or in vitro model available to study how EBV infection causes lymphomas in the absence of EBNA2
expression. BLs, which are largely driven by MYC translocations, have stringent type I latency (expressing only
a single EBV protein, EBNA1) and currently the major role of EBV in BLs is thought to be prevention of MYC-
induced apoptosis by the virally-encoded microRNAs. EBV+ HLs, which have type II latency, express only three
viral proteins (EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2A) and are thought to be driven by the LMP1 (a CD40 mimic) and LMP2A
(a BCR mimic) proteins, in conjunction with cellular mutations that activate JAK/STAT signaling and a supportive
CD4+ T cell-rich microenvironment. Here we propose to use a novel in vitro cell culture model, in combination
with a cord blood-humanized (CBH) mouse model developed by our lab, to examine whether an EBNA2-deleted
EBV mutant recently constructed by our lab (ΔEBNA2 EBV) can induce BL-like, HL-like or DLBCL-like
lymphomas in vitro or in vivo when specific oncogenic pathways known to be induced in each type of tumor are
activated, or tumors suppressor genes (TSGs) associated with these tumors are inactivated. Our promising
preliminary results already suggest that over-expressing the MYC oncogene in B cells infected with the EBNA2-
deleted EBV allows cells to form BL-like tumors with type I latency in NSG mice. In Aim 1, we will determine if
ΔEBNA2 EBV cooperates with MYC, BCL6 and/or cyclin D3 over-expression to induce BL-like and/or germinal
center (GC) type DLBCL-like lymphomas in NSG mice. In Aim 2, we will determine if ΔEBNA2 EBV cooperates
with JAK/STAT activation or inhibition of plasma cell differentiation to cause HL-like lymphomas in NSG mice.
In Aim 3, we will identify novel cellular gene mutations/alterations that cooperate with ΔEBNA2 EBV to induce
BL- and/or HL-like or DLBCL-like lymphomas in NSG mice and define the mechanism(s) for this synergy. We
hypothesize that EBNA2-deleted EBV will cooperate with cellular alterations commonly found in EBV+ BLs
and/or HLs to induce BL-like and/or HL-like lymphomas in vivo (although the cellular mutations required to induce
BL-like versus HL-like tumors will be different), and that our approach will also identify novel cellular gene
alterations that cooperate with stringent EBV latency to cause AIDS-related lymphomas in humans."
10900450,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common among older individuals in the United States, with 26.7 million cases
projected by 2050, an almost 4.5-fold increase from 2005, and the vast majority of these individuals have
overweight or obesity. Type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity are often described as accelerators of biological
aging due to associations with decreased lifespan, increased disability risk, and reduced health-related quality
of life. Yet, not all individuals with these conditions face the same prognosis in later life, and some continue to
maintain relatively high levels of function and independence. This suggests that strategies could be identified
to promote healthier later-life experiences. It is natural to consider that behavioral intervention to promote and
maintain weight loss may mitigate against the consequences of aging.
 We propose to conduct the Look AHEAD Extension-2 (LA-E2) in response to RFA-AG-21-028 Limited
Competition for the Continuation of the Look AHEAD Study, which emphasizes “assessing important health-
related outcomes over time” in a cohort that has been extensively characterized over 18 years, with an
emphasis on “outcomes that are relevant to healthy aging and resilience; major health events; healthcare
utilization; and relevant behavioral and other factors that predict, mediate, or otherwise inform the long-term
health effects of a multi-domain lifestyle intervention designed to produce and maintain weight loss in aging
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.” We plan to enroll approximately 2600 Look AHEAD participants who had
been randomly assigned to 10 years of either Intensive Lifestyle Intervention that successfully induced and
maintained weight loss or a comparator condition of Diabetes Support and Education. These individuals will be
followed for 4 additional years, using telephone interviews and Medicare linkage, to assess the legacy of this
intervention on important later-life outcomes.
 The RFA targets five domains of outcomes: 1) Multimorbidity, 2) Physical function, 3) Cognitive function, 4)
Health care utilization and costs, and 5) Health related quality of life and health status. These goals and
outcomes frame our primary aims. We also have important secondary aims, as specified in the RFA, “to study
the heterogeneity of diabetes and chronic disease development in this well-characterized, diverse study
population.” We will describe how later-life outcomes are associated with clinical measures, medication use,
and behaviors and how intervention effects vary among individuals depending on their gender, race/ethnicity,
age, obesity, and health status. We will also maintain the Look AHEAD cohort as a source of discovery by
promoting ancillary studies, dissemination, and the distribution of well-documented public use data, and
through scientific interest groups.
 Our overarching goal is to provide information that is vital for improving the care of older individuals with type
2 diabetes mellitus and overweight or obesity."

processing and machine learning approaches in a generalizable framework for bioentity and relation
extraction from large-scale text. Our Protein Ontology supports protein-centric semantic integration of
biomedical data for both human understanding and computational reasoning. We have also developed a

(PTMs) across modification types and organisms. Building on our computational algorithms,
bioinformatics infrastructure and community interactions, we will further develop literature mining tools to
support automated information extraction across the bibliome and open linked data models for semantic

system to assist in hypothesis generation. We will present evidence in the form of textual artifacts and
semantic models to ensure unbiased analysis and interpretation of results to promote rigorous and
reproducible research. We will develop scientific case studies to drive the system development.
Examples include PTM disease variant and enrichment analyses for drug target identification, genotype-
phenotype knowledge mining for Alzheimer's Disease understanding, and gene-disease-drug knowledge
network construction for COVID-19 drug repurposing. To foster community engagement, we will host
workshops and hackathons to address critical fundamental research questions and emerging disease

10900681,"Project Summary/Abstract: Project 1, Sources and Mechanisms of Sequential Activity
Sequential activity is widespread and predominant across the mouse brain during an evidence-accumulation
decision task and in other tasks as well. Such activity may form a “temporal scaffold,” on top of which other
variables are encoded in the amplitude of these sequentially active responses. This activity, different from the
ramps and persistent activity often studied in perceptual decisions, could be driven by navigation. The first aim
will be to test this idea by identifying conditions that produce sequential representations, such as the task’s
timing structure, navigation through spatial locations, or visual stimulation. To distinguish these possibilities, we
will record neural activity from regions containing sequential activity during tasks that isolate these key
features: active navigation, passive navigation, and visual stimulation. This work will establish whether removal
of task features eliminates sequential activity, producing ramps or persistence.
 The second aim will be to use focal cooling to test a potential role of the striatum as a master temporal
scaffold. Medium spiny neurons of dorsal medial striatum (DMS) show sequential activity. Inactivation of this
region in the cue period has large effects on choice, yet few DMS sequences are choice-specific in this period.
We propose instead that DMS generates a temporal scaffold that controls the timing of choice and
evidence-encoding sequences in neocortex and hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, we will use focal cooling
to slow striatal neural dynamics, while recording in neocortex and hippocampus. These results will constrain
models of sequence generation and reveal the mechanistic foundations of sequential neural activity.
 The third aim will be to identify network architectures that could underlie the observed data, by building
models with three architectures that generate choice-selective sequences. In the moving bump attractor model,
activity location in a population jointly encodes position and evidence. In the competing-chains model,
evidence is encoded in amplitude, while position is encoded in activity location, in two competing sequences.
In the position-evidence multiplicative model, evidence is accumulated in classic ramping activity that controls
the gain of activity that is sequentially activated with position. These models will make testable experimental
predictions to help us distinguish these network architectures.
 The fourth aim will be to compare ultrastructural anatomical connectivity with neural coding. We will use
cellular-resolution imaging of neural activity during behavior, followed by serial-section electron microscopy of
the same neurons in the dorsal hippocampus and neocortex, to empirically test network models of sequential
activity. Together, the results of this project will identify task features, brain regions, neural architectures, and
microscale anatomy underlying the appearance, timing, and function of sequential activity. We expect that the
experiments and models in this project will substantially advance three priority areas of the BRAIN Initiative:
the brain in action, demonstrating causality, and identifying fundamental principles."
10911190,"Project Summary/Abstract
In studying the PI3 Kinase isoform dependence of different tumor types, we made an extremely surprising
finding that now turns out to have considerable clinical importance. This finding forms the basis for this OIA
application. We discovered that tumors driven by the loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor are uniquely
dependent on the p110β isoform of PI3 Kinase. This finding likely explains why PI3K inhibitors first tested on
PTEN null tumors failed in the clinic, as they were poor p110β inhibitors. New p110b specific compounds are
now showing clinical promise. In attempting to understand the molecular mechanisms that uniquely couple
PTEN loss to p110β activation, we have uncovered a set of molecular mechanisms, which not only explains
how p110β is activated in response to PTEN loss but also suggests why the same tumors might quickly
become partially or even totally resistant to PI3K inhibition. Notably the same mechanisms clearly suggest
other drug targets, which can and should be attacked in combination with PI3K in PTEN null tumors. Our very
recent data identify 2 proteins that uniquely interact with p110β, and not with p110α, form a positive feedback
loop in the absence of PTEN. One of these proteins is the small ras family GTPase known as Rac, which
interacts with p110β but not p110α. We have recently shown that Rac localizes p110b to the lipid rafts where it
is activated. Thus Rac is an upstream activator of p110β. However Rac family members are unique in that
their activators, the Rac GEFs, are activated by the phosphoinositide products of PI3Ks. Thus Rac is also a
downstream effector of p110β. The interactions of Rac and p110β constitute the very definition of a positive
feedback loop. However, this leaves open how the Rac/p110β feedback loop is initiated- what activates
p110β/Rac in the first place. We have found that the activation event is dependent the small adapter protein
CRKL which is also a p110β specific binding protein. Activation of CRKL occurs via a SRC/p130Cas signaling
cascade that is also activated by PTEN loss. Notably SRC signaling renders cells resistant to PI3K inhibition.
Finally and most exciting we have found that p110b inhibitors synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. We
have generated data already showing the inhibitors of SRC RAC PAK (another downstream target of RAC)
lipid raft formation and immune checkpoints can all combine well with p110b inhibitors in vitro, and in some
cases, in vivo. This grant will focus more rigorous testing of new drug combinations on the one hand and on
the other hand, further refining our mechanistic understanding of the effects of PTEN loss to generate even
better combination therapy."
10927264,"ABSTRACT
Humans can skillfully control their grasp during actions as complex and dynamic as swinging a tennis racket,
and as simple and static as holding a briefcase. Both tasks require the use of sensory feedback to achieve
and maintain an appropriate grasp force. There is evidence that motor and somatosensory cortices
communicate task-relevant information in order to enable skillful movement. Our primary goal is to uncover the
motor cortical dynamics underlying grasp force control and determine the extent to which these dynamics are
mediated by behavioral context and corticocortical communication of somatosensory feedback.
We propose to study the cortical control of grasp by leveraging the unique experimental paradigms afforded by
a bidirectional human brain-computer interface study in which participants with tetraplegia have intracortical
electrode arrays implanted in motor and somatosensory cortex. Previous work, primarily focused on reaching
movements, has demonstrated that motor cortex exhibits population dynamics that are constrained within low-
dimensional manifold. We have identified similar dynamic responses within human motor cortex that contain
information about grasp force. However, these responses are task-dependent and can change as the
complexity of the proximal arm movement changes. Here we will extend that work to study the context-
dependence of M1 dynamics across a range of static and dynamic hand and arm movements including both
overt and covert (i.e., imagined) behaviors.
Sophisticated motor control relies on sensory information to shape neural control signals emanating from motor
cortex, yet very little is known about the flow of information from somatosensory to motor cortex for the control
of the hand. We aim to quantify the corticocortical communication pathways across a range of task contexts
through the analysis of simultaneous neural recordings in motor and somatosensory cortex. We will then use
intracortical microstimulation to probe these communication pathways while providing task-relevant sensory
feedback as well as task-irrelevant stimulation as a control. Finally, we will use a brain-computer interface to
test whether there is the potential for plasticity within the corticocortical communication circuits, or whether
communication is constrained by between-area dynamics. Successful completion of this proposal will lead to
new knowledge about the role of M1 in dynamic and static grasp behaviors. We will quantify how
somatosensory input is communicated with M1 and whether corticocortical communication pathways can be
modified through training, which has relevance to understanding skill learning and improving rehabilitation."
10851793,"Project Summary
Pregnancy is associated with a striking increase of uterine blood flow that is essential for normal fetal
development as well as for cardiovascular well-being of the mother. Hypoxia during pregnancy has profound
adverse effects on uterine artery hemodynamics adaptation, increasing incidence of pregnancy complications
including preeclampsia and fetal intrauterine growth restriction. Previous studies in an animal model of pregnant
sheep acclimatized to high altitude hypoxia demonstrated that pregnant ewes were similar to pregnant women
in that they both showed an increase in uterine vascular resistance and elevation in maternal systemic blood
pressure in response to gestational hypoxia. Yet, much remains unknown of the mechanisms underlying
maternal cardiovascular maladaptation to chronic hypoxia during pregnancy. Our preliminary study in sheep
suggests a highly novel mechanism of a monomeric G protein, Rad in inhibition of L-type CaV1.2 calcium channel
currents in the uterine artery. The L-type CaV1.2 calcium channel, as the major pathway of Ca2+ influx, is essential
for vascular smooth muscle contractions and plays a central role in regulating organ blood flow and arterial
pressure. We identify that both ovine and human Rad gene promoters have multiple estrogen response elements
(EREs), suggesting a robust mechanism of sex steroid hormones in the regulation of Rad gene expression in
the uterine artery. In addition, the approach of RNA-seq analysis revealed a downregulation of Rad gene
expression in uterine arteries of pregnant ewes acclimatized to high altitude hypoxia. Of importance, we
demonstrated that chronic hypoxia during gestation abrogated pregnancy-induced upregulation of Rad protein
expression and increased CaV1.2 channel currents in ovine uterine arteries. These exciting findings and many
highly novel leads provide a strong scientific premise for us to move the field forward significantly by launching
a new focus of research aimed at understanding the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of Rad in regulating
CaV1.2 channel currents and phenotypic programming of uterine vascular adaptation to pregnancy and
gestational hypoxia. The proposed study will be conducted in a unique animal model of pregnant sheep exposed
to high altitude (3801 m/12,470 ft) hypoxia during gestation. The overall hypothesis of the proposed study is that
Rad is a novel regulatory mechanism and plays an essential role in the regulation of L-type CaV1.2 calcium
channel currents and uterine vascular adaptation to pregnancy and gestational hypoxia. The proposed study
has the strong scientific premise with a novel conceptual framework and mechanistic approach. It will provide
new insights into fundamental mechanisms in uterine vascular adaptation to pregnancy, and will have a major
impact on our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying pregnancy complications including
preeclampsia caused by gestational hypoxia. Of importance, the similarity in uterine artery hemodynamics and
maternal blood pressure responses to gestational hypoxia between pregnant ewes and pregnant women, as
well as likely common mechanisms of Rad gene regulation by sex steroid hormones, will provide much needed
translational relevance of the proposed study in the understanding of maternal cardiovascular complications in
response to hypoxia during pregnancy."

The goal of this project is to find new neural substrates governing metabolic state in Drosophila melanogaster.
Success of organisms through evolutionary time depends upon their ability to optimize utilization of resources.
When environments become unfavorable, animals will preserve energy and attenuate reproduction. This strategy
requires perception and assessment of a complex environment, which is an ancient role of the nervous system.
Many metabolic disorders in humans, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, remain incompletely understood,
but probing an underlying role for the nervous system remains a monumental challenge. Here, we propose to
exploit the genetic accessibility and cellular resolution experiments possible in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster,
to explore how the brain sets metabolic and reproductive state. Given the importance of environmental
adaptation, we expect the biological principles underlying these strategies to be highly conserved among motile
animals with nervous systems, including flies and humans. The Meiselman lab seeks to establish a network map
for the nervous system components that permit the fly brain to change metabolic state, thereby laying
groundwork for investigations in organisms with brains of higher complexity.
 During my postdoc I showed that DN3 circadian neurons and expression of their operant neuropeptide,
Allatostatin-C (AstC), are temperature-sensitive and terminate cold-induced reproductive arrest when warm
temperatures return. In this proposal, we will find the minimal neural subset that depends on temperature
information from DN3s and adjusts reproductive output, then examine how their innate activity responds to
temperature change with calcium imaging (Aim 1.1). Next, we will determine if the minimal subset controlling
reproduction causes changes to rhythmicity, feeding, and metabolic rate (Aim 1.2). We will then investigate a
second subset of neurons that depress reproduction when activated, heart-innervating LkAC neurons. We will
assess their role in modulation of metabolism (Aim 2.1) and examine if their activity affects heartbeat (Aim 2.2).
Finally, we will find the molecular (Aim 3.1) and neural (Aim 3.2) substrates that attenuate reproduction in
response to noxious percepts (hunger, thirst, and high heat). In sum, this work will offer comprehensive insight
into how the nervous system integrates sensory information to control metabolic state and reproduction.
 This project will present opportunities for diverse students at a minority-serving institution (UNLV) to
engage in research which utilizes cutting-edge techniques. My co-mentors Dr. Mariana Wolfner and Dr. Frank
van Breukelen, and collaborators Drs. Allen Gibbs and Nilay Yapici collectively have world-leading expertise in
fly genetics, metabolism, and neurobiology. Their support will allow me to foster a successful laboratory
environment wherein I can offer top notch mentorship to my students and reach my career goals. In addition to
critical technical skills, my mentors will offer me guidance that will allow me to establish a successful extramurally
funded research program, and to unveil new insights into the interface between brain and metabolic state."
10850704,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms
and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools
for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly
important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory
applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein
structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the
principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical
applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites,
and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to
better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which
the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune
diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo
design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell
receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem
repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent
display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we
have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their
peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular
simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein
constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health."
10903870,"SUMMARY (Project 2)
A key theme of this Program Project Grant is that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) makes
specific contacts with both lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and certain high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
subspecies to export lipids from cells to generate mature HDL. This removal of cholesterol from the artery wall
protects against cardiovascular disease. Project 2 picks up on Project 1’s observation that small HDLs are a
subspecies that promotes cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 and that it is especially important for cardioprotection in
diabetes. In addition, we found that the presence of HDL’s second-most abundant protein, apolipoprotein A-II
(APOA2), also promotes ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to fully lipidated HDL particles. These
observations counter the commonly accepted idea that only lipid-poor apolipoproteins can engage ABCA1.
Taking a mechanistic and functional approach, the main goal of Project 2 will be to understand how lipidated
forms of HDL can interact with ABCA1 to promote lipid efflux. The central hypothesis is that the APOA1 in
small HDLs, and in those containing APOA2, undergoes a conformational change, possibly in its C-terminus,
that allows it to interact with ABCA1 (called the “Flipped Ends’ hypothesis). Aim 1 will use high-resolution cryo-
EM and other structural techniques to understand how APOA2 affects APOA1’s structure and its functionality
in cholesterol efflux assays. We will work hand-in-hand with Project 3 to not only model APOA1/A2 interactions
but also to visualize how those particles interact with ABCA1. The specific APOA2 sequences involved will be
identified with an eye toward developing therapeutics that stimulate the transfer of cholesterol from ABCA1 to
lipid-containing HDL particles. Aim 2 will use novel mutations of APOA1 that alter the sizes of HDL particles
along with sophisticated particle reconstitution and structural techniques, such as hydrogen-deuterium
exchange, to identify structural features in small HDL that allow it to engage with ABCA1. We will also identify
and structurally characterize HDL subparticles in human plasma that can interact with ABCA1. Therapeutics
that boost levels of lipid-poor APOA1 as substrates for cholesterol efflux by ABCA1 are being evaluated in
clinical trials. Our work suggests that it may be possible to design therapies that not only increase cholesterol
efflux by ABCA1 to lipid-poor acceptors but also to preformed HDL particles—a pool with much higher capacity
as it comprises the lion’s share of circulating APOA1."
10782001,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ca2+ ions impact almost every aspect of cellular life. Ca2+ signaling begins with the opening of Ca2+ channels
in either the plasma membrane (PM) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and results in a dramatic increase in
the physiologically low (<100 nM) cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The temporal and spatial Ca2+ levels are exquisitely
regulated and enable the precise and specific activation of critical biological processes like changes in gene
expression, cell differentiation, muscle contraction, fertilization, or secretion of neurotransmitters to name a
few. Ca2+ signaling regulates pathogenic pathways of apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma gondii which
infects approximately one third of the world’s population. T. gondii is an opportunistic pathogen of
immunocompromised patients like HIV-infected individuals, fetuses, and organ transplant recipients. As an
obligate intracellular pathogen, T. gondii replicates inside cells and the clinical manifestations of
toxoplasmosis are a direct result of its growth within cells and its dissemination. T. gondii relies on Ca2+ signals
for the stimulation of specific features of its infection cycle and several Ca2+ signaling elements play essential
roles in its parasitic cycle. However, the fundamental elements that initiate Ca2+ signals in T. gondii are largely
unknown yet are likely essential for its viability and virulence. Discovery and characterization of the molecules
that initiate Ca2+ signaling in T. gondii are hence central for the understanding of its pathogenesis. Active egress
of T. gondii from host cells is critical for dissemination of the infection and our prior work has provided
conclusive evidence that there is a cytosolic Ca2+ peak preceding egress. This parasitic cytosolic increase
arises from release from intracellular stores, likely the endoplasmic reticulum. It is puzzling, however, that
intracellular parasites replicate surrounded by the low host cytosolic Ca2+ but still store sufficient Ca2+ in their
ER to trigger egress. Upon host cell rupture, extracellular Ca2+ influx across the PM contributes to a second
Ca2+ peak enhancing motility of parasites, which then exit and seek another host cell to invade. Our hypothesis
is that PM Ca2+ entry is essential for refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and both intra and extracellular sources
are necessary for triggering the cascade of molecular events that lead to the stimulation of parasitic functions
like motility, secretion of adhesins, invasion of host cells, egress and dissemination. In this proposal we aim to
characterize the proteins that enable PM Ca2+ influx. There is almost no information about the functional
characteristics and roles of Ca2+ channels in T. gondii. This lack of knowledge could be due to lack of appropriate
tools, techniques, and training in electrophysiology within the molecular parasitology field. We address this
void with a collaboration with a mammalian electrophysiologist and a modeler. Channels are critical for the
successful unicellular life of parasites, and they could be targeted by many therapeutically useful agents. Ion
channels remain significantly under-exploited as therapeutic targets, even more so as antiparasitic agents."
10878962,"ABSTRACT
In the past 40 years, fungal diseases have emerged as a pressing health concern, as incidence rates have
increased markedly, novel pathogens have emerged, resistance to antifungal drugs has risen and prevalence
of immunosuppressive conditions has increased. Changes in climate may exacerbate fungal disease risks by
shifting the suitable environmental habitat for pathogens, lengthening the transmission season of spores,
increasing the frequency of extreme climate events that mobilize spores and further straining adaptive capacity
of vulnerable populations. A mechanistic, quantitative, and causal understanding of the effects of climate on
the distribution and severity of fungal diseases will be critical to protecting the health of high-risk groups in the
coming decades, and to addressing factors leading to health disparities across axes of social vulnerability. To
date, epidemiologic studies of fungal diseases in the U.S. have been limited in spatiotemporal scope and
sample size, precluding robust characterization of the impact of climate and extreme events on fungal disease
risk. While largely untapped as a resource for investigating fungal disease, electronic health record (EHR) and
infectious disease surveillance systems generate massive health datasets that can be used to estimate risk
factors for fungal infections, including candidiasis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis,
coccidioidomycosis and dermatomycosis. Via partnership with Cerner (Kansas City, MO), we will analyze de-
identified EHR data for over 96 million patients, 1.4 billion visits, and 4.7 billion clinical events. A subset of the
databases is available with geographic locations of patient 3-digit zip codes. We will also analyze surveillance
data on all reported cases (>95,000) of coccidioidomycosis in California since 2000, geolocated to patient
address. After addressing misclassification, selection, and missing data biases in the EHR, our team will
estimate regional trends in incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates for fungal diseases in the U.S. We will
apply modern time series approaches to understand the effects of climate variability, including in temperature,
precipitation, and humidity, on fungal disease incidence and geographic emergence. We will investigate the
impacts of extreme events such as heat waves, dust storms, tropical cyclones and flooding on incidence and
examine whether investment in infrastructure can mitigate effects. We will determine whether exposure-
response relationships between climate and fungal infection are modified by socio-economic status and race,
and identify individual- and community-level factors that mediate the relationship between social disadvantage
and fungal infections and severe outcomes, such as preexisting comorbidities and housing quality. We will
apply our estimated exposure-disease relationships to quantify the proportion of fungal disease incidence since
2000 that is attributable to anthropogenic climate change, and project mid- and end-of-century estimates of the
distribution and burden of key diseases. The project will yield robust understanding of the climate epidemiology
of major mycoses in the U.S., and the role of social disadvantage and resilience in moderating future impacts."
10832655,"Abstract: Sensorineural hearing loss affects 1.5 billion people worldwide, with the primary pathology being the
irreversible loss of cochlear hair cells and supporting cells. Although hearing aids and cochlear implants can
improve hearing, we currently lack the ability to reverse the underlying pathology of hearing loss-hair cell and
supporting cell loss. Recent studies found that defined transcription factors can reprogram endogenous cochlear
supporting cells to directly acquire a hair cell fate, however, the hair cells formed are limited both in number and
degree of maturation. Moreover, this non-mitotic approach, coined direct transdifferentiation, leads to a loss of
the overall supporting cell population. Thus, a better understanding of 1) mitotic regeneration of supporting cells
and 2) how regenerated hair cells in the cochlea mature is critical.
 In this proposal, we will test whether singular or combinatorial application of transcription factors can
replenish hair cells and supporting cells in the immature and mature mouse cochlea. In preliminary and recently
published data using transgenic mouse models, we found that 1) greater epithelial ridge (GER) cells, instead of
being a transient structure during development, migrate into the organ of Corti to regenerate lost supporting cells
and mature to become the supporting cell subtype inner phalangeal cells, which are critical for the survival of
inner hair cells, 2) damage induces GER cells to robustly proliferate and upregulate transcription factors
associated with proliferation, 3) Atoh1 overexpression robustly induces new hair cell formation in the GER, which
mature to become inner hair cell- and outer hair cell-like cells.
 The first aim will test the hypothesis that damage-responsive transcription factors promote mitotic
regeneration in the neonatal and damaged mature cochlea. In the second aim, we will use regenerated hair cells
in the GER as a model system to characterize the spatiotemporal features by which regenerated hair cells mature
and then test whether the outer hair cell factor Ikzf2 enhances an outer hair cell fate. Moreover, we will examine
the ability of combination of hair cell transcription factors to induce hair cell regeneration and maturation in the
damaged mature cochlea. To gain an unbiased insight into the genetic signature of ectopic supporting cells and
hair cells, the third aim will probe the transcriptomes of GER-derived hair cells and supporting cells. We will
reveal their genetic landscape using bioinformatic approaches to define genes marking progenitors and
regenerated supporting cells and hair cells and candidate genes driving regeneration.
 In summary, we will apply state-of-the-art technologies (live cell imaging, electrophysiology, snRNA-seq,
inner ear surgery, viral transduction) to study the mechanisms of supporting cell and hair cell regeneration. We
have assembled a team of experts who have worked together to collect promising preliminary data. At the end
of this 5-year proposal, we will have determined 1) whether transcription factors can enhance cochlear
regeneration 2) mechanisms dictating regeneration of supporting cells and hair cells in mammals."
10852988,"PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease characterized by abnormal
proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) in the distal blood vessels of the lung. There are
currently no therapies that target the underlying endothelial dysfunction in PAH. Mitochondrial dysfunction,
increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) are important
pathogenic abnormalities observed in MVECs isolated from patients with PAH, but the mechanisms that link
these cellular abnormalities is unknown. In MVECs isolated from rats undergoing Sugen/Hypoxia (SuHx), an
experimental form of PAH (SuHx-MVECs), our prior work and current preliminary data suggest a)
mitochondrial dysfunction recapitulating those seen in human PAH ECs, b) increased mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (mtROS) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), c) increased activation of the transient receptor
potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) channel and increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), d) EndMT and e) increased
proliferation. Further, we also observe specific shifts in metabolism (increased use of anaerobic respiration as
well as an increase in fatty acid oxidation), suggesting a metabolic basis for mitochondrial dysfunction in SuHx-
MVECs. Our preliminary data now suggest specific roles for two metabolic byproducts of increased fatty acid
oxidation – BOHB and mtROS - in sensitizing and activating TRPV4, respectively. Thus, we hypothesize that,
in PAH, a shift in MVEC mitochondrial metabolism from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation promotes mtROS and
BOHB generation, leading to TRPV4 activation and consequently, Ca2+-dependent activation of EndMT and
proliferation. Using MVECs isolated from rats, mice and humans with and without PAH, as well as in vivo
experiments utilizing various novel transgenic rats and mice, we propose the three independent aims centered
around the following questions: 1) How does increased fatty acid oxidation promote TRPV4 activation in
MVECs; 2) Is TRPV4 activation necessary and sufficient to induce EndMT; and 3) What is the impact of
TRPV4 loss or BOHB supplementation on EndMT development in vivo. To accomplish these aims, we plan on
utilizing a variety of methods ranging from fluorescent live-cell imaging of MVECs isolated from WT and
transgenic mice and rats, in vitro studies in human MVECs from PAH patients (and controls), and in vivo
lineage-tracing studies to examine EndMT development in rodent models of PAH. Completion of these aims
will provide novel insight into the interplay between fatty acid metabolism, Ca2+ homeostasis and EndMT in
normal MVECs and role of the metabolic dysfunction and increased [Ca2+]I and EndMT in PAH."

Disparities in health and well-being among children in families with different incomes emerge
early in life. Children in poor families are born with worse health than their counterparts in
higher income families, and this relationship between health and income becomes more
pronounced through the life cycle. Children who experience worse health early in life also go on
to have significantly lower educational attainment, health, and socio-economic status in
adulthood. This relationship suggests that the intergenerational transmission of advantage that
we observe within families could be driven by the good health that wealthy parents confer to
their children early in life. Understanding how unequal parental incomes result in unequal
health in childhood may therefore help us understand patterns of income inequality and
intergenerational economic mobility more generally and also help policymakers make informed
decisions about the efficacy of cash transfers. We propose to provide new evidence on the
relationship between parental income and children's mental and physical health and well-being
through the Y Combinator Research (YCR) Basic Income randomized controlled trial. The YCR
experiment will provide $1,000 per month of supplemental income to a randomly-selected
treatment group over a period of three years, with a control group receiving $50 per month over
the same period. The 3,000 participants in the study have 3,640 children under the age 18 living
in their household. We will survey participants about their children and leverage existing
administrative datasets to obtain information on the impact of this income supplement on
children's health outcomes. By comparing children of treatment group participants to control
group participants, we will document how parental income affects the quality of the household
environment and parental interactions (Aim 1), and investment in children's well-being
including access to and use of medical care, food security, expenditures on enrichment and
activities, neighborhood quality, and the quality of non-parental care (Aim 2) and childhood
emotional, conduct, hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems, pro-social
behavior, achievement of developmental milestones, cognitive development and physical health
(Aim 3). Our study will provide new, timely, and policy-relevant estimates on the impact of
parental income on child health and well-being and the mechanisms through which this
relationship operates."
10900698,"Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed health systems, caregivers, and patients for over a year. Hundreds of
thousands have died, and millions more have been impacted by the threat of infection and efforts to mitigate
disease spread. In response to these challenges, the Medicare program introduced emergency policies that
permitted greater flexibility in the provision of outpatient and inpatient care, including relaxing rules governing
the remote delivery of outpatient care and increasing hospital capacity. Unfortunately, there is limited
information on how the changes in care delivery made possible by these temporary policies have impacted
patient outcomes during times when viral spread and mitigation policies both waxed and waned. In this project,
we will examine the impact of changes in outpatient and inpatient care on clinical event rates and deaths
among older patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) living
in the community. These patients are particularly vulnerable to social isolation or disruptions in their care, and
might not be able to articulate their needs. Those with yet additional disadvantages such as frailty or lower
incomes appear to have been even more susceptible to adverse effects of COVID-19 infections. Some care
delivery changes, however, might have increased the number or quality of clinician interactions with patients,
e.g., more frequent tele-health visits because of less need to travel. Thus, to examine the impact of the
changes in care delivery under the emergency Medicare policies, we will address three aims: 1) To assess and
refine study variable definitions given data collected during the pandemic; 2) To examine the impact of
changes in outpatient care on clinical event rates, e.g., emergency department and hospitalization rates; and
3) To examine the impact of changes in inpatient care on mortality. Notably, changes in visit and referral
patterns during the pandemic could impact information capture; thus, diagnosis-based definitions of AD/ADRD
status, frailty, or delirium developed in the pre-pandemic era could be less accurate when using pandemic era
data. We will examine these care patterns, assess the accuracy of claims-based measures, and develop
prediction models using machine learning methods and linked, overlapping datasets; we also will account for
temporal variation in documented COVID-19 infections and employment at the county level across all aims.
Given these complex data and analytic issues, we will work with NIH’s Social, Behavioral, and Economic
Research on COVID-19 Consortium to improve the data resources and methods for this type of work. The
information from this large natural experiment is critical for preparing for future outbreaks or other shocks to the
health system, to determine which of the emergency policies, if any, should be extended, and to inform
debates concerning the balance between local flexibility and national standards within Medicare."

Among the estimated 165 million worldwide contact lens wearers one third experience itchy eyes from seasonal
or perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Prevalence of ocular allergy has also risen in part due to environmental
changes related to increased carbon emissions and the contributory role of air pollution in conjunctival
immunological response. Topical anti-allergic agents with multiple mechanisms of action such as ketotifen and
olopatadine are currently recommended as the first-line agents. Olopatadine drops have proven to be more
effective than ketotifen to relieve the symptoms and signs of allergic conjunctivitis] and to provide more ocular
comfort at application. Contact lens wearers are frustrated that ocular allergy interferes with normal wear and
often rely on eye drops to manage symptoms which they find frustrating. The recent and first approval in the U.S.
of a medicated contact lens that addresses this market is Johnson & Johnson's ACUVUE® Theravision™ with
ketotifen medicated daily disposable hydrogel lens. We propose to further develop a next-generation, 1-day drug
delivery contact lens (DDCL) platform for olopatadine using boundary charge modifiers to extend and control
drug release. The work will build on our previous accomplishments in the field—enabling the use of both the
most efficacious allergy drug and the most breathable lenses. The recent Johnson & Johnson product requires
compromises in both areas to accomplish just a few hours (~2 h) duration of release. Lynthera's technology
enables a boundary surface modification scheme to directly incorporate anionic long-chain fatty acids in silicone
hydrogel contact lens' internal nanodomains to house nearly 80% of cationic charged drugs in the polymer-
aqueous pore interfaces of a lens. Our modification scheme will substantially raise olopatadine retention at these
interfaces due to electrostatic interactions between fatty acid anions with olopatadine cations, thereby raising
the precision, duration, and resultant efficacy of olopatadine drug delivery, as well as prolonging comfortable
wear time due to the silicone hydrogel lenses oxygen transmission. With the key aims of Phase I substantially
completed, Phase II will focus on pre-clinical development of its technology platform for a daily disposable, drug
delivery contact lens with olopatadine. Our specific aims are: (1) to optimize a 1-day silicone hydrogel DDCL that
delivers 5 to 22 µg olopatadine with a sustained in vitro release profile for at least 12 hours, while maintaining
requisite commercial standards for optical transmission, oxygen transmissibility and shelf-life; (2) the DDCL
prototype will be evaluated by two in vivo studies of New Zealand rabbits including a small-scale, pilot
pharmacokinetics and one-month toxicology, the latter of which is required to support the IND filing; (3) regulatory
development of the DDCL for an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing with key activities to include pre-IND
meeting and planning and design of a clinical trial. For the commercialization strategy, we have agreement with
a global contact lens company to manufacture and supply the DDCL."

This SPORE renewal application represents the efforts of interdisciplinary teams of investigators from the Neuro-
Oncology Program of the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) to build on our
accomplishments to continue to translate our findings to improve care for patients with brain cancer. We have
three specific objectives: (1) to develop novel peripheral blood-based biomarkers for glioma patients, (2) to
identify novel metabolic markers for noninvasive imaging to evaluate tumor burden and treatment response, and
(3) to develop a novel immunotherapy strategy to overcome the current significant challenges. At the heart of
the proposal are three translational research projects—each intended to evaluate paradigm-changing novel tools
for prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic modalities with defined human endpoints. Project 1 will build on the
team’s pioneering work during the current funding cycle that they established as immunomethylomics. The team
identified GBM survival to be independently predicted by an interactive model of age and peripheral blood
immune profiles, a methylation biomarker of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or a methylation biomarker of
dexamethasone response. Using prospectively collected >1,800 samples from the current cycle and additional
samples from the new cycle, the team plans to create blood DNA methylation-based biomarkers for integrated
GBM prognosis models, stratification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild type vs. mutant gliomas, and
assessments of treatment response. Project 2 team will also build on their achievements during the current
funding cycle related to the development of hyperpolarized C-13 imaging as novel imaging markers of response.
In the current proposal, the team will evaluate their central hypothesis that the use of hyperpolarized C-13 (HP)
imaging probes (HP [2-13C]pyruvate or [1-13C]α-ketoglutarate [α-KG]) in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging will
serve as metabolic markers of treatment response and tumor burden in patients with IDH-mutant glioma. The
team will first evaluate their hypothesis in preclinical models and the roles of HP [2-13C ] pyruvate and HP [1-
13C]⍺-KG probes in the treatment response and tumor burden, respectively, in patients. Project 3 will develop
the first-in-human phase I trial of adoptive transfer therapy using autologous T lymphocytes that are genetically
engineered with a novel “prime and kill” gene circuit. Based on preclinical data, this approach will allow us to
overcome significant challenges for developing effective immunotherapy for GBM, such as antigen-
heterogeneity, on-target off-tumor toxicities, exhaustion, and the lack of effective GBM-homing of the therapeutic
T lymphocytes. This SPORE proposal also requests continued support for the Career Enhancement and
Developmental Research Programs and for three Cores (Administrative, Biospecimen/Pathology, and
Biostatistics and Clinical) that will support the efforts of the three projects. The research proposed here has
significant potential to change how we detect, diagnose, and treat brain cancer."

10829465,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stimulation of hippocampal NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) can induce long-term potentiation
(LTP) or depression (LTD), two opposing forms of synaptic plasticity that are thought to be required for higher
brain functions such as learning, memory and cognition. This proposal will focus on the molecular computation
that mediates the decision between these two forms of plasticity. LTP has long been known to require the
Ca2+/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and its autophosphorylation at T286 (pT286),
which generates Ca2+-independent “autonomous” CaMKII activity (~20% of the maximal Ca2+/CaM-stimulated
activity). In the first funding period of this proposal, we have shown that CaMKII and pT286 are additionally
required for LTD. But how can pT286 CaMKII possibly mediate both of these two opposing forms of plasticity?
We have started to address this question in the second funding period: LTP additionally requires CaMKII
binding to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B, and two mechanisms suppressed
this binding during LTD. By contrast, LTD instead requires a distinct additional autophosphorylation, the
inhibitory pT305/306, which blocks Ca2+/CaM binding, limits further pT286, and also directly inhibits GluN2B
binding. The three regulatory CaMKII mechanisms (pT286, pT305/306, and GluN2B binding) are all thought to
require the CaMKII holoenzyme structure and all cross-regulate each other. In order to elucidate how this cross-
regulation works to enable the LTP vs LTD decision by CaMKII, we will here determine the specific holoenzyme
rules underlying each mechanism. In three related but independent aims, the project will determine the
holoenzyme rules for CaMKII phosphorylation at T286, phosphorylation at T305/306, and GluN2B interaction.
A fourth aim will test effects on neuronal functions, which are expected to differ for LTP versus LTD."

 Organs of the human body rely on complex integration of multiple neuronal circuits in order to maintain
homeostasis. For example, the heart must respond to internal and external stimuli and produce sufficient blood
flow to meet environmental demands. Glia play critical roles to support nervous system function but are also
indispensable for establishment of appropriate circuit structure and physiology. Our lab recently identified a cell
type in the heart with many similarities to astroglia populations found elsewhere in the body. This cell type, which
we termed cardiac nexus glia, is present as the heart is being formed and is critical for establishment of heart
rhythm. Ablation of these glia causes cardiac arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation, both serious physiological
conditions. This project uses the zebrafish animal model to investigate the developmental ontogeny and
morphological characteristics of cardiac nexus glia in the developing hearts of living animals (Aim 1). Additionally,
it probes the functional relationship between these glia and cardiomyocytes and their roles in modulating heart
rate and rhythm (Aim 2). The results of these experiments will contribute crucial detail to our understanding of
the multi-faceted roles of glia in the peripheral nervous system and provide important and specific insight about
cardiac nexus glia function in heart development and disease.
 This research will be undertaken in a supportive and collaborative laboratory environment within the
Biological Sciences Department at Notre Dame University. It will rely on expertise from staff of the Center for
Zebrafish Research and the Integrated Imaging Facility. In addition to the development of bench skills and
technical expertise inherent to this project, the applicant will also hone teaching, mentoring, and management
skills that will be critical for her future success as a PI running her own research group at a primarily
undergraduate institution."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disorder with significant morbidity and mortality which affects millions of
Americans and shows no sign of improvement. Because there are no clinically approved therapeutics that can
halt or reverse the progression of CKD to end stage kidney disease, research is needed to elucidate novel
molecular and cellular targets. This project is based on the scientific premise that inflammation and fibrosis are
key components in the progression of CKD. While recent research has highlighted the importance of the immune
system in CKD, the specific contributions of resident memory T cells (TRMs) remain unknown. We have
established and validated an aristolochic acid (AA)-induced mouse model of CKD which mimics clinical CKD.
Five consecutive days of AA injections lead to a sustained decline in kidney function, indicated by reduced
glomerular filtration rate and increased serum creatinine six weeks later. Flow cytometry of kidneys reveals a
predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate within two weeks of the first AA injection, CD4 and CD8 T cells being the
most abundant. These T cells persist for at least 6 weeks, coinciding with the persistent decline in kidney function.
Moreover, a large population of T cells in the kidneys of these mice express pro-inflammatory and fibrotic
cytokines, as well as CD103, a hallmark epithelial adhesion molecule of TRMs. TRMs have been described as
contributors to unwanted inflammation in other chronic diseases and their presence has been descriptively noted
in human kidneys. Thus, our central hypothesis is that TRMs mediate the progression of CKD through an
inflammatory response that promotes kidney injury and fibrosis while inhibiting repair. The aims of this proposal
will 1) determine the activation status and cytokine profiles of TRMs as well as their contributions to kidney
inflammation and fibrosis; and 2) determine CD103’s necessity for T cell-epithelial adhesion and its regulation of
T cell localization to injured kidneys, as well as its necessity for the TRM pro-inflammatory state. To achieve
these goals, we will utilize genetic knockout models, adoptive immune cell transfer, flow cytometry,
immunofluorescence microscopy, and pharmaceutical interventions both in vitro and in vivo. Successful
execution of the proposed studies will illuminate basic mechanisms involved in CKD and could provide pre-
clinical evidence for novel targets in the treatment of CKD. This is in line with the mission of the NIDDK, as this
proposal focuses on the elucidation of treatments for progressive kidney disease. The laboratories of the
sponsors along with their expertise in nephrology and immunology will provide an ideal training environment to
carry out the proposed studies and advance the PI’s career. The training received will advance the knowledge,
critical thinking, technical, and professional skills that will be required for the PI’s transition into independent
academic research and establishment of his niche in the field of cardiorenal disease."

The ability of therapeutic drugs to access specific organs strongly depends on the nature of the blood-tissue
barrier at said organs. The prostate and brain, for example, have tight barriers with no intercellular gaps, and
most drugs cannot permeate them at sufficiently high levels to be therapeutically effective. Thus, understanding
the relationships between drug chemical structure, dosing regimen, and organ penetration is crucial to
the development of new and effective drug therapies. Motivated by this, the long-term goal of this program
is to establish a measurement standard of molecular transport parameters affecting the passage of therapeutic
agents across biological barriers in vivo. Specifically, the objective of this proposal is to demonstrate that
electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors – an emerging sensing platform with the ability to continuously
measure the levels of specific molecules in the body – can support continuous monitoring of molecular transport
from blood to liver, prostate and brain. The proposed measurements will determine the transport parameters of
seven therapeutic agents (three aminoglycoside, three β-lactam and one glycopeptide antibiotics) across four
biological barriers (i.e., blood-liver, blood-prostate, blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid). These drugs were
chosen because, although effective at treating infections across organ barriers, they cause dangerous side
effects driven by their narrow therapeutic window, making their precise dosing an important medical challenge.
The central hypothesis of this work is that achieving spatially and temporally resolved drug measurements in
blood and target organs will produce unprecedented permeability data that will guide new therapeutic drug
development toward the creation of permeability-enhanced therapeutics and more effective dosing regimens.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the kinetics of drug uptake in the
liver via continuous, seconds-resolved E-AB measurements; 2) Determine the transport kinetics of antibiotics
through the prostatic barrier; and 3) Determine the transport kinetics of prophylaxis antibiotics delivered from
blood to the brain. The proposed research is significant because it will define the structural and transport
characteristics necessary for therapeutic agents to penetrate targeted organs and propel the study of other
therapeutics beyond the families of antibiotics considered here. Thus, this work will develop foundational
knowledge and generate the necessary resources for other researchers and industries – working on drug
development, in-vivo testing and clinical dose scaling – to advance the field of therapeutics. The proposed
research will have an immediate positive impact as it will establish a better understanding of therapeutic drug
transport within compartments in the body. Longer term, this work will have established the groundwork
necessary for the in-vivo evaluation of molecular transport across tight biological barriers."

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP)
targets significantly reduced risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, leading to new guidelines
recommending a lower BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. However, intensive BP targets may increase the risk of
adverse events from antihypertensive therapy. With widespread adoption of the new BP guidelines, there is
an urgent need to evaluate whether there are subgroups of patients who may have an unfavorable balance of
benefits and harms from intensive BP lowering. We propose an innovative approach to risk stratification that
integrates traditional risk factors with novel information gleaned from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that are essential for energy metabolism and stress adaptation. In
animal models, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a fundamental role in aging, CVD, and neurodegenerative
diseases. Because mitochondrial metabolism is vital to adapt positively to bioenergetic stressors such as BP
lowering, measures of mitochondrial health may help to predict beneficial and adverse outcomes among
adults undergoing intensive treatment for hypertension. Recent observational studies have linked novel
mtDNA measures with several age-related outcomes, including risks of CVD, hypertension, death, dementia,
and reduced functional status. However, the optimal methods for integrating data across the mitochondrial
genome have not been established, nor have prior studies investigated the utility of mtDNA measures for
identification of subgroups who may derive greatest benefits or harms from intensive BP targets.
This proposal will leverage next-gen sequencing technology and machine learning analytics to develop and
validate mtDNA risk scores that predict CVD risk, mortality risk, and longitudinal changes in cognitive and
physical function in older adults. Our first Aim will implement a biologically-informed neural network among
participants of the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC; N=3,075) and the Lifestyle
Interventions and Independence for Elders Study (LIFE; N=1,755) to develop two mtDNA risk scores for
prediction of CVD and cognitive and physical function outcomes, while accounting for the competing risk of
death. Our second and third Aims will validate these mtDNA risk scores in two landmark trials that evaluated
the impact of intensive vs standard BP targets on cardiovascular outcomes: SPRINT (N=9,361) and Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD; N=2,488). We will then examine whether mitochondrial
risk, assessed by these mtDNA scores, modifies the efficacy or safety of the BP interventions. This work will:
1) develop innovative methods for analysis of mitochondrial genomic data; 2) provide novel hypotheses
regarding pathways linking mitochondrial health, CVD risk and functional status; and 3) explore the potential
of mtDNA measures for personalized health interventions in older adults."
10876359,"ABSTRACT
Seasonal influenza and the current COVID-19 pandemic cause serious health and financial burdens. Severe viral infection
leads to acute lung injury, inflammation and contributes to tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Intriguingly, clusters of ectopic
basal cells (also known as pod cells) are present in the peripheral lungs during acute infection and remodeling phases. Initial
studies indicated that these cells were able to generate type I and II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Nevertheless,
subsequent lineage tracing studies revealed that pod cells had minimal if any contribution to alveolar regeneration.
Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that pod cells give rise to goblet cells, resulting in mucous metaplasia accompanied
by the presence of chemosensory tuft cells (also known as brush cells). Significantly, genetic ablation of tuft cells promotes
the differentiation of pod cells into AECs. Our further analyses revealed that tuft cells express the Notch ligand Jag2,
whereas pod cells express Notch receptors with prominent Notch activation. Consistently, Notch inhibition led to reduced
mucous metaplasia and improved alveolar regeneration. We therefore hypothesize that tuft cells promote mucous
metaplasia of pod cells and impede alveolar regeneration via paracrine JAG2/Notch activation upon viral infection.
Two specific aims were devised to test the hypothesis. Aim1: To address the molecular mechanisms by which tuft cells
promote mucous metaplasia following viral infection. Aim2: To promote the differentiation of pod cells into AECs through
targeting JAG2 in tuft cells. In this aim we will combine a novel COVID-19 mouse model and pod cell organoids
established from COVID-19 patient lungs to test the efficacy of a JAG/Notch decoy in promoting alveolar regeneration.
Together this proposal will not only elucidate the disease mechanisms impairing lung regeneration post viral infection, but
also offer new therapeutic approaches to treat lungs infected by influenza and coronavirus."
10874544,"Iron-related disorders affect over a billion people worldwide. Dysregulation of intestinal iron absorption is an essential component of iron-related disorders. Although iron-deficient anemia and hereditary hemochromatosis are on opposite ends of the iron-disorder spectrum with respect to systemic iron levels, they initiate very similar intestinal responses. Hyperabsorption of iron is mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)2α. We recently demonstrated a novel hetero-tissue signaling axis that initiates increased intestinal iron absorption in iron-related disorders: liver hepcidin levels decrease, leading to stabilization of the iron exporter ferroportin; the resulting efflux of intestinal iron into the blood triggers HIF2α activation, which leads to a feed-forward cycle of increased iron absorption from the intestinal lumen. We recently found that metabolites produced by gut microbiota are essential regulators of HIF2α expression and activity. The role of the microbial metabolites in the regulation of iron absorption is still unclear. Moreover, how HIF2α selectively regulates iron metabolism-related target genes, but not its other target genes, in iron deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis is enigmatic. The first on-target HIF2α inhibitor produced promising results in clinical trials with patients with renal cancer; however, it is not known whether HIF2α can be targeted to treat iron-related disorders. For those reasons, research on HIF2α and its role in iron metabolism is needed and likely to lead to novel therapies. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the mechanistic underpinnings of HIF2α-mediated regulation of intestinal iron absorption. On the basis of our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the transcriptional activity and iron-absorptive gene networks activated by HIF2α are regulated in a coordinate fashion by epigenetic reprogramming and microbial metabolites in iron-related disorders. Using a novel reporter mouse model, we discovered specific histone modifications on HIF2α iron target genes. In Aim 1, we will conduct experiments using the same mouse model to determine if cell-autonomous epigenetic reprogramming is critical to regulate intestinal iron absorption. In Aim 2, we will determine if the microbial metabolite axis is the major mechanism regulating HIF2α in iron-deficiency and iron-overload disorders. In Aim 3, we will determine if drugs that inhibit or activate HIF2α provide any benefit alone or in an adjuvant setting in preclinical models of iron-related disorders. Completion of those Aims will (i) uncover mechanisms of HIF2α regulation, (ii) define new metabolic pathways that alter intestinal iron absorption, and (iii) highlight new pathways and potential drug targets."

Oropharyngeal head and neck cancers (OP HNC) have increased to epidemic levels in the United States.1,2
Despite good response to cancer treatment,3 survivors are suffering life-long toxicities that result in swallowing
problems (dysphagia).4,5 Treatment options for dysphagia after OP HNC are extremely limited, focus on
swallowing movements alone, and do not consider the importance of respiratory-swallow phase patterning.6-11
Prior evidence has demonstrated that
of
impairments,
when aberrant respiratory-swallow phase patterning is present ( initiation
 swallowing during nspiration ) in patients with OP HNC, there is a higher occurrence of swallowing
increased residue, and airway invasion. 12,13
i
Further, it has been well established that the expiratory
limb of the respiratory cycle provides a biomechanically advantageous set point in which to initiate safe and
efficient swallowing.14-17 Thus, we developed and tested an innovative approach to train individuals with
dysphagia after OP HNC to initiate swallowing during expiration.18 In this preliminary trial, we found that training
initiation of swallowing during expiration resulted in marked improvements in airway protection and key
physiologic components of swallowing function.18 These compelling findings led us to the current randomized,
Phase II, sham-controlled clinical trial to test if this respiratory-swallow phase training approach will improve
airway protection and swallowing efficiency in OP HNC survivors in the subacute phase (3-6 mo.) of recovery.
Our primary goal (Aim 1) is to determine if respiratory-swallow phase training results in increased frequency (%)
of swallows initiated during expiration and improved swallowing safety. Our secondary goal (Aim 2) is to examine
the impact of respiratory-swallow phase training on the frequency of swallows initiated during expiration in
wakeful, naturalistic swallowing environments, including eating and drinking. We will recruit 88 OP HNC survivors
with dysphagia, impaired respiratory-swallow phase patterning, and airway compromise. They will be
randomized 1:1 into Experimental (n=44) or Sham (n=44) group arms. We will deliver therapy remotely using a
telehealth platform and an innovative wearable sensor that provides real-time visual feedback of respiratory-
swallow movements. Primary endpoints for Aim 1: frequency (%) of swallows initiated during expiration and
Penetration-Aspiration Scale19 scores. Secondary endpoints: Normalized Residue Ratio Scale20 and Modified
Barium Swallow Impairment Profile21,22 scores. Endpoints will be measured from synchronized videofluoroscopic
and respiratory-swallow sensor recordings at baseline, within 1-week post-treatment, and 1-month and 3-months
post-treatment. The primary endpoint for Aim 2 is frequency (%) of swallows initiated during expiration in wakeful,
natural contexts measured at baseline, during training, within 1-week post-treatment, and 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and
12-weeks post-treatment. Consistent with the NCI's mission, this proposed study investigates a new therapy
option that could be combined with traditional therapies to improve swallowing recovery for survivors of OP HNC."

This proposal delineates a 4-year research career development program focused on brain mechanisms by
which sex steroids protect from atherosclerosis. The candidate is currently a Research Assistant Professor in
the Department of Medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition at University of Washington
(UW). The proposed experiments and didactic work will provide the candidate with a unique set of multi-
disciplinary skills for him to become an independent investigator in the cardiovascular field. The candidate has
completed a PhD degree in Pharmacology at the University of Chile and two postdoctoral fellowships at OHSU
and UW. The applicant’s combination of expertise in sex steroids biology and CNS regulation of metabolism
uniquely qualify him to conduct these studies. In this proposal, he will address key questions in the field of
cardiovascular disease, the answers to which will increase our understanding of the relationship between
androgen deficiency and elevated cardiometabolic risk. Dr. Dorfman and his mentors (Drs. Karin E. Bornfeldt
and Joshua P. Thaler) have created a specific training plan that takes advantage of the intellectual resources
at the UW to guide him through the proposed educational activities and research. The goal of the current work
is to work in mouse models to identify CNS mechanisms by which hypogonadism increases the incidence of
cardiovascular events. Specifically, he will investigate the role of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) in
cardiometabolic changes that accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis. The proposal focuses on human
evidence that low levels of circulating androgens promotes cardiometabolic dysregulation, and that
hypothalamic gliosis is associated with lower endogenous testosterone and plasma LDL in men. Furthermore,
the preliminary data identify a dramatic synergistic increase of hypothalamic gliosis when hypogonadism
induced by castration and Western-type diet are combined; in this animal model, early markers of
cardiometabolic risk are also evident including increased liver inflammation and triglyceride content, a shift
toward very low density lipoprotein species, and circulating leukocytosis. These findings support studies
proposed in Specific Aim 1 to use animal models with ablation of microglial or astrocyte inflammation to
determine whether hypothalamic gliosis is required for Western-type diet and androgen deficiency to
synergistically predispose to atherosclerosis. Additionally, the candidate has developed and validated a mouse
model in which microglia and astrocytes can be pharmacologically activated through the use of Designer
Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) technology. These models of glial activation
provide a tool to determine whether gliosis is sufficient to increase the risk of CVD as proposed in Aim 2."

I am a radiation oncologist and early-stage investigator at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. My
work has focused on improving the quality of care of older adults undergoing palliative radiation therapy (RT), a
treatment used in approximately 500,000 older cancer patients each year to improve quality of life. Palliative
RT (PRT) – RT intended to reduce symptoms rather than achieve cure – creates both benefits and harms,
particularly for older adults in whom cancer occurs in complex settings of multimorbidity and geriatric
conditions including functional or cognitive impairments. PRT can dramatically improve symptoms such as pain
and neurologic function. Yet it may also cause fatigue, burns, and other adverse effects that can persist for
months. Other burdens include weeks of daily travel to attend PRT sessions; painful body positioning due to
restricted joint mobility; and tight-fitting face masks which can be terrifying to cognitively impaired persons. If
PRT is too burdensome, it is often interrupted or prematurely stopped, limiting its efficacy. Older patients may
be particularly vulnerable to PRT as a result of complex and interrelated cancer-specific and geriatric
conditions. Yet, little is known about the contribution of these geriatric conditions to PRT-related outcomes,
including how they relate to (1) difficulties completing RT; (2) changes in function, hospitalization, and mortality
after RT; and (3) self-reported toxicities and quality of life. To address these knowledge gaps, I propose 2
interrelated and complementary studies: (1) a retrospective cohort study of a large, nationally representative
sample of adults ≥65 years with metastatic cancer from the 2000-2018 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS), which links geriatric assessment data with administrative claims, to (a) determine factors associated
with PRT-related outcomes (e.g. completion of RT, function after RT, hospital admission, and mortality) and (b)
characterize distinct phenotypic profiles of patient complexity, then examine their associations with the same
outcomes; and (2) a prospective cohort study employing more detailed assessments than are in MCBS to (a)
further refine associations of PRT with function and QOL and (b) explore associations with self-reported RT-
related toxicities. Results from these studies will lead to improved recognition of individuals at high risk of poor
PRT outcomes and will support a future R01 application testing a targeted and geriatrics-driven intervention
that improves PRT outcomes important to older adults. My long-term goal is to be an independent investigator
and leader at the intersection of geriatrics, palliative care, and radiation oncology who improves treatment
decisions and designs interventions for older adults receiving PRT. The Beeson Award will support my
development in (1) geriatrics and geriatric oncology; (2) population-based observational data and its analyses;
(3) prospective study design and implementation in older adults; and (4) leadership in geriatrics to facilitate
research dissemination and implementation. These research and training activities will ultimately prepare me to
become a leader in aging who aligns RT delivery with the unique needs of older adults with advanced cancer."

New mechanistic insights into placentation and the signaling pathways that maintain proper trophoblast
differentiation and invasion of the endometrium will provide the foundation for new therapeutics against pre-
eclampsia. Senescent cells are characteristic of the developing and mature placenta, and changes in the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) have been observed in placental dysfunction. In patients
with pre-eclampsia, increased SASP factors are associated with their disease status. Senolytics and
senomorphics have recently been proposed as therapeutic interventions for patients with pre-eclampsia,
reducing the intensity of SASP. Histone variants organize the senescent genome, and a newly characterized
histone variant, H2AJ, is enriched in the placenta and is known to control SASP. This proposal aims to perturb
H2AJ in human embryonic stem cells and establish foundational knowledge about H2AJ and its role in
trophoblast development and genome architecture. Our human trophoblast cells derived from human embryonic
stem cells recapitulate many aspects of fetal placental development and upregulate H2AJ (Figure 5,6,7). This
study will serve the long-term goal of identifying new regulators of trophoblast development by identifying protein
partners of H2AJ that may serve as therapeutic drug targets. Differentiating human embryonic stem cells with
and without H2AJ, we will examine transcriptional, chromatin, and secretory changes in the generated
trophoblast lineages. Using protein immunoprecipitation, we will identify unknown interactors of H2AJ, providing
new insight into the role of H2AJ loading in the genome. It has been shown that during the transition to
senescence, cells undergo dramatic chromatin changes, segregating their heterochromatin into large
aggregates in the nuclear interior while maintaining SASP genes in highly expressed euchromatin (Figure 8).
The mobilization of heterochromatin away from the nuclear periphery and the maintenance of euchromatic
boundaries are not well understood in trophoblast cells. While it is known that cells become senescent in the
placenta, there are few studies describing their chromatin architecture. As H2AJ appears critical for the
upregulation of transcription at specific SASP loci, loss of H2AJ may be associated with demarcation errors
between the strict domains of euchromatin and heterochromatin. In this proposal, we will identify H2AJ's
deposition in the genome and its role in transcription, characterizing the three-dimensional chromatin architecture
of H2AJ depleted and control trophoblast cells. Furthermore, we will perform this system's first Hi-C and
chromatin tracing studies. To date, this will be the first study to characterize H2AJ in human development and
its role in trophoblast cells. This knowledge will be crucial for discovering new treatment modalities for patients
experiencing pre-eclampsia."

Molecular mechanisms of bacterial immune signaling through DNA damage
 The availability of tens of thousands of bacterial genome sequences, plus new bioinformatics tools and
new understanding of bacterial genome organization, has enabled the discovery and experimental
characterization of dozens of anti-bacteriophage and anti-plasmid defense systems in bacteria. Since a typical
bacterial genome encodes 3-6 distinct defense systems, a key question is whether and how these systems can
coordinate their activities to synergistically fight an infection. In prior work on the widespread and diverse
CBASS (Cyclic oligonucleotide-Based Anti-phage Signaling System) defense systems, we identified two
transcriptional regulators – CapW and the two-protein CapH+CapP system – that boost CBASS gene
expression in response to DNA damage. Together, CapW and CapH+CapP are associated with ~10% of
CBASS systems, and are also found adjacent to a broad range of known and predicted bacterial defense
systems including Pycsar, DISARM, and BREX. These findings suggest that CapW and CapH+CapP may
mediate activation of antiviral defense in response to a universal signal of cell stress, DNA damage. Here, I will
first identify the small-molecule or nucleic acid ligand that binds and activates CapW upon DNA damage. I will
combine biochemical assays for CapW binding to both its target DNA and its ligand with x-ray crystallography
to characterize the conformational changes imposed by the ligand to control CapW-DNA binding. This work will
establish a mechanism for CapW, a widespread bacterial transcription factor. Next, I will test the idea that
CapW and CapH+CapP mediate cooperation between antiviral defense systems by sensing DNA damage.
Specifically, we hypothesize that DNA-targeting immune systems like restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas
create DNA damage that is sensed by CapW or CapH+CapP to activate a secondary defense system (CBASS
or others) to reinforce the defensive response. I will systematically test this model by infecting cells encoding
both a restriction-modification system and a CapW- or CapH+CapP-associated CBASS system to determine if
the combination of these systems yields synergistic antiviral immunity. Additionally, I will test whether DNA
damage sensing plays a role in defense-system synergy, using structure-based mutations to either CapW or
CapP that eliminate DNA damage sensing. Together, these experiments will reveal the molecular mechanism
of CapW, and the role of DNA damage sensors in mediating synergy in bacterial defense systems. The
findings have the potential to establish a new paradigm in which DNA targeting defense systems constitute a
first line of antiviral defense, and DNA damage-activated systems constitute a second line of defense with
orthogonal mechanisms. Thus, instead of viewing bacterial defense systems in isolation, this work will
establish how they cooperate to compose a comprehensive bacterial “immune system”."

 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people around the globe.
AD pathology includes neuronal cell death, synaptic dysfunction, and corresponding behavioral deficits.
However, the molecular basis underlying AD pathologies remains unclear. Glycerophosphodiester
phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) is a member of a six-transmembrane protein family that releases
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from the cell surface. In the developing nervous system,
GDE2 promotes neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS) using its GPI-anchor cleavage
mechanism. During aging the loss of GDE2 leads to AD-like phenotypes, including Aβ production, synaptic
protein loss, and neurodegeneration. In human AD brain tissue, GDE2 aberrantly accumulates intracellularly
compared to healthy control brains, suggesting that GDE2 dysfunction could contribute to AD pathophysiology.
GDE2 mediates its functions in regulating Aβ production and synaptic protein loss via regulation of surface
expression of the GPI-anchored protein RECK (reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs).
RECK is a potent inhibitor of metalloproteases and is recently implicated in canonical Wnt signaling. Increased
expression of membrane RECK leads to a decrease in synaptic proteins that is independent of Aβ production
and levels of membrane RECK are highly elevated in AD patient brain. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal
is that GDE2 regulates synaptic function through the cleavage of RECK and that dysfunction of this pathway
contributes to AD synaptic pathology and cognitive changes. I will test this hypothesis through a multi-pronged
approach that will utilize electrophysiological, behavioral, and molecular approaches. In Aim 1, I will assess the
requirement for GDE2 in pre- and post-synaptic function in mice. In Aim 2, I will perform a variety of behavioral
experiments testing cognition to define corresponding behavioral abnormalities in mice lacking GDE2. Finally, in
Aim 3, I will probe the molecular mechanism through which GDE2 and RECK act to affect synaptic biology.
These experiments will expand our knowledge of the role GDE2 plays in synaptic biology and could potentially
help us better understand the mechanistic basis of AD pathologies. This research will be performed in a highly
collaborative environment, where I will have numerous opportunities to receive quality mentorship and training,
to develop my written and presentation skills, and to grow as a mentor and teacher to more junior scientists.
Overall, the Kirschstein-NRSA grant will support both my research aimed at discovering the synaptic biology
underlying neurodegeneration and my development as an independent scientist."

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is diagnosed at a rate of four males to one female. Autistic females
are diagnosed later than males and present with a nuanced profile of strengths and weaknesses that vary by
developmental stage. In early childhood, our team, and others, have identified social motivation (SM) and
restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) as distinguishing features between autistic males and females. It
has also been hypothesized that these differences serve as potential mechanisms that underlie autistic
camouflage. Also critical to the study of sex differences in ASD is the study of gender and gender diversity. A
number of international studies have identified higher rates of gender diversity in autistic adolescents and
adults, with potentially higher rates in autistic females. No study has charted the trajectories of these
interwoven characteristics (sex, gender, camouflaging) together or in early childhood. Representative,
longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the developmental and etiological significance of previously
observed sex differences and to characterize gender diversity and camouflaging in early childhood.
 We will conduct an Accelerated Longitudinal Design (ALD) across two sites (UNC and CHOP) in a
sample of 140 neurotypical (NT) and 140 autistic children, equally split by sex, aged 4 to 8 recruited in 5
cohorts and studied over four timepoints. ALDs have been identified as a promising methodology to study
development in ASD and recruit hard to reach groups. This multi-site effort will enable us to recruit sufficient
autistic females to examine age- and sex-linked developmental trajectories. Our team is uniquely positioned to
study how biological sex (Harrop, Parish-Morris) and gender (Strang, Harrop) impact the trajectories of young
autistic children through multimodal measures (parent-report, direct observation, eye tracking) that can probe
the mechanisms that underlie cross–sectionally observed sex differences in ASD.
 Our study has two aims: Aim One: Evaluate the impact of biological sex on developmental trajectories
of young autistic children. We will probe phenotypic and mechanistic sex differences overtime, focusing on SM
and RRBs. We will also chart the emergence of behavioral markers of camouflage. Aim Two: Characterize
trajectories of congruence/incongruence between biological sex and gender in young autistic children. We will
identify early signs of gender diversity in young autistic and NT children through parent and self-report. We will
also examine the role of gender in predicting SM and RRBs and common phenotypic variables to understand
how biological sex at birth (Aim One) and gender (Aim Two) differentially predict trajectories in autistic youth.
 This R01 project will chart the dynamic interplay between emergent ASD symptomology, biological sex,
and gender in early childhood. This work will inform sex-sensitive screening protocols and provide evidence for
sex- and gender-sensitive interventions to better address the needs of autistic females."

Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice and multi-organ
failure. Fifty percent of all ALF cases in the United States and UK are due to acetaminophen (APAP) overdose.
Supraphysiological doses of APAP overwhelm safe detoxification pathways in the liver leading to excessive
bioactivation of APAP by Cyp2e1 into the highly reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
This initiates a cascade of intracellular events driving hepatocyte death. An extensive body of work has
elucidated the molecular mechanisms of hepatocyte necrosis during APAP overdose, but detailed mechanisms
involved in the development of ALF have been largely unexplored. The innate immune response after liver
injury plays a critical role in liver recovery in the human relevant mouse model of APAP overdose. However,
immune cell dysfunction has been implicated in the development of ALF. Though crosstalk between stressed
hepatocytes and immune cells actively supports liver recovery, persistent and prolonged hepatocyte stress
may alter this communication network, resulting in immune cell reprogramming towards detrimental
phenotypes which facilitate ALF. Excessive cell stress can elicit temporary or permanent cell cycle arrest, a cell
fate decision called senescence. Some cells acquire a senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
which can elicit pleotropic effects on nearby cells and the tissue microenvironment. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that Klf6 and p21 induce hepatocyte senescence after a severe APAP overdose and that these
hepatocytes have an active SASP, enriched in the cytokine Cxcl14 which persists in circulation. These key
findings lead us to hypothesize that upon severe APAP-induced liver injury, prolonged hepatocyte senescence
results in a sustained secretome exposure enriched in Cxcl14 causing immune cell reprogramming impeding
tissue repair and injury resolution. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuit of two specific aims. Experiments in
Aim 1 are designed to evaluate how Klf6 induces p21 and Cxcl14 and the influence of in vivo silencing of Klf6
on APAP-induced senescence and liver recovery after injury. Aim 2 will use single-cell RNA sequencing in
combination with wet-lab approaches to define how the critical SASP component Cxcl14 alters the global
communication network between senescent hepatocytes and immune cells after a severe APAP overdose.
Collectively, these data will define the molecular mechanisms responsible for sustained induction of hepatocyte
senescence, its relationship to the induction of a senescent associated secretory phenotype, and the signaling
interactions between senescent hepatocytes and the innate immune response. This proposed work will provide

10874470,"Modern machine learning can fit complex models that make accurate predictions. However, understanding the brain with standard machine learning is a great challenge. A critical impediment is that it is often difficult to understand the inner workings of these models. There is thus a great need for more interpretable machine learning methods for neuroscience, in which the inner workings of the model relate to neural structure or function. The proposed research will develop interpretable machine learning methods for studying the neural control of movement. Through close collaboration with the experimental lab of Dr. Churchland, these methods will be applied to answer three central questions in motor control. In the first two aims, the research investigates how flexibly spinal motor neurons can be controlled, and how activity in motor cortex controls muscle activity across a wide range of movements. Beyond increasing scientific knowledge, answering these two questions could enhance brain computer interfaces for restoring control to those with motor impairments. In the third aim, the research investigates how multiple neural populations interact with each other to plan and generate movement. This question is relevant to many neurological disorders, in which communication between brain areas is disrupted. During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia’s vibrant neuroscience community, the applicant will receive additional training in computational techniques from Drs. Paninski and Cunningham, and additional experimental training from Dr. Churchland. This training will provide the necessary experience for the applicant to be successful in this work and to successfully start an independent lab at the interface of machine learning and the neural control of movement."
10906035,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE A: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE)
The purpose of the Administrative Core (Core A) is to ensure execution of our mission to conduct innovative,
interdisciplinary research to identify and validate the molecular mechanisms contributing to tauopathy
risk/protection associated with the H1/H2 haplotypes of the 17q21.31 region. The Center involves 3
geographically distributed sites in New York (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Los Angeles (UCLA)
and San Francisco (UCSF). Interactions will occur at two levels: scientific (exchange of information and data,
sharing of resources and specialized personnel) and administrative (organization of meetings and interactions
within and outside the CWOW). The primary goal of Core A is to connect these physically separate sites by
serving as a hub to facilitate interaction and communication between Core and Project leaders, investigators,
and external scientific communities, and ensure efficient governance and oversight of the Center. This Core will
ensure optimal utilization of center resources through maximization of institutional strengths and national and
global opportunities to broaden knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying risk/protection for
sporadic and familial tauopathy associated with H1/H2 haplotypes. This core is responsible for articulating the
research agenda and ensuring that it is effectively accomplished. Core A will accomplish this through a structure
that includes an Executive Steering Committee (ESC) led by the Director (Dr. Alison Goate) and the two
associate directors (Drs. Geschwind and Kampmann) as well as Core leaders. The ESC will insure that the
CWOW, national and international FTD resources are leveraged to the advantage of the CWOW and those of
the wider FTD community. An External Advisory Committee will provide guidance and review to
the CWOW leadership and communicate with NINDS Program Staff. The leadership will assure that the Center
is aware of national and international commitments as well as of opportunities to maximize our effectiveness. In
this capacity specific responsibilities include financial, administrative and regulatory management. This
Core will also oversee the growth of early stage investigators within the center. We propose two topically
related Projects supported by three Research Cores that leverage cutting-edge proteomic
and transcriptomic approaches in brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons and glia
to determine the mechanisms contributing to tauopathy risk/protection associated with the H1/H2 haplotypes of
the 17q21.31 region. The Data Core (Core D) will serve as a hub for integrating all data produced by Projects
and Cores to be shared within and outside the CWOW. Core A will organize regular meetings to ensure
progress, open communication and resources are available to serve Project and Core goals, that Projects and
Cores have maximal opportunity to interact, and that Projects and Cores progress according to timelines and
meet benchmarks of accomplishment. Core A and the Data Core will work together to develop and maintain a
Center website."
10906040,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE B: PROTEOMICS)
Rare MAPT mutations have long been known to be a cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD-Tau). A
common haplotype (H1) encompassing the MAPT locus is also associated with increased risk for multiple,
sporadic Tauopathies, including Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP),
while the H2 haplotype confers reduced risk. Despite this difference, very little is known regarding the
mechanisms behind the differences in risk between the H1 and H2 haplotypes or whether these common
haplotypes affect expression of rare MAPT mutations. A comprehensive analysis of the molecular differences
mediating this risk will represent a significant and essential resource for the neurological disorder community.
The work proposed by this core will be performed at the Thermo Fisher Scientific Proteomics Facility for Disease
Target Discovery located at the J. David Gladstone Institutes at the UCSF campus. Both this facility and the
Proteomics Core, will be led by Dr. Swaney, an expert in mass-spectrometry based proteomics research with
a track record in the development and application of novel proteomics approaches to enable biological
discoveries. The objective of the Proteomics Core is to provide cutting-edge and innovative technologies for
quantitative proteomic characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulating differential risk between MAPT
H1 and H2 haplotypes in a reliable, reproducible, and cost-efficient manner. It will support Projects 1 & 2 by
enabling proteomics experiments, and interact with both the Human Tissue Validation Core to validate findings,
and with the Data Core to integrate datasets as a resource for the CWOW project members and the research
community. Importantly, it will also serve as a resource to the wider scientific community by dissemination of
new assays and protocols. Efforts of this core will be focused on applying state-of-the-art discovery proteomics
technologies to precisely quantify differences in protein abundance and phosphorylation signaling for a variety
of brain cell types harboring different MAPT haplotypes or MAPT mutations on different haplotypic backgrounds.
These results will provide a proteome-wide view of specific proteins and pathways that are differentially regulated
by MAPT haplotypes. We will also complement this analysis with a hypothesis-driven targeted proteomics
approach to quantify a small number of proteins mapping to the H1/H2 inversion region and exhibiting cell type
and haplotype specific differences in gene expression and regulation. Lastly, we will validate at the protein level
the novel splice variants resulting from the ISO-seq and transcriptomic analyses."
10906044,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE C: HUMAN TISSUE VALIDATION)
The Human Tissue Validation Core will provide vital research support to the CWOW. Neurodegenerative disease
pathology and genetics have become increasingly exciting and complex in recent years, with major advances
arising from work accomplished using human postmortem tissue. In this application, Dr. Lea T. Grinberg will lead
the Human Tissue Validation Core (Core C). The Human Core goals are to (1) directly supporting this CWOW’s
Projects with well-characterized and carefully treated human tissue from tauopathy patients and controls; (2)
validating the relevance results from Projects 1 and 2 in human specimens and assembloids; (3) developing
enhanced tools for boosting the amount of information retrieved for each single biospecimen samples."
10906049,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CORE D: DATA)
Center investigators have proposed an interconnected set of Projects, Cores and aims using a genomic and
multi-omic driven approach for understanding the mechanisms of major genetic risk factors for Progressive
Supranuclear Palsy, a prototypical Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FLTD) and FTD-Tau, a rare inherited
frontotemporal dementia caused by mutations in the MAPT gene. The Center Projects and Cores will generate
a large compendium of data with diverse data types including single nuclei transcriptomics, open chromatin and
transcription factor footprints, as well as bulk proteomics from brain tissue and in vitro systems that must be
integrated to understand the functional impact of genetic variation in FTD. Therefore, it is critical for the Data
Core to support the Center’s data storage, analysis and sharing. The Center’s Data Core will be co-led by Drs.
Timothy Chang, M.D., Ph.D. (Assistant Professor, Neurology) and David Elashoff, Ph.D. (Professor, Medicine
and Biostatistics) who bring complementary expertise and experience. The goal of the Data Core is to accelerate
scientific discoveries from the Center by supporting data storage and analysis that will be shared with the
research community. To accomplish these goals, Aim 1 is to coordinate communication and storage of data
generated by the Projects and Cores. We will 1a) use project management software to efficiently coordinate
communication of data generation between Center Projects and Cores on a daily basis; and 1b) store data in a
user-friendly electronic data capture system (REDCap) with customized quality control. Aim 2 is to distribute and
support performance of data processing pipelines and analysis algorithms. We will 2a) ensure standardized data
processing pipelines and support their performance; and 2b) apply algorithms for integration of bulk
transcriptomic, chromatin structure and proteomics to understand regulatory relationships at the mRNA, non-
coding RNA and protein levels. Aim 3 is to assist the sharing of data and results with the research community.
We will 3a) share code and data on government and non-government sponsored data sharing platforms; and
3b) create haplotype and ancestry specific high-resolution data visualization tools that capture and integrate all
data including genetic, regulatory elements, gene expression, splicing and proteins. Supporting Center Projects
and Cores, the Data Core will establish resources for accurate data storage, rigorous data analysis and
productive data sharing mechanisms for the research community. The Data Core will enable acceleration of
scientific discovery within and outside of the Center."
10906053,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 1)
Genetic association between the MAPT H1 haplotype and increased risk for multiple Tauopathies, including
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), is well-established and replicated.
Despite this, very little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the differences in disease risk associated
with the H1 and H2 haplotypes. To date, comparison of these haplotypes has been restricted to studies of
MAPT splicing, as well as associations with clinical phenotypes. However, there has been no investigation of
the downstream functional implications of each MAPT haplotype. Our goal is to comprehensively assess the
chromatin structure, gene expression and functional consequences of structural differences between the H1
and H2 haplotypes in cells from individuals of European and African ancestry, in order to better understand the
mechanisms underlying risk for Tauopathy. The major MAPT haplotypes encompass a 970Kb inversion within
the 17q21.31 locus and include many genes in addition to MAPT, as well as extensive genetic and structural
variation. We hypothesize that the gross structural differences between haplotypes confer short- and long-range
changes in chromatin structure, leading to altered regulation of gene expression within and outside the
inversion, and that these changes in neurons and/or glia contribute to risk/protection for tauopathies. We will
use 2D and 3D induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to examine multi-OMIC differences between H1/H1
and H2/H2 and human brain tissue derived from H1/H1 and H2/H2 carriers to validate these changes, followed
by CRISPR-based functional genomic screens to test the impact of candidate causal variants on gene
expression and function. We propose four specific aims: 1) Use single nuc sequencing, ISOseq and proteomics
to characterize chromatin structure, gene/protein expression and splicing in human brain tissue from H1/H1 and
H2/H2 carriers, 2) Use RNAseq, HiC, ATACseq, ISOseq and proteomics to characterize cell-autonomous
changes in chromatin structure, gene expression and splicing in 2D neuron, astrocyte and microglial cultures
from H1/H1 and H2/H2 individuals; 3) Use single cell ATAC/RNAseq to examine effects on gene expression in
3D assembloids from H1/H1 and H2/H2 individuals; 4) Use CRISPRa/i-based assays to test the functional
impact of altering haplotype- and cell-specific gene enhancer regions on global gene expression and Tau-
isoform expression and splicing. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the H2
haplotype has the potential to uncover new therapeutic strategies for FTD and other neurodegenerative
diseases."
10906064,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT 2)
Common and rare variants at the 17q21.31/MAPT locus contribute to Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD-tau) and
the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorder, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).
Dominantly acting, rare missense and splice-site mutations in the MAPT gene have been reported to cause both
FTD-tau and PSP. Interestingly, it appears as though the majority of reported pathogenic MAPT mutations
causing familial PSP and FTD-tau occur on the H1 haplotype background, which is consistent with the increased
genetic risk associated with this haplotype in sporadic disease, although P301L, N279K and IVS10+16 have
been described on both haplotypes. However, it is unknown whether these haplotypes influence the phenotypic
expression of MAPT mutations. In addition to rare variation contributions to disease in this region, the strongest
genome-wide association signal for common variation in PSP is in the 17q21.31/MAPT locus. Identification of
causal variants in this region has been hampered by the broad patterns of linkage disequilibrium created by the
970 Kb chromosomal inversion, which limits local recombination. Work by our group and by others, including our
preliminary data using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), indicates that this 17q21.31/MAPT region
harbors several different risk loci and hundreds of contributory common causal variants. Furthermore, because
>96% of patients with PSP have the H1 haplotype, the effects of these SNPs driving this major association signal
likely occur in the context of the H1 haplotype, and not H2. These observations lead to two major hypotheses
that drive this project: 1) H1/H2 haplotypes not only influence risk for sporadic FTD-tau/PSP but also modulate
expression of the pathogenic phenotypes associated with specific MAPT variants. Therefore, we hypothesize
that the changes to chromatin structure and gene expression or splicing that occur in H2/H2 neural cells
compared to H1/H1 will ameliorate the pathogenic effects of PSP/FTD MAPT mutations; and 2) That the
regulatory effects of common PSP-associated variation in this region will be similarly blunted on an H2 haplotype.
We will use a combination of single-cell genomic, and proteomic approaches to characterize the impact of
PSP/FTD-associated MAPT mutations in human brain tissue and in iPSC-derived assembloids. We will use
CRISPR genome editing to introduce PSP/FTD-associated MAPT mutations into cell lines from Project 1 with
either H1/H1 or H2/H2 backgrounds, and will use single-cell multi-OMICs (RNAseq and ATACseq) combined
with proteomics and ISOseq to comprehensively assess the impact of the mutations on each background. We
will further characterize the impact of MAPT mutations on disease-associated phenotypes on each background
using cellular and molecular assays, and will then use CRISPRa/i screens to validate the functional
consequences of key haplotype-associated regulatory regions containing candidate common causal variants on
disease-related Tau phenotypes on gene expression in both H1 and H2 haplotypes, in order to test the
hypothesis that causal disease variants have more activity on the H1 background."
10897982,"Project Summary
 Modern machine learning approaches have attained substantial success in
pattern recognition and high-dimensional data analyses. However, these algorithms
heavily rely on association discovery, which cannot elucidate the mechanisms
underpinning the observed correlations and suffers from limited generalizability. To
address this challenge, the Yu Lab focuses on the development of robust and
generalizable machine learning approaches to integrate various types of biomedical
data, including multi-omics, pathology, and phenotypic information. The goal of the next
five years is to develop novel computational methods that connect machine learning
algorithms with causal inference methodologies to better understand the molecular
mechanisms underpinning disease pathology and enable fair and robust predictions of
drug response and toxicity. The overall vision of the proposed research program is to
establish generalizable data-driven methods to transform biomedical data into robust
prediction and mechanistic models. The proposed approach will systematically connect
diverse biomedical signals to extract previously unknown knowledge on the molecular
mechanisms and derive reliable prediction models for the effects of medications. The
proposed approaches are innovative because they depart from the status quo by
incorporating advanced causal inference techniques with data-driven algorithms to
enhance mechanistic and predictive modeling. This research program is significant
because it is expected to improve our understanding of disease pathology and provide a
fair and generalizable informatics framework for drug response and adverse effects
prediction in diverse populations. The proposed research activities will open new
research horizons by establishing a new machine learning platform for generating
reliable predictions, which will vertically advance molecular biology, pharmacology, and
computational research in biomedicine."
10703626,"A major barrier to HIV eradication is maintenance of latently infected cells in people living with HIV (PWH). The
Veteran population of PWH is nearly 2.5-fold greater versus non-Veteran individuals living in the United States,
underscoring a major unmet need within the United States Veteran's population for safe, specific agents that
can cure HIV and prevent or reverse associated co-morbidities. Chronic inflammation despite suppressive ART
drives HIV persistence and co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, frailty, diabetes, and HIV-
associated neurocognitive dysfunction (HAND). The Janus Kinase Signal Transducer and Activator of Signal
Transduction (Jak-STAT) pathway is a major mechanism of elevated immune dysregulation, even during viral
suppression. In viremic individuals, elevated pSTATs including pSTAT5 are associated with increased reservoir
size, viral loads, and decreased CD4+ T cell counts, underscoring the direct link between the Jak-STAT pathway
and the HIV-1 reservoir. Our team (Vincent Marconi (VAMC) William Tyor (VAMC) and Christina Gavegnano)
has extensively studied the class of Jak 1/2 inhibitors (indication HIV-1), including a first-generation Jak 1/2
inhibitor ruxolitinib, and demonstrated in a recently completed multi-site Phase 2a ACTG-sponsored study
(A5336;n=60) that ruxolitinib is safe, well-tolerated, and reduces key markers of immune activation associated
with HIV-1 persistence (HLA-DR/CD38, sCD14, and cellular lifespan marker bcl-2). We also showed a reduction
in the HIV-1 reservoir in individuals with higher baseline frequency of integrated HIV-1 DNA, demonstrating proof-
of-concept that Jak 1/2 inhibition can reduce the reservoir in a clinical setting. Furthermore, we observed that
ruxolitinib, in an in vitro model of HIV-1-infection in total memory CD4+ T cells, pushes differentiation of central
memory cells (TCM) to a shorter lived phenotype (effector memory T cells-TEM), which could also induce HIV-
1 reservoir decay. Baricitinib is a second-generation Jak 1/2 inhibitor (FDA approved for rheumatoid arthritis and
COVID-19), presenting a markedly improved safety profile versus ruxolitinib including approval for chronic long-
term use (including children), once daily dosing and renal clearance (making drug-drug interactions with
hepatically cleared agents unlikely; critical for add-on to ART). We have shown that baricitinib significantly
reduces the HIV-1 reservoir in primary T cells and reverses HIV-1 persistence markers and inflammation (murine
model). We also demonstrated that baricitinib confers substantial improvement of CD4/CD8 HIV-specific effector
function, boosting natural immune function that may i) enhance reservoir decline and ii) block or prevent
inflammatory driven co-morbidities in PWH. However, how baricitinib can confer reservoir reduction in ex vivo
patient samples, and in a dynamic in vivo (murine) model of systemic infection, remains unclear. We will define
the multi-functional action of baricitinib, a Jak ½ inhibitor developed by our team for treatment of viral infections
including HIV and COVID-19, towards control HIV reservoirs and persistence. This will be done by leveraging
our now-enrolling Phase2a study for baricitinib towards reduction of HIV-1 reservoir in the CNS
(NCT05452564) across peripheral blood and cerebral spinal fluid samples from the study, and existing VA
cohorts from Dr. Vincent Marconi (VA, Emory). Additional mechanisms will be bolstered by collaboration with
Dr. William Tyor (VA and Emory) using the humanized murine model of HIV-1 infection. Data will streamline
translation to additional human studies in the Veteran PWH population, for comorbidities and eventual HIV cure."
10852893,"Regional myocardial ischemia that leads to injury and myocyte necrosis results in focal scar formation and a
reduction in ventricular systolic function. The constitutive properties of the infarcted myocardium are major
determinants of left ventricular remodeling. The long-term goal of the proposal is to investigate the mechanisms
of cardiac healing and scar composition after myocardial infarction (MI) to provide targets and novel pathways
that drive adverse cardiac remodeling and left ventricular dysfunction. The specific objective is to characterize
the physiological effects of a specialized CD8+ T-cell population termed the innate-like CD8+ T-cells (ILTs) and
dissect how these cells regulate cardiac scar composition and biomechanics after MI. The central hypothesis is
that ILTs decrease (ECM) deposition and alter fibroblast activity via granzyme K (GzmK)-mediated paracrine
signaling through protease activated receptor-1 (PAR1) leading to a less stiff scar. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that ILTs are a fundamental determinant of the constitutive properties of ischemia induced
myocardial scar and resulting changes in ventricular structure and function. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
one mechanism by which ILTs influence scar biomechanics and LV remodeling is GzmK induced alterations in
ECM degradation. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that one mechanism by which ILTs inhibit fibroblast activation
is through GzmK induced PAR1 signaling. Our proposed research targets a novel cellular, molecular
mechanism that alters scar properties. Understanding this mechanism behind ILT-mediated effects on
constitutive properties of ischemia induced myocardial scar will provide targets and novel pathways that drive
adverse cardiac remodeling and LV dysfunction. The proposed study aligns with the mission of the VA
healthcare system by providing molecular knowledge to clinical practices so that we can continue to provide
exceptional health care that improves veteran health and well-being."

This application seeks to continue a longstanding CTSA-supported predoctoral program, the PhD in Clinical
Investigation (PCI) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein). PCI combines specialized training to
prepare biomedical scientists to understand and appreciate the methodologies of clinical and population
science, to practice team science as both leaders and members of research teams, and to advance the
discipline of translational science. PCI leverages Einstein's longstanding success in fundamental laboratory-
based research. PCI's unique integration with our master's degree-granting Clinical Research Training
Program (CRTP), along with our requirement that each student's research and mentoring team must “bridge a
translational divide,” fosters multidisciplinary team science while teaching the methodologies to overcome
barriers plaguing translational research. PCI has (1) conferred 18 PhDs, (2) 12 current trainees, (3) sustained
enrollment of trainees from historically marginalized communities (HMCs), and (4) a dramatic increase in
inquiries and applicants. Einstein is located in the Bronx, NY, the most diverse and poorest urban county in the
United States, whose catchment area experiences racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes related to
cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Since much of our trainees' research involves patient
data and samples from our catchment area, PCI has essentially been training trainees to conduct clinical and
translational science (TS) research that meaningfully contributes to our understanding and mitigation of
disparities that disproportionately affect HMCs. Building from our program's success and increased demand,
we seek to evolve PCI during the next funding period with formalized emphasis on integrating health equity
(HE) into our training and ensuring program sustainability. We will integrate health disparities research with a
focus on overcoming barriers to HE into our training though collaboration with the Community and Stakeholder
Engagement Research Module of our companion CTSA UM1. We will improve training of the next generation
of trainees, who have been unfavorably affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, by establishing the position of
Associate Director for Student Support. We will improve sustainability by developing a PCI-specific F-award
path to submission program. While the PCI is disease-agnostic, many of our trainees have undertaken
research that is highly relevant to our catchment area, particularly in relation to infectious disease, cancer, and
brain science. During the next funding period, we seek to leverage the non-categorical PCI and develop new
Research Focus Areas in Infectious Disease, Cancer Outcomes, and Brain Sciences, to integrate highly
funded mentors and provide the opportunity to bring additional disease-specific T32 grants into PCI, providing
PCI trainees funding opportunities beyond the four disease-agnostic slots sought through this application.
While our training approach will remain non-categorical, in the next project period we will seek to emphasize
these focus areas per our institutional strengths, while applying TS and HE lenses to all trainees' projects."

Although endothelial keratoplasty is one of the most commonly performed transplant surgeries, it is unknown
which technique provides optimal visual acuity outcomes while minimizing endothelial cell loss and
complications. Post-operative endothelial cell counts have been shown to correlate with risk of subsequent
graft failure, with significant cost to individual patients and society. Topical rho-kinase inhibitors such as
ripasudil 0.4% may play an important role in maintaining endothelial health after keratoplasty.
Here we propose the Descemet Endothelial Thickness Comparison Trial (DETECT), a randomized, outcome-
masked, multi-center, four-arm clinical trial with a 2x2 factorial design. The purpose of this study is to
determine differences in visual outcomes between two types of corneal transplant surgeries, ultrathin
Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (UT-DSAEK) and Descemet membrane endothelial
keratoplasty (DMEK), and to determine the effect of rho-kinase inhibitors on endothelial cell counts after
keratoplasty. Patients presenting to Oregon Health & Science University, Stanford University, NorthShore
University HealthSystem, University of Maryland, and to Kaiser Permanente Northern California with
endothelial dysfunction who are good candidates for either UT-DSAEK or DMEK will be eligible for inclusion.
Participants will be randomized to one of four treatment groups in this 2x2 factorial design study:

new high-resolution imaging techniques such as endothelial cell imaging, anterior-segment optical coherence
and Pentacam Scheimflug imaging, to guide post-operative treatment and as potential surrogate trial endpoints
in future trials. This world class team of collaborators have a proven track record for executing large NEI-
funded trials in ophthalmology, and are well positioned to answer the two important questions presented in this

Candidate: Dr. Amy Lenz is a research track faculty in Orthopaedics at the University of Utah. She has an
outstanding biomechanics background with a focus on merging experimental and modeling methods utilizing
her PhD in Engineering Mechanics. Her primary research interests involve using advanced medical imaging
techniques and computational modeling to study foot and ankle (F&A) orthopaedic biomechanics.
Career Development: This award will ensure Dr. Lenz finalizes training in advanced statistical shape
modeling (SSM) techniques to characterize morphometric variability in patients with tibiotalar and subtalar
osteoarthritis (OA) and is poised to grow a prolific independent research laboratory as an early career faculty
focused on developing new quantitative clinical tools for patients suffering from end-stage ankle OA.
Research Strategy: Dr. Lenz studies F&A morphology and kinematic function in patients with end-stage OA
and outcomes following surgical intervention. Clinical evaluation of end-stage ankle OA is primarily derived
from 2D conventional radiographs. She proposes a computational study to characterize ankle joint complex
disease by quantifying 3D anatomical variation through SSM of OA tibiotalar and subtalar joints. Dr. Lenz’s
preliminary data show that patients with ankle OA present with significant changes in morphology of the ankle
joint complex compared with healthy individuals. Her overall goal is to develop a mathematical model powered
by machine learning to characterize severity of OA identified on weightbearing computed tomography (CT)
scans. Based on the model classification, this research will ultimately guide clinicians with a consistent tool for
interpreting CTs and provide an increased morphometric understanding beyond conventional radiographs.
Mentor Committee: Dr. Lenz has identified a diverse, strong mentoring team. Her primary mentor is Dr.
Anderson in Orthopaedics at Utah, who has a 4+ year mentoring relationship with Dr. Lenz and is a well-
funded established professor in the field. Her computational mentor is Dr. Elhabian from the Scientific
Computing and Imaging Institute at Utah, and a current PI on two SSM NIH grants, will advise the application
of SSM software. Dr. Whitaker, imaging scientist mentor, is the director of the School of Computing and has a
strong history of NIH funding and mentorship of scientists. Dr. Saltzman is her clinical surgical mentor in
Orthopaedics at Utah and has collaborated with her for the last 4+ years, supporting her career advancement.
Dr. Mills at Utah is her musculoskeletal radiologist mentor and has a focus in F&A imaging. Dr. Ledoux, from
the VA Puget Sound, is an external mentor to provide expert insights as a leader in F&A biomechanics.
Environment: The University of Utah boasts an exceptional research environment with leaders in
computational modeling and orthopaedics to successfully execute this multidisciplinary research. In addition,
the Department of Orthopaedics strongly supports the candidate and will provide all resources necessary for
Dr. Lenz to complete her proposed research and facilitate the growth of her independent research lab."

 The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to
provide Nicolas A. Bamat, MD, MSCE, Instructor of Pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the
University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with the mentorship,
training and research experience needed to become an independent clinical investigator. His long-term career
goal is to improve outcomes for infants with neonatal lung disease by leading trials that identify evidence-
based pharmacotherapeutic practices. His immediate career development goal is to acquire the skills needed
to ensure a successful transition to research independence. To meet this goal, Dr. Bamat and his mentor team
have devised a career development plan that integrates: (1) intensive mentorship from successful pediatric
investigators; (2) focused training in clinical trials, clinical pharmacology and longitudinal data analysis; and (3)
innovative research on furosemide treatment strategies for severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
 Complications of preterm birth are the leading pediatric contributor to disability-adjusted life years lost.
BPD, or chronic lung disease of prematurity, is the most common major morbidity. BPD is particularly
devastating for infants with severe BPD (sBPD), the worst severity class. Prolonged initial hospitalizations, co-
morbid pulmonary hypertension, tracheostomy for prolonged ventilation and childhood death are common.
Currently, no pharmacotherapies have proven clinical efficacy for improving respiratory disease course in
sBPD. Despite this, medication exposures are common. The loop diuretic furosemide is most frequently used.
Dr. Bamat’s mentored research will address key knowledge gaps surrounding furosemide use in sBPD. He will:
(1) determine if and when tolerance to furosemide diuresis occurs in sBPD, (2) develop furosemide population
pharmacokinetic models with covariate analysis for individualized dosage regimens, and (3) apply the
knowledge gained in (1) and (2) to determine the comparative effectiveness of an informed furosemide
treatment strategy versus standard of care for improving the respiratory severity score and decreasing the rate
of furosemide-associated adverse effects. This research will be conducted by leveraging the existence of
CHOP’s Chronic Lung Disease Program, a multidisciplinary referral program dedicated to infants with sBPD.
 Dr. Bamat’s findings will guide furosemide treatment strategies in sBPD, for testing in placebo-
controlled multicenter trials, funded through R-series awards in his transition to research independence. The
described career development and research activities will occur at Penn and CHOP, an ideal environment in
which to train the next generation of scientists conducting NIH-supported patient-oriented research."
10929969,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ED-LEAD is proposing an embedded pragmatic clinical trial of three independent yet potentially synergistic
interventions all targeted at improving the care of Persons Living with Dementia (PLWD) and their care
partners. The three interventions – emergency care redesign, nurse-led telephonic care, and community
paramedicine – all focus on PLWD who present to the Emergency Department (ED) for care and the need for
careful attention to care transitions in the triadic encounter between the PLWD, care partner, and healthcare
team. These interventions will share patient-level outcomes that will benefit from a joint analysis. The proposed
randomization structure will be based on a multifactorial design, where EDs will be randomized to any
combination of the three interventions. This design will generate substantial quantities of data that will need to
be evaluated to assess implementation fidelity of each intervention and assess a range of intervention-specific
and universal outcomes. The Statistical Analysis Core (SAC) will provide biostatistical expertise for the overall
project. The SAC’s key function is to develop the modeling framework that will enable the study team to
evaluate each intervention individually and in combination with others. The factorial design is a key element of
the joint study that will allow the investigators to explore how the interventions might work together to have a
greater impact than any single intervention. Traditional methods of statistical inference typically require very
large sample sizes to perform complex factorial experiments. Furthermore, unreasonable assumptions
regarding the absence of interaction effects are sometimes required in analyzing a factorial design. We have
developed a Bayesian modeling approach that will enable us to present the results in a way that will allow
health care providers, health care systems, and health policy makers to assess the individual and joint impacts
of these three very different interventions never evaluated simultaneously. With the analytic framework serving
as a foundation, the SAC will support data management related to patient-level health utilization data, training
and intervention fidelity, non-CMS, intervention-specific patient-level outcome measurement, and intervention-
specific implementation outcome measurement. The SAC will oversee the randomization process to ensure
that the 80 ED sites participating in the study are distributed across the eight arms of the factorial design in a
way that minimizes imbalance of key site-level characteristics, such as location and size. The SAC will perform
statistical analyses and data exploration using appropriate statistical and computing methodologies, and assist
in interpreting and presenting results."
10929972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners visit the emergency department (ED) more
frequently than those who are unaffected, and face unique and complex challenges associated with managing
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and presenting symptoms.
Team-based dementia care has worked well for PLWD, and an emergency care redesign intervention
(UH3AT009844) of new and intentional workflows for emergency providers reinforced by digital alerts has
increased advance care plans and enlisted multidisciplinary support. The psychosocial challenges and the
inherent complexity of AD/ADRD care beg for a way to simplify a feasible assessment and ensure adoption of
an emergency care team-based strategy. Simplifying an approach to reflect a less time-intensive and more
pragmatic intervention while attending to needed knowledge, sensitivities, and a structure to achieve best care
for PLWD and their care partners (dyads) requires three core components: 1) identifying problems; 2)
prioritizing problems (inclusive of goals of care); and 3) establishing feasible, psychosocially sensitive
interventions. While these components are essential to reduce ED revisits and other outcomes of critical
importance to dyads, such results are unlikely without an embedded structure and an informatic-supported
workflow that emphasizes and encourages care processes congruent with high-quality emergency care. The
proposed intervention, Emergency Care Redesign, will provide core components of trial-tested dementia care
management programs, embedded within an educational structure for emergency care providers (nurses,
physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and social workers), clinical decision supports for PLWD
notification, reminders and instructional brief videos for reinforcement, a shared structured worksheet in the
electronic health record for critically needed assessments and data acquisition, audit and feedback supporting
a biweekly case-review consultation, and a post visit social work phone call to reinforce community referrals for
all PLWD who visit the ED. We will optimize, within one ED, this dementia-informed redesigned acute care
(Emergency Care Redesign) and then implement this program in 40 out of 80 EDs within 14 health systems
throughout the United States. We will test the effectiveness of emergency care redesign-informed procedures
for the care of PLWD and care partners either as a single intervention or in combination with nurse-led
telephonic care and/or a community paramedic-led transitions intervention in a cluster-randomized,
multifactorial trial (in these 40 facilities) on the following outcomes: ED revisits within 30 days following the
index visit, hospitalizations, and healthy days at home within 6 months of ED discharge. We will determine site,
provider, patient, and care partner-level characteristics associated with fidelity of implementation and variation
in impact of ED dementia-informed care. This intervention promises to reduce ED revisits while providing
evidence-based, real-world care to improve the lives of PLWD with serious illness and their care partners."
10929985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The emergency department (ED) is often the care setting of last resort, and is ill suited to provide care for
people living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners. Many ED visits, which are for ambulatory-care-
sensitive or acute exacerbations of chronic conditions, pain, behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia (BPSD), and care partner strain are addressable if intervened upon in the community. Significant
inequity in access to effective outpatient or home-based care further exacerbates who unnecessarily ends up
in the ED. ED visits are also a significant indicator for serious illness in PLWD; 43.1% will have subsequent ED
visits and 31.9% will die within one year. Telephonic nurse-led, interdisciplinary transitional and palliative care
is a cost-effective, patient centered modality shown to both reduce inequities and ED visits. Studies in both
palliative care populations and earlier stages of AD/ADRD without serious illness showed efficacy. However,
this work has not focused on those living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD) who are also seriously ill, on large scale “real-world” embedded pragmatic clinical trials,
or with a focus on the ED as site of triggering telephonic care. This project will implement Aliviado Dementia
Care-Telephonic Edition, an evidence-based nurse-led telephonic transition and palliative care intervention
tested end-to-end and widely disseminated in other modalities. The intervention will follow PLWD for 6-months,
and focus on care transitions, assessing and managing BPSD, care partner strain, social determinants of
health and social needs, and conversations about serious illness. In this study, the nurse-led telephonic
intervention will first be optimized for use in conjunction with the two other interventions used in this proposal
(ED Care Redesign and Community Paramedic-led Transitions) in two EDs to ensure effective coordination
when multiple interventions are used. This optimization will follow a user-centered design process and engage
a wide spectrum of stakeholders in coordination with administrative and implementation cores (Aim 1). We will
then conduct a 3-arm embedded pragmatic multifactorial cluster randomized trial that uses Medicare claims
data to test whether nurse-led telephonic care for PLWD alone and in concert with the other interventions
reduces ED visits and hospitalizations, and increases the number of healthy days at home (Aim 2). We will
implement the intervention in 40 EDs in the larger pragmatic trial, tested alone and in conjunction with the other
interventions in a randomized fashion. We will also examine patient- and organization-level factors, including
health inequities that influence implementation and PLWD- and care partner-reported outcomes as part of a
separate implementation analysis (Aim 3). Upon successful completion, this study will provide stakeholders
with the effectiveness data, as well as the implementation and PLWD-Care Partner dyad factors needed to
provide this highly disseminable and implementable form of dyad-centered care with the potential to improve
quality of care and quality of life, and reduce avoidable healthcare utilization in seriously ill PLWD."
10929991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 3 million known persons living with dementia (PLWD) visit the emergency department (ED)
annually. This is likely an underestimated value as most cases of dementia go unrecognized in the ED. Most
PLWD are treated and released, implying that they do not need medical oversight and are on the road to
recovery. Yet, for PLWD, the ED-to-home transition is associated with increased risk of ED revisits, adverse
events, and mortality. The critical need for effective care transition interventions for PLWD has been identified
by the NIA-funded Geriatric Emergency Care Applied Research 2.0 Network – Advancing Dementia Care. Our
adaptation of the Coleman’s Care Transitions Intervention, delivered by community paramedics for community-
dwelling older adults transitioning from ED-to-home, reduced the odds of ED revisits within 30 days by 75%
among patients with cognitive impairment. These results lay the foundation for testing the Community
Paramedic-Led Transitions Intervention (CPTI) in a large-scale embedded pragmatic clinical trial to rigorously
evaluate its effectiveness in improving the ED-to-home transitions for PLWD. In this study, we will test our
hypothesis that the CPTI will improve the ED-to-home transition and utilization outcomes for PLWD,
both alone and when combined with other interventions. We will leverage community paramedicine, an
innovative and new health care model where paramedics function outside their traditional roles to deliver
community health interventions. We will optimize the CPTI across two sites in coordination with the Nurse-led
Telephonic Care and ED Care Redesign for PLWD, assessing intervention acceptability and engagement. We
will test the CPTI’s effectiveness alone and in combination with the other interventions in an 80-center, cluster-
randomized, multifactorial embedded pragmatic clinical trial for community-dwelling PLWD and their care
partners experiencing an ED visit by analyzing ED revisit rates, hospitalizations, and total days at home
following an index ED visit. We will also determine site, provider, and patient-level characteristics that are
associated with CPTI outcome variations using the RE-AIM framework, such that future implementation can
adequately address these care gaps. Upon its completion, this study will address the important gap of
overlooked ED-to-home transitions for PLWD receiving ED care. By rigorously investigating the CPTI, we will
provide critical evidence on ways to improve PLWD health outcomes and enable underutilized healthcare
resources for this vulnerable population."
10917078,"Ammonia solution (20%) (AMM) is highly toxic and of interest to the CCRP. A major target for acute ammonia
exposure is the cornea. Corneal ammonia exposure results in an alkali wound, which can lead to a host of
potentially blinding pathologic features and often times loss of the eye. There are few studies describing AMM
cornea wounds and the mechanisms leading to those injures, with no established model to carry out such studies.
 We hypothesize that a significant pathway leading to pathologies associated with AMM-induced corneal
alkali burn wounds is the rapid hydration of epoxy fatty acids (EpFA) by soluble epoxide hydroxylase (sEH).
EpFAs are anti-inflammatory, inflammation-resolving and anti-fibrotic CYP450 metabolites of long chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Consequently, AMM injury-induced sEH hydration of EpFAs disrupts the natural
inflammation resolving and anti-fibrotic pathways present in the cornea. Moreover, we hypothesize that AMM
corneal injuries can be minimized or resolved using topically applied sEH inhibitors (sEHI) and/or natural
EpFAs such as EETs, including novel sEHI and EpFA mimics developed and synthesized in our labs.
 The long-term objectives of this project are several fold, with the overall goals being to gain a better
understanding of the mechanisms behind injuries created by corneal AMM exposure, and to develop potential
therapeutics to treat AMM-induced wounds. Given that AMM wounds are at least in part due to exposure to an
extremely alkali agent, these therapeutics could have broad applications. The project Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. Develop novel, reliable in vitro and in vivo mouse cornea AMM-injury models to test the hypothesis
that sEH activity reduces EpFA concentrations following mouse cornea AMM exposure, and determine the
cellular location of sEH in control corneas and in corneas following AMM injury.
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that AMM-induced corneal injuries can be diminished or resolved using topically
applied sEHI and/or EpFAs.
Aim 3. Quantify sEH and EpFA levels in human corneas and develop repeatable human cornea AMM-injury
models to examine the effects of AMM exposure on sEH and EpFAs in cultured primary human corneal cells
and ex vivo donor cornea rims.
The in vivo mouse wound healing studies and cell culture models will be carried out in Dr. Watsky's lab using
models currently in development, along with immunohistochemistry studies. sEH and EpFA quantitative
analysis will be performed by ELISA and mass spectroscopy in Dr. Hammock's lab. Therapeutics to be tested
and topically applied to AMM-wounded corneas will include sEHIs and EpFAs synthesized in Dr. Hammock's
lab, and biostable EpFA mimics designed and synthesized in the labs of Drs. Hammock and Vic. Human tissue
and cell culture AMM exposure model development will be carried out in Dr. Watsky's lab using donor cornea
rims and cells cultured from those rims, which are routinely obtained and utilized in the lab."
10910056,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this application is to determine the sequence of key events that leads to the pathological
progression elicited after acrolein and phosgene inhalation. Chemically-induced acute lung injury (CIALI) is a
form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by loss of alveolar barrier function
that leads to increased protein and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar air space. Currently, ARDS therapy is
mainly limited to managed mechanical ventilation, and the mortality rate remains high. Mortality is influenced by
sex, age, and genetic susceptibility in patients, which can be experimentally modeled in mice. A major CIALI risk
factor is smoke inhalation and the main irritant in smoke is acrolein. Death can be immediate or delayed resulting
from a complex cellular and pulmonary responses that progress with time and dictate the severity of the injury.
Another chemical that can induce delayed pulmonary edema is phosgene, which was develop as a chemical
weapon in World War I. Currently, it is unknown whether acrolein and phosgene produce CIALI by the same
overlapping mechanisms or by mechanisms unique to each chemical. To develop effective therapeutic
interventions, more studies are needed to understand the disease-progression and injury-resolution mechanisms
underlying severity of injury and mortality. This proposal has the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the
temporal events of sensitivity and resistance to acrolein-induced acute lung injury, 2. Delineate critical pathways
in acrolein-induced CIALI progression and resolution using multiomic analyses, and 3. Compare and contrast
the progression of phosgene-induced CIALI to that of acrolein-induced CIALI. Detailed time course analyses will
evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage, lung histopathology, spatial lipidomics, spatial metabolomics and single-cell
and spatial transcriptomics following acrolein or phosgene exposure. Strain- and sex-specific responses will be
investigated. Determining the sequence of key pathological events controlling the progression and resolution of
acute lung injury elicited by acrolein and phosgene should provide a mechanistic basis for the development of
therapy."
10925243,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The success of precision medicine continues to rest on our ability to measure the genome, the environment, and the
physiological state of patients; then choose interventions that maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. A key
component of precision medicine is to understand pharmacogenomics (PGx) — the genetic influences on interindividual
drug response variability. Two million adverse drug reactions occur annually in the United States, which results in
roughly 100,000 deaths and costs upwards of $30 billion dollars each year. Approximately 15%-20% of FDA-approved
medications are impacted by common germline genetic variation, and their effectiveness and safety can be improved by
using genetic tests to guide prescribing. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths are preventable, prompting many health
care organizations, community, and academic medical centers to invest in genomic medicine implementation by
supporting PGx decision support and returning PGx results. For over 10 years, CPIC has provided critical resources to
translate patient genotypes into evidence-based prescribing recommendations for specific drugs. Based on these important
clinical guidelines, the Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT) provides the scientific and clinical
communities the ability to annotate raw genetic test data (genotypes, DNA sequence) with standardized PGx calls,
knowledge from the clinical guidelines and report the subsequent haplotypes, diplotypes and phenotypes with appropriate
clinical guidance via a user-friendly software pipeline. CPIC coupled with the PharmCAT software enable the global
clinical implementation of PGx in precision medicine programs. In this proposal, we outline our plan to develop the
Clinical Implementation Resources for Pharmacogenomics (CIRP) to accelerate clinical implementation of PGx research
discoveries. We will accomplish this plan by continuing the development of CPIC clinical guidelines and supporting
evidence which are then applied to genetic test results by PharmCAT for result translation and the subsequent clinical
implementation of PGx. The track record of CPIC (2009) and PharmCAT (2017) in collaboration with the PharmGKB
(2000) in serving the broad scientific and clinical community is exceptional. In this proposal, we request support to
advance the CIRP in support of genome-informed medicine and outline a plan to (1) develop and utilize innovative
approaches to create, expand, and update CPIC guidelines (2) integrate CPIC, FDA, and other publicly available
guidelines through PharmCAT and (3) disseminate PGx clinical implementation content and tools to the greater scientific
community for local and cloud-based usage."
10909899,"Background and Aims: The costs associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are substantial;
PTSD impacts work productivity, relationship functioning, and physical health, with estimated annual costs to
VA in disability payments of $4.28 billion. Ineffective treatments substantially contribute to the perpetuation of
chronic PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in Veterans and, as a consequence, the enormous public
health burden associated with PTSD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly
prescribed class of medications for patients with PTSD. However, many patients are not responsive to SSRIs
and there is no rapid, uncomplicated way to determine who will or will not benefit from this family of
medications.
A pre-medication assessment using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) offers a possible means for
predicting treatment response to SSRIs. More specifically, Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked
Potentials (LDAEP), derived from responses to a series of increasingly loud tones, appears to be strongly
influenced by brain serotonin level and thereby holds considerable promise as an indicator of the brain’s
potential responsiveness to SSRIs. The primary aim of the proposed project is to investigate the usefulness of
LDAEP for predicting those individuals who will most likely show a favorable or adverse response to SSRIs. A
secondary aim is to determine LDAEP cut-off values that would enable a clinician to make an individualized
SSRI treatment decision based on a patient’s LDAEP score. A tertiary aim is to evaluate LDAEP as an
objective outcome measure of SSRI response. An exploratory aim will test whether the relationships between
LDAEP and SSRI response differ for men and women and whether men and women have different optimal
LDAEP cut off scores.
Study Design: A sample of 94 Veterans with PTSD (50% male; 50% female) will participate in a 12-week
sertraline trial preceded by a 4-week single-blinded placebo lead-in phase. Embedded in this study are four
assessment sessions: pre-placebo, pre-sertraline, and one and three months after initiating sertraline. The
procedures conducted during each assessment session will be mostly the same. Participants will: a) engage in
the ERP procedure that will yield the LDAEP score, b) complete a battery of symptom outcome measures
including measures of PTSD and depressive symptom severity, c) complete self-report assessments of current
medication use, medication adherence, and side effects, and d) provide a blood sample for measurement of
SSRI level and platelet measurement of serotonin reuptake.
Clinical Implications: Findings from this study may contribute to development of a precision-medicine
approach when choosing an initial psychopharmacological intervention for Veterans with PTSD. Development
of a biological screening method that can be used to identify those individuals who are most likely to be
clinically responsive to an SSRI and those who are more likely to benefit from a different intervention could
save the medication provider and patient weeks of waiting to see whether or not the patient will be responsive
to an SSRI. It may also aid in avoiding adverse reactions to SSRIs. The proposed methodology is noninvasive
and the test can be administered in about 40 minutes. The costs, expertise and time necessary to implement
this test in usual care would conceivably be comparable to that of an electrocardiogram (EKG)."
10903860,"SUMMARY (Core D)
The multidisciplinary approaches proposed in this Program Project, whether structural or functional, depend on
the availability of high quality and standardized biological samples and reagents. The overarching goal of the
Apo/Lipoprotein and Production Core (Core D) is to meet this critical need across the entire Program. The
Core is designed to provide the following services: 1) Isolation, characterization, and distribution of lipoproteins
and apolipoproteins isolated from human plasma, 2) Expression, purification, and distribution of recombinant
apolipoproteins, isotopically labeled proteins, and peptide mass spectrometry standards, 3) Design,
expression, purification, and distribution of customized apolipoprotein mutants, including new constructs for
assessing the mobility of HDL-bound proteins, 4) Generation, characterization, and distribution of reconstituted
HDL particles customized to test specific hypotheses from around the Program, and 5) Generation and
characterization of targeted nanobody reagents for cryo-EM studies. Core D will be led by W. Sean Davidson,
Ph.D., working with two outstanding and highly experienced research technicians, Jamie Morris and Scott
Street. It will be located at the University of Cincinnati, which has extensive and documented experience in all
of the Core’s proposed services. In the previous PPG cycle, Core D filled over 550 orders from the other
Projects and Cores, not including hundreds more that were used in the Davidson lab. Based on prices charged
by traditional biochemical supply sources, the retail value of these samples far exceeds the resources needed
to run the core. Thus, this resource contributes substantially to the synergy and cost-effectiveness of the
Program’s ongoing work. We believe that few, if any, facilities in the world can provide these services in a
single place."
10794390,"Molecular mechanisms that regulate insulin resistance and its progression to type2 diabetes (T2D) are not
understood and might reveal a therapeutic opportunity to reduce the burden of T2D. We recently identified
causative loss-of-function mutations in the CELA2A gene (Esteghamat & Mani, Nat. Genet. 2019), which
encodes the pancreatic elastase Chymotrypsin-like ELAstase 2A in kindreds with extreme phenotypes of
metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and early-onset atherosclerosis. Interestingly, the genome-wide
association studies have also shown a strong association between common variants in the CELA2A gene and
blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and BMI, underscoring its role in the disease of the general population.
Although only known for its function as a pancreatic exocrine enzyme, we found it to be a circulating protein
that is expressed in the extrapancreatic tissues, including gut. Its plasma levels rise after each meal in parallel
to plasma insulin levels in healthy humans. Our characterization of CELA2A functions revealed its ability to
trigger insulin secretion and sensitivity. In contrast, the catalytically inactive mutant CELA2A proteins found in
the cohort increased platelet aggregation and reduced insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, CELA2A was found
to proteolytically cleave GPCRs such as PAR2 and induce PAR2-dependent activation of AMPK, while mutant
CELA2As trigger different PAR2-dependent pathways, resulting in increased ERK and reduced AMPK
activation. Thus, CELA2A appears to be an endogenous ligand of PAR2, a GPCR that has been implicated in
the regulation of glucose homeostasis. These functions underscore CELA2A’s role as a novel risk factor and
an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of T2D. We will investigate the physiological functions of
CELA2A and explore its molecular mechanisms of action in glucose homeostasis in global, acinar cell- and
gut-specific Cela2a knockout mice, with a focus PAR2-dependent pathways. Cela2a KO mice are ideal for
this goal as they show impaired insulin sensitivity and increased hepatic and plasma triglycerides that match
the phenotypes of humans."
10778615,"Project Summary
A key aspect of stressor adaptation in humans and other mammals involves the selection of appropriate coping
responses. The active coping response set allows for the maintenance of lower levels of glucocorticoid stress
hormones and sympathetic activity, due in part to the actual or perceived agency over aversive stimuli, and when
active responses are restricted, such as in the passive coping set, behavioral passivity increases and HPA and
sympathetic responses are exaggerated. In this regard, elevations in HPA and autonomic systems resulting from
over-biasing toward passive coping contribute to psychiatric and systemic disease pathogenesis. Our
unpublished data using pathway-specific optogenetic circuit analyses have revealed that two parallel pathways
from caudal and rostral prelimbic (cPL and rPL) cortex, innervating dorsolateral and ventrolateral subdivisions of
periaqueductal gray (dlPAG and vlPAG), that promote active and prevent passive behaviors, respectively, in
response to acute stressors. Based on these preliminary data, we will examine the hypotheses that one or both
of these pathways are required to promote an active coping set, whereas their diminished influence under chronic
stress conditions biases the animal toward a passive coping set. The first aim will determine how activity changes
in PAG projector neurons in PL correlate with active and passive coping behavior following chronic stress
compared to rats with no previous exposure. Aims 2 and 3 will utilize pathway specific optogenetic manipulations
to evaluate whether inactivation of either cPL–dlPAG or rPL–vlPAG pathways under acute stress conditions
increases passive behavior and exaggerated HPA and sympathetic activation. Conversely, we will evaluate
whether increasing activity in either of these pathways in chronically stressed rats can rescue an active coping
set involving increased active behavior, and attenuated HPA and sympathetic output. In the fourth aim, we will
address the complementary relationship between each circuit’s function (i.e., cPL–dlPAG pathway promotes an
active coping set; rPL–vlPAG pathway prevents a passive coping set), since these data implicate the
predominance of one circuit over the other. Here, we will utilize an anterograde transsynaptic viral strategy to
optogenetically test whether the cPL–dlPAG pathway engages vlPAG as a downstream mediator for restraining
passive behavior and preventing exaggerated HPA and sympathetic activation under CVS conditions. These
studies will advance a new framework for understanding the neural regulation of stress coping for translation to
stress-related psychiatric diseases— by elucidating a novel circuitry and activity patterns of responses under
acute and chronic conditions, and the expansion of the concepts of susceptibility and resilience to encompass
behavioral, endocrine and physiological features."

The Duke Clinical Center will be a new center that participates in the full scope of the Network, enrolling a diverse
population of patients at Duke as well as a Wake Forest University (WFU) satellite site. Duke has a long history
of participation in the MFMU Network, first as a clinical center, and most recently as a satellite center. In addition
to conducting trials in the MFMU Network, the Duke Perinatal Research Center (DPRC) has vast experience in
enrolling for randomized trials and cohort studies with NIAID and CDC Networks. The Duke Clinical Center will
bring special strength in developing new research protocols, particularly in the areas of infectious diseases in
pregnancy and health disparities in preterm birth. The diverse research population available in the center’s
catchment area includes an enriched representation of Black and Latinx from multiple Duke locations, as well as
WFU. Moreover, the team has a strong track record in clinical trials collaborations, recruitment, retention, and
follow up that will contribute to the Network’s goals of enhancing rigor and reproducibility, data sharing, and
inclusion of diverse patient groups and workforce. The Center has large scale outpatient facilities as well with
an established infrastructure for enrolling patients at both high risk clinics as well as in collaboration with
generalist obstetrics partners in low risk clinics. The Duke Clinical Center, supported by Clinical and Translational
Science Awards (CTSAs) at both Duke and WFU, will promote an environment of equity and inclusion, fostering
a respectful climate for all investigators, patients, and participants. The team has a strong history of collaboration
with specialists in pediatrics, pharmacology and lactation and will leverage those collaborations to bring forward
innovative, high quality science to the MFMU Network. The proposed specific aims for the Duke Clinical Center
are Aim 1. Oversee and manage operations of the Duke Clinical Center – provide the infrastructure,
oversight, expertise, and resources to conduct Duke Clinical Center studies, including contributions from the
WFU satellite site (and any future MFMU Network-designated sites); administrative, scientific, fiscal, and data
management; communication, collaboration, and coordination processes within and between sites. Aim 2.
Maximize recruitment and retention of study participants, as well as investigators and staff, from diverse
populations – use innovative strategies, such as community-based partnerships, bilingual research staff, and
conduct of community-engaged research and qualitative methods for enrolling subjects in Network studies. Aim
3. Design and implement high-impact research protocols in collaboration with the Data Coordinating
Center and other Network sites – contribute innovative research specifically in the areas of infectious diseases,
perinatal pharmacology, disparities in preterm birth, and perinatal epidemiology; ensure rigorous collection of
reproducible, high-quality data; and leverage institutional resources to maintain robust collaboration between the

10770569,"Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) is a thermally dimorphic fungus and an intracellular pathogen of
macrophages. Hc grows in the soil in a multicellular hyphal form. Once inhaled, Hc responds to mammalian body
temperature by converting to a unicellular yeast form and initiating the expression of virulence genes important
for macrophage colonization. We have extensive experience elucidating the gene networks that are
transcriptionally induced in yeast cells. In our published work, we annotated the transcriptome of yeast-phase
cells and discovered a family of small (≤ 200 AAs) predicted secreted proteins that exhibit a conserved C-
terminal, 6-cysteine spacing pattern reminiscent of some insect toxins. The transcripts encoding these proteins
showed highly differential expression in yeast cells compared to the remainder of the transcriptome, suggesting
that they play an important role during infection. Further analysis revealed 26 Hc ORFs in this family, each
containing a predicted cystine knot (or knottin) domain. In contrast, most fungal species contain 0-2 predicted
knottin proteins in their genomes. Knottin domains are comprised of 3 interwoven disulfide bonds that form one
of the smallest known stable globular domains, making these proteins extremely resistant to chemical, heat, and
proteolytic stresses. Our preliminary data reveal the remarkable result that mutant strains lacking individual
knottins show reduced virulence in the mouse model of Hc infection. All of these mutants are partially deficient
in stimulating lysis of host macrophages, and some but not all display diminished growth within macrophages,
indicating that knottins play key roles in Hc-host interactions. We will take advantage of our expertise in Hc-
macrophage interactions and Hc molecular genetics to interrogate the role of individual and multiple knottins in
Hc pathogenesis. We propose the following aims: First, using the mutant strains we have already generated,
and taking advantage of CRISPR technology we have adapted to efficiently generate more mutant strains, we
will further investigate the contribution of individual and multiple knottins to pathogenesis of Hc in macrophage
and mouse models of infection. Second, our published work established that Hc activates apoptosis of infected
macrophages by triggering an integrated stress response (ISR) in these cells. We will compare the transcriptional
signature of macrophages to infection with wild-type vs mutant knottin strains to elucidate the contribution of
individual knottins to the ISR and other aspects of the host molecular response to Hc. Additionally, since a subset
of knottin mutants display reduced growth within macrophages, we will determine whether knottins affect the
ability of Hc to block phagosome maturation, which is a key step in intracellular survival. Finally, to elucidate the
molecular mechanism of knottin function, we will use standard pipelines in our laboratory to determine the
subcellular localization and protein interactome of selected knottins during macrophage infection with Hc. These
approaches will provide the first exploration of the role of knottins in fungal pathogenesis of mammals, and will
give critical insight into the contribution of knottins to Hc pathogenesis."

The metabolic properties of T cells can influence their ability to mount effective responses against solid tumors.
This limitation is particularly relevant to optimal adoptive cell therapy approaches, whereby tumor-antigen
targeted T cells are administered to patients to eradicate tumors. Our team has made great progress towards
overcoming this issue via our discovery that selective blockade of the PI3K p110δ isoform with CAL-101
(Idealisib®) in vitro can rewire the metabolism of T cells and render them potent upon in vivo administration to
tumor bearing mice. Importantly, the durability of these T cells is associated with their enhanced mitochondrial
bioenergetics and persistence, and an extraordinary capacity to mount rapid recall responses against tumor re-
challenge. While mice are cured from this therapy, they often develop autoimmune vitiligo. Our newest data
reveal that while PI3Kδ-inhibited T cells have stemness properties in vitro, they become tissue-resident and
effector memory cells in lymphoid tissues. These provocative results imply that they may cooperate to sustain
host-wide protection against metastasis by virtue of their memory phenotype and elicit vitiligo in the animal. We
conducted RNAseq on these potent PI3Kδ-inhibited T cells and identified a novel oligoribonuclease, called
REXO2. Our preliminary data indicates that genetic ablation of REXO2 abrogates their ability to fight tumors, but
overexpressing REXO2 supports mitochondrial biogenesis, antitumor metabolism and endows T cells with
efficacy as an adoptive cell therapy. These innovative data are the first to define a role for REXO2 as an
actionable factor to enhance ACT. This proposal will uncover mechanisms supporting T cell metabolism and
immunity in the context of REXO2 and PI3K signaling and facilitate future translational efforts for ACT with
REXO2-manipulated human T cells. We hypothesize REXO2 supports metabolism of antitumor T cells and that
REXO2 can be leveraged in T cells to improve the efficacy of ACT. The role of REXO2 in T cells and its
therapeutic potential will be investigated in three complementary Specific Aims: AIM 1 will identify mechanisms
by which PI3Kδ targeting supports antitumor T cell activity, by studying how REXO2—induced via PI3Kδ-
blockade—bolsters bioenergetics to instill immunity in mice. AIM 2 will define how resident and lymphoid memory
donor T cells protect mice from metastasis. Studies will also test how REXO2, sustained preferentially in skin-
resident donor T cells, impacts immunity to self-versus tumor tissues. We will use human TIL and CAR T cell
products generated in cancer patients and clinically-relevant xenogeneic human tumor mouse models in AIM 3,
inspired by our desire to delve into studies with immediate translational significance. Namely, this work provides
foundational data to generate optimized, redirected human T cells with heighted REXO2. This approach is
attractive to augment immunometabolism in poorly functional T cells and empower them to mediate durable
memory responses to solid tumors. Overall, the proposed research is significant, as it is expected to reveal that
manipulation of REXO2 can safely protect against tumor recurrence with reduced side effects to patients."
10835058,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc-scleroderma) is a multisystem autoimmune, fibrotic disease associated with high
morbidity and mortality. Progress in the development of effective therapies for SSc has been hampered by a
fragmented understanding of its pathogenesis. Although abundant evidence implicates dysregulated immunity
in SSc, the mechanisms by which the immune system influences fibroblast function are not well-understood. We
propose herein a multifaceted approach to elucidate the role of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in dermal
fibroblasts as a pathologic bridge between immune dysregulation and fibrosis in SSc.
An interferon (IFN) gene expression signature is the most prominent peripheral blood cell transcript profile in
SSc. Moreover, our large-scale gene expression studies have identified IRF7, a key transcription factor in the
type I IFN pathway, as the top predicted upstream regulator of the SSc molecular profile in both skin and blood,
as well as a prominent regulator of SSc fibroblasts. Our recently published work showed that IRF7 is significantly
upregulated and activated in SSc skin and explanted dermal fibroblasts, and that type I IFN upregulates IRF7
expression in fibroblasts. IRF7 interacts with SMAD3 and potentiates TGFβ induced fibrosis signaling in
fibroblasts. Moreover, global Irf7 knockdown attenuates dermal fibrosis in two murine dermal fibrosis models.
Lastly, our recent preliminary data suggest fibroblast specific Irf7 knockdown might be sufficient for attenuating
the bleomycin induced dermal fibrosis. Herein, we hypothesize that IRF7 links type I IFN pathway to the fibrotic
response by potentiating the TGFβ signaling in fibroblasts which are the primary effector cells in SSc. Our primary
goal is to elucidate the role of type I IFN induced IRF7 upregulation in potentiating the TGFβ canonical
pathway via IRF7 interaction with SMAD3 in dermal fibroblasts. The following Specific Aims will be pursued:
Aim 1: Define the fibroblast specific contribution of Irf7 depletion in murine dermal fibrosis models. The
impact of fibroblast specific Irf7 depletion on dermal fibrosis in bleomycin induced and Tsk1 dermal fibrosis
models will be investigated. Aim 2: Elucidate the functional effects of IRF7 on SMAD3 mediated
transcriptional activity and gene expression regulation Human fibroblast cell lines with IRF7 over-
expression and deletion will be generated and TGFβ-mediated SMAD3 transcriptional targets and gene
expression regulation will be characterized by ChIP- and RNA-sequencing. Aim 3: Delineate the relationship
between the peripheral blood cell interferon signature and IRF7 upregulation at the end-organ level in
patients with SSc. The relationship between the peripheral blood IFN signature and IRF7 expression in SSc
skin tissue and dermal fibroblast subpopulations will be characterized using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing.
Cumulatively, this proposal can elucidate a key mechanism by which immune dysregulation leading to IRF7
activation potentiates the fibrotic response in SSc. Ultimately, this can open the door to identification of more
targeted and effective treatment options for this potentially devastating disease."
10912553,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Deregulated protein interactions contribute to the development, maintenance, and chemoresistance of human
cancer. The critical contact points of cancer-causing proteins are often mediated by so-called “helix-in-groove”
interactions, whereby an alpha-helical subcomponent of one protein inserts into the surface groove of another
to drive oncogenic signaling. For example, BCL-2 family proteins regulate the critical balance between cellular
life and death and cancer cells overexpress the anti-apoptotic members, which contain a surface groove that
effectively traps the “killer” helix of pro-apoptotic members, to enforce cellular immortality. We have inserted all-
hydrocarbon struts into natural alpha-helices to restore their shape, stability, and bioactivity so that they can be
used as both powerful chemical tools to dissect oncogenic protein interactions and as prototype therapeutics to
drug them. Over the last 15 years, I have developed special expertise in the design of stapled peptides for
diverse applications in cancer research and treatment. I have generated spin-labeled analogs for NMR structural
analyses, photoreactive constructs for rapid binding-site analysis by mass spectrometry, cysteine-reactive
variants for covalent targeting of oncogenic proteins, fluorescent derivatives for binding affinity quantitation and
cellular imaging, radiolabeled constructs for in vivo imaging, and iteratively-optimized analogs for preclinical
testing and translation. The remarkable impact of stapled peptides is best reflected by their capacity to identify
new cancer targets, mechanisms, and druggable binding sites and their advancement to clinical trials in adults
and children with relapsed cancers. The goal of this competitive renewal application is to continue to expand the
breadth and depth of stapled peptide innovation in support of critical cancer research programs that harness
these reagents in proteomic discovery, structural determination, mechanism-of-action studies, and therapeutic
development. Specifically, I aim to robustly support the NCI-funded R35 research program of my Unit Director,
Dr. Loren Walensky, who as a chemical biologist and pediatric oncologist, focuses on characterizing the BCL-2
family interaction mechanisms that drive human cancer by neutralizing the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
Reactivating apoptosis in cancer is essential to overcoming chemoresistance and the pathologic alpha-helical
interactions of the BCL-2 family are ideally suited for interrogation by stapled peptides. In running the Stapled
Peptide Design Group of the Walensky lab and Dana-Farber’s Program in Cancer Chemical Biology, I am
personally responsible for developing and optimizing the chemistry that drives stapled peptide innovations, and
creating a high-throughput consultation, production, purification, quantitation, and characterization workflow that
is also relied upon by dozens of our internal and external collaborators. As a Research Specialist operating at
the interface of chemistry, cancer biology, and experimental therapeutics, I am committed to mining the potential
of next-generation stapled peptides to advance our understanding of fundamental oncogenic mechanisms and
to create novel therapeutics for cancer treatment."
10919202,"SUMMARY
The pandemic rise of obesity worldwide is alarming, with the highest increases occurring in the United States.
Obesity is a major risk factor for many cancer types, including colon cancer (CC). To date, the biologic
mechanisms underlying this relationship, specifically the potential signaling between dysregulated adipose
tissue and adjacent tumor, are incompletely understood. Given the rising rates of obesity and the challenges
for many people to lose excess adipose tissue, an integrated, multilevel approach to efficiently identify
crosstalk and validate key molecular targets is needed to develop effective mechanism-based strategies for
prevention and control of obesity-driven CC. We hypothesize that the metabolic and inflammatory
perturbations induced by obesity increase CC risk through altered signaling between adipocytes and colon
epithelial/tumor cells, and that inhibition of this crosstalk will disrupt the obesity-CC link.
 We will test this hypothesis through the integration of: 1) a unique, prospective, multicenter epidemiologic
cohort of normoweight to obese CC patients, from whom paired serum, tumor, and tumor-adjacent adipose
tissue samples will be used to discover and validate lead targets; and 2) complementary in vivo models of lean
and diet-induced obese mice with CC, together with in vitro/in vivo organoid models in which potential targets
underlying the effects of obesity on CC will be tested mechanistically. This unique transdisciplinary approach
utilizes innovative clinical/epidemiological and preclinical studies of biochemical, transcriptomic, and
metabolomics analyses in rigorous study designs to identify and validate new targets for disrupting the
reciprocal crosstalk between adipocytes and colonic epithelial cells. We propose three synergistic aims: 1a) to
discover and validate targets underlying the adipose tissue-CC link, using 400 CC patients; b) to identify and
validate metabolic and transcriptomic signatures of adipocyte-colonocyte crosstalk; 2) to characterize the
adipocyte-colonocyte crosstalk underlying the obesity-CC link, using two rigorous mouse models of CC; 3) to
determine the causal role of candidate epithelial target genes in obesity-associated CC progression using
murine in vitro and in vivo organoid CC models.
 This paradigm-shifting transdisciplinary collaboration builds on extensive preliminary data and generates
maximum synergy through complementary human and murine studies, using identical state-of-the-art
biomarker panels and platforms across clinical and preclinical studies. We anticipate that findings from these
proposed studies will address the clinical challenges associated with obesity and CC by establishing causal
links of the most promising targets for intercepting and disrupting adipocyte-epithelial cell crosstalk."
10865099,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Through decades of research, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified heritable coding and
noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that lead to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's
disease (AD). However, the vast majority of these SNPs remain largely under-characterized, and their
contribution to AD pathogenesis remains unclear, marking a critical roadblock to our understanding of AD
genetics and pathogenesis. While SNPs within the APOE and TREM2 genes have identified vital nodes in AD
biology, most AD-related SNPs reside within the noncoding genome, making their functional roles in the
disease less clear. Co-inheritance of nearby SNPs (linkage disequilibrium) and the cell type-specificity of
noncoding regulatory elements further complicate functional annotation of noncoding SNPs in AD. As part of
the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Functional Genomics Consortium (ADSP FGC), this project will
provide a robust and conclusive functional characterization of AD-related noncoding SNPs. To do this, we will
first create a comprehensive single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility across a cohort of
diverse clinico-pathologic states related to AD (Aim 1). Using these cell type-specific gene regulatory
landscapes, we will develop and implement innovative machine learning and statistical genomics methods to
predict functional noncoding, splicing, and coding SNPs (Aim 2). We will then validate these predictions using
massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and large-scale, scarless, single-base CRISPR editing of iPSCs
followed by cell type-specific differentiations (Aim 3). Taken together (Aim 4), this project will pinpoint the
functional SNPs and target cell types for dozens of AD-related risk loci and provide an unprecedented picture
of the gene regulatory landscape of AD. This work will be performed as a joint collaboration between Stanford
University and the Gladstone Institutes at UCSF. Our team, with many long-standing collaborations, has
extensive experience in consortium science with long-term involvement in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements,
The Cancer Genome Atlas, and The Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. The proposed project is thus well-
positioned to integrate into the highly collaborative ADSP Functional Genomics Consortium."

 The Markey Cancer Center’s (MCC) Translational Oncology (TO) Research Program is scientifically
focused on identifying novel targets, discovering new anticancer agents and devices, and leading catchment-
relevant clinical trials to decrease cancer burden in Kentucky and the nation. The overarching theme of the TO
Program is to use precision medicine to enhance patient outcomes through three Specific Aims: 1) Identify and
validate mechanistic targets of cancer, 2) Discover, re-design and develop new anticancer agents and devices,
and 3) Develop and lead biomarker directed, catchment-relevant clinical trials. Currently, 33 ongoing
translational studies are evaluating molecular targets and mediators of cancer. Since 2018, 38 new drugs,
novel combinations and repurposed anticancer agents and devices have been developed, with a focus on
identified mutations and phenotypes as informed by COE catchment area data. TO is a cross-disciplinary
program with 67 investigators from four colleges and 16 departments producing research awards of
approximately $10M in annual direct costs, a 68% increase from 2017, including $1.8M from the NCI and
$3.4M from other NIH agencies. Members have published 613 manuscripts (2018 to 2022), of which 148
(24%) are inter-programmatic, 169 (28%) are intra-programmatic, 344 (56%) are inter-institutional, and 13% of
which have an impact factor >10. TO members lead 26 new therapeutic interventional investigator-initiated

 B. Mark Evers, MD, (TO) Director of the Markey Cancer Center (MCC), is assisted by eight Senior Leaders
who support activities in cancer research, outreach, education and training, diversity and inclusion, clinical care
and administration. With the exception of some notable additions during this reporting period that have
expanded the effectiveness and expertise of the Senior Leadership team, this highly experienced group of
leaders has worked together since 2009, overseeing MCC’s initial NCI designation in 2013, a successful
renewal application in 2018, the preparations for this renewal and quest for Comprehensive Cancer Center
status, as well as a future five-year outlook in the form of MCC’s FY24-28 Strategic Plan. MCC’s Senior
Leaders leverage all available resources at the University of Kentucky, state and national levels to further their
cohesive plan to fulfill MCC’s mission to reduce the cancer burden with a focus on Kentucky and its most
vulnerable populations through research, prevention, treatment, education and community engagement. To
that end, MCC’s Leadership, Planning and Evaluation efforts are centered around the following Specific Aims:
1) Implement and execute MCC’s FY24-28 Strategic Plan and lead MCC based on the opportunities and
needs of the statewide catchment area and in tandem with institutional and NCI priorities; 2) Lead the ongoing
planning and evaluation of the center, coordinating and responding to internal and external reviews; and 3)
Ensure the appropriate resources and infrastructure to foster success across all areas of MCC’s Strategic
Plan, including the success of MCC’s Research Programs, Shared Resources, clinical and translational

10920427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) facilitates all clinical
cancer research at the University of Kentucky. CPDM’s Specific Aims are: 1) To provide comprehensive,
centralized support for MCC clinical research activities; 2) To ensure the safety, compliance, and quality of all
clinical cancer research performed at the center and MCC’s Research Network (MCCRN), in accordance with
the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan and NCI requirements; 3) To integrate all efforts of the Cancer Center to
provide clinical trial access to MCC’s patients, including women, minorities, underserved populations, and
individuals across the lifespan; and 4) To provide ongoing education and training services for CPDM and
MCCRN staff and faculty that enhance quality, diversity, consistency, and efficiency of teams and lead to
increased engagement with MCC’s catchment population. The CPDM facilitates clinical research through the
Clinical Research Office’s four units (72 FTEs), Protocol Development Teams (10 FTE), a Quality Assurance
Program (5 FTE) and MCCRN (11 FTE), which provide centralized expertise for development, coordination,
and execution of trials. In 2022, the Clinical Research Office managed 369 active trials—211 cooperative
group, 113 industry sponsored, and 45 investigator-initiated (12 investigational new drug-enabling). MCC’s
statewide infrastructure supports research referral and accrual within the catchment area. As the CPDM has
matured, the center increased clinical research engagement to 98 of Kentucky’s 120 counties, with 18,753 total
accruals (8,857 interventional; 9,896 non-interventional, 2018-2022). The Quality Assurance Program and
Audit Committee function independently from other CPDM components to support education, safety and
quality of trial conduct. All cancer trials are guided by MCC’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, which provides
oversight in accordance with NCI CCSG requirements. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ensures
patient safety and protocol compliance by staff and investigators. MCC leaders, investigators and staff promote
the inclusion of women, minorities and Kentucky’s special population of Appalachia in clinical cancer research
with impactful engagement of females (77% of all interventional accrual, 2018-2022) and Appalachian
Kentuckians (61%). Enhanced efforts have increased minority trial participation to reflect this patient
population, focusing on important cancer disparities such as lung and prostate cancers. In support of NIH
policies, MCC strives for inclusion of individuals across the lifespan in clinical research. In 2021, 40% of
therapeutic trial accruals were adults 65 or older, surpassing national averages. Cancer care for children is
provided by one of two comprehensive pediatric oncology programs in the state. MCC is the first center in the
region to offer germline testing to all pediatric oncology patients, supported by the Molecular Tumor Board
interpretation of results."
10920430,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The University of Kentucky (UK) Markey Cancer Center (MCC) embraces the entire Commonwealth of
Kentucky as its catchment area. Despite notable recent advances, Kentucky has the highest all-site cancer
incidence and mortality in the U.S., driven largely by socioeconomic, geographic and racial/ethnic inequities.
With a 47-year history, the goal of MCC Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is to engage
communities, practitioners and researchers in mutually beneficial collaborations to accelerate health equity and
reduce the burden of cancer. MCC’s long-standing COE programs include regionally-based community
outreach, management of the state’s cancer coalition and policy efforts, and the MCC Affiliate Network
(MCCAN), MCC’s innovative clinical outreach program with 19 community-based (non-UK) hospitals across
the state. Since 2018, MCC made strategic investments to enhance COE strengths and further integrate
research and cancer control. COE’s previous needs assessment shaped the FY19-23 MCC Research
Priorities. Key accomplishments include conducting the 2021 Kentucky Cancer Needs Assessment (KY CNA),
launching new research engagement initiatives (e.g., Community Impact Ambassadors as Research Program
liaisons, Research Advocacy Program, Clinical Trial Referral Ambassadors, internal COE funding) and cancer
control activities with extensive reach (e.g., training/technical assistance, policy changes, individual education,
facilitating access to services). Building on existing efforts and FY24-28 MCC Research Priorities, COE
Specific Aims are to: 1) Monitor cancer burden and disparities in Kentucky and identify community-driven
priorities. In addition to monitoring cancer burden and disparities and conducting the next KY CNA in 2026,
each year COE will carry out a focused needs assessment on a specific population to address data gaps and
disparities identified in the 2021 KY CNA. 2) Foster impactful research that responds to community needs and
promotes equity. COE will expand the Research Advocacy Program with a training module for basic and
clinical researchers and “Rapid Feedback Sessions.” COE will add two new strategies to facilitate clinical trial
participation: providing culturally appropriate patient and community education, including testimonial videos,
and assisting studies prioritized for underrepresented minority accruals through consultations and diverse
research advocate feedback. 3) Disseminate and implement sustainable evidence-based guidelines, practices
and policies. COE is currently using the 2021 KY CNA to guide development of the state’s new five-year
Cancer Action Plan. Next COE will assess its portfolio of community cancer control programs to strategically
realign them with the new state plan to address gaps, leverage partnership opportunities and maximize impact.
IMPACT: COE has made important advances in synergizing MCC research and cancer control efforts with
statewide partners and significant contributions to population-level improvements in colon and lung cancer
screening and outcomes, smoking and HPV vaccination. COE is poised to further accelerate MCC impact."
10920436,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In accordance with CCSG guidelines, the Markey Cancer Center (MCC) has established appropriate
mechanisms for ensuring rigorous scientific oversight of cancer clinical trials through the Protocol Review and
Monitoring System (PRMS). Protocols undergo initial scientific review by Clinical Care and Research Teams
(CCARTs), including assessment of relevance to the patient population, fit within the portfolio and interest of
investigators. In 2019, the MCC formalized first-stage review by CCARTs, expanding structure and function,
and enhancing communication with the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC). Following
CCART approval, review for operational feasibility is completed by the Feasibility Review Committee. The goal
of these reviews is to ensure that only the highest quality trials are submitted to the PRMC. The MCC PRMC is
responsible for independent peer-review of scientific merit, feasibility and prioritization of new protocols.
Following activation, PRMC monitors protocols for ongoing scientific progress and has ultimate authority to
suspend or close protocols that do not meet MCC scientific standards. The Specific Aims of the PRMS are: 1)
Optimize the PRMS structure and process for sufficient size and breadth of expertise to conduct a critical,
rigorous and fair scientific review of all institutional cancer-related research protocols involving human subjects;
2) Ensure that clinical trials conducted at MCC support and enable the scientific mission of the center, are
relevant to patients in the catchment area, including those from underserved groups, and enhance the
inclusion of diverse populations; 3) Safeguard the scientific integrity, feasibility and prioritization of all cancer-
related interventional clinical research of the MCC and apply rigorous scientific review criteria in a consistent
and objective manner; 4) Oversee the progress and performance of all interventional cancer clinical trials to
ensure their continued scientific merit and accomplishment of the scientific goals of the protocol and the MCC.
Highlights during the funding period include incorporation of first-stage reviews into PRMS framework,
enhanced member education, expanded representation in key scientific areas and strengthened quorum
expectations. From 2019 to 2021, the CCARTs reviewed 409 clinical trials for potential opening, approved 294
(72%) and declined 115 (28%); the Feasibility Review Committee declined 20 (4%) due to lack of feasibility.
From 2019 to 2021, the PRMC reviewed and/or prioritized 239 new protocols, of which 230 were approved and
9 were disapproved. In the past three years, the PRMC reviewed 552 active protocols for scientific progress,
closing 29 protocols due to low accrual or a change in scientific merit. The PRMC continuously assesses its
own performance. In 2021, median time from PRMC submission to approval was 8 days overall (7 national, 8
industry, 24 institutional). As the MCC has matured, the PRMS has continued to optimize the first- and second-
stage review and to increase scientific rigor, objectivity and scrutiny of each trial’s relevance to our diverse
population in order to ensure MCC brings the highest quality clinical research to Kentuckians."

leadership, significant investment and support from MCC and the University of Kentucky, utilization of unique
processes to facilitate effective delivery and coordination of services, and governance by evaluation and
oversight from advisory committees and the MCC Director’s Council. The aims of SRF Management are to: 1)
Promote state-of-the-art technology, methodologic and content expertise to foster MCC scientific strategies
across three Research Programs; 2) Conduct rigorous monitoring and evaluation processes and support
financial health for stability of SRF infrastructure, and 3) Facilitate robust and stable access to MCC shared
resources through innovative initiatives. The SRFs received improved ratings from NCI’s 2018 site visit and
have exhibited continued growth in breadth of services, depth of skills and service provision aligned with the
research direction of MCC’s programs. In addition, SRF management was guided by a culture of integrated
and collaborative relationships with MCC researchers with formalized processes for hand-offs among SRFs
facilitating enhanced support and the bi-directional continuum of MCC research from basic science to clinic
and into the community. MCC is supported by seven established SRFs: Biospecimen Procurement and
Translational Pathology (BPTP), Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (BB), Cancer Research Informatics (CRI),
Flow Cytometry and Immune Monitoring (FCIM), Redox Metabolism (RM), with Oncogenomics (OG) and
Patient-Oriented and Population Sciences (POP) as new fully operational facilities in this application resulting

approval. SRFs are led by Dr. Heidi Weiss (TO), Associate Director for Shared Resources; she is assisted by
Dr. Thèrése Bocklage (MCO) Assistant Director for Shared Resources, the SRF Management Office and MCC
Administration. MCC has invested $8.3M in SRF enhancements since 2018. SRF usage is robust, evident by
high numbers of users; SRFs also appropriately prioritize their services, evident by the percent of users from
2018-2022 who are MCC members: BB (156 users, 79%), BPTP (150 users, 61%), CRI (161 users, 65%),
FCIM (87 users, 61%), OG (61 users, 69%), POP (34 users, 71%), and RM (72 users, 68%). MCC Research
Program members heavily utilize SRFs as follows: 84% of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, 85% of
Translational Oncology and 82% of Cancer Prevention and Control. The total number of MCC members using
all SRFs remains consistently high (151 and 171 over MCC’s first two CCSG cycles, respectively). Fiscal
management and business planning from MCC Administration ensure SRF income mechanisms and financial
processes are robust and appropriate. These management strategies and consequent value-added metrics
demonstrate the critical role of SRFs and their direct contributions to MCC’s mission."
10931388,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Glioblastoma (GBM), arguably the deadliest of all cancers, has remained impervious to treatments, including
immunotherapies that have seen evidence of success in other cancers. The profound immunosuppressive
microenvironment in GBM thwarts immune activating stimuli like immune checkpoint blockade and significantly
limits activated T cell tumor infiltration. In fact, GBM has been described as an immune-desert. As part of this
Program Project, we plan to analyze the immune infiltration in clinical specimens from human GBMs injected
with a novel oncolytic virus (NCT03152318, clinicaltrial.gov). Oncolytic viruses (OV) are a form of
immunotherapy being investigated clinically against multiple cancers with one oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus
(oHSV) approved in the USA against melanoma and a different oHSV approved against GBM in Japan. In the
previous funding period, we started and finished a phase 1 clinical trial of the novel oHSV, rQNestin34.5v.2, that
accrued 50 human subjects with recurrent high-grade gliomas. Preliminary data from tumors after in situ
administration of this oHSV shows increased TILs. In addition, we show that elevated T cell and/or B cell receptor
(TCR/BCR) transcripts are associated with improved subject survival. Volumetric analyses of MRIs from subjects
also show that growth rate changes correlate with increased response in treated patients. These published and
preliminary data thus provide a conceptual framework justifying in situ administration of OVs to revert the
immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM into one whose cellular and molecular components become
immuno-activating. Based on the above, we hypothesize that in situ oHSV administration profoundly
changes the human GBM microenvironment into one that is more favorable for immunotherapy. We plan
to utilize clinical GBM specimens obtained from the current clinical trial to validate the hypothesis, via the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Validate the immune-activating changes in the human GBM
microenvironment perturbed by oHSV in situ administration; Aim 2. Investigate subjects’ plasma
proteome, serum cytokine/chemokine and MRI volumetrics as potential biomarkers of oHSV response
and correlate with TCR/BCR transcript abundance; and Aim 3. Utilize human GBM patient derived cells
and xenografts obtained from current clinical trial patients to characterize HLA-immunopeptidomes after
oHSV infection. These aims, if successful, will support the development of oHSV-elicited tumor antigens to
boost the immune response to oHSV infection and thereby improve patient outcomes. In addition, we will work
with Project 4 to develop the studies needed to bring the novel oHSVs to future clinical trials and with Project 1
to add our discovered oHSV-tumor antigens to the preclinical therapeutic models with armed oHSV. With Project
3, we will measure immunosuppressive metabolites in biopsy specimens."

10932222,"Clinical Protocol and Data Management: Summary/Abstract
The goal of HDFCCC Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is to support and facilitate clinical trial
conduct in the HDFCCC across the entire life cycle of a clinical trial, including protocol development, activation,
accrual and conduct, monitoring, closure, and reporting. Clinical protocol development and data management
functions in the HDFCCC are provided by the Clinical Research Support Office (CRSO), which provides the
infrastructure to support the efficient development, implementation, conduct, and reporting of clinical research
studies, including the management of clinical research personnel across the HDFCCC. The CRSO also
integrates and coordinates clinical cancer research activities with campus-wide entities affecting clinical trial
conduct, such as the UCSF IRB and the campus-wide UCSF Office of Research. Data and safety monitoring
(DSM) functions, as detailed in the NCI-approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of the HDFCCC,
are carried out by the DSM staff and overseen by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). In
addition to conducting data and safety review, DSM activities include the development, maintenance, and
management of clinical research training for investigators and clinical research training for clinical research
personnel, undertaken in collaboration with the CRSO. CPDM also facilitates the HDFCCC’s commitment to
accrue diverse populations of patients on clinical studies, including women, minorities, and individuals across
the lifespan. The HDFCCC strives to ensure that the diverse population of its catchment area has equitable
access to, representation in, and benefit of clinical research. HDFCCC analyzes demographic data relating to
race/ethnicity, gender, and age, to identify areas to improve inclusion of minorities, women, and individuals
across the lifespan in clinical research. Specifically, the CPDM (1) aggregates data regarding catchment area,
HDFCCC, and clinical trial enrollment demographics, at a disease-specific level; (2) analyzes these data to
understand potential reasons for disparities that are encountered; (3) based on these data, works with
investigators, site committees, and Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) to develop focused action
plans; and (4) defines and analyzes metrics of success to evaluate progress in addressing these disparities."

Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem with U.S. annual incidence of over 2
million. We propose to use an innovative paradigm in bicompartment diffusion MRI model parameter
estimation to study the dynamic longitudinal microstructural changes that occur after MTBI and to investigate
the link between white matter injury, cortical volume loss and cognitive outcome. Our preliminary findings
suggest diffusion-based biophysical parameters of axon integrity including intra-axonal diffusivity (Da) and
axonal water fraction (f) can detect microstructure changes in MTBI and provide more biophysically relevant
information compared with traditional, empirical measures of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). We will employ a
rotationally invariant formalism and parameter estimation scheme for the so-called “Standard Model” of
diffusion in white matter which unifies previous attempts of multi-compartment white matter modeling over the
past decade, now a widely accepted benchmark for multi-compartment modeling of diffusion in the brain. We
will further incorporate spherical tensor encoding (STE) and spherical kurtosis (SK) to increase the precision in
axon-specific microstructure parameters central to this project and use an optimized and clinically feasible
protocol for this translational project. The proposed work is expected to bridge the gap between macroscopic
and microstructural alterations relevant to cognitive status after injury, revealing the dynamic structural
changes occurring after injury and pointing to imaging biomarkers most relevant to cognitive outcome. By
concentrating on cognitive outcome, we will address one of the main barriers to predicting outcome in MTBI
which is heterogeneity of clinical status. The results of this work are expected to be significant from both
scientific and clinical perspectives by 1) advancing basic knowledge of injury in an impactful way, 2)
discovering biophysically meaningful imaging biomarkers relevant to cognitive status in MTBI, and 3)
mechanistically linking microstructural and macrostructural brain alterations, in three respective specific aims.
This will provide a means toward quantitative tracking of injury and recovery specific to the cognitive domain,
and tracking of efficacy of targeted cognitive therapeutic strategies such as cognitive rehabilitation and
integrated behavioral health treatment in patients with MTBI."

Three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMP1-3) in humans heterodimerize with the class B G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) calcitonin receptor (CTR) and calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and modulate their
responses to calcitonin (CT), amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and two adrenomedullin (AM)
peptide hormones. These have functions in bone remodeling (CT), regulation of food intake and blood glucose
(amylin), and regulation of blood and lymphatic vasculature function (CGRP and AM) by activating one or more
of seven receptors arising from CTR, CLR, and the RAMPs (6 heterodimers + CTR alone). The receptors are
drug targets for osteoporosis (CTR), diabetes and obesity (amylin receptors), migraine headache (CGRP
receptor), and cardiovascular and lymphatic system disorders (AM receptors). How RAMPs modulate CTR and
CLR ligand binding and signaling is incompletely understood. This limits our understanding of the molecular
basis for the diverse peptide actions in vivo and hinders drug development. Notably, there is growing evidence
that RAMPs interact with numerous GPCRs so understanding this model system will have broad impact. In
prior funding cycles we used biochemistry, pharmacology, and X-ray crystallography to reveal how CT, CGRP,
and the AM peptides bind their receptor extracellular domains (ECDs) and how the RAMP1/2 ECDs alter CLR
ECD peptide selectivity. Guided by these results we developed ultra high affinity CGRP and AM variants
including picomolar affinity antagonists and sustained signaling agonists that exhibit persistent cAMP signaling.
Herein we continue to define the mechanisms of RAMP modulation of CTR and CLR ligand binding and
signaling and further characterize our novel peptide variants, which may have therapeutic potential. In Aim 1
we define the kinetics of peptide binding at CGRP and AM receptors (CLR:RAMPs) and its relation to cAMP
signaling kinetics using biochemical and pharmacological assays (SPR and BRET kinetic methods). In Aim 2
we continue to define the structural bases for RAMP modulation of peptide binding to the CLR and CTR ECDs
using advanced molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray crystallography. In Aim 3 we employ a novel
biochemical assay to define how RAMPs modulate agonist and G protein coupling to CTR to enable amylin
signaling. Completion of this project will yield the following outcomes: 1) an understanding of how peptide
binding kinetics affects cAMP signaling kinetics for CGRP and AM receptors and the molecular basis for
sustained signaling of ultra high affinity variants, 2) a near complete high-resolution structural understanding of
calcitonin family peptide binding to their receptor ECDs including pathways of CGRP and AM peptide binding
and unbinding, and 3) clarification of longstanding amylin receptor pharmacology ambiguities and delineation
of how RAMPs modulate CTR. This project will advance our understanding of accessory membrane protein
modulation of GPCRs and aid the development of therapeutics targeting CTR/CLR:RAMP complexes."
10896251,"Project Summary/Abstract
The lens pathologies presbyopia and cataract are the leading causes of age related refractive error and vision
loss in the world today. The transparency and refractive properties of the lens are determined by its geometry
(shape and volume) and its inherent gradient of refractive index (water to protein ratio), which are in turn
maintained by the cellular physiology provided by the internal microcirculation system. This system utilizes
spatial differences in ion channels, transporters and gap junctions to establish standing electrochemical and
hydrostatic pressure gradients to drive the transport of ions, water and nutrients through the avascular lens. It
is our hypothesis that the process of aging has negative effects on lens transport, degrading ion and water
homeostasis, and producing changes in lens water content. This age-dependent decline in water transport
alters the optical properties of the lens, causing changes in optical quality and accommodative amplitude that
initially result in presbyopia in middle age and ultimately manifest as cataract that requires surgical correction
in the elderly. To test this hypothesis, we propose to identify additional components regulating water transport
activity in the intact mouse lens ex vivo. We will use impedance and intracellular hydrostatic pressure
measurements to monitor intracellular water transport in mice with pharmacological blockade or targeted
deletions of transport proteins. We will then use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to spatially map the effect
changing mouse lens water transport has on total free water content, the water to protein ratio (refractive
index) and lens surface geometry. To investigate whether changes in lens water content are associated with
the onset and progression of human cataract, our recently developed in vivo MRI-based optical modelling
platform will be applied to patients who are scheduled to undergo vitrectomy and age matched control
subjects. Studying vitrectomy patients will allow changes in water transport preceding cataract formation to be
followed longitudinally in an accelerated time frame compared to normally ageing humans. To study the
relationship between lens geometry and water distribution during accommodation in the human lens in vivo, we
will use our MRI imaging protocols to monitor key parameters of lens transport non-invasively in volunteer
human subjects during accommodation. These proposed studies will use transgenic mouse models to gain
mechanistic insights into how lens water transport contributes to maintenance of the optical properties of the
lens, which will then be translated into human studies to assess how water transport contributes to the
development of presbyopia and the onset of nuclear cataract. Insights from these studies could potentially lead
to novel therapeutic interventions to alleviate the burden of the age-related lens pathologies."

Research Project. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICi) have, thus far, been ineffective in the treatment of
glioma, largely due to the immunologically “cold” microenvironment and the low number of neoantigens. Our
group recently discovered that IDH1/2 mutations, which are common in gliomas, induce homologous
recombination (HR) defects and confer sensitivity to DNA damage response inhibitors (DDRi), such as poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase
inhibitors. Emerging evidence shows that inherited or acquired DDR defects increase tumor immunogenicity
through DNA damage-induced activation of immune recognition pathways. Therefore, the central hypothesize
of my proposal is that mutant IDH1/2-induced DNA repair defects can be exploited with PARP and ATR kinase
inhibition to induce host and cancer cell-intrinsic immune activation and improve ICi response in otherwise
poorly immunogenic gliomas. In Aim 1, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to test the
potential efficacy of combined PARP and ATR inhibition against IDH1/2-mutant glioma and explore DNA repair
mechanisms contributing to this synthetic lethality. In Aim 2, we will probe the immune-mediated mechanisms
of DDRi synthetic lethality and define the tumor-intrinsic and host-dependent immunomodulatory effects of
combined PARP and ATR inhibition. In Aim 3, we will determine whether PARP and ATR inhibition, alone or in
combination, improves the response to anti-PD-1 in vivo."

 For the nearly 95,000 people currently waiting for a kidney transplant, their geographic residence has a
major impact on whether they will get a transplant. Organ allocation is based on geographic boundaries of
donor service areas (DSA) that are artificial. There are 58 DSA in the US, and they vary tremendously in size
and population, which explains some of the variation in access to transplantation. The geographic boundaries
of DSAs were never designed to optimize organ allocation, and do not account for population, prevalence of
kidney disease, or organ donation rates. These geographic boundaries might also contribute to another
important problem – unnecessary discard of donated kidneys. Nearly 20% of all kidneys donated in the US are
discarded. Improving access to transplant and reducing kidney discard are national priorities under the
“Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative.” A new kidney allocation policy that does not use any fixed
geographic boundaries is scheduled for implementation in December 2020. However, the new organ allocation
policy may have unintended effects on organ outcomes and worsen disparities in access to transplant.
 This grant will examine three eras of kidney allocation that reveal how the use of geographic
boundaries has affected transplant benefits and equity for patients with end-stage kidney disease: 1) Historical
Allocation Era: Transplants performed before 12/4/2014, when kidneys procured within a DSA were allocated
primarily to recipients within the same DSA; 2) Kidney Allocation System Era (split into two sub eras): Kidneys
considered “lower quality” were shared over a wider region until 9/5/2019, and this policy was subsequently
reversed due to high kidney discard rates; 3) Concentric Circle Era: This system is scheduled for
implementation on 12/15/2020 and eliminates DSA boundaries, and uses a 250-nautical mile radius around
donor hospital to allocate kidneys. The overall objective of this scientific proposal is to determine the effects of
wider geographic sharing of deceased donor kidneys on the specific outcomes of kidney discard, disparities in
access to transplant, and recipient outcomes. My central hypothesis is that systems with wider sharing of
deceased donor kidneys might reduce geographic inequities for patients living in areas with high wait-times,
but it will worsen organ discard and fail to improve kidney allograft survival. These novel insights into the
relationship between geography and kidney allocation could ultimately drive major public health gains for
patients with kidney disease by showing how kidneys can be allocated to improve fairness and increase the
number of transplants.
 The applicant has an appointment on the junior faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. With the

Pennsylvania, his goal is to foster a career of enduring research as an R01 funded independent physician

10907586,"Abstract
 The lung alveolar epithelium is exposed to the environment and pathogens and is thus highly susceptible to
injury. Repair of the alveolar epithelium requires the activation of alveolar epithelial stem cells by signals from
their surrounding niche. Significantly, the role of lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs) in mediating this
repair is poorly understood. In this proposal we address this gap in knowledge by focusing on a novel mechanism
of bioactive lipid mediated interaction between lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVEC) and alveoli
epithelial cells (AEC) in the reparative niche. LMVECs account for >40% of total lung cells. They are juxtaposed
to AECs (both alveolar type I cells (AT1) and type II cells (AT2)) and play essential roles in regulating their repair,
although the underlining mechanisms remain unclear. AT1s have a thin and extended squamous shape, occupy
> 95% of the alveoli surface area and mediate O2–CO2 exchange. AT2 occupy only 5% of the surface area, but
play multiples roles, including producing surfactant and, importantly, acting as adult tissue stem cells to repair
injured alveoli. Studies, including ours, have shown that while AT2s are normally quiescent, they can respond
to signals released by surrounding niches and initiate a repair program by differentiating into AT1. However, the
signals that regulate AT2 stem cell function(s) remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that AT1 also exhibit a
certain degree of plasticity, but it is almost completely unknown whether and how AT1s participate in lung repair
after injury. In preliminary studies, we generated a mouse model with endothelial cell (EC)-specific deletion of
sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), the enzyme responsible for spinhgosine-1-phosphate (S1P) production. These
mutant mice manifest a significantly defective repair of AECs in the standardized Pseudomonas aeruginosa
bacterial lung injury model. We further showed that S1P functions through its receptor S1PR2 expressed in AT2,
leading to nuclear translocation of the transcriptional regulator Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), which mediates
the differentiation of AT2 to AT1 and repair of injured alveoli. Furthermore, we observed that in response to S1P,
AT1s undergo substantive alteration which likely contribute to the repair process. These fundamental
observations led to our central hypothesis: that LMVECs constitute a niche that, when activated by alveolar
injury, releases the bioactive lipid factor, S1P, which acts via S1PRs on both AT2 and AT1 to promote their
reparative capacity required for the restoration of alveolar epithelium. To test this hypothesis, we propose three
specific aims: Aim 1: To determine S1P-mediated interactions between the EC niche and AEC required for lung
repair. Aim2: To define the functional significance of S1P-S1PR2-YAP signaling axis in regulating AT2 to AT1
transition and mediating alveolar repair. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that S1P induces AT1 alteration leading
to alveolar repair. This research program will throw new light on the fundamental mechanisms driving lung repair
after injury, with the long term potential for innovative therapeutic approaches."

 A promising strategy to improve neuromodulation therapies (e.g. deep brain stimulation) in Parkinson’s
Disease (PD) is to develop stimulation paradigms that target specific neural signals. Most previous work has
aimed to identify and reduce pathologic signals. An unexplored alternative approach is to identify and enhance
neural signals that promote movement. Several scenarios known to improve movement in PD patients are the
presence of visual movement targets, rhythmic auditory stimuli, and motivational incentives. The goal of this
proposal is to capitalize on these scenarios to identify biomarkers of movement facilitation that may serve as
targets for future neuromodulation therapies. This approach has potential to provide novel therapies for
symptoms refractory to current treatments, such as freezing of gait. Previous work examining neural
mechanisms of movement facilitation in PD have yielded inconsistent results. This may be due to a failure to
account for well-known heterogeneity in behavioral benefits across PD patients and the assumption that
different cueing phenomena exert motor benefits through a single neural mechanism. The studies proposed
here test the overarching hypothesis that 3 different types of cues (visual targets, rhythmic auditory stimuli and
reward incentives) facilitate movement through distinct neuroanatomic circuits and electrophysiological
mechanisms, by leveraging known variability in behavioral cueing benefits across patients. Aim 1 is to
demonstrate behavioral dissociations between the 3 forms of movement facilitation within patients and relate
variability in cueing benefits to integrity of dissociable neuroanatomic circuits as measured by resting state and
diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Aim 2 is to characterize the electrophysiological correlates
of behavioral benefits for the different cue types using electroencephalography (EEG) and intraoperative
electrophysiological recordings obtained during implantation of deep brain stimulator in the globus pallidus
internus. This work will augment my prior skills in task fMRI, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
electrophysiology by extending training in multiple modalities (high density EEG, resting state fMRI, DTI); build
my analytic skills in advanced multivariate statistics; and advance my expertise in PD motor physiology. My
mentorship team comprises experts in PD neurophysiology and neuromodulation therapies, and non-invasive
studies of inter-individual differences in motor neurophysiology. Coursework in multivariate statistics and
seminars in advanced EEG and neuroimaging applications will further my development. The environment at
UCLA has a rich interdisciplinary neuroimaging community, state-of-the-art image acquisition facilities including
Ahmanson-Lovelace Brian Mapping Center and Staglin Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and a renowned
clinical Movement Disorders Division. The career development plan forges a path to become an independent
physician-scientist, using multiple modalities to characterize neurophysiologic biomarkers of heterogeneous
disease features in Parkinson’s disease to improve therapy development and delivery."
10891517,"The recent success and expanded use of the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies in clinical oncology
has resulted in an increased incidence of a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), some of
which can have a lasting impact on the lives of our patients. The continued development of adjuvant
immunotherapy protocols and more potent immunotherapy combinations such as the
ipilimumab/nivolumab regimen is expected to increase the incidence and societal impact of these irAEs.
Despite their growing prevalence, the underlying pathogenesis of individual irAEs is poorly understood
and our therapeutic management of these conditions remains crude.
 Using a genetically engineered model of melanoma, we have found that anti-PD-1 antibody (ab)
immunotherapy routinely leads to neutrophilic infiltration of the lung parenchyma and colon lamina
propria, closely resembling the pathology noted in human checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonitis
and colitis, respectively. This work further revealed that anti-PD-1 ab treatment of non-tumor-bearing
mice eliminates the development of these irAEs, suggesting the presence of a tumor-intrinsic pro-
inflammatory mechanism. As part of this work, we have recently identified a tumor-intrinsic PD-
L1:NLRP3:HSP70 signaling axis that drives the accumulation of neutrophils in distant organs including
the lungs and colon in response to PD-1 blockade. Additional studies have shown that genetic knock-
out of tumor HSP70 expression and the pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome
suppresses the accumulation of neutrophils in these distant tissues. Based on these findings, we now
hypothesize that the tumor NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the development of checkpoint inhibitor-
associated colitis and pneumonitis and that NLRP3 represents a promising pharmacological target for
suppressing the development of these irAEs. To address this hypothesis, we have generated a
transgenic melanoma tissue-specific NLRP3-/- model to examine the role of tumor-intrinsic NLRP3 in
the development of checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis and pneumonitis. Additional studies will address
a potential role for this tumor NLRP3 pathway in Th17 differentiation in these distant organ tissues and
whether a small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 would be a superior option over steroids for the
management of colitis and pneumonitis in an autochthonous melanoma model undergoing anti-PD-1
ab immunotherapy. We will further utilize tumor tissue and DNA collected from patients undergoing
checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy on an active IRB-approved clinical study to determine if genetic
variations of NLRP3 may contribute to the development of these irAEs. Overall, this work will provide
unique mechanistic insight into the development of irAEs and identify rational therapeutic strategies
and predictive biomarkers for improving the management of patients undergoing immunotherapy."
10892937,"Single cell genomics technologies have allowed researchers to study differences between single cells. In order
to understand how every cell functions in the whole living organism, cells need to be studied in the context of
both time and space. Researchers would like to learn a comprehensive picture of each single cell, including its
current cell state and predicted future state, and how it interacts with neighboring cells during the temporal
dynamics. So the step after gaining a certain amount of knowledge of single cells is to go from “parts” to
“whole”. This proposal discusses advances that can be brought to the study of both temporal dynamics
and spatial interactions between cells. The theme of this proposal is “integration”.
Existing integrative methods for single cell data focus on two scenarios: 1) integrate the same type of data (eg.
RNA-Seq data) from multiple batches; 2) integrate multiple types of data performed on the same cells, which is
also called multi-modality data or multi-omics data. This proposal highlights concepts and methods to
integrate multi-omics data to understand cell temporal dynamics and regulatory mechanisms, while
taking into account dependency between data modalities, which is rare in current methods. A new
concept of “problem integration”, where related computational formulations can be connected to
provide a consistent and more general picture of a certain aspect of cells, is also presented here.
In order to study different aspects of a cell, different computational problems have been formulated, eg.,
clustering of cells, inference of cell trajectories, inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), etc. The idea of
unifying or connecting related computational problems, such that a unified framework can involve or
output the information that is previously used in multiple individual computational problems, is proposed. In
particular, a unified framework for cell temporal dynamics analysis involving related computational
tasks, is presented.
So far the multi-omics integration methods often deploy the integrated data to cluster cells for cell type
identification. Few methods on data integration are designed for temporal analysis with continuous populations,
or to learn biological mechanisms like GRNs. So another direction proposed here is to infer the trajectory of
cells with both gene-expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data; with the inferred
trajectory, the effect of chromatin accessibility on gene-expression can be studied, and GRNs can be
reconstructed while taking into account this effect.
In reality, a gene’s expression level is determined by multiple factors: its transcription factor (TF), its chromatin
accessibility and the signal a cell receives from other neighboring cells through cell-cell interaction. Therefore,
another important dimension to consider about the cells is the spatial location of cells. It is proposed to
ßreconstruct a generalized GRN which models inter-cell regulatory interactions."
10824247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowing how to act in response to cues in our environment is a critical behavior. Making optimal choices involves
engaging the necessary neural networks to seek rewards (e.g., food etc.), avoid negative outcomes (e.g., injury
etc.), and ignore irrelevant information. Aberrant network activity in response to cues leads to maladaptive
behavioral responses, something characteristic in many psychiatric disorders including PTSD, addiction, autism
spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. The brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) and brain-wide levels of
norepinephrine (NE), a majority of which originates from LC, are vital for engaging appropriate behaviors in
response to cues. Recent discoveries emphasize the unexplored complexity in the organization of LC and its
role in responding to cues that elicit behavior. Distinct ensembles of LC neurons encode different cognitive
processes and behaviors. Furthermore, discrete LC subcircuits are required to parse various LC functions. My
long-term goal is to dissociate the complex role of LC and NE in regulating adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.
The specific objective of this proposed research is to identify the functional LC neural ensembles and projection
targets necessary to appropriately respond to positive and negative reinforcement cues. To achieve this goal, I
will (1) characterize LC neural activity acquired from high density electrophysiology probes and (2) identify and
modulate LC projections with an activity dependent viral labelling strategy during an active avoidance and reward
seeking task. My central hypothesis is that opposing cue-outcome associations recruit separate LC neuron
ensembles and circuits necessary for appropriate behavioral responses, even when outcome-associated
behaviors are similar. In Aim 1 I will analyze large scale electrophysiology data obtained from high-density
Neuropixel probes to characterize LC neuronal activity during active avoidance and reward cue presentation. I
hypothesize that there will be separate and distinct ensembles of neurons that respond to cues prompting similar
actions to either receive a positive outcome vs avoid a negative outcome. In Aim 2 I will use calcium-dependent
genetic tagging, Cal-Light, to identify and inhibit discrete LC projections driven by behavior-evoking cues. I
hypothesize that LC ensembles for active avoidance and reward seeking cues preferentially target different brain
regions forming functional subcircuits. Furthermore, I will test my hypothesis that activity in these LC subcircuits
is necessary for appropriate behavior. The proposed research will identify LC ensembles and projections
underlying optimal behavior, highlight circuits that may contribute to maladaptive behavior, and inform circuit-
based treatment targets for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders."

 Increasing collection of intensive longitudinal data (ILD) through mobile health (mHealth)-based
approaches, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), present a rich source of information for
understanding temporal variations in psychological states key to smoking cessation. However, advances in
statistical methods are needed to fully leverage these rich data to assess interventions and inform the design
of future interventions. In Aims 1 and 2, this proposal seeks to develop a novel statistical model (joint
longitudinal recurrent-event model) and estimation method that will allow for analysis of EMA data from a
smoking cessation study using low-dimensional interpretable states to describe the behavioral phenomenon
and processes related to smoking cessation. By incorporating just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) into
the model in Aim 3, this project will facilitate assessment of the impact of time-varying adaptive interventions
on a subject’s risk of a future lapse in smoking cessation using data from the Mobile Assistance for Regulating
Smoking (MARS) micro-randomized trial (U01CA229437; PIs: Nahum-Shani, Wetter).
 Training goals, which were developed with the mentorship team, include: (i) advancing technical
training in statistical theory and computing, (ii) improving written and oral communication skills, (iii) building
collaborative relationships, and (iv) attending conferences, workshops, and professional development
activities. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the University of Michigan (UM) in the
Department of Biostatistics, which has close ties to the UM Institute for Social Research and a reputation for
excellence in research and training.
 Altogether, the statistical methodology proposed in this project will contribute to the science in two key
ways: (i) it will allow for the integration of many different items (e.g. emotions, urge, motivation) in a way that
facilitates interpretation when measuring vulnerability (e.g. risk of lapse) and (ii) its interpretability will
subsequently help inform the design of evidence-based adaptive interventions (e.g. JITAIs) through increased
understanding of the conditions that represent vulnerability. These scientific contributions directly promote the
National Institute on Drug Abuse’s strategic goal of developing “new and improved treatments to help people
with substance use disorders achieve and maintain a meaningful and sustained recovery”. Although presented
in the context of a smoking cessation study, this methodological framework is highly flexible with broad
applicability to mHealth studies of substance use disorders and in other health domains. This novel analytic
method will be freely available in a user-friendly R package, thus facilitating the potential impact on drug-use
research."

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) involves assessment of circulating cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA)
extracted from maternal plasma and the widespread clinical application of this technique to detect chromosomal
aneuploidies in pregnancy is now routine and the standard of care. While NIPS technology has advanced to
detect some targeted genomic abnormalities, current approaches are low-resolution and able to capture only a
small fraction of genetic conditions important to prenatal diagnosis. Our preliminary studies on 6 samples
suggest the feasibility of a high resolution non-invasive prenatal screen (hrNIPS), that can capture the vast
majority of pathogenic coding variation (SNV, indel, CNV). However, our results suggest that the ability to call
all types of variation can be improved through calibration of statistical models and development of new
techniques. Integration of phenotype data will allow interpretation and prioritization of identified pathogenic
variants.
Therefore, we will deploy hrNIPS on 100 samples with paired fetal exome sequencing data to develop and
calibrate methods over this large number of samples (Aim 1). We will call variation on these samples using the
improved methods and implement an infrastructure to capture systematic phenotypes in these samples using
the phenopackets schema (Aim 2). Further, we will use phenopackets and associated HPO terms to leverage
phenotype-aware algorithms to prioritize identified variants for further review. We will interpret all variation in a
clinical context using ACMG criteria and explore which types of variants might impact prenatal care (Aim 3).
Finally, we will investigate the potential added value of hrNIPS as a maternal carrier screen. In parallel with these
research aims, an exceptional team of seven mentors and advisors across disciplines, career stages, and
institutions will provide didactic training, hands-on research support, and regular opportunities for presentation.
Collectively, the ability to comprehensively assess coding variation in pregnancy with hrNIPS would allow early
and non-invasive pregnancy assessment for molecular diagnosis and has the potential to transform the standard
of care."

Individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder who identify as an ethnic minority are at greater risk of
experiencing mental health care disparities, attributed in part to a lack of fit between treatment approaches and
cultural preferences. Given the rapid growth of Latinxs in the U.S., estimated to account for 29% of the
population by 2050, attention to cross-cultural research with Latinxs is essential for equitable schizophrenia
treatment delivery to this underrepresented and underserved population. For instance, social cognition has
emerged as an important treatment target for functional recovery in schizophrenia, but scholars have called
attention to the predominately Western understanding of social cognition and point to concerns about the
cross-cultural validity of social-cognitive tasks used in clinical trials.
With a focus on social cognition, the current project proposes a research training plan that facilitates the
applicant’s development into an independent researcher addressing disparities in mental health outcomes for
Latinxs living with schizophrenia by (1) gaining expertise in psychometric analyses with a focus on cross-
cultural validation that ensures fair assessment during clinical trials, (2) implementing best practices for
research with Latinxs living with schizophrenia, and (3) conducting community-engaged research methodology
that allows for the involvement of service users in the development of culturally-appropriate interventions.
The complementary research plan aims to generate a better understanding of how the measurement and
construct of social cognition might differ between Latinx individuals living with schizophrenia and their white
peers. The specific aims are to (1) evaluate the psychometric properties of field-standard measures of social
cognition in a secondary data set of Latinxs with schizophrenia (n = 71); (2) to investigate the functional
significance of social-cognitive treatment targets in this same sample, as well as the potential influence of
acculturation; and (3) conduct and analyze culturally-focused cognitive interviews (n = 30) to identify potential
cultural bias within the measures. Previous research has shown that cognitive interviews are effective for
elucidating sociocultural factors that influence the item-response process and go beyond quantitative methods
by providing an opportunity to identify the source, rather than just the presence, of measurement disparities.
The implications for such information include the development of culturally-relevant psychosocial interventions
that target social-cognitive deficits in Latinxs living with schizophrenia, in line with NIMH’s Strategic Plan (Goal
4, Objective 4.3). Innovative service delivery models for the Latinx population living with schizophrenia can
assist with improved acceptability, access, and effectiveness of treatment."
10828324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The transport of proteins and lipids throughout the cell is crucial for cellular function and organelles, including
those of the endolysosomal system, require the correct lipid and protein composition to complete their roles. One
important aspect of vesicular trafficking is the asymmetric organization of lipid species across the exofacial and
cytofacial leaflets of the membrane. This membrane asymmetry has been shown to be critical for protein
trafficking, signal transduction and apoptosis. Membrane asymmetry is established by type-IV P-type ATPases
(P4-ATPase), which utilize ATP hydrolysis to transport lipid substrates from the luminal or extracellular leaflet to
the cytofacial leaflet of membranes. P4-ATPase deficiency disrupts vesicle-mediated protein transport from Golgi
and endosomal membranes and causes hyperacidification of endosomes and lysosomes. Our goal is to
understand the role of P4-ATPases in vesicle-mediated protein transport. For proper P4-ATPase function,
correct localization to appropriate membranes is essential. Of the five P4-ATPases in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Dnf1, Dnf2, Neo1 and Drs2 are known to localize to the plasma membrane (PM) and/or Golgi and
travel through the endocytic pathway as part of their trafficking itineraries. In this study, I seek to determine the
recycling and retrograde trafficking pathways traveled by P4-ATPases, and how these flippases interact with
components of those pathways. Key components of four major trafficking pathways between endosomes and
the Golgi including Drs2/Rcy1/COPI, Snx4, retromer and AP-1/Clathrin, were deleted to determine the routes
required for Dnf1/Dnf2 PM localization and Neo1/Drs2 Golgi localization. Deletion of retromer components
including Vps35, Vps5, Vps17, and Snx3 led to mislocalization of Dnf1, Dnf2, Neo1 and Drs2 to the vacuole.
These data suggest a primary role for retromer in proper localization of P4-ATPases although a minor role for
Rcy1 and Snx4 was detected. In addition, preliminary data suggest that there is a novel retromer recognition
motif within the C-terminal tail of Dnf1 and Dnf2. These results indicate that loss of retromer leads to a substantial
loss of P4-ATPases to the vacuole and should therefore cause major changes in membrane organization.
Deficiencies in the human orthologs of Dnf1/Dnf2 and retromer have been linked to endosomal dysfunction
leading to Parkinson's Disease. This study could help elucidate why mutations in these proteins cause the
disease."

Of all life experiences, salient ones are the likeliest to be remembered. The storage of experiences into long-
term memory is thought to depend on post-learning consolidation processes occurring during sleep. While
much is known on how spatial and sensory information is incorporated into memory, the mechanisms through
which salient aspects of experiences are linked to other components of a memory are still largely unknown. A
central neuronal population implicated in encoding salience is the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTADA)
neurons. VTADA neurons encode, and are necessary for the formation of, both positive and negative valence
associations, and are anatomically and functionally connected with brain regions implicated in memory
consolidation. Prior research and our preliminary data suggest that VTADA neuronal activity during sleep is
experience-dependent, yet whether the activation of VTADA neurons during sleep has a causal role in memory
consolidation, the specific components of waking experiences that affect VTADA neuronal activity during sleep
and the integration of VTADA neuronal activity with hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation processes
are largely unknown. We hypothesize that activity in VTADA neurons during sleep plays a critical role in linking
salient aspects of experiences to other aspects of a memory trace. We propose to elucidate the determinants,
contents and time-course of experience-dependent activity and reactivation events in VTADA neurons during
sleep (Aim 1) and causally interrogate the function of VTADA neuronal activity during sleep in processes of
memory consolidation (Aim 2). To achieve these aims, we have developed an innovative approach that
combines ensemble-level calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, optogenetic manipulations and
various learning tasks in freely behaving and sleeping mice. Our findings will provide fundamental new insight
regarding the integration of information encoded in multiple brain regions into coherent multifaceted memories
during sleep. Moreover, our research could promote the development of new therapeutic approaches for
various psychiatric disorders that are associated with a combination of dysregulated dopamine signaling and
impaired memory. The training plan we have developed, which draws on the skills and expertise of my various
sponsors, as well as the strengths of the research environment at the University of Michigan, will provide me
with comprehensive and rigorous training as I develop into an independent researcher."
10757929,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions
that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will
there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world
instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current
methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15
West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the
2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and
prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are
typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission
mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on
the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations,
particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching
scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical
covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to
confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to
forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches;
(2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making
in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory
to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop
accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics.
We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches
to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned
above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that
occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed
are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to
epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting
and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical
approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during
public health crises."
10910000,"Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a pro-inflammatory lipid mediator derived from arachidonic acid, exerts
its biological effects via thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TP-R). However, it is currently
unknown whether TP-R can modulate metabolic pathways. Although the adipocytes are mainly
involved in the storage of excess triglycerides, emerging evidence suggests that they have an
important role in amino acid (AA) metabolism, in particular branched chain AAs; of note, elevated
plasma levels of branched chain AAs is strongly associated with insulin resistance. However, the
role of adipose tissue (AT) in the metabolism of other essential AAs is still unclear. The preliminary
data provide evidence that mice lacking TP-R (TP-R-/- mice) grow lean when exposed to a high
caloric diet. Moreover, a striking increase in markers of histidine catabolism in the AT of TP-R-/-
mice was noted. Further, these mice showed a reduction in AT inflammation and improvement in
insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis on a high fat diet. Therefore, the overall hypothesis is
that TP-R plays an important role in mediating obesity-related inflammation and insulin
resistance via altered His and/or glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. Clinical,
biochemical, and molecular approaches will be employed to determine the potential of TP-R as a
therapeutic target in obesity-related insulin resistance and investigate the mechanisms by
which TP-R blockade improves insulin resistance, inflammation, and histidine and glucose
metabolism in AT. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct studies subcutaneous and visceral AT and
PBMCs collected from lean/overweight insulin sensitive and obese insulin resistant subjects.
We will compare TP-R expression in AT and PBMCs between lean/overweight insulin
sensitive and obese insulin resistant subjects and determine the potential of TP-R as a target
for therapy against obesity-linked insulin resistance in humans. In addition, detailed
mechanistic studies will be conducted in cultured AT explants, primary adipocytes and
human adipocyte cell-line to determine mechanisms by which TP-R promotes insulin
resistance. In Specific Aim 2, we will correlate visceral and subcutaneous AT TP-R
expression with markers of inflammation. In addition, we will determine mechanisms by
which TP-R promotes inflammatory response in AT explants, adipocyte cell-line, and PBMCs.
In Specific Aim 3, we will correlate visceral and subcutaneous AT TP-R with histidine
transporters in AT, in particular Slc15a4. Furthermore, we will perform studies in cultured
explants and cells to determine the role and mechanism of TP-R in modulating histidine and/or
glucose metabolism. The findings will be relevant to uncover the role of TP-R in metabolic
control and develop novel therapeutic strategies to manage hyperglycemia in obesity and type
2 diabetes."
10896155,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The TODAY and RISE studies revealed a rapid decline in β-cell function and its unresponsiveness to two of the
most commonly used treatments for T2D in pediatrics. This dire scenario is further aggravated by the rising
prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) affecting ~40% of obese youth in the US. Hence, there
is a pressing need for effective approaches to preserve β-cell function and reduce NAFLD in obese youth, in
order to prevent disease progression. To investigate the roles of insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and
NAFLD in the earliest stage of T2D: Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT), we formed 2 large multiethnic cohorts:
The Pathogenesis of Youth Onset Diabetes (PYOD) study (NCT01967849), and The Yale Pediatric
NAFLD/NASH Cohort (NCT01966627). In a series of studies using these cohorts, we found that beta-cell
function relative to insulin sensitivity gradually decreases in obese youth across rising 2-hr glucose levels and
degrees of Hepatic Steatosis. Importantly, in the current grant cycle, we identified in obese youth the key role
of a reduced incretin effect early in the pathophysiology of glucose dysregulation and NAFLD. Taken together,
these studies provide a strong scientific premise for using novel approaches to understand the
interconnectedness among beta-cell dysfunction, impaired incretin system, and NAFLD in the onset of
prediabetes. Our Primary Objective is: To determine the mechanisms by which Liraglutide, the first GLP-1
analogue, might restore glucose homeostasis by examining its effects on ß-cell and alfa cell function and hepatic
fat content in obese youth with IGT and NAFLD/NASH. The Specific Aims and Hypotheses (H) are Aim
1&H1: A: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial design (RCT), we
will test whether a 6-month (6-M) treatment with Liraglutide, (Victoza 1.8 mg) improves ß-cell function and
decreases glucagon levels, compared to placebo, and B: whether the functional improvements in ß-cell function
following 6-M of active treatment can be sustained 3-M after the withdrawal of therapy in obese youth with IGT
and NAFLD/NASH. Aim 2&H2: A: To test whether a 6-M treatment with Liraglutide decreases MRI-PDFF
measured hepatic steatosis compared to placebo, via changes in de Novo Lipogenesis (DNL), and B: whether
the effects persist after a 3-M washout period. C: To explore the efficacy of Liraglutide in reducing hepatic fibrosis
measured by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) after 6-M of treatment. Overall Approach: Our team
will use an innovative study design that incorporates rigorous and detailed MRI imaging of the liver, coupled with
clamp-techniques and the use of stable isotopes to gain insights into the mechanisms by which Liraglutide might
affect beta-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity and reduce intrahepatic fat accumulation in youth with IGT
and NAFLD. Collectively, the proposed mechanistic RCT study, will provide important proof-of-concept, safety
data and advance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of two highly prevalent endo-hepatic
metabolic disorders in pediatrics: Impaired glucose tolerance and NAFLD/NASH."
10892168,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Innate recognition of pathogenic bacteria involves sensing both the physical presence of potentially harmful
microbes and the perturbations of host physiology that accompany infection. By monitoring for the effects of
pathogen infection on the host rather than for the infectious microorganism itself, surveillance immunity
enables the host to direct immune defenses towards bona fide pathogens during an infection and not harmless
commensal bacteria. The concept of surveillance immunity was first described in plants and in the nematode
C. elegans, and subsequently, a few specific examples have been characterized in mammals. However, it is
unknown how pathogen-induced changes in host physiology activate immune defenses.
Here, we advance a new hypothesis of innate immune sensing that stems from the concept of surveillance
immunity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that pathogen infection causes a change in the fluidity of
intestinal plasma membranes, which is sensed by the host to induce innate immune defenses. Specifically, we
propose that pathogen infection alters fatty acid desaturation in the phospholipid compartment of plasma
membranes, which reduces their fluidity and leads to activation of intracellular immune signaling cascades.
Through genetic studies of host-pathogen interactions in the nematode C. elegans, we made several
observations that provide the rationale for this idea: (i) Membrane fluidity dynamics are monitored to activate
innate immune defenses. Disruption of a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid biogenesis and desaturation
decreases membrane fluidity and causes immune activation in a manner that recapitulates intestinal infection
by bacterial pathogens. (ii) The p38 PMK-1 innate immune pathway, a host defense pathway of nematodes, is
activated in C. elegans mutants that have membrane fluidity pathology. (iii) Pathogen infection rapidly depletes
host fatty acids and suppresses the transcription of genes that synthesize monounsaturated fatty acids.
Importantly, we found that pathogen infection also disrupts the fluidity of intestinal epithelial cell plasma
membranes. (iv) Finally, cell membrane fluidity is required for pathogen resistance. C. elegans mutants with
defects in membrane fluidity are hypersusceptible to pathogen infection, and restoration of membrane fluidity
dynamics complements this mutant phenotype.
In this proposal, we will characterize host surveillance of intestinal cell plasma membrane fluidity as a novel
mechanism to activate innate immunity (Aim 1). We will also define the pathogen-induced changes in
membrane composition that decrease plasma membrane fluidity (Aim 2) and determine the mechanism of p38
PMK-1 pathway activation during bacterial infection (Aim 3). The proposed study will define a general strategy
employed by C. elegans to detect pathogen-induced disturbances in host physiology, revealing fundamental
insights into a previously unrecognized, evolutionarily ancient strategy of immune activation."
10903763,"1. Abstract: The number of patients with autoimmunity and other antigen-specific immunoregulatory
disorders is increasing worldwide at a rate of 4 to 8% per annum. Current therapies for autoimmunity only
treat disease symptoms and are systemically immunosuppressive, resulting in an increased risk of infection
and malignancy. The Holy Grail of autoimmune therapies would specifically abrogate pathogenic
autoantigen-specific immune response. To this end, we propose the development of a novel biomaterial-
based intranasal antigen-specific immunotherapy engineered to elicit auto-antigen specific regulatory T
cells that control autoimmunity. Our in intranasal AIST is composed of autoantigens conjugated to a water-
soluble polymer that binds to nasal mucus, facilitates paracellular transport across the nasal epithelium, and
targets autoantigens and tolerance-programming small molecules (i.e., minocycline and dexamethasone) to
underlying nasal DCs, resulting in the induction of autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells that suppress
autoimmune responses. In this application, we propose: (1) the synthesis of our novel intranasal ASIT, (2)
the demonstration of the ability of our platform to suppress antigen-specific immune responses, and (3) the
use of our platform to treat and prevent experimental autoimmune myocarditis. Completion of this project
will deliver a clinically viable treatment for autoimmune myocarditis and a therapeutic platform that can be
easily tailored to treat other diseases driven by antigen-specific immune dysregulation, including diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, transplant rejection, and numerous allergies."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by progressive loss of cognitive
function. Unfortunately, currently there is no effective treatment for AD and clinical interventions of AD have
largely failed despite enormous efforts. For the current application, we seek to develop multimodal machine
learning models by leveraging the rich collection of AD-related omics data and phenotypical data recently
generated from large-scale collaborative projects such as Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI),
Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).
Three aims will be pursued in the current application. Aim 1. We will build an expandable multimodal
unsupervised machine learning framework to investigate AD heterogeneity. Given the multifactorial nature of
AD, we will perform AD subtyping by harnessing the rich information across multiple spectrum of data. Aim 2.
We will build an expandable multimodal supervised machine learning framework to quantify AD risk from
longitudinal follow up of cognitively normal elders. The models will be built from genetic susceptibility and gene
regulatory information as well as endophenotypes measured when participants were cognitive normal. Aim 3.
We will build AD-related gene interaction networks in post-mortem human brain samples. We will examine the
association of multiple omics data with AD in brain samples, and build tissue-specific interaction networks to
understand potential molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. The present application represents
an innovative approach to identify individuals at high risk of AD from both clinical and genetic risk factors in
ethnically diverse populations. The outlined strategy will provide new insights into the risk stratification and
prevention strategies for AD. We also commit to share our methods through GitHub or CRAN for free access
across the scientific community."

10900786,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease that affects ~10% of reproductive age
women, resulting in debilitating pelvic pain, infertility, and compromised quality of life. It is characterized by
anatomically and phenotypically diverse lesions of endometrial-like tissue superficially on the pelvic peritoneum,
the ovaries and deeply infiltrating into pelvic organs, with resulting neuroangiogenesis, fibrosis, adhesions, pelvic
pain and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis relies on complex interactions between endometrial,
peritoneal mesothelial and connective tissue cells and activation of local immune cell responses. There is
profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems, associated with inefficient lesion clearance
and pelvic and systemic inflammation. As clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to the
heterogeneity of disease expression, diagnostics as well as effective treatments are lacking. Thus, precise
understanding of the cellular and molecular pathobiology of endometriosis is a critical prerequisite to improve
disease classification and inform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The goal of Project 1 is to determine
the contribution of the immune system to the pathobiology of endometriosis on a single cell level, and using a
data-driven strategy to derive and molecularly characterize objective disease classification. In Aim 1, we will
determine the cellular composition and functional attributes of endometriosis lesions, their surrounding
peritoneal/serosal niches, and eutopic endometrium through the lens of transcriptomic signatures at single cell
resolution. Our hypothesis is that lesions and their niche environments have unique and functionally relevant
transcriptomic signatures. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of the local and peripheral immune system
to the pathobiology of endometriosis leveraging CYTOF technology. We will test the hypothesis that the local
and peripheral myeloid phagocyte systems are dysfunctional in women with endometriosis. Local and systemic
immunological data will be integrated to identify immunological signatures of dysfunctionality and to differentiate
endometriosis disease types, along with functional studies. Finally, in Aim 3, we will leverage unsupervised
machine learning techniques to integrate single-cell assessment of endometriosis lesions, surrounding tissue,
endometrium, the local and peripheral immune systems and clinical data into a cross-tissue predictive model of
disease classification. Our integrated approach will leverage hundreds of existing, clinically well-annotated
biospecimens in our well established Human Endometrial Tissue & DNA Bank and ongoing accrual through our
extensive network of physician and surgeon collaborators. The impact of this study will be to derive a replete
transcriptomic and proteomic taxonomy of endometriosis lesions, their niche environments, eutopic endometrium,
and the local and peripheral immune systems at single cell resolution; identify disease subtypes based on
molecular signatures for disease stratification and inform personalized diagnostic and therapeutic targets; and
provide a rich data source for the greater research community focused on endometriosis and related disorders."
10900680,"Project Summary/Abstract: Overall
The overarching goal of this U19 program is to determine how neural computations across brain regions
produce two core cognitive processes, working memory and decision-making, and thus to derive fundamental
principles of brain function. This renewal application proposes to pursue powerful new themes that emerged
from our previous work and to broaden our scope substantially. To do so, the eight PIs plan a tightly integrated
set of experimental and computational studies of mice doing the accumulating towers task—in which they must
remember how many towers flash on each side as they run down a maze in virtual reality—and related tasks.
 The first theme arises from the finding that neurons across the brain encode task variables and are
necessary for task performance. Almost all of these areas exhibit sequential activity, in which neurons are
active at different times in the task and, together, tile the trial duration. Project 1 will identify the task features
that drive sequential activity, use cooling to identify neural circuits that generate sequential activity, and
elucidate its anatomical basis by combining transmission electron microscopy and computational modeling.
 A second theme is that manifold inference methods, applied to large-scale hippocampal recordings in
our task, reveal the geometry of a joint neural representation for an external variable (position) and an internal,
cognitive variable (accumulated evidence). Project 2 will extend our work on the geometry of neural
representations to other brain regions. We will examine how geometries and representations in these regions
interact with each other, and we will develop models to explain how the observed neural manifolds arise.
 A third theme, fueled by our development of statistical methods to infer internal brain states, is that
animals’ brains occupy qualitatively different states from trial to trial during the same task block. Our data
suggests that behavior in each state requires different neural structures and circuits—in the same animal and
the same trial block. Project 3 will use multi-region recordings and perturbations to investigate whether states
are local to subcircuits versus global across the brain, extend our behavioral inference methods to neural data,
and examine to what extent our inferred states are linked to internal states of arousal, thirst, and hunger.
 Elucidating how multiple circuits performing local computations combine into a brain in action is the
goal of Projects 4 and 5. Project 4 will probe functional interactions in multi-region recordings, including very
large-scale simultaneous electrophysiological recordings with next-generation silicon probes; and through
targeted experiments will test two hypotheses of how subcortical regions interact with neocortex.
 Project 5 will generate a set of mechanistic models that instantiate specific hypothesized roles of
different brain regions. These local models will be combined into a single multi-regional model, informed by
data from all projects, that will enable us to dissect the roles of individual regions and their interactions in
performance of the many variants of our decision-making task."
10840843,"PROJECT SUMMARY: An extraordinarily challenging problem is to develop general methods to target defective
or malfunctioning RNAs that cause disease selectively. Current therapeutic strategies to target RNAs are based
on specific sequence recognition by oligonucleotides. However, many human disorders are caused by highly
structured RNAs not readily targetable by conventional base pairing, in particular RNA repeat expansions that
cause or contribute to >30 incurable neuromuscular diseases and genetically defined dementia. Thus, allele-
specific ASOs modalities for these microsatellite disorders have been developed by targeting polymorphisms
outside of the repeating sequence. The consequences of this approach are that only patients with the
polymorphisms benefit from treatment and that an ASO has to be developed for each disease, even if caused
by the same repeating sequence. If the toxin in these diseases, the expanded repeat, could be targeted
selectively with a structure-specific small molecule, then a single modality could be a therapeutic or chemical
probe for multiple diseases and for all patients.
 Over the past 14 years, we have shown that RNA structures can be targeted selectively with small molecules
in situ and in vivo, more selectively than oligonucleotides. Indeed, we have designed compounds against many
RNA repeat expansions that selectively recognize the target’s structure and rescue disease-associated
pathobiology in situ and in vivo. Further, these chemical probes have elucidated new mechanisms of disease,
including a previously unknown RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway that operates in fragile X
syndrome. These studies, along with our innovative strategies to synthesize drugs at the site of disease and to
engineer small molecules with novel activities, including antisense- or CRISPR-like modes of action, lay the
foundation for our proposed research program.
 Herein, we propose a comprehensive strategy to study the molecular recognition of RNA repeat expansions
by small molecules in situ and in vivo, enabling the establishment of new chemical biology frameworks to target
RNA using small molecules and the development of preclinical candidates. Our studies span many types of
repeat expansions, differing in both sequence and gene contexts (intron, untranslated region, or open reading
frame). We have devised innovative strategies to: (i) exploit the structures of RNA repeats to coax the disease-
causing RNA to synthesize its own drug; (ii) interface small molecules with natural RNA decay and QC pathways;
and (iii) recruit endogenous nuclease to the repeats with small molecules. We will not only deliver proof-of-
concept small molecules that rescue disease-associated defects in situ and in vivo, but make new discoveries
about how to drug RNA using small molecules. Our proposed work would therefore be well supported by an
R35 award, as the flexibility conferred by this award is truly necessary to ensure sustainable, long-term funding
and the investment required to develop a new code for how molecules interface with RNA in health and disease."
10912577,"Project Summary (Project 1, Co-PIs: Froemke, Lin, Buzsaki)
Oxytocin is a neuropeptide important for social behavior, such as maternal care, pair bonding, and cooperation
by partners and groups. Direct axonal oxytocin release into various forebrain targets is critical for social behavior,
but it remains unclear if the oxytocin system is heterogeneous and reflects important functional differences for
certain cell subsets, relates to inter-animal differences in parental abilities, and if experience-dependent plasticity
can adapt the oxytocin system to social and parental environments. Oxytocin administration might also be
clinically promising for autism spectrum disorders, social anxiety, and post-partum conditions. However, it is
imperative to understand what aspects of oxytocin release relate to parenting, cooperating, and communal living,
and whether there are differences in oxytocin modulation that depend on sex, experience, or social context.
 Here we will address this critical knowledge gap. Recently, with the U19 Behavior Core we built a system
for neural recordings and behavioral monitoring, continuously collecting data over days to months on home cage
life as mice parent or co-parent together. This was combined with photo-tagged recordings in vivo of identified
oxytocin neurons in maternal mice. Our documentary-style video recordings revealed previously-undescribed
behavioral interactions by which experienced mothers seemed to encourage or perhaps ‘teach’ co-housed pup-
naïve virgin females to engage in maternal care. These behaviors activated photo-tagged oxytocin cells in virgin
PVN, providing a robust foundation for the current Project, in which our team aims to understand what aspects
of maternal care- by single mothers, pairs, and small groups- activate oxytocin neurons, require oxytocin
signaling, and might produce or depend on plasticity of this system upon transition to parenting. The central
hypothesis is that the oxytocin system is attuned to social variables related to pup care and the behavior of other
potential co-parents, to regulate the behavior of single and co-parents to assure pup survival. We further
hypothesize that this depends on adult dominance interactions (studied with Project 2 and analyzed with the
Computational Modeling Core) that set up social structures for effective co-parenting. We will monitor oxytocin
neurons with in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, photometry, and perform behavioral and opto-/chemo-genetic
studies in adult mice to determine when and how oxytocin modulates neural circuits for social information
processing and reliable maternal behavior, with mechanisms of modulation informed by Project 3 and relevant
brain areas for social information processing identified in Projects 2 and 4. In Aim 1 we study initial plasticity of
oxytocin cells when animals become single mothers, relating oxytocin cell firing to variables such nest building
or pup temperature. In Aim 2, we ask if oxytocin neurons help experienced dams teach co-housed naive adults
to co-parent. In Aim 3, we study groups of 3-4 mice (including an experienced dam and litter) to quantify dynamics
of communal living and co-parenting, and how oxytocin helps ensure social network stability for raising infants."
10912578,"Project Summary (Project 2, Co-PIs: Lin, Buzsaki, Froemke, Tsien)
In a complex social group, the ability to learn who to approach and who to avoid is essential for success or even
survival. Mice, just like humans, quickly learn to avoid a bully after they are attacked and defeated. This defeat-
induced social learning is essential for establishing stable social hierarchies. Animals learn their ranking relative
to a competitor after each round of fighting. This iterative process leads to a “pecking order”. The neural
mechanisms supporting the behavioral change after social defeat remain elusive. The goal of Project 2 is to
understand the neural process underlying social learning in the context of social hierarchy formation, with a
special focus on oxytocin. Our recent study found that oxytocin signaling in a small hypothalamic region, the
anterior ventrolateral part of ventromedial hypothalamus (aVMHvl), is essential for defeat-induced social
learning. Specifically, in defeated animals, oxytocin receptor (OXTR)–expressing cells in the aVMHvl
(aVMHvlOXTR) specifically increase responses to cues generated by the winner. This increase is functionally
important as inactivation of VMHvlOXTR cells impairs avoidance of the winner, whereas optogenetic activation of
the cells induces avoidance even in undefeated animals. We further found that OXTR in the aVMHvl is itself
necessary for the defeat-induced social avoidance thanks to its role in facilitating synaptic potentiation.
Interestingly, aVMHvlOXTR cells receive a private source of oxytocin from the nearby retrochiasmatic supraoptic
nucleus (SOROXT), which is activated during defeat and functionally important for defeat-induced behavioral
changes.
 Following up on these exciting findings, our current proposal is aimed at deepening and broadening our
understanding of OXTR signaling in social learning in the context of social hierarchy formation via three specific
aims. Aim 1 will address whether OXTR signaling is essential for the initial social learning (memory formation)
or remembering after learning (memory retention). Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that social status modulates
OXTR signaling at the aVMHvl to adjust rate of social avoidance learning, i.e., susceptibility to defeat. Lastly, in
Aim 3, we will examine the role of OXTR signaling in forming and maintaining social hierarchies through long-
term behavior recording, genetic manipulation, and computational modeling, requiring the essential services of
each Core facility proposed in this U19. This project draws diverse expertise from all U19 PIs and cores, using
tools including transcriptomic profiling, in vivo and in vitro recordings, functional manipulations, and theoretical
modeling. This Project provides critical data on adult social interactions important for communal living/parenting
for Project 1, relies on mechanistic studies and data to be performed in Project 3, and serves as a test-bed for
circuit-level perturbations developed in Project 4."
10912583,"Project Summary (Project 3, Co-PIs: Tsien, Buzsaki, Froemke, Lin)
Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that shapes vital behaviors such as pair bonding, parenting and social competition.
There are many pressing questions about how such behaviors are steered by brain circuits. Understanding
oxytocin’s actions in the brain is further motivated by possible disruption of oxytocin signaling in various
neuropsychiatric disorders. Oxytocin is widely seen as affecting cellular excitability, synaptic transmission, and
long-term plasticity in single neurons, but a mechanism-based understanding of behavior is still lacking. Project
3 and 4 have a suitable meeting ground for understanding modulatory mechanisms, examining circuits in
hippocampus and lateral septum (LS) that successively relay input from neocortical areas and send output to
other brain areas that control social behaviors. OXTRs are particularly enriched in the CA2 subregion of the
hippocampus. Hippocampal CA2 harbors pyramidal neurons (PYRs) that directly receive input from lateral
entorhinal cortex and are pivotal to generation of brain oscillations and establishment of social memory. The
lateral septum, a largely GABAergic structure, includes neurons in its dorsal quadrant that receive inputs from
CA2 and other neurons that connect to hypothalamic VMHvl to help control a range of behaviors including
aggression and competition.
 Here we will study the cellular, synaptic and microcircuit signaling mechanisms of oxytocin, focusing on
the CA2 subregion and the LS. Aim 1 builds on our recent discovery of how oxytocin alters excitability in CA2
PYRs: by diminishing inward rectifier potassium channels (IKir) (favoring membrane depolarization) and shutting
off hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels (Ih) (providing a hyperpolarizing drive). The
combined reduction in both IKir and Ih restrains membrane potential from quickly depolarizing from rest (thus
enabling oxytocin to “signal slow”) but synergistically elevates membrane resistance, favoring dendritic
integration. Indeed, we observe a new population of huge unitary synaptic currents. We will test whether these
giant events arise from distal dendritic inputs, impinging on local GluR clusters several times bigger than at
postsynaptic sites nearer the soma, potentially those arriving from entorhinal cortex. In Aim 2, we will pursue
new data showing that fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) display an unusual synergy between oxytocin and
inhibitory transmission. A FSI driven to rapidly fire by OXTR stimulation can be persistently interrupted by brief
GABAergic inhibition. We will test whether such combinatorial “signaling fast” supports sudden switching of
circuits involved in social choice, as proposed by our Computational Modeling Core. In Aim 3, we will build on
our surprising observation that oxytocin hyperpolarizes certain inhibitory LS neurons, causing them to cease
their spontaneous firing (“signaling in reverse”), by heavily weighting inhibition of Ih. We will explore the
consequences for various LS functions, including control of aggression and global oxytocinergic regulation."
10912587,"Project Summary (Project 4, Co-PIs: Buzsaki, Froemke, Lin, Tsien)
The spatiotemporal scales of oxytocin (OXT) modulation in the central nervous system remain unclear, and the
actions on downstream targets and mechanisms of upstream control are poorly understood especially compared
to other modulators. Here we measure signals from next-generation modulatory GRAB sensors. Our pilot data
established that OXT levels fluctuate extensively during both overt waking behaviors and sleep, reaching its
minimum during REM sleep. Thus OXT release occurs not only during social behaviors but in other contexts as
well. Therefore, the goal of Project 4 is to ask how a) OXT neurons are regulated by upstream brain regions,
involved in a variety of behaviors, and how b) OXT affects specific network computations in target areas. We will
also relate its actions to a well-characterized neuromodulator, acetylcholine (ACh) and address how artificial
(“pathological”) coupling between OXT and specific circuit patterns during sleep impacts waking social behavior.
 In the first set of experiments, we will identify paradigm-independent physiological features of subtypes
of OXT neurons and relate them to paradigm-specific (e.g., parental behavior, social hierarchy) behaviors.
Potential OXT subtypes (assessed with mouse lines generated by the Molecular Tools Core via intersectional
approaches) will be identified optogenetically, with by physiological and brain state-dependent characterization.
Using large-scale electrophysiological methods, we will establish the relationship between the firing patterns of
OXT neuron types and characteristic population patterns in the hippocampus, thalamus and neocortex. In turn,
these characterized firing patterns will serve to relate their spiking activity observed during social interactions
and maternal care. The second set of experiments are devoted to reveal the differential impact of OXT neurons
in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei on their target circuit patterns and compare these effects to those of
a different modulator (here, ACh). We will examine the influence of neuromodulation on critical hippocampal
(theta, gamma, sharp wave ripples) and neocortical (gamma, UP-DOWN states) network patterns and inter-
regional communication. We will also establish the state-dependent temporal relationships between OXT and
ACh. The final set of experiments will artificially alter the temporal relationship between REM and non-REM
patterns in the hippocampus and OXT release. The goal of these experiments is to gain knowledge how potential
sleep patterns might be required for social learning and memory over extended interactions between animals,
and if specific perturbations of these mechanisms impact subsequent social behavior in the waking animal.
 In sum, this project aims to discover the network control of OXT and its impact on circuits, and compare
the conditions and circuit mechanisms distinguishing non-social vs social aspects of OXT signaling. This is a
collaborative effort across laboratories of the four PIs, supported by the Cores. Our collaboration increases
productivity and guarantees interdisciplinary training of students and postdocs participating in these projects."
10912589,"Project Summary: Administrative Core
This BRAIN Initiative proposal Oxytocin Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior is located at NYU
Grossman School of Medicine, and each of the four Project team labs (Tsien, Buzsaki, Lin, and Froemke) are
housed within the Neuroscience Institute at NYU Langone Health, in proximity to the five Cores (Administrative,
Behavior, Computational Modeling, Data Science, and Molecular Tools). The first five years of this effort was
considerably productive and transformative here at NYU, leading to a number of collaborative publications and
set the groundwork for this new proposal. Our team studies and activites will therefore benefit from integration
with the larger NYU scientific environment, including the Neuroscience graduate program, an existing and robust
scientific outreach program, a strong history of activities supporting diversity and inclusion, and institutional
resources including a cutting-edge health science library and data management system and a strong
administrative staff.
 This Administrative Core will help ensure the management, coordination, and interactions between these
components of this proposal. Aim 1 of the Administrative Core is to continue to enable productive and synergistic
interactions between Project team labs, coordinating with the Internal and External Advisory Committees, and
scheduling regular meetings for open communication, sharing of scientific results, developing collaborations,
and providing opportunities for trainee engagement. Aim 2, under the direction of Dr. Froemke as mentorship
and diversity champion, is to enhance the scientific training and careers of junior colleagues in team labs,
including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and technicians, by facilitating co-advising and interactions
with NYU training programs. We will also develop activities that support diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts for
trainees and staff with under-represented minority backgrounds. Aim 3 is to ensure that our results are clearly
communicated in a timely manner to NIH staff, other scientists, and the public. Our labs are committed to data
sharing, and we will continue to work with the Data Science Core on these efforts. The Neuroscience Outreach
Group at NYU has substantial connections with schools and museums throughout New York City, and engages
in activities both at the city and national level (particularly through the Society for Neuroscience). Finally, Aim 4
will ensure the appropriate management of Project and Core finances and the overall budget. Administrative
Core Co-Directors and staff members are highly experienced at managing multi-PI projects and budgets. Drs.
Tsien, McKellar, and Froemke, bring complimentary expertise and a solid working relationship to their leadership
roles within the Administrative Core. They will continue to enable synergistic and accelerated scientific progress
across team labs, support career development of trainees and foster a community that is diverse and inclusive,
and effectively communicate our findings to the greater scientific and public communities."
10912594,"Project Summary: Data Science Core
Our team for this NIH BRAIN Initiative U19 proposal on Oxytocin Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and
Behavior is located at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and staff for the Data Science Core are located in
the NYU Health Sciences Library and Neuroscience Institute. This proximity facilitates their interactions, which
has produced a number of collaborations and efforts to promote data sharing, standardization, and archiving that
form a solid foundation for this proposed Data Science Core. The Core Director is Dr. Alisa Surkis, a faculty
member in the Health Sciences Library with a background in computational and experimental neuroscience, in
collaboration with Dr. Karen Adolph, Dr. Peter Petersen, and Nicole Contaxis (leaders in repositories for
behavioral and neural data and data discovery, respectively).
 The Data Science Core will help ensure the management and stewardship of the datasets to be collected
in our Projects and by the other Cores, including behavioral data (short episodes and weeks-long movies),
physiological recordings (in vivo and in vitro, whole-cell and extracellular recordings), imaging (2-photon,
confocal, and fiber photometry), and gene expression profiling. Aim 1 of the Data Science Core is to build a
pipeline for annotating, storing, and sharing behavioral video data. This project will involve a collaboration with
Drs. Mar (Behavior Core), Froemke (Project 1 PI), and Lin (Project 2 PI) and Dr. Karen Adolph, director of the
Databrary video repository to add functionality and metadata to Databrary to popularize a “Zoobrary” for animal
video data. Aim 2 is to further develop and disseminate the BrainSTEM tool as a low barrier means to achieve
FAIR data sharing. Dr. Surkis will continue her work with Dr. Peter Petersen to refine and disseminate this
experimental neuroscience metadata collection tool as a low barrier means to FAIR data sharing. Aim 3 is to
develop a blueprint for a sustainable system to maximize discoverability of BRAIN Initiative data. Dr. Surkis will
work with Nicole Contaxis, lead of the NYU Data Catalog to develop functionality that will provide a blueprint for
means to improve discovery of datasets within a fragmented and evolving data repository landscape. We will
also continue to work with extramural collaborators and other BRAIN Initiative U19 groups to discuss best
practices for data sharing, e.g., under the FAIR principles, and leverage Dr. Surkis’s position as Director of the
National Center for Data Services of the Network of the National Library of Medicine to disseminate best practices
developed within the OXT U19 and across the BRAIN Initiative."
10912599,"Project Summary: Molecular Tools Core
 One of the major features of this BRAIN Initiative proposal on “Oxytocin Modulation of Neural Circuit
Function and Behavior” is this Molecular Tools Research Support Core. Each of the Project teams is examining
oxytocin release and the action of oxytocin receptor signaling. Oxytocin is exemplary among peptide hormones
and neuromodulators, has been studied in various forms for over a century, and has clear physiological action,
behavioral relevance, and biomedical importance. However, little is known about the cellular and network effects
of oxytocin signaling. This is in part due to lack of specific antibodies for determining which brain areas and cell
types express oxytocin receptors, as well as other molecular tools for specifically manipulating and monitoring
oxytocin signaling with high spatiotemporal precision. Our labs have generated, validated, and are distributing
the first specific antibodies to mouse oxytocin receptors, and have also developed the first successful versions
of caged oxytocin compounds. Given the successful use and enthusiasm by the scientific community together
with the need for continued validation and optimization, we feel obliged to scale-up production of these reagents
and improve their functionality. There is clearly urgent and widespread need for these resources, which are best
produced, tested, and distributed by a Core facility rather than by individual labs.
 Aim 1 of the Molecular Tools Core is to continue production of oxytocin receptor antibodies, distribute
these antibodies broadly, and optimize their utility and specificity including generation of monoclonal antibodies.
Aim 2 is to generate and optimize caged and photo-switchable forms of oxytocin receptor agonists and
antagonists, useful for delineating specifically when and where oxytocin receptor signaling acts to generate
physiological responses in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Aim 3 generates reagents for
click chemistry involving tagged oxytocin, to visualize oxytocin within fixed and live tissue, to help determine if
and where exogenous oxytocin delivery acts within an organism. Aim 4 is to generate useful and when needed
develop new mouse lines for cell-type specific dissection of oxytocinergic signaling, and to leverage
transcriptome data and other gene expression resources to facilitate studies on the roles of molecularly defined
Oxt+ and Oxtr+ populations in socio-spatial behavior."
10912604,"Project Summary: Behavior Core
Long-term (days to months) and continuous (24 hours/day, 7 days/week) behavioral monitoring of mouse socio-
spatial behavior is fundamental to this BRAIN Initiative proposal on “Oxytocin Modulation of Neural Circuit
Function and Behavior”. Each Project requires behavioral assessment of mice in home cages or in larger more
complex environments, often longitudinally and in conjunction with neural recordings, optogenetics, or other
manipulations of cellular and network-level activity. A number of recent technical advances across levels now
enable a deeper understanding of neuromodulation on flexible information processing and behavior in mice.
Some of these innovations have been pioneered by our laboratories and the Projects/Cores of the Oxytocin U19
in the previous funding cycle. Specifically, it is now possible- if not routine- to apply advanced machine learning
and computer vision methods for quantitative behavioral analysis of animal poses and trajectories from video
data. This includes video tracking of multiple animals interacting, from different camera angles, across the
light/dark cycle, and with simultaneous neural recordings. Over the last five years we have developed hardware,
software, and other infrastructure to perform this continuous behavioral monitoring in our facility. Our successes
have led to considerable investment in space and computer storage for this facility by NYU Langone.
 We now capitalize on the development of this facility and behavioral monitoring system to support the
next-generation studies of multi-animal behavior and modulation of neural circuit function by the Oxytocin U19
teams. Aim 1 is to improve our capacity for behavioral home cage monitoring, both in terms of number of animals
monitored per cage and the pipeline for data collection and analysis. Aim 2 is to develop more complex housing
environments for studies of socio-spatial behavior and decision-making in mouse colonies of small to moderate
sizes. Aim 3 is to provide a suite of additional social, spatial and other oxytocin-related testing available to Project
teams and assisted by Behavior Core staff, including breeding and housing the set of transgenic mouse lines
required for this U19 proposal."
10912606,"Project Summary: Computational Modeling Core
Our team for this BRAIN Initiative U19 proposal on Oxytocin Modulation of Neural Circuit Function and Behavior
is located at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and staff for the Computational Modeling Core are located in
the NYU Neuroscience Institute alongside the Oxytocin U19 Project and other Core labs. This proximity facilitates
their interactions, which has produced a number of ongoing collaborations and will promote the development,
validation, implementation, standardization, and dissemination of computational analyses of oxytocin function
that are the foundation of this proposed Computational Modeling Core. Core Director Dr. Kenway Louie is a
computational neuroscientist with extensive experience in network modeling and behavioral analysis, who will
lead a team of postdoctoral-level staff with expertise in the proposed modeling techniques.
 This Computational Modeling Core will serve as a centralized resource for computational modeling
relevant to oxytocin mechanisms in Project team lab research, coordinating theoretical, analytic, and simulation
approaches across the Project labs. This research support will enable theoretically-motivated collaborations
between the four Project labs, standardize computational modeling approaches to predict behavioral effects of
cellular, synaptic, and circuit changes, provide an integrated, hierarchical modeling framework for different social
behaviors, and provide straightforward and robust access to the computational examination of oxytocin
modulation of circuit function and behavior for all U19 team members. Aim 1 of the Computational Modeling Core
is to develop circuit-based models of oxytocin function and individual animal behavior. Using established
dynamical rate models customized to circuits of interest, this approach will identify specific oxytocin-related
experimental manipulations relevant to the brain areas under study, allowing comparison to experimental data
and hypothesis testing about circuit-specific oxytocin function. Aim 2 is to develop agent-based models (ABM)
of multi-agent social behaviors, which will examine how oxytocin contributes to the relationship between neural
computations, individual animal behavior, and emergent multi-agent social behaviors. This work will make
predictions about the effect of specific manipulations (e.g., oxytocin receptor knockout) on specific behaviors
(e.g., social hierarchy formation), test ABM predictions in empirical behavior, and refine our understanding of the
computational and cognitive role of oxytocin in different social behaviors. Aim 3 is to develop a unified theoretical
framework that synthesizes modeling approaches for diverse datasets, specifically drawing on both the
dynamical modeling of Aim 1 and ABM frameworks of Aim 2, to capture multiple timescales of social behavior.
We will work closely with the Data Science and Behavior Cores to standardize model structures, simulated
behavioral and neural data, and metadata curation. We will also ensure accessibility of our work by maintaining
a dedicated U19 Computational Modeling Core source code repository."
10912646,"Project Summary/Abstract
Work under this proposal supports development of a broad-spectrum point-of-care (POC) coagulometer by
Perosphere Technologies (The Perosphere Technologies POC Coagulometer) with the intent to create and offer
an automated, microfluidic version of the manual Lee/White clotting time method. The device is based on novel
technology and utilizes reagent-less, single-use microfluidic cuvettes made of silicon and glass for measurement
of blood samples. Clot activation occurs at the beginning of the intrinsic clotting pathway through contact of a
blood sample with the inner glass and silicon surfaces of the cuvette. The device detects clot formation by
monitoring the intensity of near-infrared light, transmitted through cuvette and blood sample, and sensing of fibrin
assembly at the end of the common clotting pathway. The clot detection scheme affords development of two
main assays, a Clotting Time Assay, that measures the time to onset of clot formation and is currently
implemented on the coagulometer platform, and a Clot Lysis Time assay, that measures the time to onset of
subsequent clot breakdown and is in development. Research indicates that the device is broadly sensitive to
the effects of anticoagulants across drug class, their reversal agents and thrombolytic drugs. Initial marketing
efforts will focus on use of the device with implemented Clotting Time assay for monitoring of the direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) and low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Research under this proposal targets
establishment of clotting time reference ranges for healthy volunteers and patients on the DOACs rivaroxaban,
apixaban, dabigatran and edoxaban, in direct support of initial marketing goals. In support of future device
applications, the research also targets assessment of the device’s ability to detect inherited or acquired
coagulopathies, based on abnormal clotting times, as well as assessment of the device’s sensitivity to
abelacimab, a novel anticoagulant and direct factor XI/XIa inhibitor, currently in clinical development.
Perosphere Technologies intends to commercialize the device through a marketing, sales and distribution
partnership with a global medical device company. The device is similarly suited for use in emergency situations
(e.g. emergency room, emergency vehicle) and for routine care in the inpatient and outpatient settings (hospitals,
clinics, surgical suites, doctor’s offices, pharmacies) by healthcare professionals who can perform or order fresh
venous whole blood draws. The device promises to address several unmet medical needs, including point-of-
care monitoring of DOACs, and has the potential to define new standards of care. The device is expected to
improve patient care, clinical outcome and to reduce healthcare costs, by providing physicians with the means
to make faster and better-informed treatment decisions. The developed Clotting Time and Clot Lysis Time
assays will present a new way to describe a patient’s coagulation state and enable opportunities for fundamental
research of disease mechanisms and therapeutic approaches."

The goal of the University of Miami CTSI K12 Career Development Program is to prepare 10 diverse scholars
(MD or PhD) for independent and sustained careers in clinical translational science and research (CTSR) with
focus on health disparity, community health and health equity. Integrated with the Miami CTSI, the program will
develop a robust, broad-based CTSR workforce of diverse scientists who possess both deep scientific domain
expertise and broader research systems understanding. Driven by this goal, we have set three objectives: 1)
develop core competences and knowledge in CTSR; 2) provide evidence-informed mentoring; and 3) accelerate
transition to independent and sustained careers in CTSR. Our program is designed to ensure that a diverse
pool of highly trained CTSR scientists can address community needs. Following the NCATS vision of the ideal
translational scientist, the program’s approach to CTSR training is global, where scholars produce discoveries
that are simultaneously important for their disciplines, contribute to other disciplines, and of benefit to patients
and communities, advancing the translational process as a whole. Our program’s conceptual approach
integrates principles of team science, dissemination & implementation (D&I) and diversity, equity, inclusion and
accessibility to help scholars successfully move their research products into real-world use relevant to public
health. Given our geographical location, with exceptional diversity in ancestry, racial/ethnic identities, and
cultures combined with ten years of a successful CTSI KL2 program and a strong institutional commitment to
workforce diversity and research environment, we offer unique training opportunities for addressing complex
CTSR challenges such as disparities and health equity. The program is organized around five major activities:
(1) recruitment and selection of highly qualified candidates; (2) developing key competencies in CTSR; (3)
collaborative mentorship by CTSR domain experts, and clinician, peer and community mentors; (4) accelerating
scholar transition to an independent and sustained career in CTSR; and (5) program evaluation. In the five years
of the K12 award cycle, the program will provide up to two years of funding to each scholar for personalized
training, intensive scientific practice, and research career development experience under the guidance of
collaborative mentorships and partnerships outside of their areas of expertise, both within their research domains
and with community stakeholders. Our rigorous evaluation plan assesses the quality and effectiveness of the
training program to gauge its effectiveness in enhancing diversity and principles of D&I in CTSR, and scholar
capacity to effectively lead, communicate, collaborate, and break down barriers across multidisciplinary teams
and the translational process. The program is led by two directors who are translational MD/PhD researchers
with complementary laboratory-to-clinical and clinical-to-population health research, and guidance committees
composed of experienced scientists and training program leaders from our Hub and other CTSAs."

10927294,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We propose to establish the Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC) for the Developmental
Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) Project to generate, analyze, and integrate multimodal genomic data from
various tissues, with emphasis on multiple brain regions, across 4 age groups: infancy, early childhood, late
childhood and adolescence. We will develop an atlas that integrates genotyping data and functional genomic
data to help predict functional impact of noncoding genomic variants, both common and rare on gene expression.
Our project will address two key knowledge gaps. First, large-scale efforts by GTEx and other consortia have
focused on adult or prenatal ages and only to a limited extent, on the postnatal developmental ages from birth
to adolescence, critical periods because humans have prolonged postnatal development, particularly prominent
in the brain. Second, resolution at the level of specific cell types in lacking in many studies. Studying postnatal
development at the level of specific cell types is critical because the effects of genetic variants on gene regulation
are often cell-type specific. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose to 1) create an atlas of
pediatric tissue gene expression in bulk tissues and single cell populations, 2) analyze differences in gene
expression, regulation, and known expression QTLs and splicing QTLs across postnatal human development,
and 3) create and make available a biobank of as many tissues as possible (up to 50 tissues per donor), and
associated data for further characterization. 4) develop a data portal for data dissemination as well as integration
of our data with Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx), Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and other
consortia. By so doing, we will radically expand upon earlier efforts by GTEx and create a comprehensive and
broadly available community resource on human developmental tissues, to help drive research forward in
multiple research fields, and generally any disease."
10885072,"Project Summary
The GENCODE consortium creates foundational reference genome annotation for the human and mouse
genomes in which all features are identified and classified with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and
then freely released for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation. GENCODE seeks to
create annotation that increases the understanding of genome function in both human and mouse by prioritizing
human disease genes and respecting the role of mouse as the major mammalian model organism. To effectively
annotate genomes, GENCODE has created a suite of tools and draws on deep expertise across its partners
across four fundamental components: 1) a comprehensive gene annotation pipeline leveraging manual and
computational annotation; 2) a set of computational methods to evaluate and enhance gene annotation; 3)
experimental pipelines targeted to expressed sequences less detectable in standard protocols; and 4) a machine
learning capacity to improve all facets of the project. GENCODE will maintain a major focus on protein-coding
and non-coding loci, including their alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes and will extend expert
manual review to small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and the annotation of non-polyadenylated transcripts.
GENCODE will also expand regulatory annotation to a defined set of gene-associated features to more
accurately reflect the interconnections between regulatory regions, including those with transcribed sequences
such as ncRNA, and overall transcriptional output. GENCODE will take advantage of the increasing maturity of
genomics technology including long-read transcriptome sequencing, functional genomics assays, and graph-
based genome representations to identify features such as genes, pseudogenes, exons and splice sites that are
incorrect, incomplete or in genome regions simply not present in the current reference assembly. More
specifically, in the next four years GENCODE plans to 1) extend its human and mouse gene sets to as near
completion as possible given available data and current experimental technology; 2) leverage new, high-quality
human genome assemblies and targeted transcriptomic data to expand representation so that more human
haplotypes will have high-quality annotation 3) annotate gene-associated regulatory regions including enhancer-
promoter connections 4) collaborate with other resources to ensure a consistent representation of genic and
regulatory features and reference transcripts for reporting clinical variation; and 5) distribute GENCODE
annotations and engage with community annotation efforts to ensure accuracy and consistency. Primary
GENCODE data will continue to be available from the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers and the
GENCODE web site. We will develop new mechanisms for effective two-way outreach, training and
communication with the community with the long-term aim of establishing GENCODE as the standard annotation
set for research and clinical genomics applications."
