Social determinants of Health (SDoH) drive 80% of health outcomes and transportation is the
third most prominent SDoH in the United States, impacting nearly all other social determinants.
A lack of access to easy, reliable transportation causes over 5.8 million Americans to miss their
healthcare appointments each year (Wolfe et al, 2020). Traditional transportation solutions like
curb-to-curb rideshare, taxis, and buses are often unreliable or unsafe for vulnerable
populations including older adults with mobility impairments and those suffering from Alzheimer’
disease or Alzheimer’ disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) (Fraade-Blanar et al, 2021). In the
United States, 5.7 million people suffer from AD/ADRD, which are projected to grow to 13.8
million (Alzheimer’s Association, 2018). Additionally, 26% of individuals with AD/ADRD live
alone in the community (Alzheimer’s Association, 2018). Onward, a California based small
business, has developed a technology enabled door-through-door rideshare service with a
companion driver trained to support older adults and individuals with mild to moderate
AD/ADRD. Drivers are certified in CPR and first aid, and have received training in supporting
patients with AD/ADRD or post-sedation care, elder abuse and neglect prevention,
communicating with special needs patients, infection control, fall avoidance, cultural humility,
HIPAA, and other subjects that enable them to safely and effectively transport riders, particularly
older adults with AD/ADRD.
Further, transportation is the number one type of caregiving support provided in the United
States. Eight out of 10 caregivers consider transportation a primary responsibility and 40% of
them spend five or more hours per week providing and coordinating transportation (AARP;
NADTC 2018). This demonstrates the demand for transportation solutions and the opportunity
to reduce caregiver stress with transportation interventions. In this Phase II project, we aim to
(1) conduct a RCT to evaluate the impact of door-through-door rideshare services with a trained
companion driver on missed appointments for older adults and patients with AD/ADRD, (2)
enhance the rider-driver matching capabilities of our technology platform, and (3) to
demonstrate the ability to replicate the solution in other geographies that have different ride
density and rider demographics."

Abstract
The goal of this application is to strengthen dissemination and implementation (D&I) science by testing the
implementation of our indigenous focused Family Listening Program (FLP), which is a culturally transformed
intervention through the use of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. FLP is currently
undergoing a rigorous R01 examination with three distinct southwest tribal communities (Jemez Pueblo,
Ramah Navajo, & Mescalero Apache), who have established their own active Tribal Research Teams (TRTs).
In this new study we introduce an innovative process called CBPR Culture-Centered System which will be
integrated with the Interactive Systems Framework (D&I structures and functions to bridge science & practice)
for an examination of the uptake, cultural acceptance, and sustainability of evidence-based strategies moved
into practice with three new southwest tribal communities, Torreon-Star Lake, Nahata Dziil, and Zia Pueblo,
who will each develop their own research community advisory board (CAB). This grant will continue the long-
term research partnership with the current R01 TRT partners that provides a solid foundation for collaborating
on the synthesis and translation of the following tools that will facilitate the three new CAB partners to adapt
their own FLP curriculum and evaluation measures into their own distinct cultural knowledge, histories, values,
and practices for implementation: a) Quality Implementation Tool; b) CAB Development Guide; c) Culture-
Centered Coaching Guide; d) Digital Story Modules; and e) Culture-Centered FLP Toolkit. Preliminary findings
have shown FLP's early effectiveness in reduced child depression, anxiety, and enhanced protective factors of
cultural connectedness and coping skills. In this application, the University of New Mexico (UNM) College of
Education with the UNM Center for Participatory Research and our TRT partners will provide a support system
to the CABs in the cultural-recentering and implementation of their own FLP program in which the delivery
system will be rigorously evaluated. The FLP is perfectly poised to take the next step of D&I and this study will
facilitate bi-directional knowledge translation between academic and tribal partners while utilizing a CBPR
Culture-Centered System (CCS) an innovation that represents the intersection of academic and tribal spheres
of influence and knowledge to create a novel implementation approach. This study has three specific aims: 1)
With TRT partners, “synthesize and translate” previous R01 research findings into pre-implementation steps
with three new tribes, i.e., build new Community Advisory Boards (CABs); assess contextual facilitators and
barriers, and re-center FLP curricula into new cultures for sustainability; 2) Test a bi-directional coaching
“support system” with UNM and the TRTs providing technical assistance and trainings to new CABs; and
producing, as co-learners, digital stories for the final CBPR CCS Guide; and 3) Evaluate the capacity of the
“delivery system” of the CABs to implement the practice- based FLP Toolkit (curriculum and program
evaluation tool), re-centered into their cultural knowledge and context."
10905428,"Cognitive decline is one of frequent challenges accompanying Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known
about the link between AD pathology and neural circuit mechanisms especially in frontal cortex essential for
cognitive control behavior. Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation has been implicated as an upstream event in AD
pathogenesis. Aβ-induced changes in synaptic function in experimental models of AD pathology suggest that
Aβ may affect neural circuit connectivity essential for cognitive control behavior. Identification of cognitive circuit
network vulnerable to Aβ accumulation would allow mitigating cognitive deficits in in AD. The goal of this study
is to examine to what extent a frontal cognitive control circuit and associated network is vulnerable to early AD
pathology. A recent study in mice demonstrated that frontal-sensory projections from anterior cingulate area
(ACA) to visual cortex (VIS) (ACAvis) plays a causal role in cognitive control by improving attention especially
after errors. In this study, we will analyze APP knock-in (KI) mice, which expresses mutant human APP under
the endogenous mouse promoter while avoiding overexpression-associated artifacts, and test a hypothesis that
AD-related amyloid pathology disrupts top-down frontal-sensory projection (Aim1) and frontal cholinergic
neuromodulation (Aim2), and that the interaction between these systems contributes to cognitive control deficit
(Aim3). To test this hypothesis, we will apply circuit specific approaches to monitor and manipulate neural activity
in ACAvis projection neurons and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons during free moving cognitive control task
using five choice serial reaction time task in APP KI mice."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of genetic signals associated with common, complex diseases and quantitative traits. However, at most signals, the specific variants and genes, their directions of effect, their cell types of action, and their mechanisms remain to be determined. Subcutaneous adipose tissue buffers lipid energy balance and may protect from metabolic risk. Previously, our analyses of bulk subcutaneous adipose tissue from Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study participants identified local expression and splice quantitative trait loci (eQTL, sQTL) colocalized with GWAS signals to suggest new candidate genes; our collaborative eQTL studies based on >2,200 participants identified >1,800 candidate target genes for metabolic traits; and our assays of chromatin accessibility in adipose tissue and differentiating adipocytes identified regulatory elements. However, relatively few regulatory effects have been validated. A more thorough understanding of regulatory mechanisms is needed, including detection and functional characterization of noncoding variants, their target genes, and cell types of action. Our overarching goal is to identify the variants, genes, and mechanisms responsible for metabolic trait GWAS signals. We hypothesize that characterizing regulatory variants in cell types from a disease-relevant tissue will reveal genes and mechanisms that alter metabolic traits. 
In the next phase of this study, we will expand identification and functional characterization of regulatory variants for metabolic traits. We will detect allelic differences in adipose cell-type gene expression that colocalize with and mediate variant effects on metabolic trait GWAS signals. At GWAS signals that colocalize with adipose or cell-type eQTL, we will use high-throughput assays to identify regulatory variants that exhibit allelic effects on transcriptional activity in adipose cell types. We will validate variant links to target genes by altering the variant-containing regulatory elements and assaying effects on expression, and for selected genes, we will use cell assays to determine functions. Excellent human tissue resources, innovations in development of high-throughput assays and genome editing, and advanced analytical methods make this project timely and feasible. Together, this study will identify functional variants, genes, and relevant cell types at metabolic trait GWAS signals. While identification of new GWAS signals continues to progress, translating associated variants into underlying genes remains challenging, and this combination of approaches provides a new opportunity to specify which genes, variants, and mechanisms are involved in disease risk. Better understanding of these factors and mechanisms may lead to improved diagnoses and treatments for obesity, T2D, and metabolic syndrome."
10905719,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The supraspinal connectome refers to the full set of neurons that reside in the brain and project axons to the
spinal cord. The sheer complexity of this connectome, both anatomical and functional, has presented stubborn
challenges to understanding and treating the highly variable disruption that accompanies spinal injury.
Anatomically, the wide distribution of the cell bodies has made it very difficult to trace and quantify all populations
simultaneously, leading most studies to focus on just one or several main supraspinal cell types. Functionally,
descending control is distributed across multiple populations with outputs that can be complementary,
antagonistic, or potentially compensatory after injury. These functional relationships strongly affect outcomes
after spinal injury but are difficult to capture in single- or several-tract approaches. This project aims to advance
the field though an approach that yields a comprehensive understanding of spinal injury at a whole-connectome
level and by providing new viral tools to selectively manipulate subtypes of brain-spinal neurons. First, we will
use 3D whole-brain and -spinal imaging to visualize and precisely quantify the number and activity level of spared
neurons in all supraspinal cell types across cohorts of animals that receive graded contusion injuries, while
simultaneously measuring both spontaneous and rehabilitation-induced recovery of function. With whole-brain
data and advanced statistical techniques we can take advantage of the natural variability between individual
animals to identify the elements of the connectome that are most predictive of recovery. Next, we will
systematically test these predicted functional relationships by targeted, reversible chemogenetic silencing of
selected supraspinal populations before injury, after injury, and after rehabilitation. Importantly, these silencing
experiments will employ both direct targeting of brain regions and newly developed viral tools that enable
selective manipulation of defined subtypes of spinally projecting neurons. Collectively, these connectome-level
data and new subtype-specific tools are needed to 1) help resolve lurking variability that currently challenges the
field, 2) provide a comprehensive, rational framework that prioritizes interest in the full sets of supraspinal
populations of highest relevance to functional recovery, and 3) provide a pipeline and data resources that extracts
maximal, brain-wide information from pre-clinical models of spinal injury to more fully align them with the complex
needs of individuals living with SCI."
10907628,"Project Summary – Research Project 
The mechanisms underlying Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs) remain largely 
unknown. A substantial number of individuals with IDDs have developmental brain 
malformations which are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This proposal 
focuses on a newly identified IDD condition (MCTT syndrome), characterized by IDD, epilepsy, 
characteristic craniofacial differences, and two important brain malformations: polymicrogyria 
(PMG) and rhombencephalosynapsis (RES). PMG is a common feature in many IDDs and is 
strongly associated with developmental disability and epilepsy. Although PMG is known to be 
due to aberrant neuronal migration, the causes and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely 
understood, and few good animal models exist. RES is a unique cerebellar malformation 
characterized by fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres with partial or complete absence of a 
recognizable cerebellar vermis; almost nothing is known about the causes and mechanisms 
underlying RES, and no animal models exist. This project represents a synergistic collaboration 
between human and mouse model-focused investigators with support from three IDDRC Cores 
(Genetics, Brain Imaging, and Animal Behavior). At the completion of this project, we will 
understand the effects of C-terminal truncating MN1 variants on gene regulation and brain 
development. Our specific aims are: 1. To dissect the role of MN1 in transcriptional regulation 
using stem cell derived models; 2. To dissect the developmental mechanisms underlying MN1- 
related PMG and RES in mice."
10907629,"PROJECT SUMMARY – GENETICS CORE
The Genetics Core is designed to integrate cutting-edge genomic technologies into the research
programs of investigators, to enhance the understanding of Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities (IDD) and develop future treatments. The translational mission of our IDDRC
includes supporting research aimed at identifying genetic causes of IDDs that will inform
prognostic information, recurrence risk counseling, monitoring for associated medical
complications, and supportive treatments. Further, we facilitate efforts to characterize
epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic responses to environmental and genetic insults
involved in IDD pathogenesis using patient derived and genome-edited cellular and animal
models. Our translational mission has engendered the development of highly interactive service
components that both inform and enable these goals. The aims of the Core are to provide
support for: 1. IDD gene discovery through human subjects protocol development and IRB
approval, participant recruitment, consent, enrollment and sample collection (blood, saliva, skin,
urine), and targeted, exome, and genome sequencing for initial discovery and validation in large
cohorts; 2. Functional genomics of IDD biological mechanisms through expression arrays and
RNA-sequencing, chromatin structure and functional assays, proteomics and metabolomics,
and bulk and single cell analyses; and 3. Cell and animal models through genome engineering
to create cellular and animal models and evaluate phenotypes, iPSC creation, and
differentiation protocols for nervous system cell types and organoids."

The offeror proposes to complete IND-enabling safety toxicology studies of BBT-059, manufacture a GMP lot of BBT-059, and write and submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin testing BBT-059 in humans."
11121706,"The goal of the Adjuvant Comparison and Characterization (ACC) program is to support side-by-side comparison of adjuvants in combination with clinically relevant vaccine/antigen platforms, and to establish both systemic and tissue-specific immunological profiles (“immune fingerprints”) of adjuvants that work through different mechanisms and have potential for a given antigen and/or disease target. Contractors supported through the ACC program will be expected to: 1) collaborate with each other, including using standardized protocols or endpoint assays; 2) screen additional adjuvants at the direction of NIAID; and 3) share both positive and negative results in order to help guide basic research and vaccine development activities within the program and across the broader scientific community. In addition, data generated from ACC-supported studies will be made publicly available, enabling the rational selection of adjuvants and the future development of more effective vaccines against infectious diseases, and/or new vaccines to treat allergic or autoimmune diseases."
10934970,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Among the 5+ million Medicare beneficiaries living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD),
one-quarter are dually enrolled in Medicaid. Medicaid is a needs-based insurance program that covers long-
term services and supports and Medicare out-of-pocket costs. Almost one third of low-income older adults who
join Medicaid lose Medicaid coverage within a year. Even though older adults may remain eligible for Medicaid,
failing to complete complicated eligibility redetermination paperwork can lead to loss of benefits. However,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary federal policy guaranteed continuous Medicaid coverage by
suspending disenrollments due to Medicaid redeterminations. The end of this protection in 2023 put 1+ million
Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD at risk for losing Medicaid coverage. Even though Medicaid is the
nation's primary source of financial assistance with health care and long-term care costs, there is limited
evidence on how losing Medicaid coverage affects people living with ADRD and their health outcomes. This
gap in knowledge is concerning given the projected increase in the number of people living with ADRD, a large
proportion of whom will qualify for Medicaid. The long-term goal of our research is to improve access to care
and services for low-income older adults living with dementia. The objective of this project is to identify
predictors of retaining Medicaid coverage for people living with ADRD and to learn how federal Medicaid policy
changes affected the health of people living with ADRD. Our central hypotheses are that 1) losing Medicaid
coverage will be more common for people living with ADRD and will vary by residential setting; and 2) federal
policy changes that temporarily guaranteed Medicaid continuous coverage improved health outcomes for
people living with ADRD. We will test these hypotheses through three aims that employ mixed methods and
strong quasi-experimental research techniques: 1) Describe how Medicaid retention differs for older adults with
an ADRD diagnosis across settings; 2) Estimate the effect of retaining Medicaid coverage among older adults
with ADRD on health outcomes; 3) Estimate the effect of ending Medicaid continuous coverage policies among
older adults with ADRD on health outcomes. The findings from this research will inform policymakers and
community organizations' decision-making around the ways to increase Medicaid participation and ensure
optimal health outcomes for people living ADRD. Further, this research aligns with a top research priority
identified by the National Academy of Medicine to improve quality of life for people with ADRD by reducing
financial stressors and enabling access to key services. Specifically, the findings from this work will provide
novel evidence on the effects of Medicaid participation and its role in supporting access to long-term care
services and medical care among people with ADRD."
10934971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An increasing proportion of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA), representing half
of enrollees in 2023. Until recently, the Medicare Hospice Benefit was carved out of the MA program, so MA
enrollees who needed hospice would receive that care through traditional Medicare. As of 2021, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) started testing the inclusion of the Medicare Hospice Benefit through
the MA's Value-Based Insurance Design (VBID) Model. By 2023, 119 MA organizations were participating in
the Hospice Benefit Component across 806 counties. Also referred to as the MA hospice “carve-in”, this
constitutes a major change for the MA programs and the implications are not yet known. While the MA carve-in
will likely impact all beneficiaries, especially in areas with high MA penetration, there are particular concerns for
the quality of end-of-life care among vulnerable groups such as decedents with Alzheimer's disease and
related dementia (ADRD). Prior work has found that these beneficiaries are more likely to disenroll from
hospice after long enrollment periods than those without this diagnosis. If we are to improve the quality of end-
of-life care provided to Medicare beneficiaries with dementia, there is a critical need to assess the impact of the
MA hospice carve-in on end-of-life care outcomes. Our long-term goal is to improve the quality of end-of-life
care provided to persons with dementia. The overall objective of this application is to explore the
implementation of the hospice carve-in and assess its impact on various aspects of care delivery and end-of-
life care outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that the hospice carve-in represents a profound change in
incentives for providers and may worsen end-of-life care outcomes among beneficiaries with dementia. We
plan to accomplish the overall research objective by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) explore how MA
organizations and hospice providers have adapted to the MA hospice carve-in by gathering primary qualitative
data from carefully selected informants from specific markets, 2) determine the effect of being enrolled in an
MA plan participating in the VBID Hospice Benefit Component on end-of-life care outcomes for Medicare
beneficiaries with dementia, and finally 3) examine heterogeneity in the impact of the MA hospice carve-in on
hospice utilization and other indicators of quality of end-of-life care among MA beneficiaries with ADRD across
different cohorts of health care users, racial/ethnic groups, and MA plan and market characteristics. The
expected outcomes from this proposal include a stronger evidence base to inform policy decisions and
oversight of the MA Hospice Benefit Component, including a better understanding of national variation in how
MA organizations have been adapting to this new care model."
10934972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are increasingly opting to remain in the
community, resulting in a heightened reliance on Medicare's skilled home health care services. About a third of
all home health recipients have ADRD, highlighting the significance of ADRD within the home health sector. The
implementation of the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) on January 1, 2020, represents a significant
alteration in the reimbursement landscape for Medicare-certified home health agencies. In contrast to the prior
volume-driven payment system which incentivized home health agencies to overprovide therapy, the PDGM now
pays home health agencies based on patient characteristics at admission. With the PDGM came several
significant modifications including: halving episodes of care from 60 to 30 days, reducing the payment rate after
the initial 30 days, and diminishing reimbursement rates for community-initiated services. Our research team has
previously shown that persons with ADRD use home health care in systematically different ways than persons
without ADRD, including requiring longer episodes of care and being more likely to use community-initiated care
(vs. post-acute care). As such, it is critical to understand how this significant payment model change will impact
home health services for people with ADRD.
This study seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by exploring the impact of the PDGM on home health care access
and quality for patients with ADRD, pinpointing factors influencing patient outcome disparities, and capturing
stakeholder perspectives within the PDGM framework. Our guiding hypothesis is that the PDGM, while designed
to enhance home health care delivery for the broader populace, might inadvertently adversely impact care and
outcomes for people with ADRD. To delve into this hypothesis, we propose a mixed-methods study. We will
employ a dynamic difference-in-difference analytical model, leveraging Medicare claims and related
administrative datasets, to estimate the differential impacts of the PDGM on patients with vs. without ADRD.
Simultaneously, we will use qualitative data to garner in-depth insights from a range of home health care
providers, shedding light on their experiences, challenges, and adaptive strategies within the PDGM context. In
summation, this study will offer the first comprehensive, national evaluation of the PDGM's impact on home
health care delivery and key outcomes (mortality, hospitalizations, change in function), specifically focusing on
people with ADRD. The findings are expected to equip patients, caregivers, home health agencies, and
policymakers with robust empirical evidence to guide informed decisions within the evolving home health care
environment."
10936035,"ABSTRACT. Over 5.4 million people worldwide have Down syndrome (DS), which is caused by trisomy of
chromosome 21 (Chr21). Emerging DS studies demonstrate that Chr21 trisomy is associated with the
overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The pathogenic alteration of APP cleavage positively
correlates with the accumulation of Amyloid betta 40/42 (Aβ40/42) peptides, the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), in most aged individuals with DS. In addition, it was also reported that patients with DS demonstrate
elevated oral bacterial dysbiosis and periodontitis. However, our knowledge about the influence of virulent factors
produced by P. gingivalis on AD in individuals with DS remains limited. Therefore, studies proposed in the
Administrative supplement will investigate novel pathogenic host-bacterial interaction in experimental models of
DS, of which age-associated AD pathogenic amyloidogenesis emerges with PGDHC. In addition, this study will
help PI to establish novel collaborative relationships with AD- and DS-established investigators. We recently
reported that a structurally unique P. gingivalis-derived isoC17:0-dihydroceramide-1-phosphoglycerol (PGDHC)
exacerbates bone loss in experimental models of inflammatory osteolysis. Furthermore, our group also
demonstrated that PGDHC enters the circulation as well as accumulates in the brain and elevates the production
of Aβ. Using the parent K02 award, we generated new preliminary data demonstrating that 1) PGDHC is elevated
age-associated periodontitis in wild-type mice; 2) PGDHC is frequently detected in post-mortem AD brains; 3)
PGDHC-mediated periodontitis exacerbates Aβ42 accumulation in the brain of AD-like mice. We hypothesize
that within the context of DS, a novel class of PGDHC produced by the critical periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis
is engaged in pathogenic age-associated amyloidogenesis of APP. Our unique expertise in oral pathology, DS
and AD demonstrates that we are ideally suited to test this hypothesis. We will elucidate the effects of PGDHC-
mediated periodontitis on pathogenic amyloidogenic processing of APP and accumulation of Aβ in the mouse
brain of DS mice, e.g. Ts65Dn, Dp1Yey, and corresponding wild-type control mice (both sexes). To further
identify DS-associated molecular mechanisms of amyloid pathology in response to PGDHC, collected mouse
brains will be analyzed by GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler. Proposed studies will provide critical information on
whether unique PGDHC exacerbates pathogenic amyloidogenesis of APP using experimental models of DS.
This study is also expected to lay the foundation for future NIH applications, e.g., R01-INCLUDE and K99/R00
to promote diversity. Altogether, proposed emerging study meets the Component 1 scope of the INCLUDE:
Targeted high-risk - high-reward basic science studies in areas highly relevant to Down syndrome and only
achieved by the additional funding from an administrative supplement to the parent K02 award."
10918922,"SUMMARY
Health inequities pose serious threats to people in minority groups through exposure to greater
socioeconomic risks and less access to healthcare. The economic burden of these inequities is estimated
in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Many people in minority groups do not know that they have diabetes,
but even among those who are aware of their diabetes, the lack of compliance with recommended annual
foot exams is well documented. A shortage of providers—from nurses to specialists—also creates barriers
to preventative care and treatment, especially in rural areas. Yet research has shown that screening
contributes to better medical and economic outcomes.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common comorbidity of diabetes, but a lack of standard
screening protocols is an unmet need in resource limited settings, and no single tool objectively measures
the symptoms of DPN.
Drawing from our experience in developing and commercializing diabetes-related screening technologies,
we will create an accurate, comprehensive, and integrated system for the quantitative detection of DPN.
This system will integrate a low-cost smartphone with thermal-imaging capabilities and an AI decision
support system for use in primary-care settings, as well as mobile screening and outreach programs. DPN-
Doc will combine thermal results with other critical information from a patient’s clinical exam and medical
record to give the provider a recommendation for further care.
Aim 1 – Identify a portable thermal imaging device. We will select a commercial, off-the-shelf mobile
phone–based thermal imager that meets our cost and performance requirements.
Aim 2 – Develop an AI classifier and test a smartphone-based user interface. Using our database of cases
containing both thermal and clinical data gathered during standard diabetic foot exams, we will develop
a classifier able to integrate a variety of data points and produce a recommendation for DPN care. We will
incorporate this classifier into our smartphone-based thermal imaging system and test the effectiveness
of the new device as compared with standard diagnostic tests for DPN.
Aim 3 – Create educational materials that emphasize the importance of continuous foot care and
periodic foot exams. In collaboration with graphic artists and medical experts, we will develop highly
visual, bilingual (Spanish/English) educational materials in the form of a comic book or fotonovela, a
technique we have used previously to address lack of adherence to eyecare screenings.
Aim 4 – Evaluate user experience of smartphone-based device. We will evaluate our smartphone-based
system and educational materials among 10 potential users who work with underserved populations to
gather their feedback on ease of use and communicability."
10918866,"Digital therapeutics are transforming healthcare. Digital therapeutics are clinical-grade software used
to prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease. A large body of research demonstrates that digital
therapeutics can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and health outcomes. For example, in
our work, digital therapeutics for substance use disorders (SUDs) more than double drug abstinence rates
compared to standard addiction treatment systems in the U.S. and greatly increase retention in SUD treatment.
They also have synergistic effects with medication treatments for SUDs. And, they are associated with marked
reductions in ED visits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.
Despite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of digital
therapeutics to improve people’s lives across the globe. First, the pace at which digital therapeutics are
developed, tested and commercialized is slow. Second, many development activities are redundant across
projects. Third, due to budget, time and capacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of digital
therapeutics that can be used in research trials but which are not built to scale for use by large numbers of end
users. Finally, most digital therapeutics cannot be readily adapted for use by various target populations critical
for advancing digital health equity (e.g., adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).
 Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing digital
therapeutics, we have developed a unique digital therapeutics platform (Laddr) which integrates science-
based, therapeutic processes to address a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform.
This platform offers the potential to revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering
digital therapeutics to treat any disorder with a behavioral component. We now plan to make an editable
version of Laddr (which we call Cogito) commercially available to developers of digital therapeutics. Cogito will
provide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating, deploying, and scaling digital therapeutics for the
prevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a drag and drop interface with no
programming necessary.
 In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its
commercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting digital therapeutics. And we will assess
the feasibility, technical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito digital therapeutics platform via usability
testing with clinical researchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the field of SUD
treatment in this initial phase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the
prevention, treatment, or management of various health conditions in future iterations of this work. Overall,
Cogito offers great promise to markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based digital therapeutics."
10919097,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the U.S. over 5 million people are living with paralysis at an annual cost of over $200B to the healthcare
industry, over half of which is due to stroke patients. It has been reported that over 25% of stroke patients
identify as “non-community walkers” and almost 66% have ongoing issues with mobility in the five years
following their stroke. The American Stroke Association recommends exercise therapy and gait training for
stroke survivors, as the inability to walk can contribute to secondary health complications such as muscular
atrophy, increased incidence of urinary tract infections, skin sores, falls, decreased bone density, presence of
muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive function, and reduced
respiratory and cardiovascular capacities. Unfortunately, adherence to clinic-based exercise programs is poor,
with up to 50% of patients stopping within 1 year, and in-patient costs for stroke rehabilitation can exceed
$70,000 annually. In addition to costs, barriers such as lack of access to rehabilitation centers, limited physical
abilities, and limitations in individualized rehabilitation plans all prevent patients from pursuing gait training.
An in-home solution for exercise therapy and gait training would eliminate many of these barriers, however the
limited options for rehabilitation devices currently on the market all have shortcomings that prevent them from
meeting clinical needs. Exoskeletons are incredibly expensive, don’t offer body weight support to prevent falls
during use, typically require 1-2 assistants for use, and don’t offer high volume gait training. Exoskeletons
instead serve as mobility aids, rather than systems for exercise therapy or gait training. Treadmill and track
systems share many of the same shortcomings. A system that offers overhead support for fall prevention is
prohibitively large and expensive for home use, and 2-4 clinicians are required to facilitate manual ambulation
of the patient’s legs. Additional device offerings such as ellipticals, FES bikes, etc do not provide any body
weight support and thus are only meant for exercise, rather than high-dose gait training.
At Healing Innovations we are developing a novel device whose value proposition is providing high-intensity
gait training in the home to improve patient outcomes. Our Rise&Walk InHome (RWH) brings the benefits of
clinical gait training to the home setting. The RWH offers body weight support during the sit-to-stand transition,
as well as during therapy. The innovative motor and linkage system provides assisted gait training to guide the
patient’s arms and legs during use. All of this is combined with an online platform to foster community
engagement and allow customized therapy plans. Finally, this system is a fraction of the cost of clinical
devices. Through this proposal we will finalize our device and software design through iterative development
before testing the device in a pilot clinical trial to demonstrate its safety and efficacy during home use. We
anticipate a large market for this device among stroke patients, and in the future we plan to rapidly expand into
spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury markets as well."
10929340,"Hydrocephalus primarily affects infants under one year of age. The traditional treatment for hydrocephalus is
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt. Life-time complications of CSF shunts are high and expensive, with annual
hospital charges of nearly $2.0 billion, accounting for 3.1% of all pediatric hospital charges. As shunt
complications also adversely impact quality of life, it is not surprising that surveys of families affected by
hydrocephalus show that they desperately desire shunt-free treatment options. The most promising shunt-free
treatment for infant hydrocephalus is endoscopic third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization
(ETV+CPC), which our Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) and others have shown to be safe
and viable. However, the cognitive outcome of ETV+CPC compared to shunt is not known. Our data suggest
that most families would accept the risks of ETV+CPC for the chance to be free of shunt, but only if initial
treatment with ETV+CPC will not lead to noticeable sacrifice in cognitive outcome compared to shunting. With
this U01 proposal, we aim: 1. To determine, in infants ≤12 months corrected age, with hydrocephalus requiring
treatment at tertiary care pediatric neurosurgery centers in North America, does ETV+CPC compared to shunt
result in non-inferior cognitive outcome at 12 months from surgery, as measured by Bayley Scales of Infant and
Toddler Development (Bayley-III) Cognitive Scale with a non-inferiority margin of 1.5. 2a. To determine, in
the same cohort, if ETV+CPC compared to shunt results in non-inferior Bayley-III Motor/Language Scales or
Vineland-3 Scales. 2b. To compare other measures of treatment performance (brain/ventricle volume,
treatment failure, hospital days, repeat surgery, use of imaging) and complications between treatment arms.
3a. To determine the effect of ETV+CPC and shunt on cerebral structural connectivity, with diffusion MR
fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum 12 months after surgery. 3b. To define the relationships
between pre-operative brain/ventricular volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NCAM-1 level to post-operative
corpus callosum FA and Bayley-III Cognitive Scale 12 months after surgery. 3c. To define the relationships
between change in brain/ventricular volume (pre-operatively to 12 months post-operatively) to FA in the
corpus callosum and corticospinal tract and Bayley-III Cognitive and Motor Scales 12 months post-operatively.
To do this, we plan an RCT comparing ETV+CPC and shunt in infants with hydrocephalus, within the HCRN, a
committed group of 14 leading North American pediatric neurosurgical centers with a long track-record of
successful collaborative clinical research and RCTs in hydrocephalus. Optimal cognitive outcome, the primary
concern of families, will therefore, be our primary outcome. Assessment of dMRI, a validated, non-invasive
method of measuring white matter microstructural integrity and structural connectivity in the developing
brain, will provide further insight into the developmental consequences of these 2 treatments. This RCT will
help families determine the optimal treatment of hydrocephalus for their child."
10929346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain is costly, challenging to treat, and associated with substantial impairment in physical function. Mild physical
activity such as walking is safe but engagement and adherence are problematic. IMMPACT criteria and the ICF frameworks
recommend that all chronic pain clinical trials assess and target physical function comprehensively using not only self-
report, but also performance based and ambulatory monitoring of activity (e.g., objective). No clinical trials to date have
followed these recommendations. A mind body program adapted for the unique needs of individuals with chronic
musculoskeletal pain that incorporates activity skills to help individuals increase step count using a Fitbit to provide
accountability to goals may be efficacious in improving all aspects of physical function. To begin testing these hypotheses
we completed an R34 NCCIH funded project, in which we: 1) adapted a multimodal, theory grounded mind body program
(The Relaxation Response Resilience Program; 3RP) for the unique needs of patients with chronic non-malignant,
musculoskeletal pain and to specifically target increased walking (their preferred activity) through time goals (GetActive)
or step count goals measured and reinforced by a Fitbit (GetActive-Fitbit); 2) completed an open pilot with exit interviews
of the 2 programs; and 3) conducted an RCT of the 2 programs and established single site feasibility, acceptability and
fidelity benchmarks including similar signal of improvement in physical function measurements. Directly building upon
this successful trial, we now propose a multisite pilot RCT implemented at MGH and 2 additional geographically diverse
sites (Rush and Duke) of GetActive-Fitbit (with evidence of superiority over GetActive from quantitative and qualitative
data) vs a Health Enhancement Program (HEP). We will establish: 1) multi-site fidelity to training and protocol; and 2)
multi-site feasibility and acceptability of study procedures including recruitment of sedentary individuals who benefit the
most from this program and a sample of racial and ethnic minorities that is representative of the USA (38%, 2020
numbers) .We will also refine our protocols using qualitative information from staff and participants to set the stage for a
large, multi-site efficacy RCT and subsequent implementation of GetActive-Fitbit in routine care of chronic pain patients."

Smooth Muscle Dysfunction Syndrome is a rare disease with less than 50 known cases worldwide. It is caused
by a specific genetic mutation in the ACTA2 gene that affects smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells are
found in many different organs in the body. These include the large blood vessels that carry blood around the
body (aorta), brain blood vessels, lungs, eye pupil muscles, gut, bladder and even the womb in women. The
children affected by this specific ACTA2 mutation have very complex medical problems involving many body
systems. Patients experience repeated strokes as blood vessels supplying the brain are abnormal in shape and
narrowed. As adolescents, the aorta can weaken and dissect, requiring major surgery. Some children have
need respiratory support or home oxygen. These children suffer from a severe complex disease that can result
in progressive neurological disability. Our aim is to develop a gene therapy for children with ACTA2 disease
that can treat all the different organs affected. In this proposal we will extensively characterize in vitro
ACTA2R179H smooth muscle cell function (AIM1), evaluate the neurovascular and subsequent behavioral
consequences of the ACTA2R179H mutation in a novel mouse model (AIM2), and finally use the
ACTA2R179H mouse model to study the ischemic strokes (AIM3). To investigate therapeutic options
throughout the proposal we will utilize a novel CRISPR-cas9 system with custom guide RNAs to revert (base
editing) or destroy (allele targeting) the ACTA2R179H allele, delivering the system in vitro and in vivo, and
quantitatively measuring the phenotypic consequences of gene targeting"

Protective immunity against melanoma requires two immune cell populations that form the melanoma – immunity
cycle: Dendritic cells (DCs) act as sentinels that transport melanoma antigens to draining lymph nodes where
they prime T cells, and CD8 T cells act as effector cells that identify and kill melanoma cells. The major
hypothesis of this application is that therapeutic targeting of CARM1 will enhance the function of both
cDC1 and CD8 T cells in the melanoma immunity cycle. CARM1 is an epigenetic enzyme that acts as a co-
transcriptional activator by di-methylation of specific arginine residues in histone H3 and other chromatin-
associated proteins. We identified CARM1 as a negative regulator of melanoma-infiltrating CD8 T cells using
an in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Inactivation of Carm1 in CD8 T cells enhances their proliferation and effector
function in the tumor microenvironment. We also discovered that inactivation of Carm1 in cDC1 enhances their
ability to cross-present melanoma antigens to CD8 T cells. In Aim 1, we will investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which therapeutic targeting of CARM1 inhibits T cell exhaustion. We will evaluate the available
high-affinity CARM1 inhibitor in multiple melanoma models, with an emphasis on immunotherapy resistant
models and metastatic disease. We will also use conditional knockout mice to selectively inactivate the Carm1
gene in CD8 T cells to test our hypothesis that Carm1 inactivation inhibits T cell exhaustion. We will also
investigate the relevance of CARM1 in human melanoma using co-cultures of tumor-infiltrating T cells and
autologous melanoma cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CARM1 inhibition
enhances cross-presentation of melanoma antigens by cDC1 to CD8 T cells. Preliminary data show that
conditional knockout of Carm1 in cDC1 enhances melanoma immunity and sensitizes resistant melanomas to
PD-1 blockade. We will use these conditional knockout mice to study antigen cross-presentation in vitro and in
vivo. Finally, we will identify the direct target genes regulated by CARM1 by CUT&TAG, ATAC-seq and RNA-
seq. These studies will develop a novel strategy to enhance the anti-tumor activity of both DCs and T cells in
the melanoma – immunity cycle."
10934144,"ABSTRACT
 Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction caused by antibodies (Abs) that target platelet
factor 4 (PF4) when bound to heparin (H) or other glycosaminoglycan-like polyanionic molecules. HIT usually
results in a low platelet count, but is too often associated with devastating venous and/or arterial thrombosis and
thromboembolism. While many heparin-exposed patients test positive for the presence of PF4-binding Abs, only
those with HIT have ""pathogenic"" Abs that activate platelets. The complexity of current diagnostic tests limits
their value for timely treatment decisions, which can lead to over-diagnosis of HIT. While failure to diagnose HIT
creates a significant risk of catastrophic thrombosis, equally concerning is that an erroneous diagnosis of HIT
not only prolongs hospital stay and increases costs, but also needlessly exposes a patient to treatments with
potentially serious side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need for a rapid and precise diagnostic test for HIT.
The molecular basis for the crucial functional differences between the PF4/H-binding Abs that are platelet
activating (PA) from those that are not (NA) is unknown, however, and hinders this effort. Furthermore, the
absence of monoclonal (m) Abs from actual HIT patients has also hampered our ability to dissect the
pathogenesis of HIT. We have recently achieved a breakthrough in this regard by successfully cloning 54 IgG1+
PF4/H-binding mAbs from HIT patients. Among these clones, seven demonstrated platelet-activating properties.
Notably, although the PF4/H-binding capability of both PA and NA mAbs was found to be similar, only the PA
mAbs physically bound to PF4-coated platelets. Specific Aim 1 seeks to build upon these novel findings by
further characterizing the molecular and structural biological interactions underlying the binding of platelet-
activating HIT Abs to PF4 on the surface of platelets. A thematically related subject to be addressed in Project 2
deals with the etiology of HIT, and builds on our recent observations that pre-existing B cells that produce basal
levels of PF4/H-reactive IgM Abs are constitutively present in both humans and mice. It remains unknown,
however, how these pre-existing PF4/H-specific Abs and B cells are generated, or how they might contribute to
the development of HIT. Studies in germ-free mice have linked gut microbiota to the presence of naturally
occurring PF4/H-reactive IgMs and PF4/H-specific IgGs. Specific Aim 2, therefore, will identify the specific gut
microbial species associated with the selection and development of PF4/H-specific B cells that predispose
individuals to later development of HIT. Taken together, developing a more complete understanding of the
interactions between HIT PA Abs and platelet surface antigens, coupled with elucidating the role of gut microbiota
in generating these Abs, will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of HIT, with significant implications for
diagnosing, preventing, and treating this severe acquired clinical disorder. Proposed studies will leverage shared
Core resources, with added benefits from parallel concepts and ongoing collaboration among Project and Core
leaders within this cohesive Program Project."
10922420,"Falls are a major cause of death and morbidity for older adults in the US each year, and injuries from falls leave
many older adults with a greater risk of physical and cognitive decline due to inactivity and social isolation. At
Senaptec, we have developed stroboscopic eyewear (“Strobes”) for sensory resistance training and rehabilitation
that uses liquid crystal technology to intermittently occlude visual input to promote reweighting of dependencies
on the different sensory modalities. Many independent laboratories and clinics have documented significant
improvements in motor performance and sensorimotor coordination after even brief training regimens with our
Strobes. Notably, our Strobes are particularly useful for improving balance and stability, simply by being used
during basic tasks. In an ongoing pilot study of older adults with self-reported balance deficits, we have observed
improvements in balance metrics after only 10 min/day of Strobe use for 2 weeks during standing activities of
daily living. Our Strobes were initially designed for athletic performance training, and, given the potential benefit
they could have for older adults particularly, we are now modifying their design to accommodate prescription
lenses without losing functionality and incorporating a feature that will improve their function in low-light settings,
such as in the home. While existing programs and devices for fall prevention may be effective, these options are
often community-based, require transportation, or are otherwise unavailable in convenient settings where older
adults live or receive care. Some exercise programs and devices may be applicable in the home, but those that
are difficult, not engaging, or too strenuous for this population are unlikely to be adopted for initial or lasting use.
Our Strobes, however, can be worn in the home and have shown potential to reduce fall risk simply by being
worn during brief periods of time while the user is conducting routine activities. Now, to bring Strobes to the
large population of older adults in the US, including those aging in place, we must alter their design so they are
suitable for users who require prescription lenses and for low-light settings that may be encountered in the home,
and we must conduct clinical efficacy studies that will enable FDA clearance. Thus, for this Fast-Track SBIR
project, we will modify the Strobes to fit over a broad range of prescription eyewear and to include a “low-light”
mode for improved visibility in a broader range of environmental conditions, and we will test the efficacy of Strobe
training for older adults at risk of falling, as determined by Berg Balance Scales scores <45, with a randomized
control trial. We anticipate this work will demonstrate the efficacy of balance training with Senaptec’s Strobe
eyewear for improving balance and decreasing fall risk in older adults and enable us to achieve clearance from
the FDA. Ultimately, we hope Strobes will be a highly accessible and adoptable solution for individuals wanting
to reduce their risk of falling and maintain their health and independence as they age."

Asthma is a chronic, non-communicable disease that affects 300 million children and adults worldwide. In the
United States alone, asthma burdens 26 million citizens. With the rise of global temperatures, climate change is
adding to the complexity of asthma occurrences. Changes in environmental conditions can lead to negative
downstream effects such as prolonged pollen seasons that can elevate aeroallergens. Increase in aeroallergens
are concerning due to its association to allergen-induced asthma. Asthma is a debilitating disease that has no
cure, and the severity of the disease varies person to person. Diagnosis and monitoring in children is challenging
due to an inability to follow technical instructions to perform lung functioning tests such as spirometry and their
inability to communicate symptoms. To alleviate difficulties associated with diagnosis and monitoring of asthma
treatments in children, Aquillius Corporation proposes to develop a respiratory sensor capable of real-time
continuous monitoring and measuring of pulmonary functions. Utilizing graphene nanotechnology, this innovative
device will be cost-effective, robust, and suitable for all ages. Our approach seeks to improve patient monitoring,
treatment, and diagnosis of asthma through development of innovative respiratory sensor. To reach this goal,
Aquillius will (i) Optimization of respiratory sensor’s function by utilizing a manikin lung simulator for normal and
asthma conditions; and (ii) Demonstrate the ability of GNS respiratory sensor to capture pulmonary function data
in real time. Upon the successful completion of Phase I feasibility studies, Phase II will focus on development
and refinement of the device by incorporating human test subjects with asthma. The end-user interface and
software will also be further developed. Overall, the commercialization of the respiratory sensor will greatly
improve patient care by measuring a patient’s lung function in real-time, thus helping with both accurate diagnosis
and personalized asthma treatments."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with a 50% survival rate. MM is the leading
hematological cancer in African Americans, who are diagnosed 2-3 times more commonly than whites. The
factors contributing to this disparity remain unclear, but genetics and immune dysregulation are believed to play
a key role. The scientific goals of this proposal are: (1) to apply integrative and innovative methods that leverage
genetic and transcriptomic data to elucidate biological pathways contributing to this disparity and (2) to contribute
evidence to inform future precision health efforts in this population.
 The first objective will be to identify putative causal genes associated with MM susceptibility by conducting
a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), using genetic prediction models of gene expression developed
specifically in African Americans. TWAS will be performed by imputing gene expression profiles in 1813 cases
from the African American Multiple Myeloma Study (AAMMS) and 8871 controls, the largest genome-wide
association study of MM in African Americans. The next objective will focus on white blood cell (WBC) traits,
which are important intermediate phenotypes for hematologic and immune-related cancers. The distribution and
genetic architecture of WBC traits varies substantially across ethnicities and may contribute important
information for deciphering MM risk in African Americans. The shared genetic basis of WBC variation and MM
susceptibility will be examined by conducting: (1) genome-wide genetic correlation analyses and (2) developing
genetic scores for predicting an individual’s inherited predisposition to a specific WBC profile. Genetic scores
will be applied to AAMMS data to test their association with MM, and comparative analyses of WBC-predictors
from African and European ancestry populations will be conducted. The last research component will aim to
elucidate genetic factors that are associated with specific features of MM tumors. Analyses will focus on
examining the contribution of local genetic ancestry to somatic events, such as translocations and amplifications
that are more commonly observed in African American patients. The role of genetic mechanisms involved in
gene expression or alternative splicing will also be investigated, to test the hypothesis that some tumor features
seen in African Americans are due to germline genetic effects on these processes.
 This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s strengths in cancer
and genetic epidemiology to develop new expertise in integrative and ancestry-aware genomic analyses,
hematological cancer, and cancer disparities. Novel insights into MM etiology in African Americans will be
important for improving health outcomes in this population that is disproportionately affected by MM, yet under-
represented in genetics studies. The research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful
independent career in cancer research with an interdisciplinary focus on risk stratification and cancer control."
10922374,"Roughly 60% of college students meet the criteria for at least one mental health disorder, with anxiety and 
depression being the most common diagnoses. The number of students seeking help for mental health issues 
increased by almost 40% at campus counseling centers between 2009 and 2015 and has continued to rise since 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the demand has not been proportionately matched with increased
funding to support mental health provision on college campuses. Thus, college students require a different 
approach to managing the stress that exacerbates their mental health symptoms. Technology-based breathing 
interventions for stress management, which have been shown to prevent and remediate stress, are growing in 
popularity with the rise of commercially available mobile apps and bio-feedback technologies that do not require 
the help of a professional. However, while such mHealth interventions are now widely available, they often fail 
because they do not lend themselves to use in real-world settings. Most technology-based interventions require 
the use of mobile phones ─ a disruptive and often unwelcome behavior in most educational settings. Existing 
biofeedback devices (e.g., chest straps, clip-ons, inhalers) are similarly contextually inappropriate, making use 
obvious, distracting, and potentially stigmatizing. To overcome these barriers, the PI developed the AIRpen, a
simple, affordable, multi-functional stress management device that is designed to fit into the fabric of users’ lives 
to potentially optimize the delivery, practice, and fidelity of diaphragmatic breathing (DB) interventions in realworld settings. With anecdotal and empirical evidence supporting the device as feasible and acceptable in realworld academic settings (Purdue IRB-2022-423), this Phase I STTR project proposes the following aims: Aim 1. 
Develop and refine the AIRpen intervention to enable the use of the device without oversight by a professional. 
Aim 2: Develop Smart AIRpen prototypes, which are equipped with sensors to measure user adherence in future 
real-world effectiveness studies. Aim 3: Establish the usability and acceptability of the AIRpen intervention with 
a sample of 60 college students (30 in each device group) in a laboratory setting and gather preliminary feedback 
on subject-reported stress using physiological and subjective surveys as a secondary outcome. Aim 4: Establish 
the feasibility of a future real-world research study that will evaluate the usability and acceptability of the AIRpen 
intervention when used during an exam period with a sample of 30 college students. Secondary outcome data 
utilizing subject-reported stress measures will also be collected. Results will support future larger-scale 
effectiveness trials and inform future protocol designs for scaling cost-effective and time-efficient treatments that
broadly support the development of coping skills for stress management."

In 2020, the financial burden associated with the care and treatment of individuals afflicted by Alzheimer's
disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) amounted to $305 billion for a population of 6 million
(including young onset disease), and 2050 projections indicate that the costs will quadruple while the number
affected will exceed 13 million people. ADRD and cognitive impairment (CI) disability is characterized by a
diminishing ability to learn, recall information, and make decisions and judgments, changes that threaten the
CI/ADRD individual’s autonomy and ability to live independently. Access to the internet, smart devices, and
telehealth have the potential to help people with CI/ADRD maintain independence, but current technologies
can be difficult for these adults to use. B.A. Maze Inc. has designed a technology platform, the At-home Health
Station (AHS), that is a plug-and-play modular system designed to use the circular economy to simplify the
digital experience for the CI/ADRD-user and provide caregivers/administrator (AC) the ability to set unique
prompted health reminders via a secure multi-device management AHS-Webapp. The AHS system will ensure
consistent access to basic health measurements through remote patient monitoring (RPM) to promote health
function and independence. Our goal is to develop appropriate RPM and care systems to enable long-term
independence and health in people living with CI/ADRD and give caregivers a care and communication
platform for proactive health decision-making. Our objective in this Phase I project is to advance the design of
the AHS through usability testing and feedback from CI/ADRD individuals. The outcome of this development
study will be an AHS design that achieves a System Usability Scale (SUS) of ≥70 and a cognitive baseline of
usability for cognitively impaired adults aged 40+. The product of Phase I will be an AHS minimum viable
product that will be further validated and prepared for commercialization in Phase II."
10923534,"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a phenotype of osteoarthritis (OA) that is temporally linked to acute joint
injuries, such as intra-articular ligament rupture or meniscus tear (1). Service members and veterans are
disproportionally affected by extremity injuries that can lead to PTOA due to heavy load carriage, high activity
rates, insufficient recovery time, and combat trauma (10–14). Absent early intervention, acute knee injuries
induce diverse pathogenic cascades including hemarthrosis, inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis, and matrix
degradation (2). Targeting only a single aspect of these pathogenic mechanisms has proven insufficient for joint-
level chondroprotection and attenuation of PTOA. Due to the lack of regenerative capacity of cartilage and the
paucity of early intervention therapeutics, OA and PTOA have remained the leading cause of service member
disability and medical discharge over the past decade (11, 13). Current reliance on non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and physical therapy highlights an unmet need for novel solutions that attenuate,
delay, or altogether prevent PTOA following an acute knee injury. Without these solutions, the young cohort of
veterans suffering from career-ending and life-altering joint injuries will continue to grow. Therefore, our goal is
to develop an intra-articular therapeutic to control the spatial and temporal release of bioactive factors in an early
intervention setting following an acute joint injury. By establishing an early intervention therapeutic, we hope to
reduce the number of service members who develop PTOA and alleviate the physical, medical, financial, and
psychosocial burden on the veteran population (8, 9). In Aim 1, we will establish a biologic profile of the post-
injury joint microenvironment using human clinical data from veteran patients enrolled at the Corporal Michael J.
Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center (CMCVAMC) with traumatic ACL and/or meniscus tears. Through our
understanding of the pro-inflammatory biomarkers and synovial transcriptome gained from this data, we will
develop a state-of-the-art large animal model of PTOA that resembles the phenotype observed in our veteran
patients. We will extend our existing porcine model of PTOA to combine arthroscopically assisted ACL
transection (ACLT) and destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) to recapitulate an acute knee injury for
evaluation of novel, early intervention therapeutics. In Aim 2, we will develop a multi-factorial therapeutic that
addresses the spatial and temporal pathology of PTOA by precisely delivering multiple bioactive factors within
mechanically activated microcapsules (MAMCs) in a hyaluronic acid (HA) carrier. We will employ a 3D model of
PTOA using porcine osteochondral explants exposed to mechanical overload to recapitulate the aberrant
cartilage loading observed in our in vivo ACLT/DMM model. By early delivery of anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic,
and antioxidant factors, we will achieve superior chondroprotection compared to delayed treatment or delivery
of a single factor. Upon completion of the proposed Aims, we will have defined and validated a bioactive, multi-
factorial, injectable therapy to attenuate the effects of an acute knee injury and establish a clinically relevant
animal model for the future translational evaluation of this novel therapeutic approach."
10926832,"Background: Rural Veterans represent over one third of all Veterans served by the Department of Veterans
Affairs and rural America is strikingly different than urban areas with respect to the social and economic
conditions that drive health. Based on research documenting the relationship between social adversity (e.g.,
homelessness, food insecurity) and health, policy makers suggest routine screening and referral (S&R) for
unmet social and economic needs (hereafter: “unmet needs”) in the clinical setting. This call has catalyzed a
small but promising evidence base, indicating that efficacy of S&R. However, the S&R evidence base focuses
on unmet needs in urban settings. This means we lack the knowledge needed to adapt unmet need S&R for
the unique needs of rural VA settings and the rural Veterans they serve.
Significance: Our study addresses the HSR&D priorities to mitigate the unmet needs of Veterans and to
integrate heath care solutions as much as possible into existing care, rather than depending on new personnel
and resources. This study will advance these priorities by adapting the specifications of evidence-based S&R
to align with existing unmet needs and unmet need resources in rural VA settings. This study will also establish
a process for adapting S&R that can be replicated across VISNs and facilities.
Innovation and Impact: This research is highly innovative as we know of no research that is implementing
unmet need interventions for rural Veterans. We will provide novel knowledge about unmet needs among rural
Veterans, the mechanism by which these needs manifest, and the social service infrastructure within the VA
and community that serve rural Veterans. Our research is also innovative in our use of user-centered design
(UCD) methods to adapt the specifications of an S&R intervention. Specifically, throughout the process of
adapting S&R to the target local sites, we will engage and solicit feedback from the eventual end-users,
including Veterans.
Specific Aims: 1) Determine unmet needs among rural Veterans and their associations with health outcomes;
2) Assess existing systems for addressing unmet needs and adapt S&R to fit local conditions and stakeholder
preferences; 3) Pilot test the adapted intervention and develop an Adaptation Playbook.
Methodology: Guided by the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework, we propose a 3-year mixed-
methods study. We will survey rural Veterans served by VISN 1 about their unmet needs and merge survey
data with secondary VA data to assess the scope and scale of unmet needs and their associations with health
care outcomes. We will conduct qualitative interviews with key stakeholders (Veterans, VA providers and staff,
representatives of community agencies) to understand how unmet needs manifest among rural Veterans, the
existing infrastructure for identifying unmet needs and referring for services, and opportunities and preferences
for adapting S&R. We will use the information gathered from these interviews and UCD methods to adapt the
specifications of S&R. Finally, we will pilot the adapted S&R intervention, refine as needed, and develop an
Adaptation Playbook detailing how other facilities can adapt S&R to their local conditions.
Next Steps/Implementation: Upon completion of the IIR, we will have moved through the first two of four REP
phases (pre-conditions and pre-implementation). By doing so, we will understand the key components
necessary for REP phases three and four, which will be the focus of future work (full-scale implementation of
the adapted S&R intervention and evaluation) in on-going collaboration with our operational partners the New
England Veterans Integrated Service Network, Office of Rural Health and Office of Social Work."
10921984,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating disease that affects millions of Americans and imposes a huge socio-
economic burden. AD-related cognitive decline is associated with the accumulation of Amyloid plaques and tau
tangles, which are insufficiently cleared by brain clearance pathways. Perivascular space (PVS) clearance health
plays a substantial role in the net clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. Human magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) studies have shown that the integrity of the PVS, is a marker of brain clearance health and its
alteration is an important feature of AD pathology. Another important clinical relevance of PVS in AD has been
emerged by the introduction of the first classes of amyloid clearing treatments (e.g., Biogen:Aduhelm or
Eisai:Lecanemab). Alzheimer’s patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy comorbidity have high likelihood of
manifesting an adverse event called, amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). PVS is a diagnostic criterion
for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (based on BOSTON criteria 2.0). AD patients are required to go through MRI
before and during the treatment for ARIA monitoring and PVS assessment is an integral part of the monitoring.
PVS integrity is therefore an important clinical feature in Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Hence, a
tool that allows non-invasive in-vivo mapping of PVS from clinical MRI is of high significance to aid AD diagnosis
and disease monitoring. Such tool, however, does not exist. Current clinical routine to investigate PVS is based
on counting total number of observed PVS in MRI by neuro-radiologists, which is non-specific, rater-dependent,
and does not capture the distribution, whole extent of PVS change nor volumetric features of the PVS. In practice,
this technique is time consuming and laborious. These limitations in part have prevented neurologists from
adopting PVS quantification into their clinical routine. NeuroScope has developed computational techniques for
mapping and quantifying PVS morphology from MRI, which enables automated and accurate quantification of
PVS across the brain without the need for time consuming manual intervention. NeuroScope tools were clinically
and technically validated (Phase-I-STTR deliverables), with >99.8% test-retest reliability, sensitivity, and
specificity of >98% and >93%, respectively. Our patent application on our tools was also submitted in Feb 2021
and their executable stable version have been implemented on our cloud server. NeuroScope is now ready to
build the commercial ecosystem that enables interaction with potential customers. The goal of this proposal is to
develop the IT infrastructure required to commercialize our PVS mapping technologies and to submit FDA 510(K)
application. Our main customers are pharmaceutical companies and hospital radiology sectors. The IT
infrastructure is required to provide service in clinical trials and the FDA approval is required to expand our
market domain to clinical diagnostics. NeuroScope has identified potential customers and have already made
significant progress. Several industry leading companies shown interest in our technology."

Global Cerebral Ischemia (GCI) afflicts over 700,000 Americans each year and often results in permanent
cognitive impairment or death. Here, we will complete IND-enabling studies for a therapeutic strategy for GCI.
Our optimized peptide inhibitor of CaMKII, tatCN19o, shows effective and potent neuroprotection in animal
models of GCI that closely mimic the most relevant human conditions: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after
cardiac arrest in mice or after ventricular fibrillation in pigs. When our CaMKII inhibitors were injected i.v. at a
clinically relevant timepoint after GCI, they provided dramatic improvement over therapeutic hypothermia alone
(the current standard of care); after combination with therapeutic hypothermia, only residual and barely
detectable neuronal cell death was seen. Neuroprotection manifested on the anatomical, synaptic, and
behavioral level. Target validation has been done using mutant mice with impaired CaMKII signaling. Target
engagement has been characterized by biochemical and structural studies. This current lead compound has
been optimized for potency (ki of 0.1 nM) and selectivity (>100,000x compared to the most closely related
kinases). Intellectual property protection for tatCN19o is in place. The tatCN19o peptide is a tight-binding active
kinase inhibitor that only engages the CaMKII fraction that remains hyperactivated after ischemic insult. These
features enable optimal efficacy at an extremely low dose (0.01 mg/kg i.v.). TatCN19o is a cell- and blood-brain-
barrier –penetrating 30mer peptide that is readily soluble in water or saline and highly stable in lyophilized or
solubilized formulation (to be further characterized here). Current data suggest a favorable safety profile (also to
be further characterized here), including lack effects on memory. These characteristics enable straightforward
preparation of an injectable for clinical use in humans. Notably, tatCN19o inhibits rodent and human CaMKII
equally well. Phase I of this project achieved the proposed key preclinical milestones for tatCN19o, including:
characterize binding kinetics of dissociation from target, establish a quantitative method for detection in plasma,
and evaluate pharmacokinetics in safety species. To enable testing in humans, this SBIR project will conduct
studies required for a successful IND application, including (1) an in vivo extension of our in vitro characterization
from Phase I, (2) formulation development, (3) pivotal safety studies, and (4) regulatory document preparation.
The results of this proposal will serve as critical components of an IND application to the FDA, in preparation for
a Phase I clinical trial and ultimately commercialization. Our Pre-IND meeting is planned for the end of year 1.
The clinical/market potential for tatCN19o as a GCI therapeutic is detailed in the Commercialization Plan."

A number of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting highly conserved and vulnerable
epitope regions of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) are being investigated for a range of clinical applications
based on their ability to robustly prevent infection in a variety of animal models. Successful monoclonal
antibody (mAb) prophylaxis aims to offer an alternative to vaccine development efforts, and the relatively long
half-lives and tolerability profiles of bNAbs promise to offer a complement to the small-molecule inhibitors
comprising current pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options.
While bNAbs represent a promising approach to provide protection from infection, suppress plasma and tissue
viremia, and reduce viral reservoirs, results from the first major bNAb prevention efficacy trial were mixed.
Protection against infection with neutralization susceptible strains was observed, but fewer strains were
sufficiently susceptible than anticipated, and overall efficacy criteria were not met.
Our objective is to define and refine the means by which bNAbs can be used to restrict HIV replication in vivo
using a more stringent model in which their ability to delay or prevent systemic viremia in the context of seeded
HIV infection is monitored. We hypothesize that the antiviral activity afforded by a single bNAb can be
enhanced by one or more of two distinct strategies that will be rigorously tested for in vivo antiviral activity by
benchmarking their ability to delay detectable plasma viremia in the context of spreading infection. Guided by
strong preliminary data, the project goals will be achieved though completion of two Specific Aims: 1) Define
the ability of Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity across diverse envelope epitopes, 2) Define the
ability of bNAb combinations, with and without Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity. Each strategy
will be evaluated for effects on neutralization and effector function in vitro and in vivo for the ability to delay or
prevent systemic viremia.
Collectively, these studies will generate unprecedented insights into the means whereby bNAbs, if introduced in
early infection after mucosal exposure, delay or restrict viral spread thereby lowering the viral burden and
improving outcomes. This work will inform on both next-generation rational vaccine design and the ongoing
deployment of bNAb prophylaxis and therapy—driving innovation relevant to combatting HIV acquisition and
transmission across diverse intervention strategies and populations."
10925199,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal cancer that is resistant to
currently available therapies. Notably, we discovered that PDACs are exquisitely susceptible to a range of
therapies directed at RNA splicing. However, it is unknown how alterations in RNA splicing drive PDAC
tumorigenesis or impact therapeutic responses. Thus, identification of the role of aberrant RNA splicing in
PDAC tumorigenesis could reveal novel therapeutic targets for PDAC. Our long-term goal is to identify,
design, and test novel mechanistic-based targeted therapies for highly aggressive tumors such as PDAC. The
main objective of this proposal is to characterize the role of RNA splicing factor mutations in PDAC
pathogenesis and treatment response. Recently, we identified that the most common gain-of-function driver
mutations found in 50% of PDACs (mutant KRAS and p53) synergize and cooperate through altered RNA
splicing. While >90% of PDAC cases harbor mutant KRAS, only 50% co-occur with mutant p53. We
performed mutual exclusivity analysis among hundreds of annotated mutations in PDACs and identified two
mutant splicing factors, SF3B1 and RBM10, that co-occur with mutant KRAS but do not co-occur with mutant
p53 and are mutually exclusive between each other. Additionally, our proof-of-concept studies using newly
generated genetically engineered mouse models, oligo-therapy and RNA splicing inhibitors demonstrated that
RNA splicing is a therapeutic target. Our central hypothesis is that persistent RNA splicing defects,
downstream of SF3B1 and RBM10 mutations, are a required adaptive mechanism for KRAS-mediated
tumorigenicity and represent a therapeutic target for PDAC. We aim to 1) determine the role of aberrant RNA
splicing in PDAC tumorigenesis, 2) identify the function and correct RNA splicing defects in pancreatic
cancer, and 3) evaluate the impact of mutant RNA splicing factors on the therapeutic efficacy of spliceosome
inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents. Our expected outcomes include identification of 1) how aberrant
RNA splicing underlies major cancer-driving events, 2) novel therapeutic targets for our newly generated
oligo-therapy or small molecule inhibitors, and 3) a previously overlooked mechanism for how cancer can
evolve through multiple mutations converging at a common mechanistic function. We will use innovative
newly generated genetically engineered mouse models co-expressing KRAS and splicing-factor mutations in
the pancreas leading to autochthonous PDAC resembling patient tumors, and we will employ novel
computational and genetic biotechnologies to identify and correct RNA splicing defects. These results will
uncover a fundamental, yet novel non-mutational mechanism required for PDAC pathogenesis: altered RNA
splicing. This will provide a strong basis for future approaches to treat PDAC, which would significantly impact
personalized therapies and patient outcomes. This research directly aligns with NCI’s mission to advance
scientific knowledge of drivers and targets of cancer to improve patient’s lives."
10923291,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was diagnosed in 30,635 people in the U.S. in 2020, with about half
of people with HIV (PWH) retained in care. HIV health outcomes are impacted by the circumstances in
which a person lives and the wider set of social forces that shape a person’s life known as social determinants
of health (SDH). Providers can supplement missing or coarsely defined SDH data from structured electronic
health record (EHR) sources with clinical notes. Indigenous, specifically American Indian and Alaska Native
(AN/AN), PWH have unique histories and sociopolitical conditions that contributes to SDH factors not captured
by generic SDH categories. However, culturally congruent Indigenous SDH (ISDH) are not well
understood in terms of 1) categorical definitions, 2) discussion in clinical notes, and 3) their predictive power
for HIV outcome modeling. In this K99/R00 application, we propose building community collaborations and
leveraging EHR data to elucidate how ISDH are defined and can be deployed within the clinical setting. In the
K99 phase, we will collaboratively define ISDH with AI/AN PWH through qualitative interviews. In the R00
phase, we will use natural language processing to extract ISDH from clinical notes and measure their
predictive power for modeling health outcomes such as retention in care and future risk of HIV. Our specific
aims are: (1) describe ISDH through collaborations with AI/AN PWH (n=20) and health organizations; (2)
identify ISDH in clinical notes AI/AN patients (n=30,097); and (3) measure the predictive power of ISDH with
HIV health outcomes for AI/AN PWH (n=199) and AI/AN patients at risk for HIV (n=359). The training
objectives of this project include developing competencies in qualitative methods and data analysis,
community-based participatory research approaches, and building strong, reciprocal relationships with
Indigenous communities and health organizations. The long-term training goal is to support Dr. Bear Don’t
Walk to transition to faculty and build an independent research program. Dr. Bear Don’t Walk seeks to lead an
interdisciplinary team of quantitative and qualitative health researchers, clinicians, and Elders, committed to
developing analytic methods to better understand indicators, behavioral, and lifestyle characteristics, and
other causes of health disparities, with a focus on community engagement. To ensure success for the
planned research and training, a multidisciplinary mentorship team with a breadth of expertise, stellar
mentorship records, and established, well-funded research programs will advise Dr. Bear Don’t Walk.
Additionally, the research and training will be conducted at a world-renowned university and academic medical
center with exceptional community engagement resources, and biomedical informatics research expertise.
The proposed research is both significant and innovative because it elucidates ISDH from three complimentary
views on how ISDH are: 1) conceptualized and defined by Indigenous PWH, 2) understood and discussed by
clinicians in the clinical note, and 3) associated with important health outcomes for PWH in the EHR."
10921340,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: To meet the UNAIDS 95-95-95 Fast Track targets for HIV epidemic control by 2030, public
health services must prioritize strategies that support high HIV burden communities to engage in HIV testing
and follow-up services. Globally, transgender and gender diverse (TGD) communities bear a higher HIV
prevalence than general populations and face stigmatizing healthcare environments. Further, global HIV
research and programming has lacked TGD community leadership and inclusion. Partnering with TGD
communities to explore new models of service delivery is vital to make progress towards HIV epidemic control.
Study Goals and Aims: The proposed study explores how a person-centered care model can improve service
access for TGD communities to know their HIV status and benefit from tailored service packages. The study
focuses on TGD populations in Telangana and Maharashtra, India to 1) Identify profiles of HIV testing non-
engagement among TGD people; 2) Explore mechanisms which promote HIV testing among TGD people with
a person-centered care model; and 3) Generate staff-designed solutions which promote service engagement
among TGD communities implemented through a person-centered care model. This research aligns with NIMH
Division of AIDS Research priorities to advance context-appropriate interventions to increase HIV testing.
Approach: An explanatory, sequential mixed methods design will use existing data from a respondent-driven
sampling survey and will partner with three person-centered care TGD healthcare centers called Mitr clinics in
Telangana and Maharashtra, India. The study builds off work of a PEPFAR/USAID-funded program led by the
Johns Hopkins University with service delivery by Indian non-profit YRG CARE. Aim 1 will conduct latent class
analysis using quantitative survey data to identify sub-groups of TGD people with specific sets of needs around
HIV testing. Aim 2 will collect primary qualitative data through in-depth interviews with 25-35 TGD individuals to
explore how to fill HIV testing needs and priorities for services at a person-centered care model. Aim 3 will use
human-centered design workshops to understand Aim 1-2 findings from the perspective of 20-30 Mitr clinic
staff and providers to co-create strategies to improve service engagement at a person-centered care model.
Triangulating findings from Aims 1-3 will enrich scientific inquiry and produce strategies to align HIV services
with TGD community needs through a person-centered care model implemented with ease and efficiency.
Fellowship Information: The proposed study will serve as the doctoral dissertation for PhD student Rose
Pollard Kaptchuk at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The training is guided by a tailored
mentorship team with complementary expertise to support Rose in her training, facilitate successful
collaboration with Mitr clinics, and ensure effective dissemination of research findings. The training plan will
prepare Rose to become a leading independent researcher conducting mixed methods, participatory studies
advancing equity in HIV service delivery for sexual and gender minority communities."
10921696,"Most recent advances in the management of AD call for extensive use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging in order to maximize patient benefits, as reflected in Draft NIA-AA Revised Clinical Guidelines for Alzheimer’s
and multiple analyses of current and upcoming therapies. However, availability of AD PET across the country is severely
limited by the capacity of the manufacturers of short-lived radioactive contrast agents – AD PET tracers.
 Technology developed in current NIA Phase II project (R44AG071409) enables dramatic expansion of AD PET
imaging by substantially simplifying and standardizing the commercial production process for AD PET tracers. The most
complex and currently non-scalable part of the PET tracer production process is Quality Control (QC). Trace-Ability has
pioneered a radically new approach (Tracer-QC), where most of the QC tests are based on optical measurements enabled
by disposable kits containing Trace-Ability’s innovative indicators.
 Phase IIB project will take Tracer-QC technology with commercial reliability successfully achieved in current NIA
Phase II at small scale to commercial robustness and scale required for its rapid nationwide implementation in production
of AD PET tracers. Key requirements for this are (1) product shelf-life and (2) high-quality scale-up procedures for
disposable kits, which define the project’s Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: 12-Month stability established and proven for Tracer-QC kits. Continuous use of Tracer-QC in
demanding commercial settings requires such stability, since any interruption in Tracer-QC operation may translate into
patients not getting their AD PET scans.
 Specific Aim 2: Tracer-QC kit production scale-up procedures developed and validated within an ISO 9001:2015-
certified Quality Management System (QMS). Achievement of this aim will involve: (1) Redesign of product and process
to achieve consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing. (2) Establishing and certifying an ISO 9001:2015 QMS.
 Outcomes. Successful completion of this project will expand availability of AD PET tracers across the country by
simplifying AD PET tracer production procedures so that they can be implemented in any facility, even those constrained
in space and skill sets. Superior quality of AD PET tracers released by robust and standardized Tracer-QC platform will
further steer both customers and regulators to make it the preferred solution. By effecting the largest number of commercial
production sites in a single standardized effort, this project enables rapid expansion of AD PET imaging to the broad AD
population, that cannot easily travel. With the US AD population over 5 million and cost of treatment over $320B/year,
there is strong need for AD PET in clinical trials to optimize their efficacy. Also, recently approved therapeutics are expected
to lead to a 20-fold increase in AD PET imaging. All of these events drive immediate need for a paradigm shift technology
to enable AD PET tracer manufacturers to support nationwide demand for AD PET imaging. Fortunately, Tracer-QC
technology can address this once the aims of this project are achieved."

Migrant agricultural workers and their families face formidable challenges in accessing COVID-19 testing,
treatment, and preventive measures due to geographic, cultural, linguistic, and social isolation from community
institutions and resources. Our research team has partnered with migrant families in rural Nebraska to improve
access to COVID-19 testing, healthcare, and community response resources by implementing the Mobile
Health for Migrant Health (mHealth-4-Mhealth) program. This program collaborates with state and local health
departments and the Title IC Nebraska Migrant Education Program and seeks to mitigate direct and indirect
negative effects of the pandemic by providing mHealth-guided decision support for at-home COVID-19 antigen
testing and infection management coupled with mHealth-assisted social determinants of health (SDOH)
screening and response protocols to connect families to community resources and aid. Our experience to date
highlights the feasibility and acceptability of mHealth-based public health interventions to engage marginalized
communities in COVID-19 responses and facilitate access to community and health systems resources. The
research objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of mHealth-4-Mhealth program implementation on
migrant families’ utilization of COVID-19 testing, treatment, and related healthcare resources by achieving
three specific aims. Aim #1: Determine the effectiveness of self-directed decision support via an mHealth tool
and human-assisted systems navigation for engaging rural migrant families in COVID-19 (1a) testing and (1b)
treatment. Aim #2: Identify SDOH and other implementation factors at participant, household, and community
levels associated with program adoption among rural migrant families. Aim #3: Determine the cost-
effectiveness of implementing mHealth and systems navigation to increase COVID-19 (3a) testing and (3b)
treatment among rural migrant families. We will conduct a prospective, cluster-randomized clinical trial among
Nebraska rural migrant families. Households will be randomized to one of three study arms to first receive free
at-home antigen test kits for varying periods of baseline observation followed by addition of our mHealth tool
and then the tool combined with human-assisted systems navigation. A fourth study arm will consist of existing
mHealth-4-mHealth families who already receive all program components. Primary outcomes will be COVID-19
test and antiviral therapy utilization. Secondary outcomes will include COVID-19 vaccination and unplanned
healthcare utilization. We will analyze these outcomes across intervention states. For Aim 2 we will assess the
association of SDOH and other implementation factors that may contribute to rural migrant families’ use
(adoption) of program interventions. For Aim 3 we will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of program
implementation using the mHealth tool with or without systems navigation. Results will provide evidentiary
support to scale the intervention to migrant-serving programs nationally, inform health policy development, and
drive future programs aimed at improving community resilience in public health emergencies."
10905500,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trophoblast cell derivatives of the early embryo contribute to restructuring the uterine environment, an event
required for the establishment of a successful pregnancy. The human and rat each possess a uterine-
trophoblast interface that is characterized by deep intrauterine infiltration of trophoblast cells, which contributes
to dynamic changes in uterine immune cell, endothelial cell, smooth muscle cell, and stromal cell constituents.
This important developmental process is directed by specialized trophoblast cells possessing invasive
properties referred extravillous trophoblast (EVT) in the human or by the generic term invasive trophoblast cells
in other species, including the rat. Differentiation into these specialized trophoblast cell types requires
suppression of pathways essential for maintaining the trophoblast cell stem state and activation of the
invasive/EVT cell differentiation program. We hypothesize that repression of the trophoblast cell stem state is
an event essential for the establishment of pregnancy. In this project, we investigate roles for activin-follistatin
like 3 and WNT-WNT antagonist regulatory networks controlling development of the invasive/EVT cell lineage.
Roles for the activin-follistatin like 3 and WNT-WNT antagonist regulatory networks are the focus of Aims Nos.
1 and 2, respectively. In Aim No. 3, we examine FSTL3 and the WNT antagonist, NOTUM, in patient-specific
human trophoblast stem cells. Experimentation includes genome-wide analyses of the transcriptome and the
chromatin landscape. Execution of this research project will facilitate elucidation of elements of the regulation
of the invasive/EVT cell lineage and will create a platform for understanding the pathogenesis of early
pregnancy loss."

Abstract
Fate specification is a fundamental aspect of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology. The proposed studies are focused on the still elusive molecular mechanisms that direct bipotent megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP) towards downstream unipotent megakaryocytic progenitors (MkP) and erythroid progenitors (ErP), which are essential for platelet and red blood cell production. Building on our published studies and new preliminary data, we will test how the transcription factor RUNX1, one of the most commonly mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia, regulates MEP fate. In collaboration with experts in proteomics, and transcriptional initiation we will use state-of-the-art approaches to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of specific serines and threonines of RUNX1 by CDK9 and other kinases promotes the transcriptional elongation of genes that promote the megakaryocytic fate whereas inhibition of this phosphorylation promotes the erythroid fate. Sorted MEP, MkP and ErP populations provide a unique opportunity to study mechanisms of fate specification as they are extremely close to one another developmentally, yet have distinctly different differentiation potential. Using cell and molecular biology along with highly innovative proteomics approaches, we will 1) determine the differential levels of phospho-RUNX1 proteoforms in primary MEP, MkP, and ErP; 2) test the degree to which the upstream kinase CDK9 promotes RUNX1 Serine and Threonine phosphorylation; and 3) assess potential downstream mechanisms by which phosphorylated RUNX1 regulates MEP fate specification. This research holds significant promise for advancing our understanding of hematopoiesis and has implications for therapeutic interventions in Hematology and Transfusion Medicine as well as broad implications regarding fundamental mechanisms in fate specification."
11041784,"Skin cancer is the most common cause of cancer in the US. About 16% of skin cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is the most aggressive type of non-melanoma skin cancer. Actinic keratoses (AKs) are a dysplastic epidermal lesion that often appear prior to SCC and may be precursor lesions of invasive SCC. Although the rate of AK transformation to SCC is 1 to 10% over a 10-year period, it is not possible to predict which of these early lesions will progress to SCC, thus treatment of all AK lesions is medically necessary to minimize the risk of progression to malignant skin cancer. In addition, in immuno¬suppressed patients, there is up to a 250-fold increased rate of conversion of AK lesions to SCC. Current treatments available for AK utilize fairly toxic agents such as cryotherapy, surgical excision, oral bexarotene, and topical cytotoxic agents such as 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac, imiquimod, and ingenol mebutate. Thus, there is a need for clinical studies that examine the long-term effects of non-toxic topical AK treatment as a component of a chemopreventive strategy for reducing the conversion of AK to non-melanoma skin cancers in immuno¬compromised patients.

PHT-427 is a small molecule dual inhibitor of the pleckstrin homology (PH)-domains of AKT and PDPK1, both important drivers of skin cancer carcinogenesis. PHT-427’s lipophilicity allows skin penetration when applied topically; concentrations in skin can be 10,000-fold higher than in plasma, leading to local AKT and PDPK1 inhibition. Topical PHT-427 has been shown to inhibit UVB-induced carcinogenesis in mouse models of AK with low toxicity; PHT-427 has exhibited a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) following daily oral administration greater than 400 mg/kg, with no evidence of skin irritation in mice or rats upon repeated topical administration at 150 mg/kg/dose. The mild toxicity profile separates PHT-427 from the irritant treatments currently being used for AK.

These features suggest that PHT-427 could be an ideal candidate for long-term treatment to prevent the development of skin cancer in patients with precancerous AK, particularly in immunosuppressed patients, who are prone to develop AK and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The main objectives of this Task Order RFP are to develop a topical formulation of PHT-427 suitable for use in human patients and perform in vitro and in vivo IND-enabling toxicology studies to facilitate translation to human clinical trials."

The COBRE in Stroke Recovery has been tremendously successful – effectively establishing the Medical
University of South Carolina (MUSC) as an international leader in stroke rehabilitation research, with outstanding
researchers and core resources. Our Phase 3 strategy is to remain leaders in stroke recovery while widening
our scope to fully support research into the restoration of neural-based function in all populations – building upon
the diverse and multidisciplined user base built over the first two phases – effectively becoming the COBRE for
Restoration of Neural-Based Function. The COBRE will foster continued innovation; technology development;
and diverse and multidisciplinary faculty recruitment, career development, and retention. Further, we propose to
fully align our COBRE investigators and core infrastructure with three synergistic MUSC strategic research
initiatives. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Optimize successfully established stroke recovery research programs
and restoration of neural-based function infrastructure built in prior COBRE phases; and 2) Implement strategies
to advance MUSC research excellence in the restoration of neural-based function beyond COBRE funding. First,
we will streamline existing Phase 2 cores to better serve the needs of our investigators by refocusing on specialty
services not available elsewhere, while transitioning those services which have become more widely available
through other university research cores. Specifically, we will consolidate the specialty services of the Brain
Stimulation and Neuroimaging Cores to become a more focused Neural Function Core supporting
neuromodulation, neural recordings, and combined multimodal studies. Second, we will coalesce COBRE
operations and human capital within a newly constructed research home. This will create a truly synergistic
research environment for transdisciplinary collaboration to tackle complex restoration of neural-based function
research in state-of-the-art laboratories. Next, we will leverage considerable, new university-wide faculty growth
and diversity programs – in which COBRE faculty already have leadership roles – to accelerate cluster hiring,
career development, and resource allocation for sustained COBRE growth and independent operations post NIH
funding. Finally, we will support a robust pilot project program to drive novel mechanistic and technological
innovations. MUSC will be leaders in ushering in the era of neural circuit-based medicine as we use our world-
class resources to develop novel neuromodulation interventions for restoring neural-based functions across the
spectrum of physical function, cognitive function, and psychiatric function for all of those in need."

a complex blend of key nutrients and components that are essential to meeting life’s critical early milestones.
The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant’s life to
deliver an ideal source of nutrition, immune instruction, pathogen defense, and microbiome development. To
facilitate continued breastfeeding in light of challenges with return to work, nursing mothers often rely on freezer
storage of expressed breastmilk, and those with lactation difficulties seek donor breastmilk, which is also stored
frozen. However, the temperature of most household freezers (-20 °C) does not preserve the complex emulsified
structure of human breastmilk, resulting in fat breakdown and the generation of rancid flavor compounds during
storage and thawing processes. In addition to loss of fat/caloric content and rancidity, the nutritional value of
freeze-thawed breastmilk is significantly degraded compared to fresh breastmilk, particularly for proteins,
carbohydrates, antioxidant capacity, and bactericidal capacity. With ~74% of breastfeeding mother freezing their
milk for over three months, and ~42% of parents finding frozen milk more difficult to feed than fresh breastmilk,
these challenges contribute to suboptimal infant feeding regimes (e.g., discontinuation of breastfeeding) and
infant undernutrition. The only established method to prevent milk spoilage is pasteurization, which alters
breastmilk's emulsified structure and decreases its nutritional content and is impractical for caregivers to perform
at home. Addressing these gaps, PumpKin’s affordable technology would be the first to offer an easy to use, at-
home solution for breastmilk preservation. PumpKin’s breastmilk-preserving formulations have been developed
through rapid, high-throughput screening of 2,750+ food-derived and/or generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
compounds and have already been shown to inhibit >60% of fat breakdown over six months. Building on these
promising findings, the following Phase I Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Develop GRAS-based formulation(s)
demonstrated to significantly preserve fat stability in frozen breastmilk; 2) Investigate benefits of formulations on
the preservation of other high-value, storage-sensitive biological components in human milk (i.e., maternal cell
viability and milk fat globule membranes; and 3) Assess performance under realistic home storage conditions
and determine the minimum formulation dose needed for human breastmilk preservation. These aims will
position PumpKin to further develop this technology in Phase II, which will involve exploring additional
refinements for the preservation of an expanded set of high-value components and establish manufacturing
quality controls and scalability. Successful development of Pumpkin’s technology will be informative to the core
application in shelf-life extension for breastmilk and also to the broader food and beverage preservation markets."
10919294,"Fecal incontinence and fecal urgency (FI/FU) are extremely inconvenient and stigmatizing conditions that are common in the elderly, nursing home residents, women (due to anal damage during childbirth), and people with neurological conditions (e.g. spinal injury, multiple sclerosis). It is especially high in elderly with age-related dementia. The severe impacts of FI make at-home care difficult, and patients and caregivers suffer the emotional burdens of shame, embarrassment, and stigmatism. FI is associated with declining mental health and increased risk for psychological distress and depressive symptoms. Thus, incontinence is one of the top reasons for institutionalization of the elderly, and nearly 50% of all nursing home residents, and 66% of those with age-related dementia, exhibit FI. Current management of FI for most patients at home and in institutions is to simply prevent a mess when an FI “accident” occurs (i.e. wearing adult diapers to catch the stool) and trying to normalize GI function (e.g. treat diarrhea or constipation). Wearing a diaper does not prevent the odors of the stool from broadcasting that FI has occurred (which can hinder professional and social relationships), and relieving constipation or diarrhea is only effective in 1 of 5 patients. 
Clinical and preclinical evidence indicates FI/FU can result from sensitization of a specific population of colorectal afferent terminals. Dignify proposes that inhibiting these colorectal afferent terminals will safely and effectively prevent or reduce the symptoms of FI/FU, as well as reduce symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Colorectal sensory fibers will be inhibited by intrarectal administration of proprietary compounds that are known to inhibit sensitized afferent terminals in other regions of the body and produce analgesia. An important advantage of local, intrarectal administration of the compounds is elimination or reduction of systemic distribution of the compounds, which reduces the possibility of off-target side-effects. Specific Aim 1 examines the effects of the compounds on colorectal function and establishes the duration of colorectal afferent inhibition to guide dosing frequency. Our phase 2 SBIR plans are to test the “best” compound in a translational model of FI in TNBS-treated rats, optimize a suppository formulation, initiate IND-enabling studies, and immunohistochemically examine the effects of the analgesics on phenotypically-identified rectal afferent fibers of treated animals to provide insight regarding mechanism of action."

Chronic prostatitis/Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is the most common urological condition affecting
men under the age of 50. With an estimated prevalence of 6-12% of the male population, the average direct and
indirect cost totals $10,000 per patient/per year in the U.S. There are currently no FDA approved therapeutics
for CPPS. Research on CPPS has shown that mast cell dysfunction can lead to symptoms of CPPS and that a
combination of a mast cell stabilizer and histamine receptor antagonist is uniquely synergistic. These
observations have been validated in a recent pilot study in humans with CP/CPPS where this combination was
shown to be efficacious. However, the medications utilized have poor absorption from the GI tract, necessitating
high doses and a cumbersome treatment protocol, contributing to lower patient adherence to treatment. We
therefore proposed to develop an optimized formulation that can be delivered orally, once or twice daily, in a
soft-gel capsule. Working with a formulation company, initial proof of concept studies in dogs showed that
enhancing intestinal permeability can increase absorption, providing a means to achieve our developmental
goals. In this application, we propose to develop and test two unique formulations with permeation enhancers
in dogs to select the formulation with the most desirable pharmacokinetic parameters. In addition, we will work
with our academic partner, Northwestern University, to define the exposure-response relationship of these
therapeutic agents in a murine model of CP/CPPS. These feasibility studies proposed in two separate Aims will
set the stage for a phase II STTR which will focus on optimization and stability of the lead formulation, inclusion
in a proprietary enteric-coated soft-gel capsule and small batch manufacturing."

visiting lecturer series as well as the development of a summer research opportunity for undergraduate and
medical students to take part in this critically important area of research on pain."
10930005,"Project Abstract – Project 1
Chronic pain afflicts over 100 million Americans and is a leading reason for seeking medical treatment. Few new
therapies have been delivered in the past decades, resulting in overuse of opioids, despite their potential for
abuse and limited efficacy in many chronic pain conditions. One glaring concern is the failure of studies using
preclinical models to yield agents that are effective pain therapeutics. A key barrier in addressing this problem is
the knowledge gap between our understanding of the human peripheral nervous system and the studies
performed in rodent preclinical pain models. In this project, we propose to identify additional genes involved in
human pain pathways via analysis of the genomes of a cohort of patients with idiopathic painful neuropathy.
While nociceptive neurons are the components most critical for peripheral pain transmission, other cells in
peripheral nerves—glia and immune cells, particularly macrophages—are important regulators of pain
responses in these neurons. Additional analysis is required to understand how interactions among these cellular
nerve components, and with sensory axons, contribute to pain. We therefore propose to use single-nuclei
RNAseq strategies that we recently utilized to produce a mouse peripheral nerve atlas to create a multi-layered,
comprehensive atlas of the expression profiles of human peripheral nerve cellular components.
 In this proposal, we outline a series of experiments to examine gene expression in cells of human
peripheral nerve and to identify novel gene variants associated with idiopathic painful neuropathy. Whole
genome sequencing will be performed on samples from a large cohort of well-characterized patients with painful
neuropathy. Gene variants will be associated with phenotypic information to identify new genes involved in the
pain pathway. Using multi-omic technologies, including snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq as well as spatial
transcriptomics and multiplex proteomics, to study nerves from our donor tissue core, we will devise a
comprehensive, unbiased single-nuclei atlas of gene expression and cellular composition of human peripheral
nerves. Parallel studies will be performed to determine the cellular components and gene expression patterns of
surgically resected painful neuromas. By comparing the neuroma transcriptomes to the atlas derived from normal
nerve datasets, we plan to identify cell type-specific determinants of painful neuromas. We expect these rich and
complementary datasets to provide a foundation for molecular and cellular analysis of sensory nerve dysfunction
in pain syndromes that will provide insights into treatment options for pain."
10930009,"Project Abstract – Project 2
Rodent models of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have been extremely useful in identifying the cellular and molecular
mechanisms involved in pain, nerve injury, regeneration, degeneration, and various forms of peripheral
neuropathies. However, translation of preclinical findings may be greatly improved by validation in human tissues.
Since differences exist between rodent and human sensory neurons, a detailed study of all cells within human
DRG is critical for future treatment of painful state, nerve injuries as well as peripheral neuropathies. The difficulty
to gain access to human DRG has hampered progress on that front. Our collaborative team is uniquely positioned
to tackle this problem. We have gained expertise in the surgical procedure for extraction of human DRG from
organ donors consenting to tissue donation for research and the preparation of viable adult DRG cells for
functional and molecular studies. Combined with our strong expertise in single cell sequencing, imaging mass
cytometry and bioinformatics approaches, we will define at the single cell level the molecular profile of neuronal
and non-neuronal cells within human DRG tissue. We will integrate gene expression profile with imaging mass
cytometry (IMC), a tissue-based proteomic analysis that allows the detection of over 30 protein markers
simultaneously on tissue sections at the single-cell level while retaining the spatial relationships of the cells. IMC
enables a variety of distinct cell types to be analyzed concurrently at a single-cell resolution and is reshaping the
ability to interrogate both the intercellular interactions and the architectural relationships between cells and their
native microenvironment. This spatially-resolved multiplexed profiling approach has been applied to cancer,
diabetes, immunology, and infectious disease research, identifying functionally distinct immune cell
subpopulations associated with disease progression, treatment outcomes, and biomarkers for disease prognosis.
We will develop computational approaches for integrated IMC and single cell transcriptomic analysis of hDRG.
Application of this spatially-resolved, highly multiplexed, single-cell transcriptomics and proteomic profiling
approach to pain research will likely reshape our ability to interrogate cell population and gene expression
changes and their spatial relationships between neurons and non-neuronal cells in healthy and painful conditions.
By integrating the cellular, spatial and functional branches of the human DRG atlas we will dramatically expand
the characterization of human DRG in healthy and painful states. This project will generate a reference atlas for
human DRG and define inter-individual variability of healthy human DRG tissue and DRG from painful conditions
with single cell resolution."
10930011,"Specific Aims: Tens of millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. Unfortunately for these patients, there
is very little we can offer in the way of treatments. Opioids represent the main tool for treating pain, but their use
in chronic pain conditions suffers from a poor evidence base and the inherent risk of addiction. The current crisis
of opioid-related deaths highlights the risk associated with widespread opioid use. The parallel crises of chronic
pain and opioid-related deaths has led the NIH to launch the HEAL Initiative, with one of the major goals being
the identification of novel analgesics for the treatment of pain, with a focus on drugs that are non-addicting. The
PRECISION Human Pain Network seeks to provide foundational data on the diversity among cell types that
comprise the pain neuraxis. Goals for our proposed PRECISION Human Pain Network U19 center include the
development of optimized experimental protocols and functional assays utilizing primary human cells and tissue
(including dorsal root ganglion neurons and spinal cord slices), and the elucidation of comprehensive
molecular/cellular phenotypes that underlie human pain transduction, transmission, and processing under
different pain conditions. This project seeks to increase our understanding of the physiological properties of
human neurons in the pain neuraxis. The three aims here will begin to catalog the functional profiles and
transcriptinoal signatures of DRG and spinal neurons from donors with and without a history of pain or opioid
use. We will continue our work to optimize protocols for cutting edge functional and genetic studies in human
nervous system tissue. We will work with other centers to optimize protocols to assess physiological,
transcriptional, and morphological features of human DRG and spinal cord neurons at cellular resolution, and
how these properties are impacted in tissues recovered from patients with a history of pain. Because our donor
population also includes patients with substance use and misuse, and in some cases this overlaps with chronic
pain conditions, we will also characterize similar properties of DRG and spinal cord neurons in patients with and
without a recent history of opioid use. These studies will provide foundational knowledge of human neurons in
the pain neuraxis by mapping electrophysiological features of neurons in the human DRG and spinal cord onto
genetically-defined subpopulations of human DRG or morphological classes of spinal neurons. The study will
also profile tissues derived from donors with and without a history of chronic pain or opioid use/misuse, providing
opportunity for new understanding of the impact of pain and substance use on these neurons in the human pain
neuraxis. Another major deliverable from the present study will be the development of optimized protocols for
key aspects of the proposed analyses, including protocols for RNA sequencing from patch clamped neurons
(Patch-seq) and for the preparation, maintenance, and recording form human spinal cord slices."

grant. Led by the three P.I.s, the AC is supported by an executive committee, composed by the leaders of the
Cores, of the Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) and of the scientific projects. The AC has a prestigious
External Advisory Board (EAB), with members who represent all the disciplines and expertise relevant to this
ROBIN. A team of experienced patients advocates, completes the organizational chart. An Executive Director
will be recruited if the ROBIN is funded, in charge of maintaining communication and coordination of all ROBIN
activities. To this scope the ROBIN Tracker will be introduced, adapted from an IT tool developed at Weill Cornell
Medicine for electronic communication of activities and tasks of large grants (like SPORE or PPG). An important
role of the AC is to develop a semestral evaluation plan and share it with the EAB, and if necessary, at ad hoc
meetings when important decisions need to be made. Metrics of success will include the timely achievement of
completion of MTAs and other legal steps to enable transfer between academic institutions of research
specimens in the US, and of research data both in the US and Europe. Planned accruals to the MCT, generation
of preliminary data from the scientific projects, and successful integration of trainees within the ROBIN programs
are additional metrics of success. The iterative nature of ROBIN will also be assessed, as it is expected that the
results of the first MCT and the associated scientific projects (converged with the feedback and results from the
other centers in the ROBIN network) will inspire the design of one or more new MCT, around year 3. These new
MCT will be implemented during the last two years of the award through the existing Immunology and Radiation
Oncology Network (IRON) that will run the proposed first MCT. Another important role of the AC consists of
assessing the Cross Training Core (CTC). While metrics of success of the CTC are defined in detail in its planned
self-assessment, the AC will monitor the CTC to ensure a harmonious integration of the different disciplines and
expertise that characterize ROBIN and are indispensable to a cross training in Radiation and Immunity, the
overarching theme of this ROBIN proposal. A central duty of the AC is to identify potential collaborations within
and beyond the ROBIN network and participate in the process of actualizing the restricted fund pilot projects
program of the ROBIN network. The ROBIN newsletter proposed in the CTC, with distribution across the network
will advertise the RFA. In addition, each of the ten academic institutions involved in this ROBIN will use their
internal communication mechanisms to solicit applications. We expect the applications to be evaluated by a
committee formed by representatives of each funded ROBIN. The AC will select representation from this ROBIN,
based on the need of the committee, with consideration to ensure its diversity (gender balance, diversity of
expertise and seniority, etc.). Finally, the AC leaders will participate in the executive activities of the ROBIN

10930021,"ABSTRACT
Molecular Characterization Trial
The Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) is a clinical platform to enable tissue acquisition to perform cutting
edge laboratory and imaging research to advance the field of radiation biology. The MCT overarching hypothesis
is that the contribution of radiotherapy (RT) to the outcome of cancer depends on the balance of the crosstalk
among the irradiated tumor and normal tissue, the host microbiome, and the host’s immune system. Rectal
cancer is an ideal model to test this hypothesis since imaging and specimens, from patients undergoing a
standard short course radiotherapy (SCRT) treatment, are accessible and available at pre- and post RT
treatment as well as at time of surgery. As such the RT effects can be analyzed longitudinally in each single
tissue and then be integrated globally into a model to correlate biological and imaging data with clinical outcome.
Rectal cancer is also a research priority because of its disparity in racial incidence and outcome.
The ROBIN P.I.s have assembled an international team of established investigators, to conduct the same trial
concurrently, at seven centers, to accelerate accruals and discovery. As such, the MCT represents the ROBIN
foundation on which both Project 1 and Project 2 rely to answer fundamental questions regarding RT biology.
Novel bioinformatic approaches will be applied to integrate clinical and biological data with imaging data, to
enhance the potential for discovery. The initial MCT will create a supporting structure for future trials, iteratively
testing new interventions informed by the results of the associated scientific projects. Project 1 will focus on the
molecular analyses of tumor and patient’s matched non-tumor tissue with the goals of defining the local immune
response to RT and the genomic changes induced by RT and elucidate how the treatment affects the pathways
involved in cell fate decisions, and its effects on the local colonic mucosal microbiome. Project 2 will use blood
specimens and lymph nodes, collected inside or outside the radiation field, to quantify RT-induced oxidative
stress and the biological outcome of it on each immune cell subpopulation. Pathways associated with cellular
stress responses, cell death, and immunological fitness will also be evaluated. Additionally, stool samples
collected before and after RT will be analyzed to qualitatively and quantitatively map changes in the microbiome.
Both projects will address these pivotal questions using state-of-the-art, genomic and proteomic approaches
integrated with the patients’ clinical data and multi-modal imaging from an orthogonal radiomic study.
 After standardization and upload, all laboratory, clinical and imaging data will be harmonized and cured by
the Data Sharing and Integrative Analysis Core (DSIA). Data will then be analyzed using novel integrative
bioinformatics approaches to identify previously undetectable patterns related to radio-responsiveness and
assess their association with clinical outcomes. The final output will converge into NIH/NCI databases and
becomes available to the ROBIN network and to the scientific community at large."
10930023,"SUMMARY
Tumors develop in complex and dynamic microenvironments that influence disease progression and response
to treatment, including radiation therapy (RT). RT results in compromised cellular fate as a consequence of
unrepaired DNA lesions, macromolecular damage and failing adaptation to stress, culminating in cell death or
permanent proliferative inactivation (cell senescence), both of which crosstalk with the immune system. Local
differences in genomic instability, oxygenation and microbial components can also affect tumor responses to RT
and immune activation. All these factors and their dynamic intertwining contribute to local control and patient
survival. Despite the growing knowledge in radiation biology and the improved precision delivery of radiation to
tumors, the molecular determinants of how RT impacts the tumor-immune interaction over time are still largely
undefined. Moreover, how RT-induced stress response and adaptation in distinct cell components in the tumor
microenvironment ultimately influence the clinical outcome remains elusive. Likewise, how such therapeutic
outcome can be further altered by distinct pre-existing signaling profiles related to genomic instability prior to
RT, is not well characterized. Here, we test the novel hypothesis that pre-operative RT for resectable
colorectal (CRC) cancer alters the dynamic interactions between malignant cells, normal cells, immune
cells, and the tumor microbiome, to modulate cell fate decisions and anticancer immunity. Our team of
basic scientists has joined forces with a group of immunologists, clinical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists,
physicists, and bioinformaticians, to create a unique environment for testing this hypothesis in conjunction with
Project 2. Specifically, we aim at (1) establishing the spatiotemporal landscape of the immune response and
mutational and transcriptional changes within histological context induced by RT in CRC and the adjacent non-
malignant colon; (2) assessing the effect of RT on genome stability, cell fate, and modulation of cancer signaling
pathways; and (3) investigating how RT modulates the tumor-associated microbiome. To these aims, we will
harness a unique set of longitudinally collected CRC samples provided by the Molecular Characterization Trial
(MCT) and state-of-the-art, innovative technologies including spatial transcriptomics (the technology of the year
2020), RNAscope and others, which will enable for an unprecedented (at near-to-single cell resolution)
characterization of the dynamic interactions between malignant cells, normal cells, immune cells and the tumor
microbiome in tumor samples, and how such interactions evolve prior to, during and after radiotherapy, with
special emphasis on factors and processes that have previously been linked to radiosensitivity, including (but
not limited to) genomic instability, hypoxia, DNA damage responses, cell death and cellular senescence."
10930025,"SUMMARY
Over the last decades, we have enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
efficacy of RT and have also made progress to improve the efficiency of RT while reducing side effects
associated with damage to nearby normal tissues. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of how RT, in
a given anatomical field, distinctively alters cancer cells, normal tissue, and infiltrating immune cells based on
each cell’s “uniqueness"" is still unresolved. Further, and importantly, how these combined RT-dependent effects
on different cell types converge to influence therapeutic outcomes remains poorly understood. It is well
recognized that immune fitness is important in controlling cancer growth and progression; as such, any therapy
compromising immune cells, by default, can compromise the immune system’s ability to control malignant cells.
Whereas Project 1 focuses on the tumor and tumor microenvironment response to RT in colorectal cancer, in
this project (Project 2), we focus on the impact of RT on immune cells and the microbiome.
The overall hypothesis of Project 2 is that the immune system is an important component of the cancer response
to RT and that innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by RT are pivotal to restrict cancer progression.
However, these immunological benefits of RT are counterbalanced by deleterious effects of RT on immune cell
fitness and survival with consequent leukopenia and immune dysfunction. As such, a quantitative understanding
of the percentage and sub-populations of immune cells that are directly or indirectly (as bystanders) affected by
RT-induced damage is fundamental to completely understand the role of RT in cancer treatment outcomes.
In Project 2, firstly, we will quantify the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as
immune cells within lymph nodes located inside or outside the radiation field that are affected by RT. Secondly,
we will quantify the RT-induced damage by calculating both the accumulated RT exposure at the single cell level
and related cellular responses (i.e., apoptosis, ER mitochondrial stress, activation of inflammatory pathways,
immunological fitness). Using single cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we will generate a road
map of the effects of RT on the different immune cell types (T and B cell subpopulations, dendritic cells,
monocytes, macrophages, NK cells) in relation to RT dose exposure. Additionally, we will analyze qualitative
and quantitative changes in the microbiome in samples collected before and after RT to infer how RT-mediated
changes in the intestinal microbiome could affect immune responses. In the second part of Project 2, a machine
learning approach will be utilized to integrate all of the acquired data to develop a more comprehensive view of
how RT influences immune responses and treatment outcomes."

10930033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: RESEARCH CORE
The prevalence and incidence of mental health challenges, including addictive behaviors, continues to be sub-
stantially elevated among American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) populations when compared to other racially
and ethnically minoritized groups in the United States. Despite this substantial need, AI/AN communities remain
underserved and often lack necessary resources for addiction treatment and prevention. To help fill these key
gaps in addiction resources and training, this Research Core will evaluate a culturally grounded training curricu-
lum, xaʔtus (meaning First Face) - for Mental Health. This curriculum will train tribal community members in how
to respond to youth and adults experiencing mental health crises and serve as a bridge between these individuals
and the help (in some cases professional) they need. The proposed evaluation of the program will use a Tribal
Participatory Research (TPR) approach, working with representatives from seven tribes to ensure that the needs
and goals of the tribal partners are emphasized in the research design and resulting products. To evaluate
xaʔtus, the Research Core will use a randomized waitlist control design, implemented in seven tribes, that in-
cludes five assessment time points for both initial trainees (n=350) and waitlist controls (n=350). These assess-
ments will measure knowledge about mental health and addiction, as well as the ability and confidence of indi-
viduals to respond appropriately to mental health crises. We will also evaluate the potential for community-level
effects of xaʔtus with a three-wave repeated cross-sectional community survey (n=400), which will examine
community-level mental health stigma, mental health and social isolation, perceived support, help-seeking activ-
ities, and treatment access and utilization. We will supplement these surveys with aggregated records from be-
havioral health centers in these communities (e.g., number of treatment referrals in the past year). This Research
Core will provide knowledge about the extent to which this culturally appropriate training program influences
mental health, community perceptions about mental health, and community mental health resource availability,
both at the individual and community levels. We will share our findings with tribal councils and community mem-
bers to ensure that the potential benefits of training are widely disseminated among AI/AN individuals in these
communities, as well as disseminating our findings through more traditional academic means with permission
from the involved tribes."
10930037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Understanding common risk and protective factors for relapse among American Indian/Alaskan Native
(AI/AN) adolescents in recovery from substance use disorders is essential for ensuring that relapse prevention
programming is authentic, relevant, culturally appropriate, and effective. The overall goals for this Pilot Project
are to (1) gain an in-depth understanding of the intrapersonal and interpersonal determinants of relapse among
AI/AN youth in recovery from addiction by surveying consecutively-admitted AI/AN adolescent residents of the
Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations (HL); (2) for the first time at the HL, integrate information collected as part
of routine clinical services with original survey data to advance clinical research; and (3) engage in a variety of
knowledge translation/research dissemination activities designed to return knowledge gained to AI/AN
adolescents’ care communities. We will invite three cohorts of approximately 15 AI/AN HL residents to take
part in a survey that assesses key demographics (i.e., age, gender, tribal reservation residence status),
situational precursors to relapse (i.e., trigger experiences, crisis experiences, other potential missed
intervention points), social community supports/networks, and intrapersonal characteristics (i.e., coping skills).
We will follow a Tribal Participatory Research approach, whereby we will solicit the feedback regarding the
research plan and instrumentation from a Working Group composed of representatives from seven surrounding
tribal nations. Therefore, the final form of the survey will reflect the interests and perceived needs of tribal
partners. We will combine survey information with relevant clinical information about HL residents, particularly
comorbid psychiatric conditions and relapse history, collected at intake. We will describe the prevalence of risk
and protective factors shared by AI/AN youth in the aggregate and supplement these descriptive analyses with
subgroup analyses designed to explore potential interactions among measured variables, to advance tailored
aftercare approaches designed to support AI/AN adolescents after they return to their home communities and
work to maintain their recovery. We will employ best practices for conveying and disseminating research
findings to a broad audience, which will include the Working Group, tribal councils, HL residents, and, perhaps
most importantly, key HL staff including aftercare specialists. This Pilot Project will provide the foundation for a
set of guided research experiences that will build professional clinical research capacity at the newly
established Healing Lodge Research and Training Unit."

10921958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in
developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific vitamin and mineral
supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual
acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be
effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant
cardiovascular risks or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier
stages. With the NIH SBIR Phase II award, iHS has filled this market gap by developing iPredict-AMDTM, an
artificial intelligence (AI) based software for screening/early diagnosis and prediction of Late AMD,
which needs to be prospectively validated for FDA approval and commercialization. To accomplish this, the
prospective clinical trials for iPredict-AMD is required along with other studies such as human factor study
and precision study, which will be accomplished through this proposal."
10925227,"Project Summary/Abstract
In recent years, precision medicine approaches based on molecular changes in an individual patient’s
tumor have become a promising strategy for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. These approaches are
challenged by the fact that tumors are a heterogeneous collection of cells that change over time and in
response to treatment. At the DNA sequence level, changes range in scale from single-nucleotide
mutations to large chromosomal rearrangements and whole-genome duplications. New DNA/RNA
sequencing technologies enable measurement of this heterogeneity and provide data to infer the
evolutionary history of a tumor. However, the algorithms and software necessary to analyze the
complexities of tumor heterogeneity and evolution remain limited in scope. We propose to develop a
comprehensive software toolkit to analyze tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution across space, time,
and genomic scale. This toolkit will be based on advanced combinatorial and statistical algorithms
developed by PI over the past several years. These algorithms will be unified into a robust,
computationally efficient, and statistically sound software package. This toolkit will incorporate modules
for different types of tumor samples including single tumor samples, multiple tumor regions, multiple
anatomical sites (e.g. primary tumor and metastasis), and multiple time points. The software will also
analyze data from different sequencing approaches (whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted
sequencing) and different sequencing technologies including bulk tumor, single-cell, short-read, and
long-read. The software package will be open source and will be released to run on individual computers,
computing clusters, or in cloud computing environments. Extensive documentation and training will be
provided to facilitate use by a wide range of users from expert bioinformaticians to clinicians. These
powerful data analytic tools will enable researchers to characterize the heterogeneity within tumors with
high accuracy, enabling greater precision in cancer diagnosis and treatment."
10925773,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature and is a leading cause of death
and neurological disability in the United States (US). AIS impacts more than 700,000 Americans annually, with
a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the AIS economic burden will exceed
$180B in the US alone.
 Standard AIS therapies include FDA-approved thrombolysis using alteplase (i.e., tissue plasminogen
activator, tPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and earliest-possible thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions
(out to 24hrs). In contrast to thrombectomy, thrombolysis does not require confirmation of a vessel occlusion.
Because only ~10% of AIS victims are eligible for thrombectomy, thrombolysis remains a critical first line tool to
treat those diagnosed with AIS. When employed, thrombolysis is associated with a modest ~15% improvement
in stroke outcomes, resulting in only ~10% fully recovering. However, due to alteplase's ~7% dose-dependent
hemorrhage risk, thrombolysis remains contraindicated for mild and wake-up strokes which together make up
~60% of all AIS events. Currently, thrombolysis usage within the US remains low (~10%) with 90% of all AIS
victims only receiving palliative care. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the efficacy and safety of
thrombolysis and extend thrombolysis to more AIS victims.
 UNandUP has invented a novel nanoparticle-based thrombolysis platform to safely accelerate alteplase to
AIS-associated blood clots, thereby overcoming restrictive hemodynamics known to prevent alteplase from
reaching the occlusion. The platform overcomes this barrier by 1) conveying alteplase-conjugated magnetic
nanoparticles to the clot’s surface more than 350X faster than normal biological diffusion (so that lysis starts
within minutes versus hours), and 2) mechanically mixing alteplase at the clot’s surface to improve lysis using
an alteplase dose nearly 250X lower than currently approved (which promises to eliminate alteplase’s elevated
hemorrhage risk). C3i participation and FDA/regulatory meetings confirm a likely CDER pathway which,
although lengthier and more costly than a CDRH pathway, results in a commercially attractive pharmaceutical
product. The platform is affordable to hospitals, does not require precise knowledge of the clot’s location, and
is intended to support EMT transfers between spoke and hub stroke centers, thereby ensuring thrombectomy
is not delayed. Once proven safe and effective, UNandUP’s goal is to extend the benefits of thrombolysis to
nearly all 700,000 AIS victims, which is 10X more than currently treated. By leveraging UNandUP’s prior
success in developing magnetic nanoparticles and portable magnet systems, the aims of this effort can focus
on synthesizing cGMP nanoparticles using proprietary magnetic cores and conducting safety and efficacy
studies in support of an FDA-CDER regulatory approval process."
10926916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diagnostic and treatment approaches for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have evolved over the last decade
from primarily empirical methodologies to objective strategies that rely on clinical characteristics of the patient
and morphological features of the nodule. Following recommendations by the United States Preventive Service
Task Force (USPSTF), high-risk individuals are screened yearly with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
as this provides high sensitivity with acceptable specificity for lung cancer. However, the introduction of LDCT
as the primary screening modality for lung cancer has increased detection rates of indeterminate pulmonary
nodules that then require invasive investigation. This decreases the quality of life for at-risk individuals through
repeated follow-ups and procedures, and greatly increases anxiety over what usually turns out to a benign
nodule. In this proposal, we aim to improve upon these outcomes by determining the features that convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) utilize when classifying lung nodules as either or benign. We will also determine if
providing CNNs with pre-specified histologic image features known to be associated with lung cancer improves
their ability to generalize to novel images outside the image set used to train them. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that increasing the attention of a CNN on LDCT image features that are accepted as
being pathophysiologically relevant will improve its generalizability to novel images and thus its ability
to accurately distinguish between malignant versus benign nodules. In the F99 Aim of this proposal, we
will address this hypothesis by utilizing LDCT images from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) together
with concept activation vectors to determine which parenchymal and tumor-specific features are used by CNNs
to classify lung nodules. In the K00 aim, we will determine if endophenotypes extracted from the COPDgene
LDCT image set can be used to improve CNN generalizability. Completion of these aims will lead to an increased
understanding of the morphologic biomarkers of lung cancer inherent in LDCT images of the lung that are most
important for accurate diagnosis. This will have potential application to the improvement of CNN classification
performance in other medical domains. In addition, by adhering to the training program outlined in this proposal
I will gain high levels of expertise in image biomarkers, early cancer pathogenesis and detection, genetic
networks, and genomics. These will collectively serve as a solid foundation for my future career as an
independent biomedical investigator."
10921862,"The capability to analyze cellular uptake of physiological and pharmacological compounds with increasing
sensitivity and temporal resolution plays a critical role in understanding the underlying molecular pathways
involved in human diseases and disorders. Radioisotopes (RI) facilitate highly sensitive detection of these
analytes, with minimal perturbation of analyte mass and structure, compared to fluorescent labels and other
molecular tags. β-particle emitters, including 32P, 33P, 35S, and 3H are commonly used as biological tracers due
to the prevalence of these atoms in biological molecules.
Despite the advent of new molecular analysis approaches, RI remain the gold standard in a wide range of high
sensitivity, quantitative biological, chemical and environmental studies. RI labels have played a critical role in the
investigation of biological systems, for almost a century. Furthermore, improved detection capabilities that enable
a broader application of RI detection to new biomedical research questions should prove transformational in high
sensitivity biomolecular analyses.
In this SBIR application, we propose to continue development of proprietary, IP-protected, innovative core-shell
nanomaterials capable of molecularly selective detection of low energy RIs directly in aqueous samples. These
nanomaterials will be demonstrated for sensitive binding assays with GPCRs embedded in native membrane
compositions, providing the receptor with a native membrane environment and yielding a more complete picture
of protein functionality. Such measurements would seed new research investigations and would position
Scintillation Nanotechnologies INC as a provider of revolutionary tools for small molecule binding and drug
screening."
10921092,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal describes key steps towards designing a high-throughput charge detection mass spectrometer
that is optimized for very high mass particles in the megadalton and gigadalton mass range. Charge detection
mass spectrometry (CD-MS) is an emerging technology capable of accurately measuring the mass of large and
heterogeneous analytes, making it highly suitable for a wide array of applications including biopharmaceuticals
including gene therapy vectors, virus particles such as adenovirus and lentivirus, liposomes, and large
miomarkers such as lipoproteins and exosomes. CD-MS often employs an electrostatic ion trap containing a
conductive detection cylinder connected to a charge sensitive amplifier. Trapped ions repeatedly pass through
the detection cylinder, generating a square wave signal, and are individually analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform
for their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and charge by measuring their oscillation frequency and signal magnitude,
respectively. While a trap offers the highest charge resolution, and therefore the highest mass resolution, it
suffers from low sensitivity and can be time-consuming. For example, routine mass spectrum acquisition takes
around 15 minutes for a sample with 1012 particles/mL and the lower detection limit is approximately 1010
particles/mL. Lower concentrations also require longer to analyze. In this proposal we aim to design a detector
array CD-MS instrument capable of enhancing the sensitivity and throughput by two orders of magnitude for
heterogeneous samples where higher mass resolution is not necessary for accurately characterizing the mass
distribution. This array will consist of ten individual detection cylinders in a linear arrangement. Ions will be flown
through the array and refocused towards the central axis by electrostatic lenses. Charge sensitive amplifiers and
analog to digital converters will generate and send signals from each detector to a central processing unit such
as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for the signals to be packaged into files and then sent to a server for
data processing. In this investigation, development will begin by performing ion trajectory simulations for
optimizing geometric parameters of the array and focusing voltages applied to the lenses to maximize ion
transmission through the array, thereby maximizing sensitivity. These trajectories will then be used to generate
representative simulated signals. Following from that, code will be written to extract the ion m/z and charge from
the simulated signals. Alongside code development, we will explore different amplifier configurations that give
rise to the fastest analysis and best charge determination. Finally, we wish to develop an integrated circuit for
CD-MS amplifiers which has the potential to significantly improve the charge measurement precision and will
have a more robust and reproducible construction than the current custom amplifier design. The development of
this high-throughput CD-MS array is key to meeting the need for an instrument capable of accurately and rapidly
characterizing the mass distribution of very heavy biological analytes."
10933258,"ABSTRACT: CORE B (CLINICAL INFORMATICS & ANALYTICS)
The central hypothesis of this proposed OPC-SURVIVOR P01 is to improve lifelong quality of life (QOL) and
health among oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) survivors by uncovering novel phenotypes and trajectories and
delivering non-invasive clinic-ready markers of delayed adverse treatment sequelae and novel mitigation
strategies. Three Projects are proposed, all of which require statistical support and timely collection, curation,
management, and access to data related to the MD Anderson Oropharynx (MDA-OPC) and enrichment OPC
cohorts. Core B will provide a centralized data infrastructure to facilitate data integration, and provide coordinated
analytic support for study design, data sharing, and data analysis across all Projects and Cores within the OPC-
SURVIVOR Program.
Objectives for Core B include:
• Application of a novel oropharynx cancer-specific ontology across all Projects.
• Build and optimize customized biomedical informatics pipelines for data extraction, processing, and storage.
• Data management and stewardship compliance with the data sharing policies set forth in the “Final NIH
 Policy for Data Management and Sharing.”
• Build and oversee semi-automated, robust data quality control assessment protocols.
• Build query-friendly, interactive clinical information visualization dashboards for preliminary data exploration
 by the Project and Core teams.
• Provide input on statistical design, sample size determination, analytical methods, and reporting for all
 projects and cores.
• Build risk-models to predict short-term and long-term treatment-related toxicities by incorporating medical-
 demographic variables, patient reported outcomes, blood-based, image-based, and functional biomarkers.
• For clinical trials, Core B will ensure rigorous analysis following the analysis plan laid out in the clinical trial
protocols.
• Work with Core A (Administrative Core) on Data Governance.
• Work with Core C (PROF Core) on the integrated Web-based database management system. This will
 facilitate prospective data collection, entry, quality control, integration, query, reporting, and data visualization
 of data for all studies.
• Practice methods of reproducible research and enhance study rigor.
The work of Core B is significant as standardized capture of temporal outcomes for OPC survivors and effective
knowledge representation will optimize the sustainability of the OPC-SURVIVOR Program while optimizing
health information exchange and event path planning for advanced computational modeling and characterization
of cancer treatment-related adverse effects. The advanced statistical support also provided by Core B will ensure
the successful completion of all proposed Projects."
10934508,"Background: Aligned with the VA Strategic Plan and Blueprint for Excellence1, it is critical to ensure Veteran-
centered, values-concordant care (extent to which Veterans receive therapies that reflect their goals and
treatment preferences) through informed, shared decision-making. This is especially important with regards to
ICDs (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) - permanent, surgically implanted cardiac devices with intent to
monitor and treat life-threatening heart rhythms with an electrical shock. ICDs present a complicated balance
of patient benefit (ie. detection and treatment of dangerous heart rhythms), procedural risk, long-term
maintenance (ie. battery and lead monitoring) and impact on psychological health (ie. heightened levels of
PTSD, anxiety and depression from ICD shocks).2,3
Significance / Impact: Given high rates of heart failure among Veterans4,5, ICD implantation rates across the
VA have risen sharply over the past decade with over 25,000 ICDs implanted at an average per-procedure
cost of $64,5006. However, this rise may not be indicative of well-informed, values-concordant care.
Numerous prior studies show patients poorly comprehend risks, benefits, psychological effects and
complications associated with ICD implantation - often left with false impressions such as ICD is a “cure” for
heart failure, requires no maintenance, and does not lead to inappropriate shocks. Prior data also demonstrate
that providers overemphasize the benefit of ICDs and patients markedly overestimate benefit.7 In February
2018, CMS mandated use and documentation of shared decision prior to ICD implantation. Likely an
underestimation, currently there are approximately 135,000 ICD-eligible Veterans in the VA system.
Innovation: Nationally and within the VHA, this discord has led to a call for decision-support tools to aid
patients in making informed, personalized decisions, particularly for invasive therapies with complex risk-
benefit tradeoffs such as ICDs.8 Innovative aspects include: (1) a significantly improved, comprehensive tool
to support ICD communications, (2) designed for routine implementation within VA clinical care, (3) study of
transition of tools from a non-VA to VA setting, (4) addressing a high-stakes decision (national mandate by
CMS for SDM tools) and (5) integration into existing VA quality-improvement infrastructure (CART-EP).
Specific Aims: The central hypothesis of this proposal is that current ICD decision-making processes are
heterogeneous and lack sufficient Veteran perspective. We will address this through:
Aim 1: Determine Veteran and VA-provider specific factors surrounding ICD decision-making.
Aim 2: Develop an VA-provider led tool that meets Veteran needs for routine use within the VA.
Aim 3: Feasibility testing of the newly developed tools designed to support ICD communications.
Methodology: This project will target Veterans that are (1) ICD-eligible, (2) have ICDs in situ or (3) have
refused ICD therapy and VA-providers who care for such Veterans. In Aim 1, semi-structured face-to-face
interviews will be conducted with qualitative data analyzed in an inductive-deductive format. Output will directly
inform Aim 2 – development of tools to personalize, enhance and support Veteran-provider ICD
communications within the VA. Aim 3 will test the tool using the RE-AIM framework among 4 diverse VA sites.
Implementation and Next Steps: At the completion of this CDA, the tools will be ready for immediate testing
through an IIR project (IIR #2) seeking to evaluate this tool, in comparison to standard of care, at multiple VA-
sites. Dr. Sandhu is leading the development of CART-EP, a VA-funded project extending use of CART
(quality system for invasive cardiovascular procedures) to ICDs. We will incorporate use of this ICD SDM tool
as a quality measure into CART-EP prior to ICD implantation within the VA. CART-EP will serve as a method
to study large-scale dissemination and implementation of this tool nationally (ie. step-wedge effectiveness-
implementation trial among a broad representation of VA clinical practices)."
10934509,"Background. Elder abuse (EA) is the physical, sexual or psychological abuse, financial exploitation or neglect
of an adult age ≥60 years. One in 10 older adults experience EA annually in the US, with many experiencing
multiple types. Veterans are at particularly high risk due to the high prevalence of EA risk factors in this
population. Experiencing EA is linked to depression, injury, increased healthcare use and mortality, but despite
its prevalence and morbidity, fewer than 5% of cases are detected, limiting opportunities for intervention. While
screening is a common approach to improving detection of similar conditions, screening tools for EA have not
been well validated or widely studied. Furthermore, EA screening may miss important high-risk populations,
such as those with dementia, necessitating the development of additional detection strategies that complement
screening. This research aims to improve EA risk detection in VA by both evaluating and optimizing current EA
screening approaches and by leveraging VA healthcare data to identify Veterans with clinical suspicion of EA
who may benefit from further assessment. Significance/Impact. With the growing population of older adults in
the US and over 10 million US Veterans age ≥60 years, improving detection of and interventions for EA is a
national and VA public health priority. By improving detection of EA via both better-informed screening and
novel data-driven tools, this research aligns with VA HSR&D’s priority to improve care for our nation’s aging
Veterans and their caregivers. Innovation. This research integrates elder abuse and implementation science
conceptual frameworks to develop new approaches to improving EA detection. This study will evaluate the test
characteristics of the first-ever data marker for EA suspicion using unique VA data elements and will employ
innovative data informatics approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), to address a complex
social problem with large health impacts. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is a national assessment of the current
landscape of EA screening practices in VA medical centers (VAMCs) and a quantitative evaluation of facility
level factors associated with screening. Aim 2 is a quantitative study that will identify the best performing EA
administrative marker (AM) in VA data. Aim 3 is a qualitative study that will elucidate opportunities for,
facilitators of and barriers to implementation of healthcare-based EA detection programs in VA. Methodology.
In close partnership with the VA Office of Care Management and Social Work, Aim 1 will conduct a national
survey of VAMCs to assess current practices around EA screening and detection; VA facility-level data will be
used to assess structural characteristics associated with screening. Aim 2 will examine three potential EA
suspicion AMs and select the best performing via comparison to a multi-component reference standard
consisting of: a) simplified rule-based NLP of progress note content, and b) evaluation of discordance between
AMs and NLP through targeted medical record review. In Aim 3, early-, recent-, and non-EA screener sites
identified in Aim 1 varying in EA case volume according to the AM selected in Aim 2 will be recruited for in-
depth qualitative interviews to elucidate opportunities for, facilitators of, and barriers to EA detection programs
in VA. Implementation/Next steps. Findings from this research will be used to derive and validate a novel EA
Suspicion Tool (EAST) in VA, then develop and implement a detection approach that improves efficiency and
impact by combining improved EA screening with comprehensive EA assessments targeted towards those at
highest risk. Candidate. Dr. Lena Makaroun is a geriatrician and Core Investigator at the VA Center for Health
Equity Research and Promotion. The goal of this CDA is to gain training and research experience in improving
EA detection among older Veterans through in-depth training in: (1) real-world EA evaluation and intervention
programs; (2) implementation science; (3) framework-guided qualitative methods; and (4) prediction analytics.
This CDA will support Dr. Makaroun’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent VA health services
researcher focused on improving care delivery, intervention and, ultimately, prevention of EA in older adults."
10913370,"Project Summary:
In this research project, we develop synthetic inorganic copper complexes to understand the fundamental
aspects of structure and function in Cu-dependent monooxygenase enzymes. These metalloenzymes contain
1 or 2 Cu ions in their active center and they couple the reduction of O2 with the oxidation of substrates via
formation of transient Cun/O2 species. We are particularly interested in studying the reactivity of mononuclear
Cu/O2 intermediates since they have been proposed as active oxidants in the hydroxylation of strong C-H
bonds in enzymes such as particulate methane monooxygenases (pMMOs) and lytic polysaccharide
monooxygenases (LPMOs). Many questions concerning the identity of the active Cu/O2 species remain
unanswered, including: i) oxidation state of Cu (CuI vs. CuII vs. CuIII); ii) reduction/protonation state of O2
(O2−,(H)O22−, (H)O2−) and the pKa and redox potentials associated with these Cu/O2 species; iii) mechanism
by which the Cu/O2 intermediates carry out C-H hydroxylations (e.g. O-O cleavage mechanism before or after
C-H oxidation?; generation of high-valent Cu-oxyl species before substrate hydroxylation?). In this research
proposal, we tackle this problem using two different approaches:
1) We utilize ligand scaffolds (L) that contain C-H substrates covalently attached to their structure (substrate-
ligands) that permit us to generate and characterize LCu/O2 species and evaluate their reactivity towards
intramolecular C-H hydroxylation. Substrate-ligand modifications will permit us to: i) evaluate the ability of the
Cu/O2 species to oxidize sp3 C-H bonds and sp2 C-H bonds; ii) control the stereo-electronic properties of the
Cu complexes by the use of different ligand donors (i.e. N2, N3, N4) that will lead to the generation of
mononuclear and dinuclear LCu/O2 species, and analyze their reactivity towards intramolecular C-H
hydroxylation including characterization of reaction intermediates, kinetics and computations; iii) utilize this
approach (Cu-directed hydroxylations) to develop synthetic protocols to promote challenging organic
transformations such as enantioselective C-H hydroxylations and one-pot synthesis of 1,3-oxazines.
2) We synthesize mononuclear Cu complexes bearing redox-active ligands with tunable H-bonds that stabilize
Cu-hydroxo and Cu-oxyl cores. These unusual Cu complexes are able to reach multiple oxidation states via
oxidation of the metal and/or ligand scaffold. These high-valent CuO(H) cores will be characterized by various
spectroscopic methods and their ability to perform biorelevant intermolecular 2e− C-H hydroxylations will be
examined systematically using the Bordwell equation (i.e. species with higher redox potential and higher pKa
should be capable of oxidizing stronger C-H bonds), kinetic experiments and analysis of the reactions products
derived from hydroxylation (e.g. organic product(s) and oxidation/protonation state of the final Cu complexes).
Overall, these studies will contribute to a broader understanding of the biochemical role of Cu ions involved in
O2 reduction and biologically relevant oxidations."
10913374,"SUMMARY
T cell exhaustion is common during chronic infections and cancer and limits control of disease. Targeting TEX by
blocking pathways such as PD-1:PD-L can reinvigorate these cells leading to dramatic clinical effects in cancer.
However, most patients do not receive durable clinical benefit. Although PD-1 pathway blockade re-invigorates
TEX function, and results in transcriptional changes, there is little change in the chromatin landscape and
functional changes are not sustained. Thus, our ability to target TEX for therapeutic benefit in cancer and chronic
infections is limited by the epigenetic inflexibility of these cells. A better understanding of the initiation, stability
and reversibility of TEX epigenetic identity should reveal new therapeutic possibilities.
We and others have recently identified Tox as the epigenetic lineage programmer of TEX. Without Tox, TEX cannot
form. Tox is required to initiate chromatin remodeling for TEX but represses terminal TEFF differentiation. However,
the mechanisms of how Tox programs epigenetics are unclear. A major question is what happens to chromatin
landscape and TEX differentiation if Tox is removed in established TEX. Addressing this question is a major goal.
TEX heterogeneity is also now pointing to a developmental biology hierarchy with discreet, functionally relevant
stages of differentiation – or TEX subsets - controlled by transcription factor circuits. These subsets also differ
epigenetically suggesting key roles for Tox that are as yet untested as well as opportunities.
These observations suggest a key role for Tox in the epigenetic identity of TEX but raise key questions about the
ongoing role of Tox once TEX are established. Our overall hypothesis is that inducible deletion of Tox in
established TEX will reveal mechanisms of epigenetic stability of TEX and opportunities for therapeutic
improvement during chronic infections and cancer. We will test this hypothesis in the following Aims:
AIM 1: TEST WHETHER DELETION OF TOX IN ESTABLISHED TEX ALTERS TEX DIFFERENTIATION, TRANSCRIPTIONAL
PROGRAM, OPEN CHROMATIN LANDSCAPE AND/OR DYNAMICS OF TEX SUBSETS. We hypothesize that removal of Tox
in established TEX will revert the TEX epigenetic program and will be associated with functional, differentiation
and transcriptional changes that will be augmented by PD-1 blockade and/or removal of antigen. To test this
idea we will use new inducible Tox deletion strategies combined with deep mechanistic interrogation of the
cellular developmental biology, transcriptional and epigenetic program and response to PD-1 pathway blockade.
AIM 2: TEST HOW COMPLEMENTARY OR DOWNSTREAM EPIGENETIC OR TRANSCRIPTIONAL CIRCUITS COOPERATE WITH
TOX IN TEX. We hypothesize that a combination of in vivo CRISPR screening and candidate testing will reveal
epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms of Tox in TEX. We will use this CRISPR approach together with
enforced expression strategies and a novel Tox-driven inducible Cre reporter to define the molecular and
genomic mechanisms of Tox-mediated initiation and maintenance of the TEX lineage."

10922023,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect over 1.5M people in the US and despite the wide array of treatment options for
maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC), significant risks of infection and malignancy accompany otherwise
effective biological agents. Locally-delivered small molecule therapies, such as second-generation glucocorticoids
exemplify the unique advantage of targeted delivery to improve therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity in
UC. Many biologics that are used for treatment of IBD (e.g., anti-TNFα therapies), enable pleiotropic responses in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract to induce and maintain remission in IBD patients; however, these biologics necessitate systemic
delivery as opposed to local delivery and remain costly with rising estimates of $50,000 – $150,000 in drug acquisition
costs per year. In addition to the desire for affordable therapies, there is an urgent need for technologies that improve local
targeting of biologics to the large intestine due to higher efficacy, less off-target effects, and a substantial reduction in
drug required to achieve an effect.
Specific technical challenges remain which have prevented implementation of intestine-targeted oral delivery systems for
biologics including: (1) inactivation of biologics by enzymes, stomach acids, bile, digestive process, etc., (2) shelf-
stability of biologics in oral dosage forms, (3) lack of spatial access to discrete sites of inflammation upon release in the
intestines, and (4) consistent and reliable delivery at the target site. To address these challenges, we have recently
developed platform delivery systems for dietary proteins as well as sensitive biologics that are capable of sustained release
over a 24-hour period in physiological situations, enabling protection against harsh conditions in the GI tract, and
compatible with a variety of proteins tested to date. This proposal aims to expand this platform to protect therapeutic
proteins (biologics) so as to enable their targeted oral delivery to the intestines. Our initial investigation will focus on
rhPRG4, a large protein involved in epithelial lubrication, towards treating the symptoms of UC. Specifically, we aim to
formulate rhPRG4 to protect against bile salts, enzymes, acids, moisture, and light with a targeted delivery to the colon.
Furthermore, we will assess viability of released rhPRG4 to reduce cytokine production in an in vitro model of
inflammation"
10909793,"Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer that begins in melanin-producing melanocytes in the skin. It accounts
for only about 1% of skin cancers, but it is the leading cause of skin cancer deaths. US military personnel have
higher rates of melanoma than civilians because of the heavy exposure to sunlight in the deployment setting.
Based on the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry, melanoma is one of the five most frequently diagnosed
cancers among VA cancer patients. US Veterans will continue to be vulnerable to melanoma as the US military
currently is and has been recently engaged in missions in several high ultraviolet (UV) index zones, such as Iraq
and Afghanistan. Thus, there is a critical need to devise strategies to slow melanoma progression, leading to
extended or even permanent survivorship in Veteran patients. Current efforts in melanoma research are heavily
focused on blocking cell proliferation or killing tumor cells. However, it may also be possible to treat this disease
by preventing tumor cells from spreading to other organs. The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway controls tissue
polarity during development by regulating the directional movement of cells and coordinating neighboring cells
to the tissue axes. Increasing evidence suggests that it also plays a role in cancer by promoting tumor cell
migration and invasion. Although some information is available regarding the PCP pathway in certain cancers,
its involvement in melanoma has not been studied. The long-term goal of our study is to dissect the role and
mechanism of the PCP pathway in melanoma development and progression. In our preliminary studies, we have
found that Frizzled 6 (FZD6), one of the core PCP genes, is overexpressed in multiple melanoma cell lines and
human tissues. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of FZD6 does not affect cell proliferation, but significantly
reduces the invasive ability of melanoma cells. In addition, we have found that KO of Fzd6 dramatically reduces
lung metastasis in the Pten/BRaf mouse model of melanoma. Therefore, we hypothesize that FZD6 promotes
melanoma invasion and metastasis by regulating cell polarity and could serve as a novel target for
melanoma management. We will test this hypothesis with the following three aims: (1) to determine the
mechanisms of FZD6 in promoting melanoma cell invasion in vitro; (2) to determine the functional significance
of FZD6 in melanoma metastasis in vivo; and (3) to determine the clinical relevance and therapeutic significance
of FZD6 in melanoma. The proposed research is innovative. We have assembled a team with diverse expertise
to take a multi-disciplinary approach using loss- and gain-of-function genetic studies, live-cell imaging, inducible
protein degradation, genomics, and drug discovery. The proposed research is significant. Our proposed aims
will not only unveil mechanistic insights into the FZD6-mediated PCP pathway in promoting melanoma
metastasis, but serve as proof-of-principle studies for drug development to target this system for melanoma
management. Since the Veteran population are at higher risk of developing malignant melanoma, our work is
relevant and significant to the health care of our Veterans."
10909794,"Acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older veterans is an under-recognized public health emergency for
Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The highest and fastest rising incidence of TBI in the U.S. is in older
adults, mostly due to ground-level falls. Compared with younger patients, older adults with TBI have higher
mortality, lower rates of functional recovery, and may be at especially high risk for post-TBI dementia. Details
of clinical and biological characteristics of older Veterans with acute TBI are incomplete, and insufficient to
implement evidence-based practice guidelines or plan clinical trials. However, pre-existing TBI,
medical/psychiatric conditions, and substance use – common in older Veterans – are emerging risk factors for
sustaining TBI and for worse outcomes after TBI. There is an urgent need to comprehensively characterize
acute TBI in older Veterans presenting to VA hospitals to inform effective interventions to optimize outcomes.
Barriers to progress are: 1) Older adults, especially older Veterans, are underrepresented in acute TBI
research. The 18-site NINDS-funded Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI study (TRACK-
TBI; U01NS086090) had no VA sites and, per protocol, excluded older adults with pre-existing conditions; (2)
Emerging TBI blood-based and neuroimaging biomarkers have not been validated in older Veterans, many
with pre-existing conditions and military relevant exposures that may reduce accuracy. To begin to address
age-related barriers to progress, we received funding from NIH for the Transforming Research and Clinical
Knowledge in Geriatric TBI (TRACK-GERI; R01 NS110944 2019-2024) study, a 5-year 2-site TRACK-TBI
Network prospective cohort of acute geriatric TBI in patients presenting to Level 1 trauma centers. However,
this study will not capture patients who present to VAs or non-trauma center Emergency Departments (ED).
Thus, TRACK-GERI will not elucidate the unique features of geriatric TBI in Veterans presenting with mostly
mild TBI to VA EDs. To fill this gap, we propose to leverage the existing TRACK-TBI Network data and
expertise of our exceptional multi-disciplinary team at SFVA/UCSF to achieve these scientific aims: Aim 1:
Characterize baseline and 12-mo longitudinal clinical features using TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs)
among Veterans age ≥65y enrolled in the TRACK-TBI and TRACK-GERI studies with acute TBI. We will
analyze existing data collected at TRACK-TBI’s 18 non-VA Level 1 trauma centers and explore comparisons to
civilians (existing geriatric cohort data consists of N>60 Veterans, N>250 civilians).Aim 2: Assemble a new
prospective cohort of Veterans age ≥65y presenting to SFVA ED ≤72h after TBI who received CT (“TRACK-
VA”) and deeply phenotype clinical and biological features over 12-months using TBI CDEs. Enroll 70 TBI
patient/study-partner dyads and 30 matched ED controls (with medical/orthopedic conditions discharged from
the ED), perform baseline clinical assessments (pre-injury health, MREs), blood draws (for APOE, proteomic
analysis), brain MRI, and assess longitudinal outcomes at 2wk, 3mo, 6mo, and 12mo post-injury. Aim 3:
Characterize neuroimaging features of acute geriatric TBI in Veterans using TBI CDEs and quantitative
structural and functional MRI. Obtain structural (T1, T2, susceptibility weighted imaging, multi-shell diffusion
imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) and resting-state
functional MRI at 2-wks, 6-mo, and 12-mo post-injury in a sub-set of the TRACK-VA cohort (N=50 TBI; N=25
controls). Characterize acute intracranial trauma on 2-week MRI and characterize longitudinal structural and
functional changes. Aim 4: Determine accuracy of blood-based GFAP, P-tau, Abeta, and NFL for TBI
diagnosis, prognosis of outcome, and disease-monitoring in older Veterans. We will obtain blood at £72h, 6mo,
and 12mo post-injury. This project will comprehensively characterize baseline and longitudinal
endophenotypes of an intentionally heterogeneous, “real-world,” population of older Veterans presenting with
acute TBI. Findings will inform development of effective interventions to optimize outcomes."
10909796,"Military sexual trauma (MST) is unfortunately common in Veterans, particularly in women, and has life-
long consequences for physical and mental health. MST, which includes both sexual assault and harassment,
is strongly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and co-morbid conditions including,
depression, anxiety, substance use, obesity and eating disorders, chronic pain, and autoimmunity. While other
psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety, are associated with inflammation, PTSD is uniquely
associated with a >50% increase in autoimmune disorder prevalence (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, and
inflammatory bowel disease). Exposure to MST further increases the risk of developing an autoimmune
disorder by over two-fold. Although increased peripheral inflammation is well characterized in PTSD, it is
unclear if peripheral inflammation reflects a disruption in immune signaling in the central nervous system
(CNS). Moreover, phenotyping the immune dysregulation that occurs with PTSD has almost exclusively
occurred through cross-sectional data collection. However, without longitudinal studies that track immune
biomarkers in conjunction with symptoms, it is unknown if immune biomarkers have clinical utility in guiding
treatment. Furthermore, while epidemiological data support that trauma disorders, particularly MST, may have
shared risk factors with autoimmune disorders, it is unknown if MST confers unique effects on immune
signaling. Filling these gaps is critical to understanding if and how immune dysregulation contributes to
symptom ""state"" in Veterans with MST to inform its viability as a potential mechanism for targeted treatment.
 This proposal will address these knowledge gaps by quantifying circulating inflammatory cytokines in
Veterans with MST-related PTSD (+MST/+PTSD) and comparing cytokine levels to Veterans without PTSD or
MST. In addition to examining circulating plasma cytokines, we will also measure cytokines and miRNA
isolated from and astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs), which are extracellular vesicles that carry RNA and
protein cargo to the blood from the CNS. Measuring biomarkers from exosome populations derived from CNS-
tissue sources can non-invasively assess neuroinflammation and compare peripheral vs. central inflammation
links to PTSD symptoms. We hypothesize that levels of baseline peripheral (plasma) and central (exosome)
inflammatory markers will be altered in female Veterans with +MST/+PTSD compared to female Veterans
without MST or PTSD. Based on the existing literature of psychoneuroimmunologic correlates of PTSD, we will
quantify IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNFα cytokines from both plasma and exosome cargo using multiplex
arrays. We will also quantify immune regulatory miRNA from exosome cargo. In the +MST/+PTSD group, we
will also collect plasma samples at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits to determine if inflammatory biomarkers are
associated with symptom trajectory across time. A highly stable marker that does not track with symptoms
would suggest it is a marker of risk. In contrast, if a marker changes alongside symptom severity over time, it
may be a marker of mechanisms driving symptom change. We hypothesize that immune marker profiles will
correspond with symptom trajectory over time.
 The biological consequences of MST represent a significant health burden for Veterans, especially
women with already higher MST and autoimmunity rates. Understanding the mechanistic link between MST
and peripheral and central inflammation will inform our understanding of immune disruption as a biomarker for
diagnosis, prognosis, and potential treatment targets. Building on the applicant's experience studying immune
signaling and immune contributions to PTSD risk, the proposed training plan will provide the necessary skills to
independently design and implement novel biomarker-guided approaches to improve patients' lives with
neuropsychiatric illness. Completing the proposed research will further support the VA mission towards
developing precision medicine tools for Veteran care in Women's and mental health."
10906765,"SUMMARY
The ability to distinguish harmful and beneficial microbes is critical for the survival of an organism. Increasing
evidence indicates that gut distension caused by bacterial colonization activates a broad innate immune
response. We propose that microbial colonization and bloating of the intestine may be perceived as a danger
signal that activates an immune fight-and-flight response. This innate immune activation depends on inputs
from the intestine that can aid in the recognition of a broad range of microbes and can modulate host
responses using a neural-gut axis that controls immune homeostasis. This proposal describes experiments
designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the nervous system may sense overall changes in host
physiology during pathogen infections and coordinate innate immune responses. Using the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, we have demonstrated that specific genes and neurons in the nervous system of the
animal control immune responses, indicating that cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act
on non-neural tissues to regulate innate immune responses at the organismal level. We propose the use of a
variety of molecular and genetic techniques to explore the general hypothesis that alterations in host
physiology caused by bacterial infections trigger innate immune responses against bacterial infections that are
controlled at that whole animal level by the nervous system."

10930200,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application proposing the 2-GeneratioN Interventions to ImprOve CardiovascUlaR Health in Indiana and
IllinoiS Through Home Visiting (2-NOURISH) is in response to the RFA “Early Intervention to Promote
Cardiovascular Health of Mothers and Children (ENRICH) Multisite Clinical Center (RFA-HL-22-007)”. Given
growing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality, interventions to optimize maternal cardiovascular health
(CVH) are urgently needed. Poor maternal CVH is also associated with poor offspring CVH. As a result, the
perinatal period is an opportune time to intervene, but evidence-based interventions are limited. Home visiting
(HV) programs serve as an ideal setting to conduct intervention research aimed at improving maternal and
child CVH as they already serve an at-risk population across the United States with a high prevalence of poor
CVH. The proposed Clinical Center, 2-NOURISH, led by Northwestern, in partnership with two evidence-based
HV models (Healthy Families America [HFA] and Parents as Teachers [PAT]), and an evidence-based virtual
platform for lifestyle intervention, Weight Watchers International (WW), is uniquely qualified to participate in all
aspects of the ENRICH Network and to substantially enhance the Network’s goals. In our application, we
demonstrate key prior experiences, which include: (1) long-standing collaborations with HV models, including
MPI Tandon’s evidence-based perinatal depression and stress management intervention (Mothers and
Babies); (2) significant expertise in the development and assessment of maternal and child CVH, particularly
during the perinatal period; and (3) extensive experience with recruitment and retention of diverse populations
for behavior interventions. During the UG3 phase (Years 1-2), we will work collaboratively within the ENRICH
Network to develop a common study protocol, adapt the intervention content, and conduct pilot tests. During
the UH3 phase (Years 3-7), we will recruit 600 mother-child dyads in partnership with 40 HV programs in
Illinois and Indiana within the proposed study timeline to achieve the ENRICH Network Goal of 3000 total
dyads to examine the effectiveness of an implementation-ready, CVH-focused, evidence-based intervention.
We carefully considered potential study designs and propose a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type 1
trial with a cluster randomized design that would randomize at the home visitor-level. Additionally, given the
potential maternal and offspring benefits of intervention during pregnancy, we propose prenatal recruitment.
Our proposed intervention also includes innovative prenatal (promotion of stress management techniques,
home visitor patient navigation) and postpartum (intensive lifestyle intervention with a virtual delivery platform,
peer support) components. Our Clinical Center is additionally committed to developing the skills of Early Stage
Investigators related to clinical trial design and the skills of home visitors related to the construct of CVH, its
components, and the common study protocol. 2-NOURISH is ideally suited to serve as a Clinical Center and
contribute to the Network’s long-term mission to equitably improve maternal and early childhood CVH."
10932505,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
NOVEL ROLE OF NEPHRON EPITHELIALIZATION IN NUCLEAR SIGNALING

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of pediatric end- stage renal disease resulting in the need for kidney transplant. They occur in almost 2% of births, making up nearly one-fourth of all birth defects. However, only 14% of cases have a known genetic cause. Many CAKUT cases result from defects in the formation of nephrons, which are composed of epithelial tubules that are required for the proper function of the kidney. Prior studies indicate that disruption of either the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway or exocyst vesicle complex result in malformation of the nephric tubules, indicating that these components are required for proper tubule formation. In our previous studies, we evaluated how tubulogenesis is facilitated through the PCP and exocyst complexes independently. We investigated distinct models by which Daam1, a formin protein that assembles actin filaments as part of the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, and Dnmbp/Tuba, which regulates exocytic vesicle targeting, facilitate tubulogenesis by promoting the generation of cell-cell contacts between nephron progenitor cells. We discovered a novel mechanism that utilizes the Wnt/PCP formin protein Daam1 to drive cell junction formation between nephron progenitor cells to generate tubules by polymerizing actin to stabilize cadherin at adherens junctions. Additionally, our results indicate that the exocyst-associated component Dnmbp facilitates the targeting of junctional components to initiate formation of these cell contacts between nephron progenitors. Despite this progress, we do not understand how the formation of cell-cell contacts influences the developmental processes of tubule epithelialization and morphogenesis in developing nephrons. To address this significant question, we will build upon on our important discoveries to evaluate how cell junction formation impacts the development of the nephric tubules by: 1) Identifying how the interaction between Daam1 and Dnmbp regulates cell-cell contact formation between nephron progenitors and 2) Determining whether Daam1’s role in junction formation regulates beta-catenin’s junctional versus Wnt signaling roles during nephrogenesis. Overall, the experiments proposed in this application will facilitate a new understanding of how cells interact and communicate to carry out tubulogenesis that has relevance in multiple organ systems. The quantitative evaluation of cell biological mechanisms involved in nephric development is a new area of study that will contribute valuable insights into epithelialization and morphogenesis mechanisms underlying tubulogenic processes."
10923785,"CDA Overview: This application proposes a mentored training program supporting Dr. Maya O’Neil’s
development into an independent VA Rehabilitation Research & Development (RR&D) investigator with
expertise in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cognitive rehabilitation, and behavioral clinical trial methods.
Dr. O’Neil is a licensed psychologist at the Portland VA, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Medical
Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), and recent K scholar.
Training: Dr. O’Neil will increase expertise in PTSD and cognitive rehabilitation research, enhance skill in the
conduct of behavioral clinical trials, and learn how to use VA resources (e.g., Corporate Data Warehouse,
CDW) to support trials. The training plan integrates formal coursework, content trainings, and mentor guidance.
Mentors: Dr. Daniel Storzbach, Portland VA Director of Neuropsychology, Associate Professor of Psychiatry
and Neurology at OHSU; Dr. Kathleen Carlson, Core Investigator at the RR&D National Center for
Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) and Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) Center of
Innovation (COIN), PI of the Portland Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma study site; Dr. Elizabeth Twamley, VA
rehabilitation researcher, Professor of Psychiatry at UCSD, Director of the Clinical Research Unit of the Center
of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health at the San Diego VA, lead author of Compensatory Cognitive
Training (CCT); and Dr. Nina Sayer, Associate Director of the HSR&D COIN and PI of the Minneapolis VA
EBP4PTSD CREATE, and Associate Professor of Medicine and Psychiatry at University of Minnesota.
Project Background: PTSD is associated with deficits in cognitive functioning including memory, learning,
processing speed, concentration, attention, and executive functioning. Though many Veterans benefit from
evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP) for PTSD, there is little research examining the extent to which cognitive
problems are present before and after EBP and are related to change in PTSD symptoms, quality of life, and
functioning. Dr. O’Neil’s pilot research suggests that many Veterans have cognitive functioning deficits even
after completing EBP for PTSD, though there are no evidence-based treatments for these Veterans. CCT is
improves cognitive functioning in Veterans with brain injury history, but is not yet tested in Veterans with PTSD.
Project Aims: The proposed studies will (1) determine the types and magnitude of cognitive problems and
changes in cognitive functioning following EBP and (2) evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and participant
characteristics, and estimate effect sizes, in a pilot test of CCT for Veterans with PTSD-related cognitive
problems. Data from these studies will form the basis for a RR&D Merit submission testing the effectiveness of
CCT for cognitive problems in Veterans with PTSD in a clinical trial during year 4 of the CDA.
Project Methods: We will recruit Veterans from local VA mental health clinics, using the CDW to identify
potentially eligible Veterans if needed. For Study 1, we will examine cognitive functioning, mental health
symptoms, and quality of life in 150 Veterans before and after EBP for PTSD. In Study 2, we will compare CCT
vs. treatment as usual for 36 Veterans with PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits. We will calculate rates
of recruitment, retention, and intervention participation. Statistical significance will be examined, though our
focus will be on effect size estimates, score ranges, and variability to plan for a follow-up, fully powered RCT.
Anticipated Impact: PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits are a significant problem for many Veterans.
CCT is an effective cognitive rehabilitation intervention for Veterans with a history of brain injury, but VA
clinicians need data on its effectiveness for Veterans with PTSD-related cognitive functioning deficits. These
studies will provide the data necessary for a larger scale RCT proposal which will be pursued during the fourth
year of the CDA if results show that CCT is as promising as expected for Veterans with PTSD."

10919089,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In 2017, there were ~750,000 US patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who required chronic
hemodialysis (HD). The ESKD population in the USA is increasing at the rate of 3% per year. Vascular access
through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is required for optimal HD and clearance of uremic toxins. The patency
of AVFs at one year is estimated to be only 62%. Venous stenosis, which occurs because of venous neointimal
hyperplasia (VNH), is responsible for the majority of AVF failures. Over three billion dollars are spent annually to
maintain the function of hemodialysis AVFs. There are no therapies which can prevent AVF VS. Effective, non-
invasive methods that reduce AVF venous stenosis would be of tremendous benefit to patients with ESKD.
Pavaj Vascular is developing and commercializing a novel therapy that can prevent AVF venous stenosis. We
have published data showing that VS/VNH in AVF is associated with increased expression of immediate early
response genes (Iex-1/Ier3) in clinical specimens with failed HD AVFs. Experimentally, Iex-1-/- mice (genetic
engineered animals that lack Iex-1) with AVFs have less VS/VNH than control mice. Iex-1 expression is down-
regulated by the calciotropic hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25), the active form of Vitamin D3, which is used in CKD
patients for calcium homeostasis. Oral administration of 1,25 vitamin D3 does not reduce AVF VS and does
cause hypercalcemia. Adventitial delivery of nanoparticles composed of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)
encapsulated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25 NP) in a thermosensitive hydrogel to the AVF outflow vein reduces VS/VNH
in mice and pigs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without hypercalcemia. Furthermore, we have shown that in
mice and pigs, adventitial delivery of 1,25 NP reduces Iex-1 expression and increases blood flow by reducing
VNH. These data suggest that 1,25 NP may be a useful treatment for improving maturation and preventing
VS/VNH in AVF.
Pavaj Vascular will use the direct phase II SBIR to complete two main goals:
1) Evaluate the Stability and Biocompatibility of GMP grade 1,25 NP.
2) Determine the long-term efficacy of 1,25 NP on reducing AVF VS/VNH using a porcine model with CKD.
Successful completion of this proposal will allow us to obtain data needed to apply for FDA Investigational New
Drug (IND) approval to perform First in Man studies to evaluate this promising technology.

particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, are also home to over two thirds of the global population of people
with HIV (PWH). HIV increases the risk of COPD and COPD-associated mortality, but the mechanisms
underlying this risk are incompletely understood, which in turn limits our ability to identify PWH at the highest
risk of developing COPD. Elucidating mechanisms that lead to COPD in PWH in LMICs is particularly
important, as an estimated one third of COPD cases in LMICs are not attributable to known COPD risk factors.
Systemic inflammation is associated with disease severity in COPD and impaired lung function in PWH, but it
is unknown if inflammatory pathways affecting lung function in PWH are distinct from those in people without
HIV. Furthermore, most data on inflammation in PWH and impaired lung function were generated by
measuring a limited number of cytokines, which yields an incomplete picture of the inflammatory pathways
involved. Microbial communities in the lung, gut, and oral cavity are also altered in patients with COPD and
data from the US suggest a causal link between the microbiome and COPD among PWH. Host-microbe
interactions likely explain the association between microbiome alterations and COPD in PWH, but these
interactions are not fully understood, particularly in LMIC populations that face the greatest COPD-associated
morbidity and mortality. Using my experience with microbiome analysis and the pulmonary research
infrastructure I built in Botswana, I will incorporate shotgun metagenomic sequencing of multiple microbial
communities (saliva, sputum, stool), host transcriptomics, and untargeted metabolomics to characterize the
effect of host-microbiome interactions on pulmonary function in a longitudinal cohort of adults with and without
HIV in Botswana. I will collect clinical, demographic, and spirometry data from 500 adults with chronic
respiratory symptoms (250 PWH, 250 HIV-uninfected) and will then collect specimens and spirometry every six
months for 24 months in a stratified random sample of 200 adults. Specimens will be shipped to Duke
University for DNA and RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry based metabolomics in advanced core
facilities. I will use advanced statistical methods that incorporate machine learning to identify unique host
pathways associated with microbiome composition in PWH and COPD and develop and validate a predictive
model to identify PWH and COPD. This proposal will advance our understanding of how host-microbiome
interactions affect inflammation and pulmonary function in PWH, thus addressing a key priority for the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Furthermore, this proposal will establish a clinical cohort and robust
biorepository that, coupled with our findings, will support future studies to validate microbiome and
metabolomics-based biomarkers for COPD risk stratification and disease progression in PWH."

Falls and fall-related injuries are a growing public health concern, particularly in regions of the
world in which high proportions of the population are elderly. When older adults are affected with
neurological conditions such as stroke, neuropathies, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,
Alzheimer's disease, the risk for falling increases substantially. Falls and the resulting fear of falls
can mark the beginning of a decline in function, participation in social activities, and
independence, thus negatively affecting the quality of life. One in three people over the age of 65
years who are living in the community experience at least one fall each year. About 10% of these
falls are associated with serious injuries such as traumatic brain injury and hip fractures. Injuries
resulting from falls are the leading cause of hospitalization and financial hardships in older adults.
Loss of balance is one of the common precipitants of falls. Interventions in the form of walking,
cycling, structured exercises, and general medications are available, but do not significantly
reduce the risk of falling.
Older adults often have alterations in the brain balance circuit that cause ineffective responses to
prevent a fall when balance is challenged. In this proposal, we present early data from human
studies in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was guided by magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI] and electroencephalography [EEG] to focus on the supplementary motor area in
elderly subjects with balance disorders. These data show that the balance-circuit activation
patterns in those elderly patients changed to patterns resembling young healthy subjects, and
that short-term balance was improved (long-term balance improvement was not evaluated). Our
aim in the proposed Phase I project is to conduct a more comprehensive clinical study of these
guided TMS methods in the treatment of balance deficits in elderly patients with a history of falls.
If we are technically successful in this Phase I project, we intend to conduct Phase II definitive
studies that will validate the science to the satisfaction of the Food and Drug Administration. We
would then commercialize the technology by streamlining workflow and increasing patient access
through the fusion of the MRI, EEG, and TMS functionalities into a single compact mobile device
(aimed at treating balance deficits and other neurological disorders of the elderly). The new
balance-treatment device could be placed in geriatric or otolaryngology clinics, driven to patient's
homes, or rotated among nursing home facilities."

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is commonly used for the management of a broad spectrum of more
than 100 indications, including chronic wounds, acute open wounds, burns, and post operative care. An
estimated 6.5 million patients suffer from chronic wounds and an estimated 48 million inpatient surgeries are
performed each year in the US. NPWT involves covering a wound with an airtight dressing, sealed by
adhesive, and applying sub-atmospheric pressure. If the NPWT drape is not strongly adhered, maceration of
tissue surrounding the wound due to leaking exudate can increase the wound size and slow the healing,
eventually leading to the loss of the adherence of the drape to the skin. However, strong adhesives substantially
increase the chances for medical adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI) during drape removal/changes.
NPWT patients are highly susceptible to this type of secondary trauma. For single use NPWT applications the
estimated MARSI incidence rate is between 1-10% whereas serial NPWT users experience MARSI >20% of the
time; however, an acceptable MARSI rate should be zero. Studies show that the type of drape used corelates
with the amount of acute pain during dressing changes and additional injury to the peri-wound tissue, which
can delay the wound healing process. Atraumatic dressings reduce patient pain and stress burden but
attempts to develop a product that adheres well yet is easily removed have fallen short. Addressing this
unmet need, Global Biomedical Technologies has developed an adhesive acrylic NPWT drape that
incorporates innovative ester oligomers that release from the skin via the application of isopropyl alcohol. The
underlying technology is a pressure sensitive bioengineered medical adhesive made with oligo (glycerol
sebacate) and polyacrylate. This painless adhesive technology, “Comfort Release®,” has been demonstrated
to result in high patient satisfaction and decreased nursing time in bandage and tape applications. This
project will validate the superior functionality and acceptability of Comfort Release® NPWT drapes against
the state-of-the art (V.A.C. drape by KCI Technologies, Inc.) in both single-use and serial-use NPWT applications.
Specific Aims of this Direct-to-Phase II are as follows: 1) Compare performance of Comfort Release® drapes
with V.A.C. drapes in single-use NPWT applications in a randomized controlled trial. Post-surgical patients
(n=200) will be enrolled at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center. 2) Compare
performance of Comfort Release® drapes with V.A.C. drapes in serial-use NPWT applications in a randomized
controlled trial. Chronic wound patients (n=100) will be enrolled at Weil Cornell Medical Center where they will
undergo 3 NPWT drape changes per week. At each dressing change and on final dressing removal,
qualitative data will be collected from clinicians participating in each aim to assess clinician acceptability of the
Comfort Release® drape. Successful completion of this project is expected to yield the data needed to support a
510K FDA clearance."

This proposal responds directly to the purpose of the RFA-MD-23-003 SBIR Funding Opportunity Announcement
(FOA). Nearly 44 million Americans experience hearing loss, but as much as 86% of adults who could benefit
from hearing aid devices (HAD) do not use them. Untreated hearing loss is almost twice as prevalent in rural
areas. More than 46 million people live in rural America, but these communities face significant barriers and
delays in accessing care and experience a lack of providers for audiology services. The average retail price of
HADs was $4,700, making it prohibitively expensive for the rural and minority populations who have lower
incomes. Hearing loss is also highly prevalent in black and Latino/Hispanic communities and growing, but older
black adults were 58% and Mexican American older adults were 78% less likely to use HADs, due to reasons of
high cost and lack of insurance coverage. Aside from cost, concerns about comfort, effectiveness and
satisfaction are the other significant barriers to HAD usage. The FDA made over-the-counter (OTC) HADs a
reality in 2022, creating a new hearing option for many adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. The
introduction of OTC HADs is set to increase accessibility and affordability of hearing care for underserved
populations.
A common complaint of HAD users is the HAD inability to reduce ambient background noise completely, instead,
the background noise is amplified along with the human voice. Speech enhancement algorithms continue to be
developed and the most advanced found on high-end costly HAD platforms. This project will develop machine
learning (ML) based smartphone software with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), to bring these advanced speech
enhancement and noise reduction algorithms to the OTC HAD users. With smartphone assistive software and
the predictive power of ML, our proposed solution to reduce background noise and enhance speech, will
significantly improve OTC HAD accessibility, affordability, and acceptance, thus benefitting the rural and minority
populations the most."

10931766,"Abstract
In the intensive care unit (ICU), enteral nutrition (EN) is a critical component of care that provides both nutritional
and non-nutritional benefits including decreased risk of infection, shorter hospital stay and decreased risk of
mortality. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million feeding tubes (FTs) are used each year in the United States
to deliver EN. Hospital and critical care admittance increase with age resulting in patients older than 65 years
being the largest subpopulation within the ICU to benefit from rapid and consistent EN. The current gold standard
method for FT placement, blind bedside insertion, results in first attempt placement failure in 8-60% (Average
32.3%) of cases, which can result in the distal tip lying in the respiratory tract, esophagus or lung. While lung
placement occurs in 1-3% of overall FT placements, the incidence is an order of magnitude higher at 13-20% in
high-risk patients including critical ill-, older- or mechanically ventilated-patients due to delayed patient response,
weakened coughing reflex and altered mental status. If undetected, these misplacements can lead to serious
patient harm. As such, x-ray verification is required to confirm the correct FT positioning. With the high rate of
failed attempts, the inherent delays associated with repeated x-rays not only add to personnel time and health
care costs but can lead to suboptimal outcomes for patients where early EN is critical. Smart FT systems have
been developed to provide real-time visualization during FT insertion. While they have demonstrated a reduction
in the number of confirmatory XRays and a benefit with respect to earlier EN, there remains significant risk as
operators have failed to accurately identify airway insertion resulting in patient injury and death. Further, once
placed, unintentional FT dislodgement occurs in as many as 33-63% of FTs which requires routine verification
resulting in increased cost and delayed EN. Thus, there is still an urgent need for a smart FT that is an easy-to-
use, inexpensive, and comprehensive solution for patient EN care. TheraNova has developed the Entarik
System, a low-cost enteral feeding system that provides real-time confirmation of FT location at the bedside for
both insertion guidance and dislodgement management. Through the support from our Phase I and Phase II
SBIR awards we have made substantial progress. The Entarik System is validated for (1) accurate classification
of the airway, esophagus and stomach, (2) accurate dislodgement detection and (3) reliable, durable
performance for the FT lifetime. Entarik was recently awarded 510k clearance by the FDA. In this proposal, we
will prepare for commercialization through three specific aims. First, we will verify detection of shallow airway
insertion (prior to an insertion depth that would induce harm) in intubated patients ventilated with heated and
humidified air (Aim 1). Second, we will design a second-generation (Gen 2) FT with improved reduced cost of
goods sold (COGS) to enable commercial launch (Aim 2). Finally, we will complete verification and validation
testing and submit a new 510(k) application to the FDA for the Gen 2 system (Aim 3). The successful completion
of these aims will enable commercialization of a cost effective solution within ~2 years of funding from this
proposal."
10930155,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 5.8 million adults age 60 and over in the United States live with Alzheimer disease and related
dementias (AD/ADRD) at a cost of $290 billion per year. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an
intermediate stage between typical aging and dementia, are 3-5 times more likely to progress to AD than those
with normal cognition. Late-life engagement in cognitively challenging activities is associated with decreased
risk of cognitive decline, and there is a need to address cognitive inactivity. Music interventions are a
promising strategy to address late-life cognitive inactivity. Music training can change brain structure and
function in non-musician adults, thereby leading to cognitive, perceptual, and psychosocial advantages. These
changes in cognitive function are thought to occur because the multimodal, complex nature of music facilitates
training-induced neural plasticity. However, the mechanisms are not yet understood, and most studies used
traditional or rote keyboard training techniques. Music training based on improvisation principles—the
spontaneous generation of musical melodies and rhythms—will likely have more potent effects on cognition
and brain function. Improvisation facilitates cognitive flexibility, self-monitoring, novel idea generation,
execution of unplanned motor sequences and entrance into a state of flow. Biologically, improvisation is
associated with distinct neural patterns involving activation of prefrontal networks and other brain networks that
are affected by aging. As a mechanism of behavior change, it is likely that improvisation training will uniquely
improve self-regulation (the ability to monitor and control one's own behavior, emotions, or thoughts and
modify to situational demands). Yet, no research has tested whether improvisation training can improve self-
regulation and facilitate maintenance of cognitively challenging activities among older adults with and without
MCI. This project will develop and test the effects and mechanisms of a music improvisation training
intervention on self-regulation of older adults with and without MCI. Our overall hypothesis is that improvisation
training will lead to improvements in self-regulation, compared to controls, and that improvisation training will
be associated with specific changes in prefrontal brain networks and ultimately cognitive engagement. Our
project has two phases. In the R61 phase, we will develop a music improvisation training intervention that aims
to improve self-regulation among older adults with and without MCI and conduct a 2-arm randomized pilot
study to (i) examine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods and (ii) determine its
effects on the hypothesized mechanism of self-regulation. If milestones are met, we will proceed to the R33
phase and conduct a randomized mechanistic trial to examine the effects of the intervention, compared to an
attention control, on self-regulation and cognitive engagement among older adults with and without MCI. The
findings from this study will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how music training
interventions can facilitate behavior change to maintain health of older adults."

10931859,"Project Summary/Abstract: The degree to which behavioral variation is shaped by experiences or determined
by heritability has long captivated biologists and non-biologists alike. It is now clear that behavior often has
a genetic component, but mapping specific genetic variants underlying differences in behavior remains a major
challenge. Recent advances in “-omics” technologies and analytical tools provide an exciting opportunity to
uncover connections between genetic and behavioral variation. Parental care is a complex behavioral trait that
has independently evolved many times across the animal kingdom. The neural, physiological, and molecular
mechanisms of maternal (female-provided) care have been widely studied and appear to be highly conserved
across deep evolutionary time. Yet, there remains a critical gap in our understanding of the mechanisms of
paternal (male-provided) care. The small stream fishes commonly called darters provide a unique opportunity to
investigate the genetic and evolutionary drivers of paternal care. Darters comprise the most diverse group of
vertebrates in North America and exhibit ample variation in reproductive behavior. Paternal care has evolved
repeatedly among evolutionarily independent darter lineages and has also been secondarily lost in at least one
species. Our goal over this five-year project is to use the darter system we developed to study the biological
basis of evolved differences in paternal care. We will leverage natural replication in this system to test the
hypothesis that similar genetic and molecular changes underlie the evolution of this behavior in darters. Our lab
has pioneered the development of genomic resources and functional genetic tools for darters, which will serve
as a platform for the proposed work. First, we will take advantage of the fact that closely related darter species
with and without paternal care can form viable crosses to produce fine-scale genetic maps for paternal care
behavior. Second, will use our previously developed bioinformatic pipelines to conduct genome scans for
selection and identify genes repeatedly under positive selection only in species that have evolved paternal care.
Additionally, we will ask whether these same genes show signatures of relaxed selection in a species that
secondarily lost paternal care. Third, we will investigate the neural and transcriptional basis of paternal care
using an approach for molecular profiling of behaviorally relevant neurons that we recently developed in darters.
The proposed work will be complimentary to other lines of research in the lab aimed at applying population
genomic, quantitative genetic, and functional genetic methods in darters and other fish models to test
fundamental evolutionary hypotheses and uncover genotype-phenotype connections. This innovative project will
bridge behavioral neuroscience and evolutionary genomics – fields which have historically remained largely
siloed and limited to model systems – to investigate the mechanistic basis of evolved differences in behavior in
natural populations, setting the stage for a highly integrative, cutting-edge research program."
10933184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our proposed research will utilize tissue generated from funded studies and employ transcriptomics and
proteomics to precisely characterize how the sclera is affected in myopia, directly addressing several objectives
of the NEI’s strategic plan regarding the “from genes to disease mechanisms” area of emphasis. This supplement
proposal addresses a missed opportunity in our funded work that can be addressed with much of the current
resources, providing the first comprehensive cellular and molecular dataset for rhesus monkey ocular structures
to aid in the development of novel therapies for myopia. For reasons not well understood, a significant and rapidly
increasing proportion of the population develops myopia, or nearsightedness. Because of structural changes
that take place as the eye becomes myopic, even low degrees of myopia pose a significant risk for numerous
blinding conditions. Myopia is now one of the leading causes of permanent visual impairment in the world and
represents a substantial economic burden. Billions of dollars are spent annually on optical corrections and
pathologies caused by myopia. The long-term goal of our research program is to provide a better understanding
of the etiology of the most common form of myopia, juvenile-onset myopia, and to develop effective treatment
strategies that reduce the burden of myopia. Little is known about transcriptomic and other phenotypic changes
in the primate sclera, which limits the ability to develop novel treatments and translate these towards clinical
practice. Since fibroblasts, the primary cell type in sclera, mediate the scleral remodeling that ultimately leads to
myopic axial ocular elongation, this fundamental knowledge gap also hinders development of scleral fibroblast-
centric molecular interventions for preventing myopia. Our findings will provide a comprehensive foundation for
examining scleral mechanisms during myopia and have the potential to identify novel scleral targets to treat
myopia in children. Our purpose is to generate knowledge that can be applied to the human eye; however, many
of the required experiments cannot be conducted in humans. Therefore, these experiments will be conducted
using non-human primates. Here, controlled rearing strategies, rigorous optical and biometric measurements
and molecular techniques, including single cell sequencing, will be used to determine: 1) which cell types in the
sclera respond to experimental myopia and 2) molecular changes in the extracellular matrix of sclera in response
to experimental myopia. Our study combines many approaches across different disciplines (genomics, cell and
molecular biology, and mass spectrometry) to produce the most complete description of scleral changes in
myopia. Results of these studies will potentially provide the scientific foundation for novel treatment and
management strategies for the most common forms of myopia in children to prevent and slow the progression
of myopia, increase quality of life, reduce the risk of associated pathologies, and decrease the economic burden
caused by myopia."
10933434,"Project Summary
 Single-cell imaging can quantify intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of gene regulation that underly
important biomedical process ranging from bacterial infections to cancer. This gene regulation is subject to
complexities and randomness of biological processes, and its observation is further subject to measurement
artifacts due to inefficiencies in biochemical labels and distortions in microscope imaging. Yet, despite these
complications, preliminary work shows that it is possible to integrate data and computational models to predict
gene regulation in myriad environmental and genetic conditions provided that: (1) models must be constrained
by informative and reproducible data, (2) models must be rigorously verified to account for biological and
technical variations, and (3) models must be systematically explored to quantify uncertainties. The overarching
hypothesis of this project is that spatial and temporal fluctuations observed in subcellular dynamics contain
unique information that can be unlocked with improved computational methods and model-guided experiments.
To test this hypothesis, this project will create a new research platform to be known as the single-cell Graphical
Utility to Interpret and Design Experiments. scGUIDE will combine experimental analysis (e.g., image processing
and single-particle tracking to extract quantitative data from fluorescence microscopy experiments), spatial
stochastic simulation (e.g., reaction-diffusion models to generate realistic videos to mimic cellular experiments),
model abstraction and identification (e.g., parameter inference and uncertainty quantification to translate
quantitative observations into predictive insight), and experiment design (e.g., statistical methods to pinpoint
which specific experimental conditions are most likely to reveal new biological insight).
 To demonstrate its broad capabilities, scGUIDE will be used to analyze and design single-cell
experiments for four different health-related processes. In yeast, the project will examine the coordination
between stress-activated MAPK dynamics and Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) subunits that control
chromatin and RNA transcription/transport dynamics, and which have been implicated in carcinoma, skeletal
dysplasia, and retinal degeneration. In human cells, the project will examine the spatiotemporal clustering and
phosphorylation of RNAP Polymerase II as it engages in single-gene transcription under CDK-inhibitor cancer
treatments. In osteosarcoma cells, the project will explore how competition for local tRNA resources affects
translation of single-mRNA molecules in different sub-cellular regions and in human and viral contexts. Finally,
the project will explore the effects that epigenetic memory and molecular competition have on the multi-
generational activation or repression of the pap operon that allows E. coli to establish uropathogenic infections.
Each project will build mechanistic and quantitatively predictive models for how spatial and temporal interactions
of transcription or translation factors, enzymes, and complex molecular machines combine with environmental
influences to regulate expression at the single-gene, single-mRNA, single-cell, and population levels."

 Francesca Cottini, MD, is a Tenure-eligible Assistant Professor in the Division of Hematology,
Department of Internal Medicine (70% research, 30% clinical) at The Ohio State University Comprehensive
Cancer Center. Dr. Cottini’s career goal is to become an independent and productive physician scientist whose
research will combine aspects of multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis and tumor immunology to develop
tailored therapies for MM patients.
 MM is an incurable disease that affects vulnerable adults causing high healthcare costs and poor quality
of life. No tailored therapies exist to treat patients with MM, despite major differences in terms of genetic
abnormalities, gene expression profiles, or immune signatures. To fill this gap, Dr. Cottini has identified a surface
marker, named CD56, which is present in 70 percent of patients and is associated with poor prognosis. Thus
far, Dr. Cottini has demonstrated the feasibility of her project with strong preliminary data, showing that CD56
promotes MM growth and tumor escape from the immune system. The main objective of Dr. Cottini’s K08
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms associated with CD56 protumoral phenotype in terms of: 1. MM
growth; 2. resistance to anti-MM therapies; 3. regulation of oxidative stress; and 4. escape from natural killer
(NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The final step of Dr. Cottini’s proposal is to find strategies to promote CD56
degradation in MM and induce tumor regression. This knowledge will lead to science-driven clinical trials and
improve outcomes in high-risk CD56 positive MM patients.
 To support her pathway to independence, Dr. Cottini has established a mentoring committee consisting
of: Drs. Don Benson MD, PhD (Primary Mentor: expertise in MM biology, tumor immunology, and translational
and clinical science), Yiping Yang MD, PhD (co-Mentor: expertise in tumor immunology, grant writing, and
leadership skills), Bei Liu, PhD (Advisory Committee Member: expertise in MM murine animal models), and
Natarajan Muthusamy, DVM, PhD (Advisory Committee Member: expertise in signaling and translational
science). She will also take advantages of two additional collaborators, with experience in genomics (Dr. Pearlly
Yan) and drug development (Dr. Gerard Hilinski). She formulated a career development plan with objectives of
(1) learning skills in tumor immunology, drug development, and animal models; (2) developing knowledge in the
analysis and interpretation of genomic data and design of correlatives for clinical trials; (3) improving expertise
in leadership, grant writing, and team management. These objectives will complement Dr. Cottini’s current
knowledge to help achieving independence as a physician scientist in the field of MM. To conclude, Dr. Cottini’s
studies have the potential to identify therapeutic options based on disease characteristics and hence improve
outcomes and reduce toxicities in patients."

pericardial access procedure for epicardial ablation of the heart. The current standard of care for
these patients is fluoroscopically guided pericardial access. Unfortunately, tissues layers and key
cardiac structures are not easily visible under fluoroscopy leading to accidental needle stick with
ventricular puncture and excessive pericardial bleeding in 10% of cases. In low volume centers,
complications are even more common, and cardiothoracic surgeons are on-site to perform
emergency surgery if necessary. There is a clear unmet clinical need for a device to enable safe,
consistent, pericardial access as an alternative to fluoroscopic guidance.
The goal of this Phase I STTR project is to demonstrate superior pericardial access with resulting
epicardial mapping and ablation using color imaging as compared to fluoroscopically guided
procedures (standard of care). To achieve this goal, we will complete the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop the next generation PeriScope device and demonstrate usability and compatibility
with fluoro-free epicardial mapping. We will 1) reduce PeriScope’s access needle to 18G while
maintaining high image resolution image quality and 2) develop a color imaging introducer to
visualize ablation catheters entering the pericardial space. These innovations will enable a
fluoroless pericardial access procedure which will be validated in a 24 subject usability study.
Aim 2: Demonstrate improved pericardial access in an acute in vivo study. We will compare
pericardial access with resulting epicardial mapping and ablation using the fluoro-free PeriScope
tool to fluoroscopically guided procedures. We will compare procedure times and safety as
measured by 1) number of pericardial access attempts, 2) severity of complications, 3) number
of heart perforations, and 4) resulting volume of pericardial bleeding.
 This research could have a transformative impact in changing current clinical practice by
converting a challenging fluoroscopically guided procedure to a more intuitive and safe color
imaging technique. While this study focuses on pericardial access for epicardial ablation, the
technique could also be used to deliver epicardial pacing and defibrillation therapies for infants
and children with congenital heart disease, as well as benefit thousands of adult patients who
have indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy but do not achieve successful implantation
due to lack of transvenous access or adequate coronary sinus venous tributaries."

Cocaine and methamphetamine-related deaths have risen steeply in the United States, the majority associated
with fentanyl. Stimulant use is prevalent among people living with or at risk for HIV, and in this population, it is
unknown what proportion of mixed stimulant-opioid overdose deaths are due to unintentional fentanyl
exposure. As overdose deaths threaten gains in life expectancy among PWH in recent years, we need to use
all available tools at our disposal to prevent unintentional opioid exposure and overdose. We propose a novel
concept of opioid overdose pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for individuals using stimulants and living with or
at risk for HIV. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of a long-acting injectable opioid antagonist
(intramuscular naltrexone) vs. a conventional in-clinic harm reduction bundle, with stratified randomization
based on baseline antiretroviral therapy delivery strategy (i.e., injectable vs. oral HIV prevention/treatment).
Our three key objectives are: 1) investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of
intramuscular naltrexone as a preventive measure for opioid overdose in individuals using stimulants, 2)
capture the experiences of patients receiving concurrent long-acting injectable medicines for HIV and
substance use, 3) employ short and long-term biomarkers of substance use, supplemented by participant
interviews, to craft an epidemiological profile detailing intentional and unintentional opioid exposure among
individuals living with or at risk of HIV. Our creative approach repurposes intramuscular naltrexone,
conventionally used for opioid and/or alcohol use disorders, as an innovative method for opioid overdose
prevention. This trial will be performed at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) at San Francisco
General Hospital’s Ward 86 clinic, home to the largest known cohort of people who use drugs receiving long-
acting injectable HIV treatment/prevention. San Francisco county's high per capita overdose death rate
underscores the urgent need for our research, and our study promises to provide valuable insights into the
interplay of HIV prevention/treatment, stimulant use, and opioid overdose prevention.

Despite the high global prevalence of knee osteoarthritis (OA), treatment options have been limited to symptom
management and total joint replacement in large part because the mechanisms driving knee OA remain poorly
understood. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that non-coding genetic variation is a major
contributor to knee OA disease-risk; however, the LD structure of human genomes, the long-range nature of
transcriptional regulation, and the lack of genome-editable and biologically accurate systems in which to study
OA have created a bottleneck that hinders our ability to translate GWAS findings into new treatments. The
overall objective of this proposal is to identify putative causal knee OA risk variants, map them to their target
genes, and quantify their phenotypic impact in chondrocytes. We will identify regulatory regions activated
in response to cartilage degradation (Aim 1), map regulatory loci and GWAS variants to their target genes
(Aim 2), and quantify the phenotypic impacts of knee OA-associated variants using an ex vivo model of the
chondrocyte OA phenotype (Aim 3). This work will break down existing barriers in knee OA genetics, improve
our mechanistic understanding of knee OA, and provide new risk genes for further study and therapeutic
development."

By 12th grade, over 50% of adolescents in the United States endorse lifetime substance use. Childhood
adversity is a prevalent and robust risk factor for adolescent substance use. Approximately 54% of adolescents
report adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), making them over 1.5 times more likely to use substances. Yet,
many adolescents with ACEs deny substance use engagement, implying the existence of modifiable risk
factors. Using an integrative model of ecological and laboratory approaches, the proposed study examines the
role of affect in the link between ACEs and adolescent substance use. Candidate: The candidate is a clinical
child psychologist with a long-standing commitment to studying risk and resilience associated with early life
stress. Her prior research has focused on elucidating mechanisms that contribute to substance use in
emerging adults with ACEs. She is applying for a five-year K08 Career Development Award to expand her
expertise and support her training, mentorship, and research in adolescent substance use. Training: The
proposed training plan includes formal workshops, seminars, conferences, directed readings, and mentored
experiences that will advance her trajectory toward research independence by fostering new expertise in: (1)
highly rigorous and cutting edge laboratory-based physiological techniques, including eye tracking, pupil
dilation, galvanic skin response, and heart rate measurement, (2) the collection, management, and analysis of
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, (3) advanced analytical approaches to integrate multimethod
research designs, (4) the design and implementation of adolescent substance use research, and (5) enhanced
professional development. The candidate is institutionally supported by The Miriam Hospital and The Warren
Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Mentoring: Five well-established researchers serve as mentors on
this proposal. Each mentor offers complementary expertise consistent with the study’s aims and training
objectives, including advanced data analytic techniques, EMA, childhood traumatic stress, laboratory-based
bio-behavioral assessment, and adolescent substance use research. Research: The proposed study will
recruit adolescent participants (N=100, ages 13-18) from an active longitudinal study (R01HD104187). Using
EMA, eye tracking, behavioral task performance, and traditional self-report data, the aims of the proposal are
to: examine the indirect effects of ACEs on substance use via affect balance (Aim 1), tolerance of affective
distress (Aim 2), and attention/reactivity to affective stimuli (Aim 3)."
10907018,"The relationship between structure and function is central to understanding how many biological and
chemical processes operate, across length scales from small molecule chemicals to gross anatomy. Through
an explosion in new technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and multiplexed tissue
imaging (MTI), tissues can now be visualized with incredible molecular and cellular detail. However, such rich
atlases of tissue structure are typically static snapshots from a ﬁxed sample, and lack important information
about how the tissue actually functions — how cells, ﬂuids, and biomolecules dynamically interact to govern
multicellular behaviors. Our project aims to overcome this limitation by building an integrated computational
and experimental platform for quantitatively linking functional dynamics within tissue to a high-resolution
spatial map of its molecular and cellular composition. As a result, the project aims to produce Molecular
proﬁling of Tissue Dynamics (MOTID) as a generalizable method that links structure with function in
multicellular communities, designed to be applicable across diverse models, tissue-types, and dynamic
readouts. In this project, we aim for MOTID to be capable of simultaneously monitoring the dynamic
morphology and migration of a substantial fraction all cells within a tissue region, combined with the ﬂuid-
phase movement of particular molecules moving from microvascular circulation through interstitium. Highly
multiplexed imaging of the same tissue, guided by interactive statistical mining of complementary genomic
data, will reveal immunologically-deﬁned cell-type identities that correspond to the observed dynamic
behavior. Thus, MOTID will provide a functional atlas that correlates cellular and ﬂuid dynamics with molecular
markers of cell state. As proof of principle applications upon which to validate the technology, we will
examine dynamic behaviors in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the beating heart, and a
genetically engineered model of malignant melanoma. To accomplish the successful development of MOTID,
this project builds upon our team's expertise and extensive preliminary data in intravital microscopy,
segmentation of single-cell dynamics within live tissues, interpretation of highly multiplexed data, and building
integrated experimental/computational platforms for systems-level analysis."

10907668,"Project 1 Abstract
Over the past 6 years, the human research component of our Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) Research Consortium
has established neurophysiological alterations linked to key sensory, cognitive, and symptom correlates in FXS.
We first reported cortical hyperexcitability in the form of excessive gamma power at rest and a reduced ability to
mount appropriate neural responses to auditory stimuli. We demonstrated that features are conserved in parallel
murine EEG experiments (Project 2 team) and probed further in ex vivo recordings within cortical slices in the
Fmr1 KO mouse (Project 3 team). Our established collaborations represent one of, if not the most tightly
integrated bench to bedside research programs studying FXS. Our central hypothesis posits that the absence of
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in cortical hyperexcitability reflected in elevated background
gamma band power and altered cross-frequency regulatory processes. The overarching aims of Project 1 are
to better clarify the nature of neurophysiological alterations and their clinical implications using new paradigms
and analytic techniques, extend findings from sensory to association cortex, initiate EEG studies of cognitive and
behavioral processes, use our neurophysiological biomarkers to predict and track response to glutamatergic and
GABAergic drugs, and with large samples investigate heterogeneity in neurophysiological alterations related to
genetic and demographic features. We aim to pursue network neurophysiology modeling in adults with FXS,
typically developing and developmentally delayed matched control subjects. In this work we will evaluate
neurophysiology during cognitive processes that are altered in FXS. We will additionally develop integrated
modeling of neural oscillatory alterations across rest, during sensory processing and during cognitive activity.
We aim to conduct novel placebo-controlled, single-dose, crossover mechanistic drug challenge studies in adults
with FXS. This drug challenge will focus on small molecule targeting of GABAB neurotransmission (arbaclofen),
GABAA neurotransmission (BAER-101; formerly AZD7325), and NMDA glutamatergic neurotransmission
(memantine). We will evaluate drug impact on neurophysiology outcomes, behavior, and cognition in parallel
with testing of the same drugs in the Fmr1 KO mouse in Project 2. Third, we aim to resolve heterogeneity within
human FXS by evaluating neurophysiological, cognitive, and clinical profiles in humans with FXS based on sex,
mosaic status, and blood FMRP level. We will additionally evaluate age-related variability in neurophysiologic,
cognitive, and clinical profiles in a cross-sectional study of patients with FXS and healthy controls in the youth
age range. These efforts build on our experience to date moving forward FXS translational medicine efforts by
ensuring tight linkages to the experiments of our preclinical collaborators. This ensures that results of preclinical
work can be forward translated while in parallel our human findings can inform preclinical approaches to establish
new therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers to speed drug discovery for FXS."
10907669,"Project 2: Network mechanisms of neurophysiology and behavior in mouse models of
 Fragile X Syndrome.
Translational biomarkers for Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) were suggested from the findings of our
research team that sensory circuits are hyperexcitable in both FXS patients and Fmr1 KO mice,
as measured with electroencephalogram (EEG) in mice and humans and in in vitro brain slices.
Our team of investigators, working closely together within an NIH Collaborative Center for Fragile
X Research, has discovered multiple neurophysiological signatures of FXS, both in the resting
state and with sound-evoked EEG, that are remarkably conserved between FXS patients and
Fmr1 KO mice. Recently, we have employed multi-electrode array (MEA) EEG in awake,
behaving mice and discovered enhanced resting state gamma power and impaired auditory chirp-
induced cortical synchronization in Fmr1 KO mice, similar to findings in FXS patients. In the
current group of studies, we propose to: (1) identify network level deficits that might underlie
sensory and cognitive dysfunction in FXS using MEA EEG recordings and analyzing interactions
across spectral bands and brain regions in developing (P21-23) and adult WT vs. Fmr1 KO mice;
and (2) test the effects of GABAergic and glutamatergic drugs on EEG and behavior in Fmr1 KO
mice. Both (1) and (2) will be done in coordination with clinicians in Project 1 to test identical
drugs and EEG outcome measures across species. (3) Implement multichannel depth electrodes
in Fmr1 KO mice to evaluate layer-specific cortical physiological abnormalities. (4) Test the
effects of endocannabinoid drugs and selective deletion of CB1Rs in inhibitory neurons on EEG
and behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Both (3) and (4) will be done in coordination with Project 3
researchers working on in vitro slice preparations to identify synaptic and cellular deficits. Thus,
Project 2 will be a critical hub of the center by translating cellular and molecular level analyses to
clinical approaches using network and layer-specific MEA EEG analysis and behavior in Fmr1
KO mice. We anticipate identification of novel biomarker-based drug targets for treatment of FXS."
10907671,"Project 1 (P1) investigators have identified cortical EEG phenotypes in humans with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS),
such as enhanced resting state gamma power, that correlate with clinical outcomes. Remarkably, many human
EEG phenotypes are conserved in the mouse model of FXS, the Fmr1 knockout (KO), as discovered by Project
2 (P2) investigators. The across-species conservation of EEG phenotypes strongly suggest similarly
dysfunctional cortical circuits in mice and humans with loss of function of Fmr1. Thus, our proposed studies to
understand and correct circuit dysfunction in the Fmr1 KO mouse will likely be highly relevant to humans with
FXS. We have identified two major functional circuit defects in primary sensory cortex of the Fmr1 KO
mouse that likely contribute to specific EEG phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice and humans with FXS – 1)
hyperexcitability of “local” circuits within a cortical region and 2) reduced functional excitatory long-
range connections between cortical regions. Hyperexcitability of local circuits is observed ex vivo in brain
slices with 2 key measures: 1) Prolonged Circuit Activation (PCA) of neocortical circuits, either spontaneously or
in response to sensory stimulation and 2) enhanced gamma power. We hypothesize that hyperexcitability of
local neocortical microcircuits underlies the increased resting state gamma power and alterations in
sensory-evoked gamma entrainment of the EEG observed in Fmr1 KO mice and humans with FXS. We
test this hypothesis in mice through mechanistic conservation. Using ex vivo neocortical slices of Fmr1 KO mice
we have discovered 3 synaptic microcircuit changes likely to give rise to hyperexcitable local circuits; 1)
Hyperconnectivity of excitatory synapses between pyramidal neurons 2) Reduced excitatory synaptic drive onto
Parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory neurons 3) enhanced endocannabinoid suppression of inhibitory synaptic
drive – likely from Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK) neurons. In Aims 1 and 2, in close collaboration with P2, we
will use optogenetic, chemogenetic, and pharmacological approaches to manipulate PV and CCK inhibitory
circuits in order to determine how their dysfunction contributes to hyperexcitability of local cortical circuits,
abnormal EEG phenotypes, and related behaviors in Fmr1 KO mice. In addition to hyperexcitable local circuits,
our new findings reveal weak excitatory connectivity between cortical regions in Fmr1 KO mice - specifically
between homotopic contralateral cortical areas (callosal connections). Dysfunctional long-range synaptic
connectivity likely contributes to the abnormal long-range functional coupling between cortical areas as
observed by EEG in humans with FXS). In Aims 3 and 4, we propose experiments to determine the underlying
synaptic and molecular mechanisms as well as the functional circuit level consequences of these weak long-
range excitatory connections. Results of Project 3 (P3) are expected to determine the specific dysfunctional cell-
types, microcircuits, and biochemical mechanisms that likely mediate human relevant EEG phenotypes in FXS

10907683,"The FMR1 repeat as functional element and therapeutic target in Fragile X disorders.
Short Tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause ~50 inherited neurological diseases. However,
disease associated loci represent only a small fraction of the ~3 million STRs present in the
human genome. Despite their importance in human disease, the broader question of what
intrinsic roles these repetitive elements play in normal neurobiology is largely unexplored. We
recently discovered a conserved and native function for CGG repeats in the 5’ UTR of FMR1.
This repeat expands in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS, a common cause of autism and intellectual
disability) and Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS, an age related
neurodegenerative disorder). At normal and expanded sizes, FMR1 CGG repeats trigger
translation of multiple cryptic proteins in the absence of an AUG start codon (CGG RAN
translation). We recently described how CGG repeats and RAN translation act as an upstream
open reading frame (uORF) to impede translation of the fragile X protein, FMRP. Using a
combination of reporter assays as well as RAN translation blocking antisense oligonucleotides
(RAN ASOs) in human neurons, we found that both the CGG repeats and RAN translation
inhibit FMRP synthesis basally. This inhibition is alleviated by metabotropic glutamate receptor
(mGluR) activation, which underlies a form of synaptic plasticity important for learning and
memory and implicated in Fragile X-associated disorders. Based on these findings, our central
hypothesis is that RAN translation and tandem microsatellite repeats have native functions in
the regulation of the genes in which they reside, and that aberrancies in these native functions
contribute to human disease. Our goals in this project are 3 fold: 1) Determine the mechanisms
by which CGG repeats and RAN translation regulate FMRP synthesis, 2) investigate what
consequences result from disrupting this regulatory loop in both mouse models and human
neurons, and 3) evaluate whether ASOs can be used to simultaneously suppress RAN
translation and activate FMRP synthesis in FXS and FXTAS human neurons as a step towards
novel therapeutic development."
10907684,"SUMMARY
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that affects
individuals with premutation alleles (55–~200 CGG repeats) in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1). Common
features of FXTAS include progressive intention tremor, gait ataxia, Parkinsonism, and cognitive decline.
Penetrance is age-dependent and reaches ~75% in male carriers by age 80. Up to ~15% of women with
premutations also show symptoms of FXTAS. The neuropathological hallmarks of FXTAS include ubiquitin-
positive intranuclear inclusions throughout the brain and marked dropout of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum.
At the molecular level, FMR1 premutation alleles exhibit a 2 to 8-fold increase in FMR1 mRNA and expression
of mutant mRNAs containing long (~100) CGG triplets has been shown to be toxic in cell and animal models.
Current data support two non-mutually exclusive molecular pathogenesis mechanisms for FXTAS: 1) RNA gain-
of-function, in which the expression of expanded CGGs in RNA (rCGG) interferes with a subset of RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs), functionally limiting their availability through sequestration, and 2) Repeat-associated non-AUG
(RAN) translation, whereby translation through the rCGG (and/or antisense rCCG) repeats leads to the
production of toxic homo-polypeptides, the most abundant of which is FMRpolyGlycine (FMRpolyG), that in turn
interfere with cellular functions. Multiple mouse models have been developed and used by us and others to study
these mechanisms. Previous work by the Nelson, Todd, Allen and Jin groups using model organisms (flies, mice)
and cell models has identified several RBPs affected by expression of rCGGs. Among these are Pur α, hnRNP
A2/B1, DROSHA/DGCR8, and TDP43. Increasing expression of these proteins can modulate rCGG-mediated
toxicity in model systems, supporting the RNA-mediated sequestration model of FXTAS. In addition, RAN
translation products are found in patient inclusions and mouse models and appear to also confer toxicity in
numerous studies. In studies to determine the contributions of both the RAN translation and RBP sequestration
mechanisms to FXTAS pathogenesis, we have generated transgenic lines of mice that express hnRNP A2/B1
and suppression of rCGG repeat-mediated toxicity without alteration of FMRpolyG positive inclusions. Parallel
efforts at the Emory Fragile X Center used whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of premutation carriers with
early or late onset of FXTAS, combined with fly genetic screens to identify additional genetic modifiers that
influence age of onset of FXTAS. Understanding the role of variation in these genes could suggest candidate
therapeutic targets. In this application, we propose to confirm and extend identification of genetic modifiers
through sequence analysis and analyze potential modifiers of FXTAS identified at Emory using human genetics
and model system studies at Baylor, Emory and Michigan using additional fly, cell and mouse models. In
coordination with Projects 1 and 3, we expect to improve understanding of mechanisms that lead to FXTAS and
other Fragile X-associated Disorders, such as Fragile X associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI)."

a small subset of patients with TNBC characterized by a high burden of somatic mutations. Surgery remains the
major treatment option for TNBC; however, the high frequency of TNBC recurrence after surgery could lead to
poor patient prognosis and high mortality. These highlight a critical unmet clinical need to develop a new
therapeutic modality that can serve as effective monotherapy or synergize with current first-line treatments to
prevent post-surgical TNBC recurrence. Intracellular ferritin serves as a key regulator to balance the increasing
need for iron to support TNBC growth while mitigating the damage of excess iron through mineralizing and
storing the intracellular iron ions. It has been well established that ferritin expression correlates positively with
TNBC cell proliferation, with more ferritin concentrations in TNBC tumors than in normal breast tissues. Clinically,
the serum ferritin level could serve as an indicator of disease severity in TNBC patients. In our preliminary studies,
we have developed a ferritin-degrading proteolysis targeting chimeras molecule (designated DeFer) that can
leverage the intracellular ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade ferritin, leading to TNBC cell pyroptosis. In
vivo anti-TNBC efficacy was substantiated on 4T1 TNBC-bearing mice. Our study suggested that ferritin can
serve as a novel TNBC drug target, and its degradation could inhibit TNBC growth. In this proposal, we will
further optimize the developed DeFer, investigate the underlying ferritin degradation mechanisms, and test its in
vitro and in vivo anti-TNBC efficacy. Furthermore, to improve the in vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of
DeFer, we will load DeFer into a platelet-based delivery system to improve the circulation time and facilitate the
selective accumulation at the post-surgical TNBC site. Finally, we will combine DeFer-loaded platelets with
immune checkpoint inhibitors to investigate the synergistic anti-TNBC recurrence efficacy on both murine TNBC
and human TNBC PDX models."

annually in the US. The lack of new antibiotics in the past three decades raises urgent concerns about the
potential revival of deadly infections, emphasizing the necessity for new antibiotics development. This phase I
application aims to establish and develop an innovative high throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify
specific bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors, poisoning inhibitors that stabilize the gyrase-DNA cleavage-complexes
and convert gyrase into a DNA damaging machinery. Bacterial DNA gyrase is a highly conserved and essential
enzyme found in all bacteria, but not in humans. It is an important and clinically validated target for discovering
and developing new antibiotics. Indeed, fluoroquinolones (FQs), a type of DNA gyrase poisoning inhibitors, are
among the most successful antibiotics targeting DNA gyrase. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to FQs has
emerged. Under certain circumstances, FQs have serious side effects. Furthermore, since FQs have been
explored extensively, the potential limit of what FQs can achieve has likely been reached. Therefore, it is
necessary to develop compounds with novel chemical scaffold targeting DNA gyrase. One challenge is to rapidly
and efficiently identify gyrase poisoning inhibitors from thousands or millions of compounds in small molecule
libraries since HTS assays are not available for such efforts. In this application, we propose to establish a unique
HTS assay that can rapidly identify specific bacterial DNA gyrase poisoning inhibitors from small molecule
libraries. Specific aims are to 1) develop a unique high throughput screening assay to discover bacterial DNA
gyrase poisoning inhibitors; 2) utilize T5 exonuclease AT-hairpin- and/or supercoiling-dependent fluorescence
quenching (SDFQ)-based HTS assays to confirm the identification of novel gyrase poisoning inhibitors; and 3)
miniaturize and automate the HTS assay. Successful execution of the proposed research could lead to
commercializing a suite of three biochemical HTS assays to identify inhibitors for DNA topoisomerases including
gyrase and screening large compound libraries for gyrase poisoning inhibitors in future HTS campaigns, which
will be pursued in a subsequent phase II application."
10919352,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by N. gonorrhoeae. In recent years, the number of people
with gonorrhea infections in the US has steadily increased, with more than 700,000 infections reported in 2021.
N. gonorrhoeae has proven adept at acquiring resistance to every single antimicrobial therapy used for its
treatment in history, starting with the sulfonamides in the 1930s and then penicillin, tetracyclines,
fluoroquinolones, oral cephalosporins, and macrolides. In the past decade, there have been reports of strains
resistant to the last remaining recommended treatment, ceftriaxone. Thus, we are on the precipice of returning
to a pre-antibiotic era of untreatable gonorrhea. Left untreated, gonorrhea infections can cause serious or life-
threatening sequelae including infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women, and, if disseminated to the blood,
may lead to complicated infections resulting in cardiovascular and neurological problems. Further, vertical
transmission to neonates can lead to blindness or life-threatening bloodstream infections if not promptly
treated. In this Fast Track SBIR grant, we propose to develop an intramuscular (IM) injection formulation of an
innovative antibiotic, AMX-2005, as a first-in-class, single dose therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant
gonorrhea. A single dose regimen is currently the preferred therapeutic paradigm to treat gonorrhea by the
treating physicians and public health organizations such as the World Health Organization due to concerns
surrounding dosing compliance in some patients and the threat this poses to on-therapy resistance emergence
and continued spread of infection in the community. We believe that a single dose therapy is most likely
achieved with a non-oral antibiotic based on PK-PD considerations. AMX-2005 possesses numerous
microbiological attributes that are desirable as an antibiotic for the treatment of drug-resistant gonorrhea such
as lack of cross-resistance to other antibiotics (including high-level ceftriaxone- and azithromycin-resistant
strains), low potential for resistance development (spontaneous mutation frequencies <5.6x10-10 CFU/mL), and
rapid bactericidal activity, including against intracellular N. gonorrhoeae. A single IM injection of a protype
formulation of AMX-2005 has demonstrated efficacy in a vaginal model of gonorrhea infection in mice
comparable to the current gold standard ceftriaxone. These proof-of-concept data highlight the potential of
AMX-2005 to address the urgent threat posed by the possible dissemination of strains resistant to all currently
available antibiotics and advocate for rapid development of injectable AMX-2005. In this grant, we plan to
optimize/manufacture the IM formulation, perform IND-enabling safety evaluations, and obtain necessary
pharmacokinetic data leading to an IND application for IM AMX-2005 to commence the first human clinical trial."

Since the successful conclusion of the Human Genome Project (HGP), significant progress has been made
towards the NHGRI strategic vision to characterize the biological function(s) of every human gene. A systematic
catalogue of molecular and cellular phenotypic effects of gene knockouts for all human genes in complex cell-
based model systems would fill a current gap between direct molecular readouts such as gene expression and
whole model organism phenotypes. It would provide another critical tool to characterize the biological functions
of all genes towards the strategic vision. The pilot phase of the Molecular and Cellular Phenotypes of Null Alleles
in Cells (MorPhiC) program will study the feasibility, scalability, required scope, and utility of such a catalogue to
characterize phenotypes associated with genes in tissue- and disease-relevant human cellular model systems.
The proposed MorPhiC Data Resource and Administrative Coordinating Center (DRACC) will enable and
support the MorPhiC research consortium by providing the highest quality FAIR (findable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable) MorPhiC data resource, analyzing, annotating, and disseminating Morphic data,
integrating external data/information, and serving as an administrative and coordination center. These functions
will be fulfilled in close cooperation and collaborating with the Data Production Research and Development
Centers (DPCs) and the Data Analysis and Validation Centers (DAVs) to support rigorous data standards, rich
metadata annotations, the highest data and software quality, and reproducibility and portability of data
processing and -analysis tools.
Members of our team have previously served in leadership positions of several national and international
research consortia, including the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), Knockout Mouse Program (KOMP), Genome-Wide
Association Studies (GWAS) Catalog, Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS),
Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG), Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K), and Monarch Initiative. Our team has
the technological, scientific, and administrative expertise to successfully operate the Center and complete the
Center and Consortium critical functions and deliverables via Specific Aims to 1) Establish and operate the
Center, 2) Deploy a state-of-the-art infrastructure to manage data across the entire life cycle, 3) Collate,
converge, and deploy cloud-enabled analysis techniques, models and data processing protocols, 4)
Create and deploy the MorPhiC Web Portal to provide global access to MorPhiC data, 5) Map and
integrate external data sources, and 6) Administer and coordinate the Consortium.
Successful completion of these Aims will enable the assessment of feasibility, scalability, required scope, and
utility of a MorPhiC Catalogue with the prospect to massively scale the functional characterization of every human
gene via phenotype mapping in relevant human model systems."

10932859,"Project Abstract:
Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) are natural guide non-coding RNAs derived from over 900 annotated snoRNA
genes in the human genome. The major known function of about one-third of snoRNAs is to install 2’O-methyl
and pseudouridine modifications in the ribosomal RNA. These rRNA modifications guide ribosome assembly
and maturation, and fine-tune translation in a cell type and cell state dependent manner. However, the majority
of snoRNAs do not have a well described function; they are called orphans because their cellular RNA targets
are not known. How snoRNA interacts with the human transcriptome and the functional consequences of these
potential non-canonical snoRNA-RNA interactions in gene expression regulation and human diseases remain to
be determined. We recently developed several new sequencing technologies that are directly relevant to
studying snoRNA biology. They include methods to robustly identify inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions in
cells and transcriptome-wide sequencing of 2’O-methyl and pseudouridine modifications. These new tools will
allow us to address mysteries of snoRNA biology. Aim 1 will identify the cellular RNA targets of the snoRNAome
through an advanced version of kethoxal-assisted RNA-RNA interaction sequencing (KARR-seq) approach to
enable comprehensive capture and identification of snoRNA-RNA interactions at the transcriptomic scale. These
results will be used to identify the rules of snoRNA-guided targeting of mRNA sequences. Aim 2 will investigate
two types of snoRNA-mRNA interactions transcriptome-wide and the consequences on regulating gene
expression through the application of new sequencing methods to map 2’O-methyl and pseudouridine
modifications in pre-mRNA and mature mRNA, and associate these results with the snoRNA-mRNA interactome.
We will also selectively delete snoRNA genes or knockdown snoRNA levels, alter the expression of snoRNP
components to investigate the consequence of specific snoRNA-mRNA interaction. All together these results will
provide the first comprehensive snoRNA-RNA interactome and derive the guiding principles of snoRNA-mRNA
interactions and the associated biological functions."

Young men who have sex with men (YMSM)—ages 13 to 24 years old—are a priority population for HIV
prevention, as they represented nearly a quarter of all new HIV cases among men who have sex with men in
the United States in 2021. Moreover, YMSM represented 20% of new HIV cases in nonmetropolitan areas,
which is relevant given the focus on rural communities in the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan. One
highly effective option for HIV prevention is Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Still, PrEP use remains low
among YMSM, and for those who do take it, adherence to oral PrEP is often suboptimal. The recent United
States Food and Drug Administration’s approval of long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP, cabotegravir, holds
promise to increase PrEP use and improve adherence. However, our understanding of PrEP preferences and
implementation needs for rural YMSM remains limited as the literature has primarily focused on older rural
samples or younger urban and national samples; more research is needed among rural YMSM to determine
how newly available LAI PrEP can be implemented for this population. Implementation science frameworks
can guide research into understanding factors influencing implementation of evidence-based practices like LAI
PrEP. As such, I propose a convergent mixed methods study to identify rural YMSM’s LAI PrEP preferences
and implementation needs informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We
will conduct in-depth virtual interviews with rural YMSM (n = 35)—residing in a rural area within one of the
seven states with rural HIV burden listed in the EHE plan—to identify perceptions of LAI PrEP and acceptability
of various PrEP delivery models using reflexive thematic analysis (i.e., Aim 1). Concurrently, an online survey
will be fielded in the seven EHE states with rural HIV burden to identify groups of rural YMSM (n = 300) with
distinct PrEP modality preferences using latent profile analysis and exploring predictors of profile membership
(i.e., Aim 2). Finally, data from Aims 1 and 2 will be used for mixed methods integration data analysis to identify
implementation strategies, which will then be positively vetted by rural healthcare providers through
empowered deliberation (i.e., Aim 3). These identified strategies will be pilot tested in future research led by the
candidate. The training plan of this F31 award is designed to support Mr. Andrew M. O’Neil—an
underrepresented candidate—with foundational experience to support his development into an independent
investigator. The candidate will gain (1) foundational content and methodological expertise in implementation
science research in the field of HIV prevention, (2) competency in advanced quantitative data analyses, (3)
necessary skills in mixed-methods research and analysis, (4) training in responsible and ethical conduct in
research, and (5) individually-tailored professional development to support transition into a research-focused
career. The training plan includes coursework, training institutes, seminars, manuscript preparation, grant
writing, academic conferences, research activities, and mentorship to support post-graduation employment."

Recent technical advances have enabled to record the activity of hundreds or thousands of neurons simulta-
neously. To extract insight from this deluge of data, computational neuroscientists have turned to data-driven
modeling approaches. In this paradigm, an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) is first fit to imitate recorded
activity, and is then dissected to reveal putative mechanisms. A prominent goal of this approach is to uncover
the dynamics of computation in the trained RNN, including attractor structure that defines how the network could
accumulate a signal or stably store a memory. However, a firm theoretical understanding of these RNN models is
lacking. In particular, are they guaranteed to uncover true mechanisms, or can they find spurious structure? How
does the RNN architecture chosen affect how they learn to imitate observed dynamics? The proposed research
aims to resolve these foundational gaps in our understanding of a widely used approach to extracting insight from
high-dimensional neural data. First, it aims to establish the fundamental domain of validity of recovering attractor
structure from data by developing benchmarks that can be applied to any data-driven method. This represents
a shift in how data-driven models are evaluated, from focusing on their ability to explain variance in test data
to instead demanding that they robustly uncover underlying mechanisms. Second, it aims to advance our ba-
sic understanding of how RNNs learn to mimic observed dynamics. Using the powerful toolkit of modern deep
learning theory, I aim to build a more complete theory of how network architecture and training procedure interact
to bias how an RNN imitates real neural dynamics. In total, this research will elucidate the limitations of one of
the most popular approaches for extracting understanding from large-scale neural data, and advance our basic
understanding of how recurrent computations are learned."
10933919,"Lung transplantation is increasingly used to treat an expanding list of end-stage lung diseases, resulting in an
over >50% increase in the number of lung transplant procedures in the US in the last decade. Unfortunately,
survival following lung transplant is the worst amongst solid organs with only 80% and 50% of patients alive at 1
and 5 years, respectively. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) affects over 50% of recipients within 24 hours of
transplantation and has emerged as the most important risk factor for both short-term mortality and long-term
graft loss from chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). The investigators in this PPG have made important
contributions to a growing molecular understanding of the complex interplay between immune and lung
parenchymal cells that underlie PGD and CLAD. In Project 1, we dissect molecular mechanisms underlying our
discovery that lung restricted alloantibodies (LRA), present in over 30% of lung transplant recipients, are
associated with PGD. In Project 2, we dissect physiologic and molecular mechanisms underlying prevalent
abnormalities in esophageal function that lead to acid aspiration and worsen CLAD severity. In Project 3, we will
credential profibrotic MoAMs as causal drivers of lung fibrosis in murine models and in patients with CLAD. In
Project 4, ESI, we test whether mitochondrial dysfunction in the alveolar epithelium predisposes lung transplant
recipients to pathologic activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) that precludes lung repair. Together
our published and preliminary data support our overarching hypothesis that acute neutrophil-mediated lung injury
mechanisms such as PGD and acid aspiration drive CLAD progression by promoting the development of LRA,
recruiting profibrotic MoAM, and inducing epithelial cell mitochondrial damage causing an ISR-mediated barrier
to epithelial repair. We will test this hypothesis in 4 interrelated and synergistic projects.
Project 1. To determine whether LRA interact with donor derived NCM and recipient CM to worsen PGD
via the activation of complement dependent and independent pathways.
Project 2. To determine whether physiologic abnormalities in the esophagus after lung transplant cause
gastric aspiration that induces LRA and CLAD progression via neutrophils and MoAM.
Project 3. To determine whether CSF1 drives the recruitment and retention of profibrotic MoAM and
whether their detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can serve as a biomarker for CLAD.
Project 4. To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction in the airway and alveolar epithelium results
in pathologic activation of the ISR that precludes normal epithelial repair to promote CLAD.
The Human and Clinical Phenotyping Core (Core B), Mouse and Cell Phenotyping Core (Core C) and
Administrative Core (Core A) will support these synergistic projects using murine models and clinical and
molecular data collected from lung transplant recipients to identify actionable pathways that can be
therapeutically targeted to improve lung transplant outcomes."
10933923,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) affects over 50% of recipients within the first 24-72 hours after lung
transplantation. PGD is the dominant risk for post-operative mortality, transplant-associated multi-organ
dysfunction, and chronic lung allograft rejection. We found that 30% of patients with chronic end-stage disease
develop autoantibodies against lung-restricted self-antigens, collagen type V and k-alpha 1 tubulin. The presence
of LRA in lung transplant recipients was strongly associated with the development of PGD and CLAD. Using a
murine model of lung transplantation, we showed that recipient mice harboring LRA have complement activation,
neutrophil recruitment, a lower PaO2/FIO2 and worsened lung injury, all clinical hallmarks of PGD. Our published
and preliminary data suggest important interactions between LRA, donor derived NCM and recipient derived CM
in determining the severity of lung injury after lung transplantation. We found that LRA bind Fc receptors on donor
derived NCM to promote their retention in the allograft and activation. This enhances the recruitment of CM to
the allograft which release IL-1β and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP8), liberating sequestered and immune
privileged self-antigens and exposing their immunogenic epitopes, enabling the extravasated LRA to form
immune complexes. The resulting immune complexes activate complement to exacerbate lung injury in the first
24 hours after lung transplantation. Further preliminary data suggest LRA immune complexes activate donor
derived NCM to release CXCL2 and promote neutrophil recruitment via a pathway that requires Src, PI3K and
BTK, but is independent of the TLR2/4/MyD88 activated by DAMPs. This results in delayed lung injury 48 to 72
hours after transplant. We will test the hypothesis that pre-existing LRA interact with donor derived NCM and
recipient CM to worsen PGD via complement dependent and independent pathways in two interrelated aims:
Aim 1. To determine the mechanisms through which LRA activate NCM to worsen PGD.
Aim 2. To determine the role of IL-1β and MMP-8 released from recipient CM in the cleavage of
sequestered self-antigens and their binding to LRA.
In collaboration Project 2, we will examine the role of acid aspiration in the formation of de novo LRA and epitope
spreading, in collaboration with Project 3, we will determine whether LRA enhance the recruitment or retention
of profibrotic monocyte derived alveolar macrophages. In collaboration with Project 4, we will determine whether
worsening of PGD induced by LRA drive mitochondrial dysfunction in the epithelium to induce pathologic ISR
activation that prevents repair. These studies will provide insights into the mechanisms by which LRA worsen
PGD and link them to clinically applicable strategies that can be rapidly translated to the care of patients requiring
lung transplantation."
10913378,"SUMMARY
Identifying functional sequence variants and effector genes for disease-associated functional variants, understanding how the variants influence effector genes and disease, and utilizing this information to advance precision medicine are among the most important yet formidable challenges in current genetic research of common diseases. Sequence variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can have substantial effects on gene expression, and identification of GWAS effector genes and the mechanisms involved has important clinical and scientific implications. Chronic kidney disease occurs in more than 10% of the general population. GWAS in up to 1 million people have identified more than 200 genomic loci associated with renal function, chronic kidney disease, or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) at these loci contain more than 7,000 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Very few studies have gone beyond associations to ascertain the effect of kidney-associated SNPs on gene expression or investigate the mechanisms involved. Such studies would have to overcome substantial challenges including the tissue-specific nature of the effect of regulatory SNPs on gene expression. Many LD regions are thousands of base pairs long and may contain dozens of SNPs. These long LD regions are particularly difficult to study. 
We have developed a unique approach and innovative methods for definitively and mechanistically linking haplotype variants, including long haplotypes, to genes in specific disease-relevant cell types. In RIGERR (Resources for Investigating Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation of Renal Disease), we propose to use this suite of sophisticated technologies to generate a large collection of innovative tools and resources to transform genetic and epigenetic research of kidney disease broadly. Aim 1 of RIGERR is to generate more than 100 lines of human induced pluripotent stem cells genetically engineered to contain readily editable or precisely reconstituted haplotypes or high-penetrance variants associated with kidney function or disease. These edited cell lines will be provided to the research community for a wide range of molecular, functional, or drug testing studies for kidney disease. In Aim 2, we will produce novel datasets and establish a workflow for utilizing these unprecedented resources to conduct mechanistic and in vivo studies of kidney function and disease, using albuminuria as an example. We have obtained exciting preliminary data that strongly support the conceptual and technical feasibility of RIGERR."

exist in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including poor adherence to ALRI guidelines, lack
of health worker training, and lack of decision support to recognize wheezing illnesses (asthma and
bronchiolitis), which represent up to 50% of ALRI in children. Acute Lower Respiratory Illness Treatment
Evaluation (ALRITE) is a comprehensive guideline- and evidence-based ALRI clinical decision support
mobile health tool Dr. Ellington developed with her team. ALRITE has demonstrated preliminary
acceptability and usability in Ugandan health centers but requires optimization for health system
integration and pilot-testing in clinical care. Dr. Ellington proposes a feasibility study in 4 Ugandan
health centers to 1) identify promising implementation strategies for the ALRITE intervention to optimize
implementation, 2) pilot-test study feasibility of the ALRITE tool and its effectiveness for diagnosis and
management of wheezing illness and pneumonia in children 1-59 months using an interrupted time
series design, and 3) assess the outcomes of implementation following ALRITE deployment and
barriers/facilitators of ALRITE use. Successful completion of these aims will improve implementation of
decision support tools in Uganda and other LMICs, provide critical preliminary data to support Dr.
Ellington’s planned R01 for a cluster RCT evaluating clinical effectiveness of the ALRITE intervention

10913483,"There is a great need for treatments for diseases caused by nonsense mutations. In the context of Cystic
Fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, patients with two nonsense alleles lack CFTR-specific
treatments. CF provides a useful context in which to study nonsense mutation biology as CF is a well
characterized genetic disease, has numerous model systems, and has dozens of nonsense mutations within
CFTR. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is the cellular process that degrades transcripts containing
premature termination codons caused by nonsense mutations. NMD acts as a treatment barrier in nonsense
mutation conditions by preventing protein from being translated as few nonsense transcripts remain in the cell.
NMD, however, does not affect all nonsense transcripts equally. NMD efficiency has been suggested to vary by
tissue, cell type, and even by patient. Furthermore, nonsense mutations in specific locations within the
transcript escape NMD. This proposal aims to study the heterogeneity of NMD in CF nonsense mutations and
the pharmacological correction of CF nonsense mutations. Novel mouse models containing CF nonsense
mutations predicted to escape NMD will be developed. Using these NMD resistant models, NMD efficiency will
be measured and compared to existing CF models containing NMD susceptible nonsense mutations. Using
existing and new CF nonsense mouse models, pharmacological correction of nonsense mutations will be
studied. NMD inhibitors will be investigated, as well as readthrough agents (capable of triggering the
readthrough of premature stop codons), and CFTR modulators (which promote CFTR protein folding and
function) will be tested independently and in combination in mouse and human intestinal organoids and
ultimately in vivo in nonsense mutation mouse models. The best pharmacological combination may differ for
each genotype or by NMD phenotype. Studying the role of NMD in CF heterogeneity and CF nonsense
mutation correction may elucidate better therapeutic strategies and provide evidence for pursuing a precision
medicine approach in CF. The training plan outlined in this proposal will strongly support a successful transition
to a career in translational research for the trainee. The training plan includes activities relating to science
communication, clinical and translational research, preclinical in vivo animal techniques, and bioinformatics."
10913484,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in
cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts
have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor
immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has
been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the
immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets.
Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly
stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells,
and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat
RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic
target to modulate tumor immunity.
We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA
recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and
without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat
RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with
activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune
microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human
immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat
recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to
quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune
receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection
technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping;
and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach
from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune
activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic
efficacy."

Project title: Dnmt3b activities in mouse development
DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes
involved in development and differentiation, and its deregulation contributes to human
pathogenesis. It is catalyzed by the family of DNA methyltransferases including catalytically
active Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b. DNA methylation plays a major role in preimplantation
development in mice. To establish a new epigenome, the mouse zygotic genome undergoes
epigenetic reprogramming, including global DNA demethylation at the 8-cell stage. Upon
implantation, a wave of de novo methylation in epiblast cells mediated by de novo enzymes
Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b results in new methylation patterns maintained by Dnmt1 that form a basis
for tissue-specific expression and differentiation. Dnmt3b regulates developmental and
imprinted genes, X chromosome inactivation, pericentromeric regions, gene bodies, and other
genomic regions. Its importance in mouse development was demonstrated by the embryonic
lethality of Dnmt3b-/- mice. We recently found that Dnmt3bCI/CI mice expressing catalytically
inactive Dnmt3bCI protein survived both pre-and postnatal development. Molecular analysis
suggested that the accessory function - the ability to recruit other Dnmts to proper genomic loci
– of Dnmt3b rather than its catalytic activity, is important for methylation and survival. Here we
hypothesize that Dnmt3b is a multifaceted protein whose various activities affect pre-and
postnatal development and disease formation in mice. In Aim 1, we analyze global methylation
and expression at different stages of development in mice lacking various Dnmt activities to
determine the scope of Dnmt3b’s accessory function in Dnmt3a-mediated de novo methylation
in vivo. In Aim 2, will test the ability of Dnmt3b to complex with other Dnmts and contribute to de
novo methylation induced by other Dnmts in Dnmt1-/-;Dnmt3a-/-;Dnmt3b-/- mouse embryonic
stem cells. In addition, we will test the importance of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3l for Dnmt3b’s
accessory function and validate our data in a human cell line. In Aim 3, we will assess disease
development in mice conceived through the use of in vitro fertilization techniques to analyze
disease development, Dnmt levels, the rate of methylation and gene expression errors, as well
as their persistence over time. Collectively, our studies will reveal the physiological relevance of
Dnmt3b activities in mouse development, and uncover basic mechanisms utilizing Dnmt3b
functions and their involvement in IVF. Our results could result in a changed focus of preventive

10923470,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise chronic inflammatory pathological conditions of the gut. IBD affects
~1.6 million people in the USA where both, incidence, and disease severity are on the rise. However, situation
is particularly dire for the Veterans as studies suggest that IBD is increasing at 2-3 times higher rate in Veterans
than the general population. The current IBD therapies are not curative as disease etiology remains unclear.
Moreover, 25% of patients require hospitalization where 45% will have relapsing disease. Also, IBD significantly
increases the risk for colon cancer. It is here noteworthy that IBD not only impacts the health and the quality of
life of affected Veterans, but it is also an expensive disease and thus a serious economic burden to patients and
the VA-healthcare system. Taken together, improved understanding of IBD pathobiology and characterization of
the key molecules involved in the processes critical for the IBD onset and progression, to develop novel and
promising biomarkers and therapeutic approaches, not only holds the promise of decreasing the patient mortality
amongst VA-IBD patients but also reduce the associated financial burden for the Veterans Administration.
 The applicant’s lab program is focused on understanding the key molecular mechanism/s involving
dysregulation of specific Claudin proteins and gut microbiota in promoting the risk for IBD and its progression to
Colon cancer and developing novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutics. His laboratory is internationally known
for its contributions in this area, especially in understanding the role of Claudin proteins in regulating gut barrier
functions and promoting the risk for IBD in association with the gut microbiota changes. In this regard, extensive
preclinical and clinical studies from his laboratory, have validated a casual role for the downregulated claudin-3
expression in promoting gut dysbiosis, IBD and its progression to colon cancer. His laboratory has further
demonstrated that claudin-3 is a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. In another project, his laboratory has become
the 1st to demonstrate that PTSD (Post traumatic stress disorder), constantly increasing in Veterans population,
modulates the gut microbiota and gut barrier integrity, and thus promotes intestinal inflammation. His laboratory
is performing State-of-the-Art fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from Veterans with PTSD into the Germ-free
mice to understand causal significance of the PTSD-associated gut microbiota in promoting IBD. His laboratory
is also developing patient-derived organoids from known disease stages and variable therapeutic response. The
applicant has a broad background in epithelial and cancer biology, with published expertise in the regulation of
IBD and colon cancer using in vivo and in vitro mouse, organoid and cell culture models. As a Research Career
Scientist, he will oversee this research program by coordinating the work done; designing the experiments,
delegating, and monitoring the work to ensure that it progresses in a timely fashion. He will also be involved in
preparing manuscripts of the work performed and presenting the results at conferences in this area of
gastrointestinal diseases, therapeutics in IBD and colon cancer patients.
 Applicant’s research program has been continuously funded by VA Merit and NIH-grant awards for ~20
years. He has extensively published his research work in over 85 peer reviewed research articles in prestigious
journals in the field including Gastroenterology, GUT and J Clin Invest. Yet another key hallmark of his program
is a multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of the research enterprise with a deep focus on mentoring new
generation of VA and affiliated university investigators to help establish their own independent research
programs. He has been successful at both the fronts: making new discoveries in the field and mentoring new
generation of young scientists and establishing a solid research environment at local VA and affiliated university.
This current application is intended to highlight the success of our program and requesting RCS program to help
us progress towards the new heights of success by nurturing and mentoring a new generation of investigators."
10925162,"Inguinal hernia repair – the most common general surgery operation in the U.S. – provides a unique
opportunity to improve outcomes for older adults by changing surgical practice. Nearly 80% of inguinal hernia
operations are performed under general anesthesia versus 15%-20% using local anesthesia. Although some
studies suggest that exposure to general anesthesia can cause cognitive and physical decline in older adults,
the evidence for choosing an anesthesia technique for inguinal hernia repair in older adults is inconclusive.
Several studies demonstrated that using local anesthesia for hernia repair reduced morbidity by one-third,
unplanned admissions by 20%, and operative time and costs by 15%, while other studies showed no
significant differences. Unfortunately, these studies have significant shortcomings that limit their applicability for
older adults, and our preliminary data suggest that the benefits of local anesthesia increase with age.
The applicant is an assistant professor in surgery whose long-term career goal is to use expertise in
implementation science and clinical trials to promote patient-centered outcomes for older adults before, during,
and after surgery. The project goal is to obtain preliminary data to support a multisite trial comparing general
versus local anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in adults aged 65 years and older. We hypothesize that
using local rather than general anesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in older adults will reduce morbidity and
enhance quality of life. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Identify the optimal target population for
a pilot study of general versus local anesthesia among patients aged 65 and older who are undergoing
inguinal hernia repair. We will use a national database of operations in the Veterans Affairs system to
determine which subsets of older patients (age, comorbidity, and functional status) are most likely to have
complications or prolonged operative and recovery time with general anesthesia. (2) Determine which
outcomes of inguinal hernia repair are most relevant to patients, caregivers, providers, and hospital
administrators for a pilot trial of local versus general anesthesia for hernia repair in older adults. We
will interview stakeholders to identify outcomes valued by each group. (3) Conduct a pilot study to assess
and refine study procedures and determine feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and retention for
a multisite randomized trial of local versus general anesthesia in older adults having inguinal hernia
surgery. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of local versus general anesthesia (30 patients/arm) targeting
the population identified in aim 1 and assessing outcomes from aim 2. We will measure rates of enrollment
among eligible patients, assess acceptability of study instruments, and verify our ability to follow patients and
measure outcomes at each time point. Expected outcomes of the study are (1) crucial preliminary data for
planning and executing a multisite trial comparing general versus local anesthesia for hernia repair in older
adults, and (2) training and knowledge necessary for the applicant to become a leader in surgical research."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, typically called “forever chemicals”) are a family of over 9,200
chemicals with research indicating a link between exposure to PFAS and various adverse human health
outcomes. PFAS is a HUGE problem, estimated to be found in the blood of 97% of Americans. Traditional PFAS
used were PFOA and PFOS and could be removed from water via two primary water treatment options: activated
carbon (AC) and resins. These two PFAS were generally phased out once their hazardous nature was
discovered and they were replaced by shorter PFAS. These shorter PFAS (named short chain—SC, or ultra
short chain—USC) are more difficult to remove from the water than their longer chained counterparts. This makes
current treatment methods of AC and resins much less effective at removing them. Thus, new approaches must
be found that are more effective. In this study AIMM will continue to optimize our proprietary, patent pending
innovation, AimmSorb, to maximize the effective PFAS capture range, speed and length of use. This proposed
work will enable carbons to be specifically tuned to target PFAS-- improving PFAS removal speed, the ability to
remove long chain, SC and USC PFAS and demonstrating the ability of AIMM’s materials to be
reused/regenerated--all verified as commercial pain points through AIMM’s customer discovery. Testing will be
conducted to evaluate the adsorption performance for traditional longer chain, SC and USC PFAS. Verification
of AimmSorb as a reusable sorbent via thermal regeneration will also be conducted. Targets for ideal
temperature and dwell time will be used that are of interest to industry and have been demonstrated to be viable
through experience and the literature. The heart of the AimmSorb innovation, is a carbon powder, as is AC, and
therefore compatible with established AC water treatment engineering and processing routes and filter forms
that are already being used. This aids in ease of commercialization and customer familiarity while performing at
a much more successful level than current filters. AIMM plans to use the successful results of the proposed
Phase I work to serve as a foundation for a Phase II effort centered around the eventual fabrication of
commercial-ready PFAS treatment systems."

During the first four years of the ECHO IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ECHO ISPCTN), the
Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site (MPCTS) has been successful in building the necessary infrastructure,
team, and partnerships to participate effectively in multi-center clinical trials. The newly formed infrastructure
includes clinical and research offices, dedicated exam and consultation rooms for participants, database and
computer facilities and clinical research expertise from several centers through the University of Montana. The
research team is comprised of a pediatric clinician/scientist as principal investigator, two research nurses, an
epidemiologist and a recently added second pediatrician. Each team member has gained experience through
multiple professional development opportunities, which have included ECHO ISPCTN Data Coordinating and
Operations Center-offered didactic presentations, manuscript writing team membership and leadership, clinical
trial protocol development leadership, and most importantly the invaluable growth that occurs with participation
in three ECHO ISPCTN clinical studies. The team is now well positioned to gain further from a robust clinical
research skills development plan designed by a new Senior Faculty Development Leader, who has extensive
expertise in both clinical trials and mentorship. We are ready to participate in the next phase of ongoing ECHO
ISPCTN trials as well as clinical trials in development. To facilitate continued and successful pediatric clinical
trial participation, we have established relationships with the major pediatric inpatient facilities in the state,
including their healthcare providers and research institutions, as well as with outpatient pediatric practice
groups and care providers throughout western Montana, including the Family Practice Medicine Residency and
Partnership Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center. We have also gained support from a newly
formed innovative rural outreach organization, Ahana, a telemedicine collaborative for afterhours care in rural
communities. Our established and active engagement with two IDeA program-supported Clinical and
Translational Research Centers in Montana has and will continue to serve as valuable resources in
professional development, research design and biostatistics, and community and stakeholder engagement, the
last of which is critical as we extend our ECHO ISPCTN activities into more rural areas of the state. The ECHO
ISPCTN has provided a pathway for including sites in clinical trial research that have not historically done so.
As we look toward the future, the overall goal is to build on the ECHO ISPCTN’s and MPCTS’s successes and
leverage existing infrastructure to expand the reach of ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials into rural and underserved
areas in Montana. More inclusive and generalizable pediatric clinical trials will improve both the quality of
clinical trial research and the health of children across the ECHO ISPCTN."

Gastric cancer (GC), the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, is characterized both by
histologic and molecular criteria. The two most common forms include Diffuse GC (DGC) and
Intestinal GC (IGC). Each class of GC is associated with early inactivation of a distinct tumor
suppressor, CDH1 (encoding E-cadherin) for DGC and p53 for IGC. Beyond genetic changes,
gastric cancer development is promoted by environmental factors, specifically Helicobacter
infection and exposure to dietary nitrates. We posit that addressing two fundamental questions
in the gastric cancer field: defining the cells-of-origin and defining the distinct mediators of
progression, should be addressed together given their interconnectedness. We will evaluate the
interplay of genetic and environmental precipitants to gastric cancer using novel engineered
mouse models where we can selectively target key tumor suppressors in the gastric epithelium in
concert with relevant exposures. We will then deeply interrogate tissues with the combination of
multi-omic single cell technologies enabling dual analysis of gene expression and chromatin
accessibility in individual cells and the subsequent use of spatial transcriptomic tools allowing us
to map features of individual cell types spatially to refine the cellular origins of these altered cell
types. In concert to defining cellular origins of the two primary classes of gastric cancer, our
integrated multi-omic and spatial analyses will be evaluated to define changes in cellular
programs and candidate mediators of these altered phenotypes. In addition, we will explore how
coevolving changes in the gastric microenvironment may accompany or promote the cell’s
precancerous transformation. We will better define the interaction of environmental exposures in
gastric tumorigenesis and investigate interactions of resulting early mutations with environmental
factors, testing our hypothesis that this interaction modulates both gastric cells and
microenvironment. Utilizing our cellular and spatial profiling, we will generate a map of the
microenvironment showing the development of the disease in its spatial context, which will also
be a resource for future studies. To generalize our findings in the mouse to human, we will perform
single cell multi-ome analysis of human and mouse derived organoids and expand our existing
single cell atlas of the human GI tract. Subsequently, we will perform functional validation of
candidate mediators of progression, evaluating both features intrinsic to gastric epithelial cells
and those emerging from the microenvironment. These studies will both address longstanding
debates over origins of gastric cancers as well as define new targets to prevent cancer

Geographic atrophy (GA) is the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration.
Recently, anti-complement drugs have shown moderate efficacy in slowing disease
progression. The long-term goals of the proposed studies are to develop two new mouse
models of GA based on RPE oxidative stress for testing potential novel therapeutics. We will
test one such therapeutic, oral deuterated docosahexanoic acid (D-DHA), which has shown
considerable promise in an acute model of photoreceptor oxidative stress caused by intravitreal
iron injection. Oxidation of DHA has been implicated in AMD pathogenesis by Joe Hollyfield's
lab. Now it is important to determine whether this oxidation-resistant form of DHA can protect
the RPE from GA formation and expansion. The approach is to study RPE-specific glutathione
peroxidase 4 knockout mice, as well as mice given a low dose of sodium iodate, which causes
an expanding patch of GA in the superior retina. The degeneration will be characterized using in
vivo imaging (cSLO and OCT), ERG, and, after euthanasia, mass spectrometry, histology, IHC,
and qPCR. The impact will be to generate new GA models and to assess the potential of a
promising new oral drug for prevention or treatment of AMD."

In the mammalian brain, action, perception, and cognition arise from the coordination of many neurons working
in concert. For decades, neuroscientists have observed these multi-neuron patterns of neural activity, and
developed complex ‘population codes’ to describe how a pattern correlates with a behavior. These population
codes make up our core understanding of how the brain works. However, simply observing activity cannot
distinguish between activity that drives a behavior (i.e., causality) vs that which only reports that a behavior
happened (i.e., correlation). Even modern optogenetic or chemogenetic approaches struggle to assess causality
in complex interconnected systems, like the mammalian cortex, and are incapable of testing the importance of
a pattern of activity, where information is encoded in the timing and relative firing rates of neurons. This has led
to calls for revised methodologies to study causality in neural systems. Here we leverage a unique and novel
approach, that we developed, to test the causal link between neural activity and specific actions. This new
approach enables the previously impossible task of recreating population activity de novo, writing different
numbers of action potentials into adjacent cells with millisecond precise timing. We will use this technique to ask
a fundamentally different class of questions than ever previously possible and create a framework determining
the causal role of population codes on behaviors.
Vector Optogenetics is the most advanced form of optogenetic stimulation yet, and the only approach able to
reproduce population activity. Evolving from multiphoton optogenetics, vector optogenetics allows a user to
specify not just which cells are activated but how many action potentials they will fire and when – anywhere
within the field of view of a conventional two-photon microscope and in a behaving mouse. In this proposal, we
use this technique to address several critical questions in motor cortex. Exploring, quantitatively, the nuance of
what patterns of activity drive specific behaviors, and other cells. We explore possible important features of a
population code (e.g., identity of activated cells, relative firing rates, synchrony, or sparsity of a pattern), as well
as popular theories of the importance of ‘low dimensional’ activity spaces. By combining vector optogenetics with
electrophysiology in the striatum, we further explore how patterns of activity drive downstream nuclei –
addressing questions about inter-area communication and the initiation of actions.
My experience as a systems neuroscientist, combined with being the inventor of these optical approaches,
makes me ideally suited to execute this plan, and overcome any obstacle. This proposal promises to
revolutionize how we study and validate models of cortical interaction and neural coding. Far from being limited
to motor control alone, these findings will have far-reaching implications – helping to create next-generation
neural prosthetics, treat complex neurological diseases, and change the way we study complex systems."

During the prior funding period, we established a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of >50 idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) and >70 non-fibrotic control lungs, through which we defined multiple previously unrecognized
and/or disease-emergent cell types and states in the human lung. These studies have provided substantial
new insights into the cellular diversity and molecular pathways that are active in advanced pulmonary fibrosis,
and lead us to new questions: 1) What is the antecedent biology which leads to the cellular identities and
pathologic molecular programs observed in advanced disease? 2) Which are the disease-mediating, nice-
specific molecular programs that lead to, characterize and emerge from the histopathologic features of
disease? 3) What is the genetic and molecular basis that underlies the heterogeneous outcomes among
patients with progressive PF? Our preliminary data lead us to conceptualize that progressive PF is the last of
three distinct stages of disease evolution, starting from a point of sub-radiographic molecular pathology
through progressive radiologically detectable presymptomatic disease, culminating in progressive,
symptomatic PF, and yet currently available therapies target end-stage disease mechanisms. We posit that
therapeutic efforts should be directed at molecular mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression,
but prior efforts the ability to deeply interrogate the very earliest disease mechanisms has been limited by the
fundamental challenge of identifying and obtaining lung tissue samples from individuals in the preclinical,
presymptomatic and early stages of disease in order to link molecular pathology to subsequent disease biology
and outcomes. We are now uniquely positioned to overcome both of the fundamental challenges in the field.
Our central hypothesis is that distinct niche-specific, spatially-coordinated molecular programs evolve
asynchronously within the lung to drive the heterogeneous progression outcomes of pulmonary
fibrosis patients. Leveraging unique access to lung tissue samples from preclinical and early-stage PF
subjects that are linked to genotype data and future clinical outcomes, together with formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE)-capable, state-of-the-art single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies, in the studies
proposed below we will 1) Identify the cellular and molecular programs of early disease pathogenesis of PF, 2)
Determine the spatial regulation and coordination of pathologic molecular programs across the natural history
of PF, and 3) Define the cell-type specific genetic regulation underlying disease progression heterogeneity in
pulmonary fibrosis. Together, these studies will establish an integrated understanding of the mechanisms that
predict and mediate future PF biology, establishing targets and outcomes for primary and/or secondary
prevention studies of PF using precision therapies."

Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is a primary component of fundamental neuroscience research and holds
great potential for sensory restoration or sensory feedback in neuroprosthetics. Despite the wide use of electrical
stimulation in neuroprosthetics and interventions such as spinal cord stimulation and deep brain stimulation
(DBS), the fundamental physiological and mechanistic properties defining therapeutic efficacy remain poorly
understood. For example, it is still unclear which cell types are activated, what role they play in therapeutic
outcomes, and how to tune stimulation parameters to selectively elicit relevant activity in those cell types for
sensory restoration. Of particular interest is the contribution of non-neuronal cells such as astrocytes. Astrocytes
are emerging as important cells in the modulation of neuronal activity during sensory processing in which they
respond to neurotransmitters with calcium elevations leading to the release of neuroactive substances to regulate
synaptic function (i.e., gliotransmission). Importantly, the time scale in which astrocytes modulate neuronal and
synaptic activity is consistent with ICMS-induced neural activity. It is because of these recently appreciated roles
regarding astrocyte-neuron communication that astrocytes have been suggested as a vital component to brain
stimulation. However, it is unclear how astrocytes respond to clinically relevant stimulation parameters on a
network level and how that activation subsequently modulates neuronal activity in an awake animal. To address
this gap in knowledge, this proposal will first quantify the calcium activity in cortical astrocytes and across a larger
network induced by ICMS with different frequencies and temporal patterns known to have differential therapeutic
efficacy using both two-photon microscopy and mesoscale imaging. Next, this proposal will quantify how ICMS-
induced neuronal activity is modulated when astrocyte calcium activity is selectively increased (optogenetics) or
decreased (viral transduction of a plasma membrane calcium pump) to determine how astrocytes regulate
neuronal network activity during ICMS. Because astrocyte calcium activity regulates how these important cells
modulate neuronal activity, the cumulative results of this proposal will provide valuable insight for fundamental
neuroscience research and the design of stimulation paradigms to elicit astrocyte activity relevant to sensory
restoration."

Aneurysms are permanent, local dilations of the blood vessel. The growth, rupture and
dissection of aortic aneurysms induce a significant rate of patient mortality. The current
standard of care relies on a reactive strategy of surveillance over a period of 1 to 5 years to
monitor the growth rate of an aneurysm. This project seeks to validate the predictive accuracy of
an ab-initio physiomarker in diagnosing both the growth and dissection of an aneurysm during
an initial evaluation. By capturing the underlying physical mechanism driving aneurysm
development, the physiomarker can be used to determine whether a cross section of the blood
vessel will dilate permanently—whether an aneurysm will grow or remain stagnant over time.
This predictive strategy can inform immediate treatment or surgical intervention at the initial
evaluation of the patient instead of waiting until follow-up to monitor for growth. The specific
aims of the project are threefold. The first is to verify the biomechanical accuracy of the
physiomarker, determine its relationship with tissue remodeling modalities, and quantify
nonlinear effects using an established in vitro experiment. The hemodynamic and vessel wall
properties will be controlled to examine the growth and stagnation regimes. The second is to
validate the accuracy of the physiomarker in patients with associated aortopathies like Marfan
syndrome or biscuspid aortic valves, which may typically act as confounding factors for
regression-based methods but are not expected to affect this ab-initio framework. Retrospective
observational studies will be performed to examine the accuracy of the physiomarker in the
presence of these factors. Lastly, the physiomarker will be measured using flexible, wearable
sensors, either in conjunction with echocardiography or as a standalone platform. This will be
carried out via carefully controlled, prospective observational studies over 1 to 2 years. Both
modalities will offer a safer, cheaper and more accurate way to predict aneurysm growth and
dissection. If the standalone sensor platform exhibits sufficient accuracy in measuring the
physiomarker, it will enable more frequent, at home monitoring of aneurysms, akin to how
blood pressure monitors can be used to track the development of hypertension. Additionally, it
will enable much broader screening for aneurysms in the general population as part of routine
health checkups."

The BRIDGE to the BS Program at Morgan State University (MSU) is a collaboration between Morgan State
University and Prince Georges Community College (PGCC). The long-term goal of this program is to increase
the numbers of underrepresented minorities who successfully complete the transition from PGCC to
completion of the Baccalaureate degree in psychology and STEM majors at MSU and who are then able to
successfully compete for positions in graduate or professional programs or gain entry in the workforce in
areas related to biomedical or behavioral sciences. The program, which will engage students from the start
of their first year in community college, utilizes a “wrap around” approach that offers continuous intensive,
individualized support and attention through the senior year at MSU. The goals center around three major
strategies: 1) pre-program initiatives to nurture a culture of research at PGCC and increase awareness of
undergraduate research and academic opportunities at MSU; 2) academic support that will foster successful
transition to MSU and persistence to completion of the baccalaureate degree; and 3) mentoring initiatives
(personal and professional) that continue throughout the academic career. Thus the “wrap around” approach
encompasses activities before, during, and after completion of the program. At the end of the funding period,
we will have trained and graduated 30 MSU BRIDGE scholars. We anticipate a much broader impact beyond
just the BRIDGE scholars that transfer to MSU given that some of the program activities at each institution
are open to all students. All students at PGCC within relevant majors will be encourages to participate in Pre-
BRIDGE activities. All transfer students at MSU within the psychology and STEM majors will be strongly
encouraged to participate in the MSU BRIDGE activities so that they will also persist towards completion of
their degree. To this end, we propose the following Goals and Objectives: GOAL 1. To strengthen the transfer
student pipeline between PGCC and MSU for students who are interested in completing a baccalaureate
degree in the STEM or psychology disciplines, with particular focus on career goals in biomedical or
behavioral sciences. GOAL 2. Create and facilitate transfer student academic success and persistence to
completion of the baccalaureate degree in STEM at MSU. GOAL 3. Nurture a culture of research and
academic achievement that will facilitate completion of the baccalaureate degree and subsequent careers in
the biomedical or behavioral sciences."

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have
an immense impact on morbidity and mortality. Acute ischemic stroke and aging are considered significant risk
for developing life-threatening VTE events. While prophylactic anticoagulation reduces the rates of VTE in such
high-risk patients, they only prevent approximately half of the expected VTE events and are associated with
significant risk of bleeding, suggesting the critical need for novel and safe adjuvant treatments to reduce VTE
burden. In recent years, compelling evidence has emerged that implicates neutrophils in the initiation and
pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In pilot studies, we found that stroke increases the risk of DVT,
both in mice and humans and integrin α9 is upregulated on neutrophils following stroke in humans and in mice
and it contributes to adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium. We also observe that neutrophil specific α9-/-
mice were less susceptible to DVT. Our central hypothesis is that neutrophil integrin α9 promotes DVT in the
context of aging and stroke. The overall objective of the proposal is to evaluate the mechanisms by which
neutrophil integrin α9 promotes DVT while exploring its relevance and therapeutic potential in reducing
poststroke DVT. In aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic role of neutrophil integrin α9 in promoting DVT in
the context of stroke and aging. We will evaluate underlying molecular mechanisms that contributes to
poststroke neutrophil adhesion and DVT. For optimal scientific rigor and to ensure reproducibility of the results,
we will test this hypothesis considering age, sex and the presence and absence of ischemic stroke. We will use
clinically relevant models (filament/embolic stroke models and IVC stenosis models for DVT). In aim 2, we will
determine the translational impact of inhibiting integrin α9 on venous thrombosis. We will use well
characterized anti-integrin α9 antibody in mouse models. By utilizing whole blood samples from controls and
patients with ischemic stroke, we will determine in vitro effect of integrin α9 inhibition on magnitude of venous
thrombosis. This project will provide robust evidence that neutrophil integrin α9 promotes DVT in the context of
stroke and aging. A longer-term impact of the project will be facilitation of the development of anti-integrin α9
therapeutics that can be used in combination with current thromboprophylaxis regimens to reduce VTE burden
in such high-risk population."

Through novel deconvolution approaches for bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified two tumor-intrinsic
subtypes of PDAC (basal and classical) that we have confirmed, are robust, replicable, prognostic and
predictive of treatment response. We found that the basal subtype is consistently associated with poor
outcome and have shown, through analysis of two clinical trials, that patients with basal subtype tumors do not
respond to the 1st-line therapy FOLFIRINOX. These results strongly support the idea that molecular subtypes
may be used to select treatment.
Given the impact of our tumor-intrinsic subtypes on therapy response, we developed a single sample classifier,

10977534,"ABSTRACT
Through novel deconvolution approaches for bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified two tumor-intrinsic
subtypes of PDAC (basal and classical) that we have confirmed, are robust, replicable, prognostic and
predictive of treatment response. We found that the basal subtype is consistently associated with poor
outcome and have shown, through analysis of two clinical trials, that patients with basal subtype tumors do not
respond to the 1st-line therapy FOLFIRINOX. These results strongly support the idea that molecular subtypes
may be used to select treatment.
Given the impact of our tumor-intrinsic subtypes on therapy response, we developed a single sample classifier,

entitled “Translational Medicine and Mechanistic Studies of Brain Neurophysiology in Fragile X Syndrome”.
This Core will provide a centralized administrative body to ensure project interrelatedness and a governance
structure required for a large multi-project, multi-site Center program. Our Administrative Core will also
organize our diverse advisory committees including an Internal Advisory Committee, External Advisory
Committee, and a Family Advisory Council. The core will also allocate and coordinate activities of our multi-
project Core Scientists in the areas of electrophysiological data analysis, translational behavioral and cognitive
testing methods across species, and statistics. Providing centralized scientific resources in these areas will be
invaluable to assuring the synchrony and interrelatedness among Projects, and our ability to compare their
results. With input from program staff, we took the step of housing these scientific resources in this Core to
ensure that their contributions are coordinated at the level of the Center by the scientific leaders comprising the
Core Steering Committee to optimize achievement of our primary scientific missions. The Administrative Core
will coordinate research dissemination to the FXS family community, and the sharing of research results and

10907685,"Project Summary
Up to an estimated 1 in 151 women carry a fragile X premutation allele, impacting over one million women in the
US. Women with a premutation are at risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common
genetic form of intellectual and developmental disability and autism spectrum disorder. These women are also
at risk for fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), with 20-30% experiencing cessation of
menses prior to age 40. Reduced fertility is the most significant consequence of FXPOI. Other health
consequences due to early estrogen deficiency include low bone density, early-onset osteoporosis and fractures,
impaired endothelial function, early-onset coronary heart disease, and increased overall mortality. Women with
a premutation are a prevalent, yet understudied population. They are at the center of families diagnosed with
fragile X-associated disorders. The focus of this proposal is to identify the modifiers and mechanisms of FXPOI.
Current data support two non-mutually exclusive molecular pathogenic mechanisms associated with the long
premutation CGG repeat track in the FMR1 transcript (rCGG): 1) expanded rCGG transcripts potentially
sequester essential proteins that bind to the rCGGs and 2) the premutation rCGG induces repeat-associated
non-AUG (RAN) translation within the 5' UTR of FMR1 mRNA, producing polypeptides that may be toxic. With
respect to modifiers of severity, we showed previously that the premutation repeat length explains only ~13% of
the risk to develop FXPOI; thus, additional modifiers of must exist. Our strong preliminary studies support the
following hypothesis: FXPOI is a multifactorial disorder that results from the molecular consequence of
premutation-size rCGGs, primarily the toxic effect of RAN translation products, on the background of modifying
genes that exacerbate the severity of FXPOI. We will test this hypothesis using a series of premutation mouse
and human models and tools generated by investigators of the Center. The goal will be to test the roles of RNA
sequestration and RAN-translation. In addition, we will build on our whole genome sequencing results and on
other novel datasets generated by Center investigators to identify and screen candidate modifying genes in our
large cohort of premutation and non-carriers on whom we have collected rich phenotype data. This unique
Center, focused on fragile X premutation disorders, has gathered a multi-disciplinary collaborative team who
have significant track records in the fragile X field. Their expertise provides novel resources and tools to address
critical knowledge gaps related to the risk factors and pathways associated with FXPOI and other premutation-
associated disorders. Filling these gaps will guide the implementation of timely and effective interventions."

Osteomyelitis is the bane of orthopaedic surgery, of which the majority is caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
Prior to this P50 Center of Research Translation on the Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection
(CoRTOBI), it was known that these rare infections following elective surgery (~1%), and our inability to control
them (~40% reinfection rate), are due to specific host-pathogen interactions. While co-morbidities associated
with infection were also known, the roles of adaptive immunity and S. aureus strain on clinical outcome had yet
to be studied. Thus, Project 2 of CoRTOBI tested this using custom multiplex immunoassays, whole genome
sequencing (WGS), animal models, and the AO-CPP Bone Infection Registry of 297 patients with confirmed S.
aureus infection. The results formally established anti-Gmd antibodies as protective and anti-IsdB antibodies
as susceptible determinants of the immune proteome, and that virtually all people have a susceptible immune
proteome. Thus, we now hypothesize that: 1) there is a defect in anti-Gmd vs. anti-IsdB antibody secreting B
cells, plasmablasts and/or long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) that is responsible for the native susceptible
immune proteome. 2) S. aureus strain specific factors contribute to susceptible immune proteome genesis.
And, 3) multivalent nanoparticle mRNA vaccines can reverse the susceptible immune proteome. Three
Specific Aims are proposed for Project 2 in this CoRTOBI renewal. In Aim 1 we will elucidate the mechanism
of susceptible anti-S. aureus immune proteome genesis by quantifying anti-Gmd vs. anti-IsdB specific B cells
and plasmablasts in blood, and LLPCs in bone marrow, in experimental mice and patients with S. aureus bone
infections versus uninfected healthy controls. In Aim 2 we will complete WGS of the 297 S. aureus strains in
the AO-CPP registry, and identify unique genes in the strains associated with the worst clinical outcomes. And
in Aim 3 we will demonstrate the efficacy of multivalent mRNA nanoparticle vaccines to overcome the
susceptible immune proteome against S. aureus, and protect mice from implant-associated osteomyelitis. In
addition to Gmd, we have also demonstrated that anti-Amd, Hla, CHIPS & SCIN antibodies are significantly
associated with infection control in osteomyelitis patients. Given the historic success of mRNA nanoparticle
vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will use this technology to develop candidate vaccines for the five
antigens. Dose response studies will be performed for monovalent vaccines to determine the minimal mRNA
concentration that can induce antibodies >10ng/ml in sera. Then the efficacy of the mono and multivalent
vaccines will be tested against the most virulent S. aureus strains in the AO-CPP registry using our
prophylactic and therapeutic murine models of implant-associate osteomyelitis. Overall Impact: We will
identify the mechanism responsible for the susceptible immune proteome, establish candidate mRNA vaccines
with potential to overcome it, and add S. aureus strain variables into our multiparametric nomogram for pre-op
treatment response prediction, which could be used for personalized prophylaxis and treatments."

The University of New Mexico (UNM) is the flagship and largest university in New Mexico, which is one of four
majority-minority states. It is also one of the poorest and most under-resourced states in the nation. New
Mexico has a large Hispanic (49.3%) and American Indian (11%) population. UNM is a Hispanic-Serving
Institution and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity University with over 16,000 undergraduates and 6,000
graduate students. The ethnic/racial diversity of the student population closely reflects that of the state, and
women make up 57.4% of undergraduate and graduate enrollments. UNM has an extraordinary group of NIH-
funded researchers who are internationally renowned for research in neuroscience and data science, each with
great potential to train and elevate the next generation of diverse scientists. Diversifying the biomedical faculty
at UNM will align with NIH’s goal of diversifying the biomedical workforce at all levels in order to accomplish its
mission of discovery and innovation toward improving human health. Furthermore, it will catalyze inclusive
excellence, and provide role models for female and URM trainees and a relatable path toward career
advancement in STEM. Cluster hiring of faculty, which will be new for UNM, appears to be an effective way to
build a faculty cohort and diversify the professoriate. Thus, the UNM FIRST program will implement a cluster
design model of faculty hiring, mentoring, and professional development that is embedded within UNM’s
ongoing commitment to inclusive excellence. Recruitment and hiring strategies designed to promote diversity
and reduce discrimination will be used. Hiring will occur across six departments. Our long-term goal is to
employ a cluster/cohort hiring model that increases the diversity of biomedical faculty at UNM, which in turn will
significantly increase our percentage of URM faculty who are Principal Investigators with NIH funding. The
central hypothesis is that the UNM FIRST program will successfully hire, promote, and retain a diverse faculty
cohort, and the policies/practices resulting from this program, such as the creation of the Institutional
Innovation Implementation Board, will be adopted by UNM and ultimately make significant improvements in
inclusive excellence. The Specific Aims of the UNM FIRST Administrative Core are: to lead the process of
recruiting and hiring the diverse UNM FIRST faculty cohort in the neuroscience and data science areas (AIM
1), to distribute start-up research funding and provide administrative support to the UNM FIRST faculty cohort
to facilitate success in obtaining NIH funding (AIM 2), and to provide ongoing support for UNM faculty,
department chairs, and UNM leadership to implement new innovative campus-wide policies and processes to
increase hiring, promotion, and retention of female and diverse faculty and otherwise lead to a more inclusive
institutional culture (AIM 3). The proposed work is highly significant, given the focus on using evidence-based
approaches to increase diversity among faculty in the areas of neuroscience and data science."

During the previous award period, SD BRIN initiated a Development Research Project Program that we 
refer to as the Faculty Fellows Program, or FFP. The program was designed to address two goals of the 
INBRE program: 1) development of faculty at primary undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and tribal 
colleges (TCs) and 2) providing a research environment for undergraduate students. The FFP yielded 15 
awards during the 5-year funding period, with 2 pending final approval by the NIH (see list below), and 
this program benefitted SD BRIN in a number of significant ways. First, it helped achieve the 
aforementioned goals of the program; developing both faculty and undergraduate researchers in 
biomedical sciences. Second, it helped to create a culture change at the PUIs that has not been seen 
previously in South Dakota. Specifically, there was buy-in from the PUIs for faculty release time, with

The saffron plant (Crocus sativa L.) contains a variety of bioactive compounds with demonstrated clinical benefit,
including the terpenoids crocin, crocetin, safranal, and picrocrocin. The clinical benefits of these molecules have been
demonstrated in depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ischemic
stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Data from randomized
controlled clinical trials in individuals with neurocognitive disorders provide compelling evidence to further develop
pharmaceutical, supplement, and food-based treatments. These approaches hold commercial and therapeutic
promise. And customer demand is high. For example, saffron supplements comprise a current market of more than
$1 billion (2022), which is expected to grow (reaching nearly $1.7 billion by 2029). But the paucity of high-quality
supplies limits market access to saffron bioactives. Ayana Bio is developing a platform approach called ASCENT
(Analyze to Scale Cellular ENhancement Technology) to realize the power of plant cell culture technology for scalable,
consistent, and cost-effective commercial scale production of plant-specific bioactives. In this proposal, we will
demonstrate proof-of-concept for ASCENT by generating the first-ever bioactive-enriched saffron cell line and
demonstrate preliminary safety and efficacy in a C. elegans model of Huntington’s disease. In Aim 1, top-of-the-line
screening, sequencing, and metabolomics approaches will be used to simultaneously optimize cell culture growth,
increase production of Crocus sativa L. bioactives, and elucidate the genes, enzymes, and pathways that can be
targeted to further optimize the strain. In Aim 2, lead lines will be engineered to overexpress key biosynthetic enzymes
that drive saffron bioactive production. In Aim 3, we will determine toxicology and efficacy of an engineered Crocus
sativa L. cell culture extract in a C. elegans model of Huntington’s disease. Our preliminary data using a large-scale
microfluidics approach to screen the C. elegans poly-glutamine (PolyQ) aggregation model discovered four
compounds that significantly reduced protein aggregation and mitigated disease phenotypes. These results
demonstrate the utility of C. elegans as a model of polyQ disease."
10918566,"With more than 3 million Americans affected, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes significant morbidity and
can progress to colorectal cancer (CRC). There are two main forms of IBD: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s
disease, and the associated abnormal immune response continues to be investigated with the hope that new
therapeutics can be developed. CRC is the 3rd most common cancer and 2nd leading cause of death in men and
women combined and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is a subset of CRC. Sporadic CRC is also a major clinical
problem in Veterans. We have previously shown in a prospectively collected cohort of adult UC patients, CCL11,
classically described as an eosinophil chemoattractant, was the only analyte increased in both serum and tissue
compared to non-IBD controls. Ccl11-deficient mice have been shown to be protected from colitis in an acute
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. However, acute colitis studies in mice lacking eosinophils
(including ΔdblGATA mice) have been mixed, suggesting it is not simply just decreased tissue eosinophil
infiltration leading to improvement in colitis. We have reported that Ccl11-deficient mice exhibit decreased tumor
number and burden in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS CAC model. CCL11 has also been shown to be increased
in sporadic CRC. We have now found that 1) mice with epithelial cell-specific loss of CCL11 (Ccl11∆GIepi) exhibit
decreased tumor number and burden in the AOM-DSS model; 2) tumors from CDX2P-CreERT2Apcfl/fl mice (CRC
model due to altered adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) expression) exhibit increased CCL11 expression; 3)
epithelial cell-specific loss of CCL11 in CDX2P-CreERT2Apcfl/flCcl11fl/fl mice leads to decreased tumor number
and burden; 4) tumorigenesis is not altered in ΔdblGATA mice in the AOM-DSS model or in CDX2P-
CreERT2Apcfl/flΔdblGATA mice, 5) human colonoids express receptors for CCL11; 6) recombinant CCL11
(rCCL11) leads to decreased colonic epithelial wound restitution; and 7) tumors from Ccl11∆GIepi mice exhibit
decreased levels of pERK1/2 indicative of MAPK activation, which is frequently implicated in CRC development.
We propose to investigate the role of epithelial-derived CCL11 in oncogenic epithelial dysfunction in models of
CAC and sporadic CRC. We will use Veteran patient-derived colon tissues and organoids to validate our animal
studies and develop rationales for future human studies. Our Hypothesis is: CCL11 dysregulates epithelial
function and supports carcinogenesis via MAPK/ERK signaling in inflammatory and sporadic colon
cancer. The Specific Aims are: 1. To test the hypothesis that CCL11 activates MAPK/ERK signaling
predisposing to CAC via epithelial dysfunction. Ccl11∆GIepi and ΔdblGATA mice exposed to AOM-DSS will
be used to test the hypothesis that CCL11 leads to epithelial dysfunction via MAPK/ERK signaling in murine
models and organoids. 2. To test the hypothesis that CCL11 signaling promotes sporadic CRC driven by
somatic mutations via dysregulating epithelial function and promoting oncogenic signaling. CDX2P-
CreERT2Apcfl/fl and CDX2P-CreERT2Apcfl/flCcl11fl/fl mice will be used to test the hypothesis that epithelial CCL11
promotes tumor development by assessing tumor number and size and epithelial function. Epithelial function
and oncogenic signaling will be assessed in murine organoids and HCT116 cells exposed to cytokine cocktails,
rCCL11, an anti-CCL11 antibody, and with CCL11 receptor knockdown 3. To test the hypothesis that CCL11
signaling dysregulates epithelial function and promotes oncogenic signaling in tissues and patient-
derived colon organoids (PDCOs) from Veterans. CCL11 is increased in IBD patients, CAC, and CRC. We
will compare genomic alterations and transcriptional profiles in normal, IBD, CAC, and CRC samples to CCL11
expression and epithelial function and oncogenic signaling pathways. Epithelial function and oncogenic signaling
will be assessed in PDCOs exposed to cytokine cocktails, rCCL11, an anti-CCL11 antibody, and with CCL11
receptor knockdown. These studies will lead to new insights that could identify molecular-based approaches to
improve patient risk stratification and identify new treatment strategies based on modulation of CCL11 signaling."
10918816,"Abstract
The DNA Damage Response (DDR) is an integrated network of DNA repair and cell signaling
pathways that are critical towards maintaining genomic stability. Targeting the DDR for cancer
therapy exploits two important vulnerabilities of many cancers. This first is that oncogenic
replication stress induces DNA damage and genomic instability resulting in the reliance on DDR
for cancer cell survival. The second is that many cancers harbor genetic defects in DDR and
DNA repair pathway components that force the cancer cells to rewire the DDR and become
reliant on compensatory pathways. This results in the opportunity for synthetic lethal
interactions that can be exploited to specifically target cancer cells. The most successful DDR
targeted therapies inhibit the DNA damage sensor, PARP, a protein that recognizes ssDNA
breaks. With the initial clinical success of PARP inhibitors, development of DDR targeted
therapeutics has become increasingly popular. However, the majority of the current approaches
have targeted protein kinases that are downstream of the DNA damage sensors and the clinical
outcomes with these therapeutics have not met expectations. NERx Biosciences has developed
a novel strategy to realize the full therapeutic promise of the DDR, by intervening upstream of
the DDR kinases and targeting specific DDR sensors. The human single stranded DNA
(ssDNA) binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), is a critical sensor for the DDR and a novel
target for cancer therapy. We have discovered, developed and characterized a novel small
molecule RPA inhibitor (RPAi) NERx-329 that blocks the RPA-DNA interaction and elicits
a state of chemical RPA exhaustion that results in in vivo anticancer activity. Previous
work employed chemical synthesis, in vitro analyses and in vivo xenograft studies to assess
mechanism of action, cellular engagement and therapeutic activity of RPA-targeted agents.
NERx-329 represents the first clinically viable agent to target the DDR pathway by disrupting the
RPA-DNA interaction and holds the potential for significant impact in cancer treatment. The
goal of this direct to Phase 2 application is to accelerate commercial readiness of this novel
therapeutic toward IND approval. This goal will be met through three aims including formulation
for oral delivery of NERx329, assessing pharmacokinetic, potency and safety of NERx 329, and
initiating critical CMC work required for final IND. The key deliverables of each aim will provide a
comprehensive data package that will ultimately position NERx Biosciences to complete final
IND enabling studies for first-in-class and first-in-human trials of novel agents targeting RPA."
10918821,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Gene therapy is an emerging therapeutic technology that uses genes in targeted cells to prevent and/or
treat acquired disorders and inherited genetic diseases. The rapid advancement of human gene and disease
research has increased the demand for gene therapy and investment in the production of large-scale clinical
applications. However, the clinical potential of gene therapy is limited by the current manufacturing capability
of gene delivery products. Gene therapy biologics are mostly produced by harvesting viral vectors in
mammalian cell cultures, which is a delicate and intricate process that can be affected by many
environmental parameters. Inefficient monitoring and control of the viral production processes can lead to
various manufacturing defects such as cell instability, high impurities, difficult scalability, and low productivity.
Therefore, in order to develop efficient and robust biomanufacturing processes, comprehensive knowledge
and understanding of bioprocess dynamics are needed. This in turn necessitates the need to develop
capable analytical technologies to provide accurate and timely information on key bioprocess parameters
and quality attributes.
 Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), proposes
to develop a novel in-line biomanufacturing process analytical technology tool. It enables real-time monitoring
of the biomolecules of host cells and their environment in large-scale bioreactors. The technology is based on
deep ultraviolet excited optical spectroscopic techniques that combine Raman scattering and
autofluorescence to differentiate cellular biomolecules including DNA and protein produced during cell culture
processes. An innovative spatially and temporally confined spectroscopy cytometry design will also be
adopted to efficiently distinguish intra-cellular biomolecules within the host cells from extra-cellular
biomolecules in surrounding media. A miniaturized optical probe will be designed that will inserted into an
agitated bioreactor for in-line cytometry measurements. In this Phase I program, a prototype cytometry probe
system will be designed, constructed, and evaluated by measuring and analyzing cellular biomolecules in
real-time during viral vector production bioreactor operations. During the Phase II program, the technology
will be improved, and its performance will be validated in different bioreactors using different culture
organisms. Successful development of this technology will support biotech R&D to improve the
understanding and monitoring of bioprocesses, which in turn will promote the development of new processes
for large-scale production of viral vector products for gene therapy applications."
10918871,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The great majority of people who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) do not develop
active disease but contain the bacterium in a dormant state, a condition referred to as latent tuberculosis
infection (LTBI). Many of these people reactivate tuberculosis (TB) later in life, often in association with an
immunocompromised status, such as co-infection with HIV, immunotherapy for cancer or other diseases,
aging, etc. An estimated 2 billion people on earth have LTBI and constitute a huge reservoir of people at risk
of reactivation TB unless treated and the persistent Mtb state eliminated. Current treatment regimens for LTBI
are long and burdensome, negatively impacting treatment completion. The study proposed herein seeks to
examine a potentially much shorter regimen requiring as little as one or two weeks. If successful, and then
replicated in humans, such a short-term regimen could change clinical practice.
 Our group pioneered the use of an artificial intelligence-enabled parabolic response surface (AI-PRS)
platform allowing rapid identification of the most effective drug-dose combinations for treating active TB by
testing only a small fraction of the total drug-dose efficacy response surface. This approach determined that
bedaquiline (BDQ), clofazimine (CFZ), and pyrazinamide (PZA) at optimal dose ratios were highly synergistic
and either by themselves or with a fourth drug were much more effective than standard treatment, achieving
relapse-free cure in mouse models of active pulmonary TB within 3 weeks - an ~85% reduction in time versus
the standard regimen for treating drug-sensitive TB. Here we propose to evaluate this 3-drug core regimen
(BCZ) in non-human primates (NHPs) for treatment of LTBI in a setting mimicking co-infection with HIV. As a
fourth drug is not needed to prevent emergence of resistance as in active TB therapy, the three core BCZ
drugs should be more than sufficient for treatment of LTBI; current approved regimens comprise 1 or 2 drugs.
 To achieve our goals, we shall leverage the two MPIs’ expertise with AI-PRS technology and the NHP
LTBI model. We shall initially perform limited pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of BCZ to optimize drug doses in
NHPs such that blood levels are equivalent to the optimal human doses determined in a PK evaluation of these
3 core drugs as part of a similar AI-PRS derived ultra-short 4-drug regimen for treating active TB in a just
initiated human study. We shall then infect NHPs with a low dose of Mtb by aerosol to establish LTBI infection;
then not treat (Negative control - all expected later to reactivate TB with SIV co-infection), treat with BCZ for 1,
2, or 4 weeks, or treat with the approved regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine for 3 months (Positive control –
none expected later to reactivate with SIV co-infection); and finally co-infect with SIV and monitor for
reactivation TB. If short-term BCZ treatment prevents reactivation TB, this study will pave the way for a
definitive treatment-shortening trial of BCZ in LTBI and potentially revolutionize the treatment of LTBI,
hastening the elimination of the TB reservoir and subsequently TB."

In 2021 there were 10.6 million new cases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and 1.6 million TB-related deaths,
making TB the second leading infectious cause of death worldwide behind only COVID-19. Standard TB
diagnostic methods are insufficient in that they either 1) utilize challenging sample types and are often invasive
(e.g., sputum, gastric aspiration, lymph node biopsy), 2) lack sufficient sensitivity and/or specificity (e.g., culture,
reliance on clinical observation alone), or 3) cannot be widely implemented in community point-of-care (POC)
settings. As a result, there remains a significant unmet need for affordable POC technologies that can be used
at local or temporary clinics, urgent care facilities, pharmacies, and school health clinics with easier to acquire
samples (e.g., urine or oral swabs). In addition, TB is notoriously difficult to lyse adding another challenge to the
creation of a POC solution.
Salus Discovery has developed 3STEP, a new LAMP-based POC NAT for TB that directly overcomes the above
mentioned challenges. 3STEP provides lab-quality, PCR sensitivity (<10 CFU/swab analytical sensitivity) with
the speed and simplicity of a lateral flow assay (LFA), (i.e., a simple tongue swab, 3 user steps, no liquid
transfers, and results within ~30 minutes). 3STEP also addresses challenges of spectral multiplexing in LAMP
reactions by enabling spatial multiplexing for integrated detection of drug-resistant infections. Importantly, our
novel stabilized interface technology (SIFT) used to create 3STEP enables both an ultra-cheap disposable and
an affordable isothermal instrument design.
In this SBIR Fast Track Phase I/Phase II proposal we will continue developing 3STEP for the detection of TB
and rifampin resistant (RR) TB from tongue swabs by: In Aim 1 (Phase I), optimizing 3STEP for TB oral swabs
using contrived samples, including designing and implementing RR testing into the spatial multiplexing
capabilities of 3STEP; In Aim 2 (Phase I), prototyping and testing a POC lysis module; In Aim 3 (Phase I),
assessing clinical sensitivity in a small pilot study using bio-banked samples collected through FIND’s FEND-TB
program; In Aim 4 (Phase II), finalizing the 3STEP assay and consumable for an expanded clinical evaluation;
And in Aim 5 (Phase II), performing a larger scale clinical evaluation of the multiplexed 3STEP TB/RR assay.
Results will be important to subsequent funding efforts for 3STEP commercial development (assay and reader)
and to demonstrate field-readiness for participation in TB diagnostic evaluation studies similar to R2D2,
DriveDx4TB, SMART4TB, and FEND-TB."
10933532,"Through innovations in both imaging techniques and the ability to process these images at scale, high-
resolution imaging is transforming the eld of molecular biology, yet its power has yet to be fully utilized
for asking questions in evolutionary biology. Just as demographic surveys can reveal more or less densely
populated areas where, for example, a contagious disease may spread at di erent rates, these imaging
datasets can help us quantify cellular and molecular patterns of spatial variation and understand how this
variation a ects rates of evolution, by impeding or accelerating the spread of new variants through the
population. My research program, at the interface of computer vision and evolutionary biology, is exploring
how molecular and cellular communities spatially organize, and how the resulting spatial topologies can
be generated, stably maintained and further shape the outcome of the evolutionary process.
 What are spatial topologies that act to amplify the selective advantage of new mutations in the pop-
ulation, versus structures that dampen the force of selection and slow down rates of evolution? We build
theoretical evolutionary models that explore how the rate of evolution is shaped by complex spatial struc-
ture and nd the relevant spatial features for evolutionary ampli cation or selective suppression. We link
these theoretical population genetic models to high-resolution imaging datasets and study the resulting
spatial architectures. This allows us to go beyond simply describing patterns of cellular or molecular spatial
variation, and enables exploration of the generative processes, as well as of the evolutionary trajectories of
the system.
 Beyond the purely theoretical interest in these questions, understanding the role of spatial structure
in shaping the mode and tempo of evolutionary dynamics is particularly timely because, by using modern
microfuidics and organoid technologies, we can start building population structures that control the topol-
ogy and migration patterns of a molecular or cellular population, amplifying the selective bene t of chosen
mutations, boosting the ability to nd optimized protein complexes for medical or industrial applications,
or as a screening tool for faster replicating pathogenic variants."

Cancer pain disparities are profound and uniquely harmful among Hispanic/Latinx and rural dwelling survivors as they
undermine their already limited ability to access, tolerate, and/or receive treatment for their cancer. Disparities are tied
to poor care, needlessly persistent and intense pain, as well as the over- and under-prescribing of opioids. Multi-modal
pain care (MMPC), a robustly validated, safer, and more effective alternative to a solely medication-based approach has
proven challenging to implement broadly, and virtually impossible in resource limited settings. The factors that impede
delivery of MMPC; provider bias, patients’ reluctance to report pain, and lack of patient-centered MMPC options, also
mediate disparities making them key targets for improvement. The Collaborative Care Model (CCM) provides a well-es-
tablished and validated framework that can neutralize factors that perpetuate disparities, guide MMPC delivery, and im-
prove pain detection and treatment. However, as currently configured the CCM’s single symptom emphasis needs to be
modified to address the multi-level drivers of pain disparities. Our team has developed and tested CCM iterations that inte-
grate elements of team-based care (TBC) to improve the CCM’s monitoring of sociocultural needs, as well as to accommo-
date MMPC’s multi-disciplinary care requirements. In addition, we have leveraged electronic health records (EHRs) to en-
able care teams to link symptomatic cancer patients with MMPC providers and resources. Our prior research deploying
CCM-TBC hybrid interventions with patient-and-care team-centered EHR-reengineering has also significantly improved
patient symptom reporting and deployment of MMPC. These efforts, while fruitful, have also shown us that a broader
EHR retrofitting is required to address the breadth of patients’ needs and the requirements of real-world clinical work-
flows. This experience suggests that a flexible, modular CCM-TBC hybrid system, supported by EHR enablement, can de-
liver high fidelity MMPC in a manner that improves care and mitigates disparities at multiple levels among Hispanic and
rural cancer survivors. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in a clinical trial entitled “Achieving Equity
through SocioCulturally-informed, Digitally-Enabled Cancer Pain managemeNT (ASCENT ).” More specifically, we will part-
ner with our community stakeholders during an initial, 1-year R61 development phase to refine a culturally informed
version of our CCM-TBC hybrid that addresses Hispanic and rural survivors’ linguistic, social, and IT needs (Aim 1). After
confirming the functionality of the intervention’s components, we plan to transition to a 4-year R33 execution phase with
a 2-arm, parallel group randomized clinical trial. This trial (Aim 2) will be conducted in 4 semi-autonomous Health Care Sys-
tems and is designed to assess whether our culturally informed CCM-TBC hybrid intervention improves pain outcomes rela-
tive to usual care among 578 survivors, 60% rural and 60% Hispanic, assuming 30% overlap. Primary (pain) and secondary
(mood, sleep, physical function, work status, and healthcare utilization) outcomes will be assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months. All
data, excepting patient reported outcome measures, will be extracted from the EHR for main effects, as well as explora-tory
mediator and machine learning analyses; the latter to identify characteristics associated with positive responses. Aim 3 will
evaluate implementation strategies to support multistakeholder adoption and use of intervention components."

Whole-body regeneration (the ability to regenerate all body parts) is one of the greatest mysteries in biology.
Harnessing this process would be a medical moonshot triumph, as it would provide therapeutic strategies to
enable regrowth of any type of missing tissues in human patients. In order to understand and control
regeneration, we need to uncover the full regulatory network of the regeneration program, and identify critical
mechanisms that may lead to the dysfunction of this network. Here, we propose to use new functional genomic
analysis tools (Spatial Transcriptomics, ATAC-seq, and single-cell transcriptomics) coupled with high-
throughput gene perturbation experiments to study two unique experimental paradigms. In the first paradigm,
we will compare two evolutionary cousins: the freshwater planarian, which is an immortal flatworm with
unparalleled regenerative ability throughout the animal kingdom, and the pathogenic flatworm schistosome,
which only has limited regenerative ability. We will reveal the critical regulatory components of the short-term
wound-induced response that are essential for launching and sustaining regeneration. In the second paradigm,
we will study surgically constructed planarian chimeras to unravel the immunological pathways that regulate
regeneration in order to manage the long-term risks of uncontrolled cell proliferation that is associated with
repeated regeneration. Collectively, our study will advance the understanding of the fundamental biological
basis of regenerative medicine and provide useful targets for activating regeneration."

cardiovascular disease among people with HIV. Anchored by an experienced, multidisciplinary, collaborative
mentoring team and formal career development activities, Dr. Durstenfeld’s career development plan will
facilitate his development into an independent investigator and leader in infectious-disease cardiology."
10925148,"Abstract:
Rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are high among combat Veterans with estimates of PTSD within
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at nearly 17% of active duty and over 24% of reserve service members that screen
positive for PTSD. Studies from the current and prior wars have demonstrated that mental disorders, in particular
PTSD, are associated with higher rates of: 1) physical symptoms, 2) chronic physical illness and 3) overall
mortality. Rates of comorbid PTSD and chronic pain are exceedingly high among veterans with reports of 30%-
50% in both Vietnam and OEF/OIF Veterans, that suggest a shared pathophysiology. Excessive release of
peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines has been implicated in the generation of: 1) pathologic chronic pain states
and 2) in PTSD. Perception of an aversive stimulus/threat activates peripheral inflammatory cytokine release,
while exogenous administration of an inflammatory stimulus (that also cause release of peripheral inflammatory
cytokines) increases the limbic (insular cortex and amygdala) response to aversive/threat stimuli as measured
by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Work by our group [Lerman et al., (2016)(15)], shows that
PTSD influences the: 1) nociceptive response, 2) intrathecal cytokine release and 3) peripheral cytokine release
in response to a painful stimulus when compared to responses of Veteran combat controls (CC). Vagus nerve
stimulation has been shown to decrease: 1) peripheral inflammatory cytokine release, 2) pain, and 3) anxiety.
Recent work by our group has shown that non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS; using extradermal
stimulation) decreases peripheral inflammation in healthy control subjects and may similarly decrease
hyperinflammation observed in PTSD [Lerman et al., (2016)(22)]. In pilot work, we have obtained initial fMRI
evidence (preliminary data) suggests that in healthy controls, nVNS decreases insular response to painful stimuli,
which is known to be dysregulated in PTSD.
We plan to use nVNS as a probe in PTSD and CC to observe the effects of vagal nerve modulation on: 1) CNS
neural circuit function during pain and pain anticipation stimuli, and 2) peripheral inflammatory biomarker
measures. The long-term goal of this line of research is to use nVNS as a probe to obtain pilot data of: 1)
peripheral inflammatory biomarkers and 2) fMRI derived brain imaging response to pain, to advance our
understanding of fundamental pathophysiology of co-morbid pain and PTSD and to ultimately provide, targeted
neuromodulation based interventions for veterans with pain and PTSD. We will study two groups [(PTSD, CC),
(both without chronic pain diagnosis)], under two conditions (either nVNS or Sham stimulation), over three time
points (pre-nVNS/Sham), (7 days post-nVNS/Sham) and one month after treatment (one month post-
nVNS/Sham). The first objective of this proposal, is to measure peripheral inflammation in response to nVNS
treatment in order to delineate peripheral inflammation based biomarker profiles of treatment responsiveness to
nVNS in PTSD and CC. The second step is to measure brain region response to a pain and pain anticipation
stimuli task before and after nVNS treatment in order to demonstrate: 1) a neural profile of treatment
responsiveness to nVNS and 2) the neural profile of nVNS effects on pain in PTSD and CC. Participants will
receive a 7-day long nVNS/Sham trial where inflammatory biomarkers, neuroimaging tools, PTSD symptom
severity and functional life quality will be assessed before and after the 7 days. Additionally, PTSD symptom
severity and functional life quality will be assessed one month after study onset. The direct contrast of pre and
post nVNS/Sham will provide an objective and sensitive assessment of neuromodulation with nVNS and lay the
groundwork for further neuromodulation based study in PTSD. Such outcomes may provide additional evidence
of potential treatment efficacy, thus ultimately provide therapies that enhance VA clinical practice guidelines."
10925151,"Project Summary: It remains unknown why some estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast cancers are
sensitive to estrogen therapy while others are resistant, and strategies for effectively utilizing estrogen therapy
are not well-established. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to maximize the clinical potential of
endocrine therapies for the management of ER+ breast cancer. The overall objective of this project is to define
the mechanism that controls cell fate in ER+ breast cancer in response to the estrogen 17b-estradiol. The
central hypothesis is that basal estrogen-independent ER transcriptional activity caused by ER amplification,
overexpression, or mutation sensitizes breast cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of 17b-estradiol/ER-induced
DNA damage. The rationale for this project is that definition of (i) the mechanism underlying therapeutic
response to 17b-estradiol and (ii) tumor features that dictate response to 17b-estradiol will provide a precision
medicine basis for its use and offer strategies to enhance response. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: (1) Determine how 17b-estradiol/ER-induced DNA damage and response control
cell fate; (2) Determine how inhibition of the DNA damage response affects sensitivity to 17b-estradiol; (3)
Define the role of ER (ESR1) mutations in dictating breast cancer response to 17b-estradiol. In the first aim,
the kinetics and spatiotemporal relationship of 17b-estradiol/ER-induced transcriptional activity, DNA damage,
and response will be measured in genetically engineered and estrogen-independent ER+ breast cancer cells.
These studies will provide a mechanistic basis for the cytotoxic effects of 17b-estradiol. The second aim will
use cell lines and patient-derived xenografts for measurement of the effects of 17b-estradiol in the context of
pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases 1/2 (PARP) as well as homologous recombination
deficiency. These studies will offer treatment strategies to enhance response to 17b-estradiol. In the third aim,
engineered cells and ESR1-mutant patient-derived xenografts will be used for measurement of 17b-estradiol-
induced changes in cell fate, tumor growth, and ER transcriptional activity. These studies will provide
understanding of how ESR1 mutations shape cancer cell response to 17b-estradiol and provide a mechanistic
basis to inform its clinical use. The proposed research is innovative because it implicates ER-induced DNA
damage in the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by 17b-estradiol therapy, enabling the development of
strategies that target the DNA damage response for advanced ER+ breast cancer. Based on our clinical trial
findings, this project will test the innovative concept that ER mutations sensitize ER+ breast cancer cells to
17b-estradiol. The proposed research is significant because it will reveal the root cause of 17b-estradiol-
induced cytotoxicity in ER+ breast cancer, as well as explain how cell adaptations convert 17b-estradiol from a
growth promoter to a growth suppressor. This research will also provide strong scientific rationale for clinical
testing of 17b-estradiol therapy in genetically identifiable patient subpopulations."
10925338,"TLC-1235, a controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP), for the reversal of insulin
resistance in patients with severe lipodystrophy
Abstract
 Patients with lipodystrophies exhibit hypertriglyceridemia, severe insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and have limited effective treatment options. Lipodystrophy is
characterized by the ectopic accumulation of lipids in liver and muscle. Increased lipids, specifically sn-1,2-
diacylglycerol, within plasma membranes interfere with insulin receptor signaling and are a central mechanism
for insulin resistance. Mitochondrial protonophores reduce intracellular lipids by increasing lipid oxidation in the
mitochondria. Mechanistically, mitochondrial protonophores shuttle protons across the inner mitochondrial
membrane via a pathway that is independent of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, thereby uncoupling
nutrient oxidation from ATP production and dissipating the proton gradient as heat. The therapeutic efficacy of
protonophores is linked to 1) increased oxidation of fatty acids to compensate for inefficient ATP production, 2)
a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the electron transport chain, and 3)
activation of the expression of AMP protein kinase (AMPK), the master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis.
Thus, small molecule mitochondrial protonophores represent a novel strategy to reduce ectopic lipid
accumulation by increasing cellular energy expenditure. Indeed, multiple groups have validated this mechanism
of action by demonstrating large improvements in insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia, with concomitant
reductions in hepatic triglycerides and markers of inflammation in relevant nonclinical models. TLC-1235 is a
functionally liver-targeted, controlled-release mitochondrial protonophore (CRMP) that will promote selective
mitochondrial uncoupling in the liver while minimizing high systemic exposures (Cmax) that have been associated
with adverse effects of systemic uncoupling including hyperthermia, excessive weight loss, and muscle injury.
During this Direct-to-Phase-2 project, we will initiate Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling activities for TLC-
1235, including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) manufacturing, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics
(DMPK), and toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. Additional work to support the filing of an IND will be
funded by the Company."
10925372,"1. Project Summary/Abstract
Hypertension affects 1 in every 3 adults in the US and contributes to 410,000 deaths annually. Hypertension and
its associated complications disproportionately affect minority populations living in urban areas. In Chicago,
health status indicators show worsening disparities between black and white residents, with the highest rates of
hypertension, heart disease, and stroke clustering in the predominantly black South and West Sides. Kaiser
Permanente demonstrated that a bundle of evidence-based interventions implemented within a large, integrated
health system in Northern California significantly increased blood pressure control rates. However, it is unclear
whether a health system centered intervention can be adapted to other settings, particularly under-resourced
urban communities. Therefore, our overall goal is to support a community-centered design and adaptation of the
Kaiser bundle. Our adaptation shifts the Kaiser bundle to be centered within churches within the South Side of
Chicago, one of the most medically underserved communities in the United States. The proposed interventions
are the same as in the Kaiser bundle (e.g., registry/audit and feedback, simplified treatment regimens, accurate
Blood Pressure measurement) but implementation of the components of the bundle will be adapted for delivery
in the community. The intervention will be carried out by local community health workers and ministry facilitators,
with health clinics and hospitals in the community as support, all connected through a common data platform.
Thus, our proposed project will identify the best strategies to support adoption, implementation with fidelity, and
sustainability of the Kaiser bundle in the community setting. The proposed study will follow the Exploration,
Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) process model and implementation is rigorously evaluated
using a multimethod approach to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-
AIM) evaluation framework. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Convene community stakeholders in order to adapt
implementation strategies using the Dynamic Adaptation Process model. Aim 2: Design, implement, and
evaluate pilot projects in order to optimize implementation strategies within our community. Aim 3: Implement,
test and evaluate an adapted implementation strategy to control hypertension through faith-based organizations
in the South Side of Chicago. Our overall implementation is a hybrid Type 2 effectiveness–implementation design
based within one primary community area (South Side Chicago) and in two settings (church and clinic). The
overall study outcome is the Public Health Impact metric (reach * effect size of the intervention). Aim 4:
Disseminate findings internally to community stakeholders and externally through creation of community
implementation toolkits."

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are extremely prevalent and have no cure. These diseases
affect the way neurons are specified and communicate with one another. In this project, we will
create an in vitro tool to reveal monogenic ASD phenotypes at the level of neuronal assemblies
mimicking physiological and pathological neuronal network development in the human cortex, by
creating self-organized networks of forebrain neurons on micropattern substrates: the cerebroids.
Compared to existing techniques, our platform is extremely standardized and uses tools from the
world of artificial intelligence to detect subtle morphological differences associated with the
disease state. This uniquely allows us to test large numbers of molecules to discover new
therapeutics. This project brings together an interdisciplinary team to develop an innovative
solution for a problem that has no solution yet: the discovery of therapeutics for ASDs. Based on
our preliminary data showing that neuronal progenitors can self-organize on micropattern
substrates and give rise to consistent mutant phenotypes across banks of patient derived cells,
we will first optimize our protocols and characterize the normal developmental time course of
human cerebroids. This will create a baseline for normal development that will then be used to
measure the pathogenic effects of highly penetrants mutations associated to five monogenic
forms of ASDs associated with: ADNP, DDX3X, FOXP1, FOXG1 and SHANK3, creating a rich
ASD-focused pipeline together with key patient led research foundations. Next, we will develop
methods for probing neuronal communication within cerebroids based on live imaging of calcium
reporters. This will allow the study of neuronal cell development and interactions at the level of a
standardized micro-tissue and bridge an important gap in our ability to model and precisely
quantify human neural networks. Finally, we will engage in a drug discovery project for small
molecule therapeutics for one ASD gene using, as a primary screen, deep learning mediated
morphological readouts of phenotypic reversal, and subsequent evaluation of the hits at the level
of neuronal communication with a live imaging strategy. The successful molecules will be strong
therapeutic candidates that will eventually be moved towards evaluation in mice models. At the
technical level, this research is impactful as it realizes the dream of placing synthetic human micro
tissues at the center of the drug discovery process. This will have long- lasting consequences in
the way drugs will be found for neurological disorders in a filed currently characterized by large
investments yet many failures. New tools lead to new discoveries - and our platform provides a
unique opportunity to find new therapeutics in synthetic neural organoids for ASDs."

The goal of this fast-track SBIR project is to further develop AAV gene therapy product for treating
Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB towards clinical application and commercialization.
MPS IIIB, is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by defects in α-N-
acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), a lysosomal enzyme essential for the degradation of heparan sulfates, a
class of biologically important glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The lack of NAGLU activity results in lysosomal
GAG storage in cells in virtually all organs, leading to severe neurological manifestations, broad somatic
disorders and premature death. No treatment is available for MPS IIIB. Gene therapy (GT) targeting the root
cause has been considered to be an ideal strategy for treating monogenic diseases including LSDs. Numerous
studies have demonstrated the success of systemic trans-BBB-neurotropic AAV9 gene delivery for treating
neurogenetic diseases. Importantly, the efficacy and safety profiles of systemic rAAV9 gene delivery have
been demonstrated to be highly reproducible across different LSDs. To address the unmet need, we
developed new GT products for MPS IIIB, using the AAV9 vector platform to deliver a codon-optimized human
NAGLU cDNA (hNAGLUop). The codon-optimization resulted in enhanced expression and rNAGLU secretion,
indicating the potential for added by-stander effects. In preliminary studies, we tested these in MPS IIIB mice
and were able to identify the optimal vector product for further development. With an IV injection of the
designated optimal rAAV9-hNAGLUop vector in MPS IIIB mice, we achieved functional correction and reversal
of neurological and somatic disorders of MPS IIIB, strongly support the therapeutic potential of the proposed
rAAV9-hNAGLUop vector product for treating MPS IIIB in humans. We believe that we are well-positioned to
move forward towards a Phase I/II IND.
In order to efficiently develop the rAAV9-hNAGLUop GT product, this Fast-Track SBIR proposal will address the
critical challenge in developing AAV GT, the scale-up vector manufacturing. In Phase I studies, we will perform
the engineering trials of the scale-up rAAV9-hNAGLUop vector manufacturing (Aim #1) to develop and optimize
the procedures, based on the protocols and procedures currently used by Dr. Fu’s team. The vector products
will be tested in vitro and in vivo for qualification and SOPs will be developed. Once validated, in Phase II, we
will build a facility with two GMP manufacture suites using certified modular cleanrooms (Aim #2), in order to
produce rAAV9-hNAGLUop vector for our planned IND and eventual clinical application and commercialization.
In Phase II stage of this SBIR, we will also hold the Pre-IND meeting with the FDA for advice on our planned
Phase I/II GT clinical trial and then submit the IND package to the FDA for approval (Aim #3). The success of
this Fast-track SBIR project will enable the efficient development of the MPS IIIB GT product towards clinical
application and commercialization."

conference will be held in Hannover, Germany from April 8-11, 2024.
This Keystone Symposia conference brings together researchers studying HIV with those investigating
emerging and re-emerging viruses of global concern to advance knowledge on pathogenesis, evolution,
prevention, treatment, and long-term sequelae. The goal is to gain a better understanding of molecular
mechanisms and apply lessons learned from one outbreak to another with a focus on deploying recent
technological advances such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), gene editing, antibody, and mRNA
therapeutics to tackle emerging infections. This conference program includes sessions that will cover infections
such as HIV, SARS-CoV-2, monkeypox, Influenza, hemorrhagic fevers, among others. The influence of an
underlying HIV condition on other viral infections will also be discussed. This conference will feature speakers
from across the globe and bring together researchers who study a variety of viral infections, with an aim of
merging mechanistic and therapeutic insights gleaned from diverse pathogens to identify intersections and
potential opportunities in prevention and therapeutics related to HIV and other viruses. The unique intersection
of researchers and scientific topics of this conference, and the opportunities for informal cross-disciplinary
discussions, networking and mentoring interactions offer an unparalleled forum to advance virology research at
a critical time following on the recent COVID-19 pandemic."
10923559,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) increases the risk for liver disease and type 2 diabetes, major health issues for
Veterans. Reduced hepatic mitochondrial function (MitoFX), defined as reduced mitochondrial -respiration and -
fat oxidation, increased H202 emission, and uncoupled mitochondria, contribute to hepatic steatosis and liver
injury. In contrast, exercise protects against steatosis/liver injury via improving or enhancing MitoFX. Female
mice and women are protected against steatosis compared to males. Still, their susceptibility to steatosis and
poor metabolic health dramatically increases after the loss of ovarian function, suggesting estrogen is a potent
mediator of liver health and metabolism. In the last funding cycle, we showed that female mice display enhanced
MitoFX compared to males, which likely underlies their protection against steatosis. In female mice, we have
demonstrated that ovariectomy (OVX-eliminates estrogen and ovarian function) dramatically reduces MitoFX,
while exercising (partially) and estradiol (fully) restores MitoFX. This data points to estrogen's role in regulating
hepatic MitoFX in female mice. Also, OVX in female mice provides a pre-clinical model system to investigate
mechanisms and develop therapies that can be used for female Veterans. Estrogen putatively mediates MitoFX
via estrogen receptor-a (ERa) signaling, a signaling node that is likely critical for estrogen replacement therapy.
A significant knowledge gap exists on how to positively modulate hepatic MitoFX and lower the risk for steatosis
after the loss of ovarian function, which is the focus of this proposal. We posit that a primary tool by which
exercise drives enhanced MitoFX is through the activation of mitochondrial quality control (MitoQC) mechanisms
after each bout, including an induction of mitochondrial dynamics (fission/fusion) followed by mitophagy. These
processes remodel or eliminate mitochondria with high oxidative stress or impaired coupling of oxidative
phosphorylation, resulting in curated pools of healthy hepatic mitochondria (coupled respiration, low oxidative
stress, and enhanced oxidative capacity). However, our preliminary data suggests that OVX impairs the ability
of exercise to activate hepatic MitoQC, which we believe will limit the power of exercise to improve MitoFX and
treat steatosis. This aligns with clinical data suggesting that exercise is less effective at treating steatosis in post-
menopausal women. In this proposal, we will test if exercise and estrogen signaling through ERa are critical for
exercise-induced activation of MitoQC and treatment of steatosis and liver injury after OVX. We will also test
whether estrogen and exercise require the activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 is a primary
regulator of mitochondrial fission and the initiation of MitoQC. We have recently shown that it is highly
upregulated in the liver after acute exercise in mice with normal ovarian function but is downregulated by OVX.
The role of Drp1 in mediating exercise and estrogen-induced effects on MitoFX is unknown. Therefore, we will
also test the hypothesis that estrogen and exercise require Drp1-mediated MitoQC to improve MitoFX and treat
steatosis and liver injury. To perform these studies, we will utilize the OVX model in female mice with or without
estradiol replacement combined with inducible molecular mouse models (liver specific-ERα knockout mice
(LERKO) and Drp1 mice (L-Drp1)) and novel outcome measures (mitochondrial-proteomics and high-resolution
respiration). These studies will explore underlying mechanisms by which exercise and estrogen mediate hepatic
steatosis through hepatic MitoFX. Mechanistic outcomes will inform the development of therapies and treatment
for hepatic steatosis in post-menopausal women, a portion of the VA population growing rapidly and at high risk
for metabolic and liver disease."

The Southeastern Medical Scientist Symposium (SEMSS) was established in 2010 by students from the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Emory University, and Vanderbilt University Medical Scientist
Training Programs (MSTPs). The three programs have co-hosted the symposium with the location rotating
among Birmingham, Atlanta, and Nashville. The objective of the symposium is to encourage a collaborative and
interdisciplinary educational environment within the Southeast region of the United States. This student-
organized symposium seeks to foster connections between the MD/PhD students at multiple institutions across
the Southeast, exposing students to trends, challenges, and opportunities inherent in careers of academic
physicians. Future SEMSS meetings will continue to rotate locations between Birmingham, Atlanta, and
Nashville in order to optimize regional student participation. The program of each SEMSS will continue a highly
effective format, including keynote speaker presentations, multiple topic-specific breakout sessions, student
research oral and poster sessions, and social events. The breakout sessions are divided into sessions of interest
to undergraduates, medical students, and MD/PhD students. The target audience for the SEMSS is MD/PhD
students in training programs in the southeast and residents/fellows, MD students, and undergraduate students
at southeastern institutions who have an interest in future careers as physician-scientists. Another important
purpose of this symposium is to expose undergraduate students to physician-scientist trainees and faculty in
order to foster excitement about careers in academic medicine and increase the pipeline of future physician-
scientists. We have focused on providing travel awards to female, URM, and students from institutions without
MD/PhD programs in order to diversify the pipeline of future physician-scientists. Greater than 60% of students
who have previously been awarded a travel award are currently in graduate training programs, with 19% in
MD/PhD programs and another 20% in medical schools currently. This successful outcome of travel awardees
emphasizes the impact and continued need of the SEMSS. Additionally, with COVID-19 pandemic drastically
limiting exposure of undergraduates to physician scientist careers and limiting opportunities of MD/PhD students
to present their research and network with other physician scientists, future in-person SEMSS meetings are
critical to providing a venue for the continued development of future physician-scientists."

This K08 proposal will address a critical gap in our fundamental knowledge of the effects of insufficient sleep
and depression on longitudinal sleep-dependent memory development and will prepare this applicant,
Katharine Simon, PhD, to become an independent translational investigator with expertise in sleep, memory,
and psychopathology across development. Depression in adolescence is a growing public health concern, with
symptoms beginning during the transition to adolescence (9 -12 years)1 and conferring heightened risk for
long-term deleterious psychological and cognitive outcomes.20-21 In contrast to other clinical disorders,
depression is associated with specific deficits in hippocampal-dependent (HcDep) memory (e.g., declarative
memory).9-11 Although the brain mechanisms underlying depression-related memory deficits are not
understood, one potential risk factor may be insufficient sleep (e.g., short sleep duration, variable timing, or
poor quality) given the critical role of sleep in supporting new hippocampal-dependent memory formation
(sleep dependent memory [Hc-SDM]).12 The transition to adolescence is a particularly vulnerable time that
involves increasingly dramatic changes to sleep patterns.2,3 Although a few nights of insufficient sleep does not
consistently affect HcDep memory performance in adolescents18,50-53; typical insufficient weekly sleep is
associated with reduced hippocampal volume.19 At present, it is clear there is a fundamental gap in our
knowledge of the individual trajectories of insufficient sleep, depression, and Hc-SDM across the
adolescent transition and the longitudinal associations between these factors. To address this question,
27 pre-adolescents (9 to 12 years) will be assessed using a repeated measurement-burst design with sampling
at quarterly intervals over a year using a personalized, mobile health (mHealth) platform. At each quarterly
evaluation, for 7 consecutive days, participants will complete daily sleep diaries, ecological momentary
assessments, and Hc-SDM tasks. The hypothesize is that insufficient sleep and depression symptoms across
the adolescent transition will predict long-term Hc-SDM performance trajectory deficits. This Mentored Clinical
Scientist Research Career Development Award will support Dr. Simon’s training goals to acquire skills and
knowledge in 1) gaining expertise in naturalistic, longitudinal cognitive and clinical assessment using mHealth
and wearable devices, 2) training in clinical pediatric research, and 3) intensive repeated-measure analyses.
These training aims will build on Dr. Simon’s prior training in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology
and expertise in short-term experimental sleep-dependent memory research. Furthermore, the training Dr.
Simon will gain from this K08 is an essential step to become an independent developmental translational
researcher and will directly lead to my future R01 application to further evaluate the longitudinal trajectories of
insufficient sleep and depressive symptoms on older adolescents’ Hc-SDM memory and identify key windows
in which sleep-based interventions can support cognitive trajectories in depressed adolescents."

 One in three Latinx adults report having extreme levels of stress and are more likely to say their stress has
increased in the past year. Stress in Hispanics has been linked to high rates of depression, higher
cardiovascular disease, and increased diabetes risk. High rates of stress and negative health outcomes among
Latinx may be the result of the unique stressors (i.e., acculturative and discrimination) they encounter, which
are not experienced by the general U.S. population. Indeed, acculturative stress and discrimination have been
linked to poor health outcomes. Moreover, Latinas experience greater perceived stress and negative
psychological outcomes compared to their male counters. Because Hispanic women have multiple social
identities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status) that interact with different forms of systemic
oppression, this leads to higher levels of overall and cultural stress. Clearly defined gender-based roles are
integral to Latinx cultural and contribute to both acculturative and discrimination-related stress.
 Both cognitive-behavioral stress management interventions (CBSMi) and mindfulness meditation training
have demonstrated success in reducing stress among Hispanics. However, Hispanics lack access to quality
health care (including mental health services) and cultural values prevent them from seeking out services to
address their mental health needs. One emerging accessible and cost-effective solution is mHealth, yet there is
a dearth of mHealth solutions that are developed specifically to address the stressors that Hispanics females
face. Therefore, we aim to develop Quédate Tranquila, a mobile CBSMi (m-CBSMi) that is tailored to the lived
experiences of Hispanic women. Quédate Tranquila will utilize theory (Transactional Model of Stress) to
reduce affective, behavioral, and physiological responses to stress and its downstream health consequences
among Latinas. The m-CBSMi will aim to foster and support healthy coping responses to stress by
incorporating culturally tailored content in the form of videos, video testimonials, mobile tools that provide
additional social support, and interactive pages that incorporate quizzes and activities.
 In Phase I, a prototype m-CBSMi was developed. This development was informed by formative research
with staff members from a federally qualified health center and Hispanic women 18 years of age and older. The
results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding
benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal.
 During Phase II, the m-CBSMi for Latinas will be fully developed. Then, in partnership with Mary’s Center,
the effectiveness of the m-CBSMi to reduce stress among Hispanic women will be examined. Participants will
be randomly assigned to either the intervention conditions or to a matched control condition. Secondary
measures will assess cultural stressors (acculturative and discrimination), coping (social support and health
behaviors), well-being (positive and negative affect, mindfulness), subjective health, and knowledge."
10932558,"Whether accidental or intentional, ionizing radiation (IR) exposure poses significant risks to thoracic organs,
particularly the heart and lungs. It can lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular senescence, resulting in a
range of clinical complications. These include pericarditis, coronary artery disease, valvular issues, heart
failure, arrhythmias, radiation pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and even mortality. Notably, there are sex-
based differences in how individuals respond to IR, with women often displaying greater susceptibility to long-
term IR toxicities. The exact mechanisms behind these sex-based disparities are still unclear, but they may
involve factors such as hormones, genetics, and metabolism. Nitric oxide synthase 1 plays a crucial role in
catalyzing nitric oxide biosynthesis. Preliminary research in mice exposed to 20 Gy cardiac-targeted IR showed
that they developed heart and lung abnormalities, including diastolic dysfunction, conduction issues, cardiac
fibrosis, and pulmonary congestion. However, male mice exhibited additional problems including left ventricular
dilation, systolic dysfunction, and alterations in mitochondrial electron transport chain complex II activity.
Interestingly, both male and female mice with decreased nitric oxide synthase 1 expression exposed to 20 Gy
experienced reduced left ventricular size and function, faster atrioventricular conduction, and no evidence of
diastolic dysfunction. Treatment with a superoxide dismutase mimetic, Rucosopasem, mitigated some of the
IR-induced cardiac changes in female mice. This data implies that sex-related differences in nitro-oxidative
pathways and disruptions in the mitochondrial electron transport chain metabolism could influence sensitivity to
cardio-thoracic IR. We hypothesize that IR-induced, sex-dependent alterations in redox signaling pathways
stemming from differences in mitochondrial electron transport chain activities between males and females lead
to changes in reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which in turn mediate IR-induced cardiac
and pulmonary dysfunction. Aim 1 will use an upper body model of IR exposure to investigate the sex-based
effects of IR on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in wildtype and heterozygous nitric oxide synthase 1
disrupted mice, its role in generating reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and its impact on cardio-
pulmonary function. Aim 2 will assess the effectiveness of Rucosopasem, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, in
mitigating IR-induced effects on the cardio-thoracic system in both male and female wildtype mice exposed to
upper body IR. Completing these studies could unveil sex-based disparities in redox metabolism and
mitochondrial dysfunction, potentially offering targets for preventing or reducing IR-induced cardio-pulmonary
toxicities. Rucosopasem might also emerge as a novel therapeutic approach for radiation mitigation."
10932563,"Project Summary
South Africa has the world’s largest burden of HIV, with almost eight million people living with HIV and the
largest HIV treatment program in the world. With the ongoing development of new and more effective
antiretroviral therapies (ART), it is important to understand the effect of different treatment strategies on
treatment and care outcomes as well as the risk of other co-morbidities. Prior research by the applicant and
sponsors evaluated South Africa’s policy change in 2019 of initiating HIV treatment with a regimen containing
dolutegravir rather than efavirenz. This work demonstrated that retention and viral suppression outcomes are
similar before and after the policy change. However, this research utilized a regression discontinuity design, so
the analysis was limited to those who initiated within 3-months on either side of the date of the policy change
and further work is needed to see if this result holds once there is more experience with the new medication. In
addition, extensive access to ART in South Africa has led to people living with HIV longer. There is growing
concern that persons living with HIV, in particular those on a dolutegravir-based ART regimen, may be at
increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). However, the severity of this risk is unclear. The aim of
this proposal is to better characterize the effect of different HIV treatment strategies on retention and viral
suppression, and to address the gap in literature on the risk of dolutegravir on NCDs. Aim 1 leverages the
Target Trial Framework to assess the effect of dolutegravir treatment over 12- and 24-months on retention and
viral suppression in comparison to efavirenz over the same time period. Aim 2 will utilize sequential
randomized trials and a Target Trial Framework approach to assess, among patients initiating a treatment
regimen containing efavirenz, the effect on retention and viral suppression after switching to dolutegravir within
the first 12-months of treatment compared to remaining on efavirenz. Aims 1 and 2 will use data from a large,
prospective cohort of patients receiving care at a public health-sector clinic in South Africa. Aim 3 will assess
the effect of dolutegravir treatment on the risk of weight gain, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in
comparison to efavirenz. Aim 3 will utilize data from clinics located in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal, Northern
Cape, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and Gauteng provinces. A detailed training plan, in conjunction with these
research aims, will provide the applicant with hands-on training to support her development as an independent
infectious disease epidemiologist with expertise in NCDs and novel epidemiologic methods for observational
data. The training plan outlines mentorship opportunities provided by sponsors, who are experts in their field
and have a well-established record of collaboration and mentorship."
10933121,"Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a severe form of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) characterized by
daytime hypercapnia and hypoventilation during sleep. OHS is driven by chronically decreased CO2 sensitivity
and depressed ventilatory responses to CO2 (hypercapnic ventilatory response, HCVR). Non-invasive
ventilation restores CO2 sensitivity and treats OHS. However, adherence to this treatment is poor. There is no
effective pharmacotherapy for OHS. Leptin increases HCVR and treats hypoventilation in leptin deficient ob/ob
mice. Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice emulate all features of human OHS, including awake hypercapnia, upper
airway obstruction during sleep and sleep hypoventilation. However human and mouse DIO become resistant to
leptin limiting leptin as a pharmacotherapy. This proposal is focused on identifying pharmacological targets
downstream of the leptin network to treat OHS. Leptin upregulates pro-opiomelanocortin, which is a pre-
hormone post-transcriptionally processed into several peptides, including α melanocyte stimulating hormone, a
ligand for the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) promoting energy expenditure. The MC4R agonist setmelanotide
has been approved for treatment of genetic forms of obesity linked to mutations in the POMC/MC4R/leptin
pathways. The role of MC4R in control of breathing remains unknown. Our exciting preliminary data shows that
setmelanotide augments the HCVR and treats SDB in DIO mice, that chemogenetic activation of MC4R (+)
neurons in the parafacial region containing the chemosensitive retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) increases baseline
ventilation and HCVR without any effect on metabolism; and that MC4R (+) parafacial neurons project to
brainstem respiratory premotor neurons, that, in turn, project to the phrenic motor nucleus. Our overarching
hypothesis is that MC4R agonists treat OHS by augmenting hypercapnic sensitivity in MC4R+ neurons
in the parafacial region, which is a major center of CO2 sensitivity. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine
the therapeutic benefits of the MC4R agonist setmelanotide in OHS in DIO mice. We hypothesize that (A) a
single dose will acutely; and (B) a three-month course of setmelanotide will chronically augment HCVR and
abolish SDB in randomized placebo-controlled trials; and that (C) the effect of setmelanotide on ventilation will
be prevented by the MC4R blocker SHU9119. In Specific Aim 2, we will use DIO Mc4r-Cre mice to examine if
the respiratory effects of MC4R activation by setmelanotide can be mimicked by chemogenetic activation and
attenuated by chemogenetic inhibition of MC4R+ parafacial neurons. In in vitro Specific Aim 3, we will examine
the synaptic neurotransmission from MC4R (+) neurons in the parafacial region to the rostral ventral respiratory
group (rVRG) neurons that project to the phrenic motor nucleus using selective expression of ChR2 in Mc4r-Cre
parafacial neurons, retrograde identification of spinally projecting rVRG neurons and patch clamp
electrophysiology. CO2/pH chemosensitivity markers of RTN will be detected in MC4R(+) neurons projecting to
rVRG. The proposal will provide a rationale for the therapeutic development of MCR4 agonists in OHS."
10913864,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Sarcoidosis is a systemic immune mediated disease that has an unknown etiology, no cure, and is currently
treated with broadly acting immunosuppressants that can lead to significant toxicity. Approximately half of
sarcoidosis patients experience self-limited disease that resolves on its own within 2-3 years, the remainder
progress to chronic sarcoidosis, characterized by progressive loss of lung function leading to pulmonary fibrosis.
Moreover, there are insufficient tools to guide clinical decision making on which patients will experience self-
limited sarcoidosis, and thus do not require immunosuppressive therapy, versus those that will progress to more
severe disease. We seek to identify immunological signatures associated with and predictive of sarcoidosis
disease progression. Our preliminary results suggest PD-1+ CD4+ T cells have pathological role through
production of profibrotic cytokines, such as IL-17A and TGF- β1. Additionally, estrogen augments pulmonary
fibrosis through modulation of pSTAT3, IL17, and TGF- β. We aim to build on these results by examining the
composite immune profile, while accounting for known non-immune risk factors. To accomplish this, we will
determine the longitudinal phenotype of innate and adaptive immune compartments utilizing longitudinally
acquired peripheral blood mononuclear cells with paired clinical characterization. Phenotyping will include
markers for leukocyte differentiation, activation, and recruitment. We will align these observations with in vitro
assays, wherein we aim to determine the functional capacity of the immune system using non-inflammatory
stimuli (e.g., polyclonal stimulation of the T cell receptor via plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28
antibodies), a panel of Toll like receptor ligands that mimic pathogenic challenge (lipopolysaccharide,
Pam3CSK4, transfected poly(I:C), transfected poly(dA:dT)), mycobacterial antigens or live influenza A virus. To
incorporate these data with known non-immune risk factors, we will utilize multivariate modeling to account for
cellular populations, genetics, socioeconomic status, and demographic factors (age, sex). Outcome variables
will be sarcoidosis outcome (progressor or resolver) and clinical quantitative metrics of lung function to identify
cellular predictors of sarcoidosis disease progression and immunological signatures underlying clinical outcome,
respectively. The integrative experimental and analytical approach will allow for quantitative comparisons of the
magnitude of each contributing factor that can prioritize putative therapeutic targets. These data can ultimately
be used to improve clinical decision making regarding appropriate use of therapeutics, identify optimum points
of intervention for high-risk patients, and will set the foundation for follow-up studies on the development of
targeted therapeutics that maximize treatment efficacy while minimizing detrimental side effects. Insight gained
from these studies is also likely to have additional relevance for understanding the immune system's role in other
interstitial lung diseases, such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma lung."
10923198,"The HIV pandemic has grown to ~40 million individuals world-wide. Although Highly Active Anti-
Retroviral Therapy (HAART) has been transformative for millions of people, less than half of those infected are
on therapy. And while the current medications are typically well-tolerated and efficacious, because of both
acute and chronic drug toxicities, drug-drug interactions, and virus resistance, there is always room for novel
HIV therapeutics, especially for those considered first-in-class. Rev is an essential regulatory protein of the
virus, which multimerizes on the Rev-response element or RRE to export intron-containing HIV mRNAs from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although there are some compounds in clinical trials that purportedly interfere
with Rev function, there are no FDA-approved agents that specifically target Rev’s known mechanism of
action. Notably, an anti-Rev compound should reduce the amount of both cytoplasmic and virion-associated
unspliced or genomic RNA and also plasma viral loads in the absence of viral replication, an activity that none
of the currently FDA-approved drugs possesses. We have developed a cell-based firefly luciferase (FFLUC)
complementation system that quantifies Rev-Rev interaction but then transitioned over to a cell-free one that
has an excellent Z’ (Z factor) of 0.64 in 384-well format. Here we first wish to further optimize the assay to then
permit testing of compounds in 384-well format, in collaboration with Yale Center for Molecular Discovery
(YCMD), which has multiple collections of compounds and requisite instrumentation to allow fully automated
testing of ~125,000 small molecules. These compounds will initially be screened at a single concentration, and
positives will be retested at a range of concentrations, in replicates. Secondary assays for specificity of
inhibition of Rev-Rev interaction include non-inhibition of FFLUC activity and transcription, non-inhibition of
unrelated protein-protein interaction, and inhibition of Rev function using a variety of assays, including cell-free
multimerization, production of Gag, and both X4 and R5 HIV replication in vitro. Therapeutic index (TI) of any
hits will be determined using a cell-based assay. Based upon these results, the physicochemical properties of
any hits will be assessed and in silico hit expansion along with any necessary synthesis will be achieved by the
commercial entity Life Chemicals. These select hit compounds will be retested in the above assays in order to
identify even more potent and active drug-like compounds. At the end of two years it is hoped that a number of
advanced hit and close-to-lead compounds will have been identified that have high TI (>100) and specifically
prevent Rev-Rev interaction and thus interfere with known Rev function, which will allow future medicinal
chemistry testing and iterative in vitro and in vivo studies to identify lead compounds of enhanced potency,
activity, and specificity. Thus, a long-term goal of this work is to identify a first-in-class anti-Rev molecule that
is capable of inhibiting the function of an essential, regulatory gene of HIV, which will expand the
armamentarium of therapeutics against this critical virus."
10923199,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major problem in virally suppressed people with human immunodeficiency virus (VS-PWH) is that despite well-
controlled viral suppression many patients develop cognitive impairment, especially during aging. Furthermore,
aging is a primary risk factor for cognitive impairment in the healthy population. Recent clinical and preclinical
studies identified neuroinflammation increases during aging and in VS-PWH. For example, brain imaging studies
in VS-PWH showed elevated markers for inflammation even under antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, the elevation
of inflammation markers correlated with worse cognitive performance. Thus, the synergistic neuroinflammation
brought on by aging and HIV may lead to the greater susceptibility for cognitive decline in some PWH. There is
a lack of understanding for how neuroinflammation drives cognitive decline and a major unmet clinical need to
develop a robust resource to track brain associated immune cells in VS-PWH to examine neuroinflammation
more directly in living patients. This project aims to track inflammatory macrophage states in vivo using
inflammatory mouse models for both aging and HIV infection (EcoHIV) and then determine which states are
prominent in human disease and contribute to clinical pathology. The specific aims are to 1) determine the spatial
distribution of microglia activation states in inflammatory mouse models. We will use hypothesis-driven spatial
transcriptomics to map macrophage and microglia activation states in two mouse models with underlying
neuroinflammation: two-year aged, and HIV infected (EcoHIV) mice. Second, we will isolate brain-associated
immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of VS-PWH to identify myeloid activation states which contribute
to disease pathology. In aim 2a, we will identify gene expression modules in CSF-derived myeloid cells that
associate with age and predict clinical pathology. Then in aim 2b, we will define the myeloid activation states
enriched in CSF from VS-PWH compared to HIV-uninfected controls. The hypothesis is that genes enriched in
CSF-derived myeloid cells will stratify patients with persistent neuroinflammation and at a greater susceptibility
for cognitive impairment. Additionally, the spatial transcriptomics from the disease relevant animal models will
provide a biologically relevant context for the disease-enriched activation states identified in VS-PWH. The
overall goal of the proposed Career Development Award (K01) is to identify the cellular honing of immune cells
to the brain, uncover disease modulating cellular markers of neuroinflammation on cognitive deficits, and
establish CSF-derived cells as a unique resource for monitoring neuroinflammation in people living with HIV.
These goals will be accomplished by the specific aims and facilitated by the proposed training plan which is
divided into three domains: 1) biostatistics and data science, 2) inflammation in HIV and aging, and 3)
professional development. The training plan was designed to gain expertise in HIV research, a new direction for
the PI, and to establish an independent laboratory with a research program focused on the regulation of brain
immune cell activity and the consequential impact on brain function in human disease."

Value-Based Payment (VBP) policy, which incentivizes care quality and cost savings instead of volume-based
care, remains under-studied concerning populations with behavioral health disorders. Moreover, little is known
about VBP policy effects within Medicaid or its impact on equity. The sparse literature primarily targets broad
categorizations of substance use disorder and findings rarely extend to specific disorders, such as opioid use
disorder (OUD). In light of OUD's burden on individuals and society, there is a critical need to identify policy
levers that can improve OUD treatment and value of care for all races and ethnicities. The long-term goal is to
identify health policies that can improve healthcare inequities among persons with OUD. The overarching
objective of this proposal is to exploit a natural experiment and assess the causal impact of NYS Medicaid VBP
policy and examine the policy's equity effects on OUD-related outcomes (service use, quality, overdose, and
healthcare costs). Because factors at different levels may alter the policy's effects, we will also evaluate the
influence of individual- (e.g., comorbidities), area- (e.g., provider supply), and policy-level (e.g., VBP provider
risk-level) factors on OUD-related outcomes. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the
outcomes of NYS Medicaid VBP policy will inform and guide policymakers as well as states implementing
similar initiatives. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Assess the overall causal impact of NYS
Medicaid VBP policy on OUD-related outcomes, including service use (any OUD service use, any MOUD),
quality (MOUD initiation/ engagement/ retention, follow–up after ED visit for OUD, 30-day OUD hospital
readmission, and hepatitis-C virus screening), opioid-related overdose (non-fatal/ fatal), and costs (total and
component); 2) Determine the equity effect of NYS Medicaid VBP policy on OUD-related outcomes, including
service use, quality, overdose, and costs; and 3) Examine whether individual-, area-, and policy-level factors
moderate the effects in Aims 1-2, and provider risk-level as a potential mediator/ suppressor of VBP impact.
Building on our partnership with the NYS Department of Health, we have selected aims and outcomes that
align with NYS Medicaid Program priorities. To complete these aims, we will use longitudinal Medicaid data
linked to area-level and death certificate data and employ a robust quasi-experimental research design, which
allows for causal inferences. Results will fill a critical evidence gap regarding Medicaid VBP policy effects
among vulnerable and high-need beneficiaries, providing valuable evidence to VBP states and those
considering VBP adoption. Work from this proposal will be shared with stakeholders and policy officials in NYS
to inform the ongoing implementation of their VBP policy."

Improving naloxone access is a central pillar of the policy landscape to curb rising overdose deaths rates in the
United States. In particular, improving access among “laypersons” is considered one of the most cost-effective
naloxone distribution options, but there is surprisingly little evidence about the share of people who carry
naloxone, where and how those who carry naloxone obtained the medication, barriers and perceived barriers
to purchasing or otherwise obtaining naloxone, optimal price points, and so on. Although two over-the-counter
(OTC) naloxone products were recently approved, there is little research about how this policy decision will
change behavior.
This project will provide some of the first evidence on the state of naloxone carrying in the United States,
including near real-time monitoring of knowledge of and purchase behavior related to the OTC products as
they become more widely available. This project will also track new and evolving barriers to the purchasing of
OTC naloxone. We will use vignettes to study optimal price points for naloxone at the pharmacy and,
separately, for the OTC naloxone products, providing especially timely evidence as policymakers wrestle with
how to keep the OTC products affordable when many sources of insurance may not cover them.
We will field a survey in each year of the project about naloxone access and use in (1) a nationally-
representative online sample and (2) a sample of individuals self-reporting “opioid dependence.” These
samples provide an opportunity to gather and publish timely evidence as the naloxone market experiences a
major shift, potentially encountering new and unforeseen barriers further hindering access and use of
naloxone. This project will ask specifically about barriers such as stigma, price, and other factors to
understand the scope for improving naloxone purchasing and possession. We will report time-sensitive
evidence about the importance of several factors with policy recommendations to address those barriers.
Given policymakers’ specific concerns with price, we will field vignettes to determine the willingness-to-pay
distribution for naloxone (both at the pharmacy and OTC). We will report how naloxone purchasing would
change if prices were reduced to different levels.
As overdose death rates continue to rise to unprecedented levels in the United States, improving naloxone
access has become an increasingly necessary policy objective. Yet, we do not have access to even basic
metrics to understand how naloxone carrying rates are evolving. This project will represent a major step
forward in our goal to increase naloxone use."

This project proposes to develop methods for automated, real-time, single-voxel magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) in brain tumors, integrate these methods with a clinical MRI system, evaluate their
performance, and distribute them as open-source tools to the research community. MRS can provide metabolic
information noninvasively for assessment of tumor phenotype and therapeutic response. Single-voxel MRS
methods provide the best quality and most reliable data, but require the scanner operator to have a high skill
level and expertise to produce good quality results. The need for this expert involvement in both acquisition
and processing remains a critical barrier to the translation of MRS methods to clinical research sites without
spectroscopy experts and to clinical practice. The first part of this project is to develop a method for 3D voxel
placement using image guidance, integrate this method with a clinical MR system, and evaluate its
performance. In the second part, we will automate our advanced MRS methods. In the third part, we will create
real-time, automatic quantification tool specific to the obtained MRS data that will provide clinically interpretable
results. We identified collaborators, the brain cancer researchers and clinicians, who will be early adopters and
beta-testers of our tools. Successful completion of this project will improve data robustness and quality,
eliminating the need for the expert interaction at the time of the scan and enabling adoption of MRS in multi-
site clinical trials and clinical practice."
10923737,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Modern biomedical science enjoys an unprecedented ability to identify and describe viral pathogenic
mechanisms, as well as characterize the biomolecular components that constitute them. However, we have not
yet achieved a fully quantitative biophysical understanding in which modeling of component molecules is
accurately predictive of viral functions in cells. Characterization of biomolecular structural dynamics, as opposed
to their static structures alone, is creating to new inroads to quantitative modeling of cellular function as well as
novel drug-targeting strategies. My recent work examining an RNA-protein interaction critical to HIV genome
transcription suggests that highly quantitative measurements and systematic mutant design, which specifically
perturbs dynamic properties, is a viable strategy for predicting viral RNA function in cells. In this proposal I plan
to use a multi-modal integrative approach to quantitatively measuring RNA dynamics for the purposes of building
a predictive model of RNA function and developing a novel RNA-targeting strategy. I will use the interaction of
the HIV 5’-leader RNA with the Gag polyprotein as the model system for these studies as it is a well-studied yet
complex interaction that involves critical interaction with the lipid bilayer and is also essential for the process of
viral genome packaging, making it a relevant drug target. In Aim 1 I will develop integrative high-throughput
(HTP) technologies that combine three-dimensional structural ensembles of component biomolecules with
quantitative measurements of in vitro and cellular functions to build predictive models of viral activity that can be
applied broadly. Specifically, I will construct a library of thousands of 5’-leader RNA mutants designed to
systematically perturb its structural dynamics. I will create a plasmid library of these sequences to develop an
RNA-Seq-based methodology to quantitatively measure the cellular activity of RNA mutants in HTP. I will then
use existing HTP methods such as RNA-MaP to evaluate the in vitro binding affinity of the same library of
sequences. Lastly, I will interpret this experimental data using structural dynamic ensembles of each RNA mutant,
determined from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-informed structure prediction programs, to build a
predictive model of the 5’-leader:Gag interaction. By evaluating RNA mutants in HTP, I simultaneously screen
for non-functional, low abundance RNA conformations in cells that could represent both attractive drug targets
and tools for applications in synthetic biology. In Aim 2 I will identify and obtain ensemble descriptions of these
non-functional conformations using NMR and computational modeling and target them for antiviral drug
development using ensemble-based virtual screening (EBVS). I will also develop a fluorescence-based in vitro
screening assay involving the lipid bilayer with which to test hits from virtual screening as well as in-house small
molecule libraries. Lastly, I will use orthogonal biophysical methods to further validate hits, as well as use them
to test the model constructed in Aim 1."
10925226,"Project Summary: This is a renewal application for years 17-21 of this summer mentored research training
program in cancer epidemiology for U.S. public health graduate students. This application supports a 12-week
mentored summer field research experience in foreign countries and among special populations in the U.S., an
orientation, a career development workshop, and mentored manuscript writing. There are few cancer
epidemiologists who have the skills and experience to implement studies in ethnically diverse settings, whether
in other countries or among migrant and minority populations in this country. Our faculty and field collaborators
have the experience to provide expert field research training and mentorship. An increase in qualified
applications has reduced the acceptance rate from 78% in the first few years to 19%, when the program
became open to students from all 247 U.S. schools and programs of public health in the current funding cycle,
in which students were recruited from 41 states. The program expanded its field research sites in minority
populations in Michigan, Nebraska, and New York. Strong infrastructure in global sites has also been
extended from Africa and the Middle East to Latin America, Asia, and Europe. The publication rate of students
from their summer research data is 78% and alumni published 699 papers after finishing the program. Sixty-
five percent of alumni continued in cancer-related fields.
The objective of this proposal is to continue developing and implementing this summer research program to
prepare graduate students from accredited U.S. schools and programs of public health in the field of cancer
epidemiology in special populations. New features of this renewal application will be increasing the number of
annual positions from 15 to 22 and introducing a workshop for mentors in the beginning of the summer. To
achieve these objectives, the following specific aims are proposed:
1. Recruit and select MPH and PhD students to fill 22 positions each year of the 5-year grant renewal period.
2. Maintain and enhance the infrastructure developed in the past 15 years that supports students in summer
 field research experiences in special populations. A new innovation in this renewal will be the development
 of a 2-day session for mentors on the subject of mentoring in the beginning of the summer.
3. Maintain and increase the pool of on-campus faculty mentors and field-site research mentors developed in
 the past 15 years.
4. Maintain and enhance review and oversight functions of our Research Training Advisory Committee.
5. Maintain and enhance the process of formative and summative outcome evaluation and long-term tracking.
This program will continue to define cancer epidemiology in special populations as a future career discipline for
students in the field of epidemiology. The successful implementation of this program will continue to provide a
source of skilled professionals needed to carry out cancer epidemiology research in special populations."
10922402,"Abstract
Senior care is unaffordable for millions, yet a large percentage of elderly Americans miss out on $30 billion yearly
in unclaimed financial aid because they are unaware that they qualify for assistance with food, housing,
prescriptions, and healthcare or they do not know how to apply. This presents a high-impact opportunity to help
millions with transformative innovation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) called Large Language
Models (LLMs) could allow for mass eligibility-screening of elderly Americans and optimal resource-matching
with underutilized local, state, or federal aid programs and other support programs. Novel applications of AI in
the eldercare ecosystem have the potential to help caregivers especially for individuals with demanding
conditions like Alzheimer's and related dementia (AD/ADRD) facing complex care demands and frequent access
and affordability issues. In this proposed study, we aim to develop, evaluate, and deploy an AI-powered care
planner technology to enable Americans to reclaim billions in underutilized aid and better access vital support
resources. This collaborative project, involving industrial, academic, and community partners, is oriented around
three specific aims: (Specific Aim 1) Development of novel specialized AI agents for elder care planning.
Three categories of AI “agents'' will be engineered for specialized care planning functionalities including: needs
assessment agents, resource & aid matching agents, and personalized care planning agents. (Specific Aim 2):
Integration of multi-agent network & preliminary usability testing of a novel intelligent user interface (UI)
among AD/ADRD caregivers. The agents will be integrated into a Multi-Agent Network and intelligent UI. The
UI will be evaluated among a pilot group of AD/ADRD family caregivers (n=25) using the User Experience in
Intelligent Environments (UXIE) framework to test for its acceptance and usability. Following a Build-Measure-
Learn approach, we will iteratively refine the UI through survey data, platform usage data, and interview feedback.
(Specific Aim 3): Evaluation of the user experience and caregiver perceptions of novel AI-powered care
planning technology among AD/ADRD caregivers with diverse backgrounds. The network will be evaluated
for usability, acceptance, and caregiving experience among AD/ADRD family caregivers (n=200) with diverse
backgrounds regarding demographic characteristics and health needs factors. The modified Technology
Acceptance Survey (TAS), the modified Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS), Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale
(CSES-8), and the positive and negative appraisals of caregiving (PANAC) will be used as key quantitative
survey tools to evaluate the technology acceptance and usability, and the caregiving experience in decision
making before and after using the technology. At Phase IIB conclusion, the care-planner technology will be ready
for service, commercially viable, and prepared for nationwide scaling."
10920983,"The number of opioid deaths has exploded in the last two years. This eruption of overdose deaths is being
wrought by a deadly cocktail of fentanyl and xylazine. Xylazine, also known as “Tranq” or “zombie drug”, is a
powerful veterinary sedative that is incredibly dangerous to people on its own. Xylazine extends the high or
euphoria of opioids, affording greater profits for traffickers. Xylazine elicits these effects by agonism of a2A
adrenergic receptor (a2A) in the spinal cord and brain. Since xylazine is not an opioid, its effects are not reversed
by naloxone (Narcan), the only approved opioid overdose rescue treatment. Narcan’s lifesaving effects stem
from reversal of respiratory depression. Xylazine-fentanyl cocktails have a high potential for fatal overdose since
both substances depress respiratory function and this may account for the surge in deaths. As xylazine antidotes,
existing a2A antagonist are inadequate, suffering from a lack of specificity. A major obstacle to developing a2A
antagonist as xylazine antidotes is extensive functional interplay between the 3 adrenergic receptor a2 subtypes,
causing concern over unexpected side effects. As a result, no approved antidote for xylazine exists. Further,
an agent reversing both opioid and xylazine overdose is an unmet clinical need.
Our Solution: NarcoBondα2/µO - a “nanosponge” containing decoy receptors for fentanyl (mu opioid receptor)
and xylazine (α2A-adrenergic receptor -α2A) will safely corral the drugs in the peripheral blood. As a result, the
drugs are trapped away the central nervous system, thus sparing the patient from the high CNS concentrations
that depress respiration and cause death. This mechanism is distinct from that of countermeasures such as
antagonists like naloxone, which displace and release drug from receptors back into circulation. Further,
NarcoBond’s sequestration mechanism does not trigger unwanted pharmacological antagonism, like that of an
α2A antagonist. A beneficial outgrowth of this mechanism is a broad capability to mitigate against all opioids
& all alpha2 agonists (e.g., Xylazine or its future illicit successors). Given the likelihood that other known
alpha2 agonists may soon appear in illicit drug supplies (as has multiple opiates), this principle is critical. We
envision that first responders will administer naloxone, as is current practice. If clinicians at the hospital observe
xylazine toxicity, they will administer NarcoBond (intravenously) to trap opioids and/or xylazine, fully remedying
life-threatening toxicity. We have already laid part of the groundwork for this approach. Previously, we showed
life-saving effects in rodents with NarcoBondµO, a nanosponge that sequestered opioids in the peripheral blood
from where the opioids were safely cleared. In Aim 1 of this Phase I we will focus on a nanosponge with xylazine
decoy receptors (NarcoBondα2). In Aim2, antagonism of the pharmacological effects xylazine in rodents by
intravenous NarcoBondα2 will provide proof-of-principle (POC). Successful POC will justify a Phase II study to
develop NarcoBondα2/µO, the combination nanosponge with both xylazine and opioid decoy receptors.
Subsequent, clinical development of NarcoBondα2/µO will deliver a paradigm shifting treatment for drug overdose."

Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including bisphenols, phthalates, and parabens, have
been linked to chronic diseases,1–5 and infertility.6,7 Unfortunately, minority and marginalized populations are
disproportionately exposed to and affected by EDCs, due to differences in product use, demographics,
occupations, and lifestyle, largely stemming from social inequalities.8,9 Mobile phone applications are powerful
tools for education and behavior changes, especially with the incorporation of gamification and instant
feedback.10,11 Currently, there are few mobile apps for raising EDC awareness and reducing environmental
exposures. The goal of this proposal is to develop the FIRST mobile application (app) and education
program, MEET, by providing Minority-focused Environmental health Education and Tracking on topics
pertaining to environmental exposures targeted to a minority population, assessing this population’s routine
exposures via an app-based mobile exposure journal which documents lifestyle, diet, and product use and
provide personalized exposure reduction recommendations, and tracking environmental health literacy
(EHL) and lifestyle improvements over time. Our app will provide real-time feedback in response to user
entries, so that individuals can make effective, evidence-based changes. We will achieve these goals by
implementing the following three aims: 1) identify lifestyle behaviors and products in a minority population that
may contribute to harmful exposures through focus groups and interviews; 2) develop culturally appropriate
educational EDC EHL materials and recommendations to reduce exposures by collaborating with community
members to add to and adapt Million Marker’s (MM) existing extensive online educational resources and
recommendations; and 3) integrate developed educational materials and targeted recommendations into the
existing MM app and test the usability of the app as well as changes in EHL, readiness to change, and
products and practices using in a cohort of 100 community members. Completion of this project will allow MM
to empower individuals in minority communities to increase their EHL and reduce their harmful exposures. This
Phase I SBIR funding will allow us to develop and begin testing the feasibility of our minority population-
targeted app, and improve MM’s products and services. If the aims are achieved, we will be ready for Phase II
to further evaluate the efficacy of this program, and scale and adapt it to multiple minority/marginalized
populations."

10910040,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Members of the ARF family of regulatory GTPases function as nodes in cell signaling to
coordinate essential cell processes; including membrane traffic, energy metabolism,
ciliogenesis, and the cytoskeleton. I have studied first ARF and later ARF-like (ARL) proteins for
over 30 years, using a combination of biochemical, cell and molecular biological, genetic, and
phylogenetic approaches and propose to continue these studies with a focus on their actions
linked to cilia and centrosomes to allow more detailed mechanistic studies of a subset of five of
the 30 GTPases in this family. We will use genome editing to generate a collection of knockout
cell lines to decipher signaling by the proteins under study. And we will use classical protein
biochemistry to purify and discover novel components in these pathways. We will both study
functions of each of these five GTPases in cells, and link to in vitro biochemical studies of their
enzymology. We will explore the potential for cross-talk or higher level ordering of cell signaling,
and also develop novel, single actions for atypical GTPases as a means of determining shared
or unique mechanisms within the family. A better understanding of these systems will reveal
novel insights into fundamental aspects of cell biology as well as providing potential targets for
intervention to alter the course of human diseases; including but not limited to cancer, heart
disease, neurodegeneration, ciliopathies, retinal degeneration, and deafness."
10906871,"Dementia affects over 44 million adults worldwide, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias
(ADRD) account for 60-80% of all cases among older adults. Physical disability is often the final consequence
of dementia before death. One-third of dementia cases may be attributable to modifiable factors, and due to
unclear benefit of approved AD treatment, there is a need to identify intervention targets to prevent dementia
and physical disability. Since both conditions may be preceded by declining cognitive and physical perform-
ance by over a decade, shared biological determinants of dual cognitive-physical decline that impact neuro-
logical, musculoskeletal, and other organ systems may inform therapeutic targets to prevent dementia and
physical disability. Separate research on these endpoints indicates that declining kidney function, which is a
model of premature aging, relates to both cognitive and physical decline. Trials of treatments to reverse kidney
disease are underway, but prevention may be more effective. Thus, identifying early markers of kidney decline
that are related to dual cognitive-physical decline and joint dementia-disability onset in initially health older
adults is a key step toward this goal. Beyond known kidney effects on bone, a kidney-brain axis and kidney-
muscle axis posit multiple mechanisms by which declining kidney health may lead to dementia and physical
disability such as kidney aging, impaired mineral homeostasis, and accumulation of uremic markers. However,
epidemiologic studies have not rigorously investigated whether kidney markers of these biological mechanisms
affect relations and dynamics between cognitive and physical endpoints. Plus, studies of longitudinal cognitive
and physical endpoints are vulnerable to survival bias and unmeasured confounding. Limitations of current
statistical methods are a key barrier to accurately quantifying the strength of relations between cognitive and
physical endpoints and to identifying markers of shared biological mechanisms to explain these relations.
Thus, new statistical methods are needed to overcome these barriers. Specific aims of this proposal are to: 1)
quantify relations between cognitive and physical endpoints over time; 2) test relations of kidney markers with
cognitive-physical endpoints; and 3) develop/validate a biomarker risk score to jointly and dynamically predict
dementia and disability. To this end, we propose to extend novel structural models for multivariate longitudinal
and time-to-event outcomes and apply them to harmonized data from 8 cohort studies of >22,000 community-
dwelling adults aged at least 65 years. We hypothesize that after addressing survival bias, cognitive and
physical endpoints will have stronger relations that are explained and predicted, in part, by markers of kidney
aging, impaired mineral homeostasis and by accumulation of uremic markers. New statistical methods
developed as essential tools to jointly study cognitive and physical endpoints will be made available to the
scientific community. The ultimate public health impact of this project is the potential for novel candidate
biomarkers to inform development of new strategies to prevent ADRD and physical disability in older adults."
10906873,"PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT
 This goal of this project is to investigate epigenetic neural mechanisms that can ensure meaningful sounds
are faithfully and adaptively represented in the adult auditory brain. One important aspect of this research
concerns the precision of acoustic content in memory, which is important for learning and performing fine-tine
auditory discriminations. A second, concerns long-term maintenance of experience via learning-induced
neuroplasticity for strong auditory memory, which is relevant to maintain learned auditory abilities for life.
 Animals (including humans) use associative learning to link sound cues to salient events (like rewards or
other significant outcomes). When neural mechanisms of memory formation are activated following these
experiences—mechanisms that span from molecules to genes to circuits and systems—associative memory is
formed, which in turn provides otherwise arbitrary sound with acquired significance. For example, in audition,
communication abilities require that sounds are precisely linked with their learned meaning, which depends on
neuroplasticity and enduring auditory memory that lasts from minutes, to hours and days, or a lifetime. Decades
of research indicate that associative learning systematically changes the sensory cortex to alter representation
of sensory cues with learned behavioral salience. How? This proposal is to determine with multi-level approaches
how molecules that regulate the genome—in particular epigenetic mechanisms that control chromatin
acetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs)—function to control genes that ultimately establish changes to the
auditory system that contribute to its plasticity and subsequent long-term auditory memory. Indeed, HDACs are
capable of enabling the auditory cortex to change with meaningful learning experiences, which may provide an
instructive control on the auditory system as a whole for adaptive (or sometimes maladaptive) function.
Currently unknown are the downstream gene and circuit mechanisms with which HDACs regulate auditory
cortical plasticity. This is important as it could explain from a genetic level why some individuals naturally form
auditory memories stronger and more specifically than others. Electrophysiological, pharmacological (AIM1)
and viral (AIM2) techniques to manipulate HDAC3 in a rodent behavioral model of auditory associative learning
will help determine how HDACs alter the acquisition and initial storage of robust auditory memory. Potential
cholinergic determinants of HDAC effects will be tested using gene-targeted and genome-wide sequencing
techniques (AIM1&2). Transgenic ChAT::Cre rats with activated DREADDs in cholinergic circuitry will challenge
HDAC function (AIM3). The studies will explain how HDACs regulate neuroplasticity from genes, molecules,
circuits and systems for robust auditory behaviors with a system better “tuned-in” to important sounds. This
research promotes neuroepigenetics and gene-discovery as an important new niche for auditory neuroscience."

10930299,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals comprise a growing population of over 1.3 million
people in the United States. TGD individuals experience cancer care-related disparities with
comparatively more frequent late-stage cancer diagnoses and more premature cancer deaths. Although
cancer screening mammography saves lives, previous, relatively small studies suggest TGD individuals
who are eligible for screening are not screened. Further, TGD people generally remain inaccessible to
research because of fear of discrimination. This K23 career development application seeks to learn how
many of these screening-eligible individuals are not screened for breast cancer and why. In aim 1, we
propose to acquire the necessary – but unknown -- benchmark data on the actual rates of cancer
screening mammography in TGD individuals who should be screened and to identify factors associated
with screening or lack thereof. We propose to interrogate and analyze data from a 200 million-patient
insurance claims database (the national Optum Labs Data Warehouse). To identify TGD patients, we will
use surgical, pharmacy, and outpatient visit coding information (our preliminary data demonstrate access
to 13,561 eligible TGD individuals). We will report cancer screening mammography rates in these TGD
individuals and compare these rates to those in cisgender women. This first aim promises to provide the
most robust data to date on cancer screening mammography in TGD individuals and will be crucial in
planning future studies to improve screening rates in this population. In aim 2, the principal investigator
(PI) will undertake qualitative interviews of TGD individuals who are 40+ years of age (40 years is the
age when screening mammography typically starts) to understand these individuals’ thoughts on
screening mammography (and on other cancer screening). These in-depth interviews will allow us to
learn directly from these underserved individuals how life-saving cancer screening procedures can be
made more accessible and will enable the PI to forge trust among TGD individuals. These 2 aims – in
conjunction with the completion of relevant coursework and ongoing interactions with a multidisciplinary
team of senior mentors (an endocrinologist, who directs the Mayo Clinic Transgender and Intersex
Specialty Care Clinic; a medical oncologist, who is interested in healthcare disparities among older
sexual and gender minority patients; a statistician; a qualitative researcher; a primary care physician with
expertise in the effects of hormones on disease outcomes; and an epidemiologist who focuses on
screening mammography) -- will enable the PI, a medical oncologist, to develop the necessary skills to
emerge as a national leader in cancer care of TGD individuals. The ultimate goal of this research is to
help underserved TGD individuals receive the same lifesaving benefits of cancer screening as the
general population."

10934505,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurologic disabling disease among young adults, affecting over
400,000 people in the United States, 2.5 million worldwide and 20,000 under the care of the Department of
Veterans Affairs. Most MS individuals are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and then
eventually transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). When MS individuals enter SPMS, neurologic deficits
progressively worsen over time. Approximately 15% of people with MS are initially diagnosed with primary
progressive MS (PPMS) and display increasing neurologic deficits without periods of relapse. Almost all the
FDA approved therapeutics for MS are for patients with RRMS and there are very limited therapeutic options for
people with progressive MS. A key cytokine/chemokine thought to drive the early inflammatory stage of MS to
a chronic progressive phase is macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). We have designed a potent
biological construct called RTL1000 and a second-generation derivative, DRhQ, that bind tightly to the MIF
receptor, CD74, and competitively inhibit MIF binding and it’s downstream signaling as well as inhibit T cell
activation and release of IL-2. RTL/DRhQ treatment was also found to promote neuroprotection and reduce the
severity of acute and chronic EAE, a mouse model of MS. RTL1000 was found to be safe and well tolerated at
doses 60 mg in a Phase I safety trial in patients with either RRMS or SPMS. However, RTL1000 contains the
extracellular domains of the MS risk factor, HLA-DR2 and as such, the FDA limited RTL1000 administration in
the clinical trial to HLA-DR2 positive patients (~50% of total MS subjects). Our second generation construct,
DRhQ, retains the potent immunomodulatory activity of RTL1000 but is HLA invariant and thus suitable for all
patients. In order to treat both DR2 positive and negative individuals with progressive MS, we are proposing
crucial preclinical studies of DRhQ and its mouse homologue, DRmQ, which will advance DRhQ towards a First-
In-Human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical trial. In this Merit Review application, we will evaluate: 1) multi-compartmental
pharmacokinetics; 2) validate relevant biomarkers, including infusion induced cytokine release, inhibition of
phosphorylated extracellular-related kinase (pERK1/2) and related cytokines, and inhibition of IL-2 secretion
induced by activated T cells; and 3) potential neutralizing activity of anti-drug antibodies against DRhQ. The data
collected during this project will be used to support the filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to
the FDA for a FIH study. The previous success of RTL1000 in reaching a Phase 1 clinical trial gives us confidence
that we will achieve success in Phase 1 as well as Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials with DRhQ."
10920056,"ABSTRACT
Microtubules (MTs) are structurally and functionally essential components of neurons, providing spatial
organization and ensuring intracellular trafficking. MTs are chemically and functionally heterogeneous structures
regulated by a complex molecular machinery that can modulate their composition, chemical modification, and
propensity for binding with specific MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Dysfunctions of MAPs are directly
associated with different forms of Alzheimer’s disease related disorders (ADRDs). This notion led to the
development of compounds restoring the correct functioning of MTs and, therefore, counteracting
neurodegeneration. However, currently this effort requires the use of methods that are costly, time consuming
and inefficient, as it requires the use of cell cultures and animal models. We propose to develop an on-chip
functional assay for identifying candidate MT-binding drugs to treat ADRDs. Our on-chip assay will replicate key
features of the neuronal MT microenvironment and will use in vitro generated MTs with kinesin based read out
system to measure the ability of potential drugs to stabilize and affect MT transport. We will validate the assay
using MT associated protein TAU and known MT stabilizing drugs. The Phase I funding will allow us to develop
a proof-of-concept on-chip assay that can be further developed in Phase II. The proposed chip will provide a
novel AD/ADRD cell-free in vitro model system that could be used in the translation process to perform high-
throughput screening for drug discovery and drug efficacy and functionally validate therapeutic target(s)."
10929367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 DNA replication is a highly conserved process essential for all life. Since eukaryotic genomes are very
large, they are replicated in parallel from thousands of replication origins. Proper regulation of replication
initiation is essential for maintaining genome stability. Oncogene activation dysregulates replication initiation
and enables rapid cell proliferation in cancer. Key regulators of replication initiation are over-expressed in
cancer, and mutations in these proteins cause rare genetic disorders.
 Yet, the molecular mechanisms that underlie replication initiation remain poorly understood, especially
in multicellular organisms, for two main reasons: (1) replication initiation involves transient protein-protein and
protein-DNA interactions that are very challenging to study using existing biochemical, genetic, and structural
methods; and (2) the most comprehensive studies of replication initiation have been done in yeast, however key
regulators of replication initiation are poorly conserved between yeast and metazoans. Notably, some human
replication factors are 2-3x larger than their yeast counterparts and containing novel domains with unknown
functions.
 My laboratory recently developed a single-molecule imaging platform to visualize replication initiation
in real time. We will use this powerful approach to (i) provide a quantitative description of replication initiation;
(ii) understand how this process changed from yeast to humans; (iii) delineate the role of key replication proteins
and their domains that are unique to metazoans; and (iv) understand why mutations in some replication
initiation factors cause disease. Our work will also provide valuable mechanistic insights into how cancer cells
sustain rapid proliferation by over-activating replication initiation and inform how replication initiation factors
may be used as biomarkers or targets for novel therapies."
10933846,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Limited regeneration of damaged organs and tissues in humans leads to chronic disease and degeneration,
while in many invertebrates and lower vertebrates, cellular regeneration repairs and preserves tissue function
throughout the lifespan. COBRE Phases I and II Comparative Biology of Tissue Repair, Regeneration and Aging,
played a central role in establishing the Kathryn W. Davis Center for Regenerative Biology and Aging (Davis
Center) at the MDI Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) as a leading institute in Comparative Biology. The Davis Center
was founded on the principle that comparative studies of diverse animal models would lead to a mechanistic
understanding of tissue and organ regeneration and identify key points of intervention to improve regeneration
in human tissues. In addition, Davis Center research has focused on mechanisms of aging using multiple
organisms to learn how cellular anabolic and catabolic pathways may be linked to extension of healthspan.
Comparative studies such as these provide a screening platform and rational foundation for development of
regenerative medicine therapies, including small molecule drug candidates capable of stimulating tissue
regeneration and slowing or reversing aging-induced degenerative changes in patients.
COBRE Phases I and II supported eight early-career Project Leaders and one mid-career Project Leader. Six
Project Leaders graduated with major independent grant support and the most recent COBRE recruit, Prayag
Murawala, has achieved significant professional success and is on a path to independent R01 support. Past and
current COBRE Project Leaders have achieved multiple professional milestones in publications, grants, patents,
new disease models and research tools, and formation of an IDeA program/Maine state government partnership
that allowed MDIBL to obtain $3M in voter-approved state bond funding to expand research infrastructure.
COBRE Phase III will continue to build the research infrastructure of the Davis Center by establishing self-
sustaining core facilities and funding pilot programs in Aging and Regeneration research. Essential core services
will be provided to COBRE graduates, MDIBL investigators, visiting scientists, pilot project awardees, MDIBL
course participants from INBRE network institutions, and investigators in Northeast region (NER) IDeA states.
Pilot project funding and imaging technology access grants will be made available to all investigators in NER
IDeA states. COBRE Phase III will greatly enhance the development of the Davis Center and MDIBL, which in
turn will ensure the continued enhancement of the biomedical research environment in Maine."

10933848,"COMPARATIVE ANIMAL MODELS CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of regenerative medicine is to harness stem cell biology and our understanding of endogenous
tissue repair processes to enhance human regeneration. Aging studies have identified multiple hallmarks of
aging and established a framework for extending healthspan. Despite this progress, the demand for
replacement organs still outstrips supply and chronic, age-associated degenerative disease remains a major
burden on the US healthcare system. While most human tissues and organs have limited regeneration
capacity, many invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates show robust regeneration in response to injury
and can replace lost and damaged organs, including the heart, limbs, spinal cord, and kidney. Aging studies
in C. elegans were the first to identify conserved metabolic pathways impacting lifespan that may be targeted
to reduce age-related degeneration. Comparative studies of these animal models provide a unique
opportunity to define mechanisms of healthy aging and regeneration and identify pathways that may be
targeted to enhance human regenerative potential and extend healthspan.
Research on regeneration in diverse animal models requires specialized facilities and expertise. The COBRE
Comparative Animal Models (CAM) Core builds on MDIBL’s signature expertise in comparative animal
biology to provide the animal resources necessary to grow and sustain the Kathryn W. Davis Center for
Regenerative Biology and Aging. During Phases I and II COBRE funding, the CAM Core provided animal
husbandry and transgenesis services for diverse animal models including zebrafish, axolotl, and C. elegans.
Core service was also a major factor in the recruitment of new COBRE/MDIBL Project Leaders. Over the
past ten years, CAM Core-supported research projects resulted in the publication of 61 papers by COBRE
Project Leaders and 57 papers by non-COBRE faculty. This research resulted in multiple firsts for the MDIBL
including the discovery of three lead small molecules for aging and regenerative medicine applications, three
issued U.S. patents, and launch of a spinoff, Novo Biosciences.
The primary goal of the CAM Core will be to support the research programs of all investigators in the Davis
Center and to help ensure the Center’s long-term sustainability. This will be accomplished by 1) providing
Davis Center faculty with animal husbandry resources, 2) Provide education and training in animal husbandry
for CAM Core users and aquatic veterinary practice, and 3) expanding user fee-supported services to ensure
long-term CAM Core fiscal sustainability."
10933849,"COMPARATIVE GENOMICS AND DATA SCIENCE (CGDS) CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
Computational genomics and bioinformatics are now an essential aspect of nearly all genetic studies of

transcriptional dysregulation leading to aging/inflammatory states and epigenetic ""clocks"" impacting gene
expression as we age, all biological disciplines now require bioinformatics expertise to plan experiments, acquire
and manage data, interpret findings, and integrate results in public repositories.
The Comparative Genomics and Data Science (CGDS) Core (formerly the Comparative Functional Genomics
Core) was established in COBRE phases I and II and provided essential support to investigators working in the
Kathryn W. Davis Center for Regenerative Biology and Aging. CGDS Core staff members have broad expertise
in analyzing genome-scale data sets including transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, non-coding RNA, and
genetic variation data. The CGDS Core Director Dr. Graber has over twenty-five years of experience in
computational analysis of genome-scale biological data, spanning multiple data types and divergent organisms
ranging from yeast to mammals. During COBRE Phases I and II, CGDS Core personnel provided essential
services in experimental design, data analysis, and education to all COBRE Project Leaders. The CGDS Core
will build upon its successes to establish a self-sustaining bioinformatics and data science core in Phase III. The
goals of the CGDS Core are 1) to provide both standard service and collaborative levels of bioinformatic support
to core users and collaborators, 2) continue to transition bioinformatic analysis pipelines to cloud computing, 3)
to educate and empower our users to perform their own bioinformatic and statistical analyses, 4) Establish
evaluation metrics for the core in conjunction with the external advisory committee and 5) enact a user fee
schedule to ensure long term sustainability of the CGDS core.
The proposed CGDS core incorporates state of the art bioinformatic services with the flexibility to engage with
core users at multiple levels of investigation. Continued bioinformatic education of users will empower a new
generation of investigators and allow for increased focus on innovation and new analytical pipelines as core
services. Consolidation of common data formats and broad access to data and analysis pipelines through cloud
computing are the current direction of bioinformatic and biomedical data processing and curation. Implementing
these core services will enable experimental innovation and increase research impact for CGDS core users."

network by establishing a microscopy course at MDIBL for graduate students, post-docs, research assistants,
and faculty from institutions across Maine. The COBRE LMF CORE will also organize and host two imaging
workshops highlighting 1) recent advances in biological imaging and innovations in light-sheet microscopy and
2) innovations in genetically encoded biosensors and digital image analysis. The COBRE LMF CORE will also
fund a visiting scientist program to enable investigators to use MesoSPIM imaging in their projects by providing
travel grants and user fee waivers. Enabling visiting investigators to acquire imaging data for publication and
grant applications will extend the impact of the COBRE Light Microscopy Facility Core to IDeA states nationally."
10934437,"Obesity and its co-morbidities are major threats to the health of Americans. In less than 20 years, the prevalence
of obesity increased from 30.5% to 42.4%, and the prevalence of severe obesity increased from 4.7% to 9.2%.
The mission of the Nebraska Center for the Prevention of Obesity Diseases through Dietary Molecules (NPOD)
is to prevent, treat and cure obesity and co-morbidities with bioactive food compounds. The focus on bioactive
food compounds is a unique niche in obesity research and has afforded NPOD with tools to ameliorate obesity
and co-morbidities through consumer-friendly, economically feasible adjustments to their diets with a negligible
effect on taste. In Phases 1 and 2, NPOD has delivered on NIGMS expectations. NPOD has increased its
member base 4.9-fold to 59 faculty in 26 departments (representing 571 trainees) at University of Nebraska-
Lincoln (UNL; lead institution), University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC; strategic partner), and University
of Nebraska Omaha. This growth was achieved through nine tenure-leading faculty appointments, recruiting
faculty not previously engaged in obesity research, and providing a home for obesity researchers who previously
worked in isolation. To date, NPOD members have secured nearly $195 million in external research funding, a
nearly 36:1 return on institutional investment. UNL and UNMC have contributed nearly 3500 square feet and
$5.5 million to NPOD in Phases 1 and 2 with additional institutional commitments in Phase 3 and the three years
following. Most of the new space was leveraged to develop a new Research Core (Biomedical and Obesity
Research Core, BORC), which provides state-of-the art services for research on obesity and bioactive food
compounds unique in Nebraska. BORC has fulfilled 1400 service requests per year that generated $266,335 in
annual revenue. NPOD is poised to continue its strong trajectory toward sustainability in Phase 3 and beyond
through five pillars of NPOD sustainability: institutional commitments, F&A costs, philanthropy, program project
grants, and NIDDK funding through the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center (NORC) mechanism. NPOD's
pursuit of sustainability will be guided by the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Implement NPOD's
succession plan to achieve sustainability through preparing former Research Project Leaders and a new hire
to serve as future Center Director. Specific Aim 2: Lead BORC into long-term sustainability by attracting new
users, particularly external users, through continued alignment of services offered with user needs and
strengthened promotional activities. Specific Aim 3: Increase NPOD's critical mass of investigators
conducting clinically important research through the Center's Pilot Grants Program and a new faculty hire in
a tenure leading appointment and expertise in electronic health records. Specific Aim 4: Increase NPOD's
revenue by prioritizing pilot grant applications with a high likelihood of leading to large-scale federal funding.
Specific Aim 5: Intensify efforts to convert NPOD from an NIGMS-funded COBRE to an NIDDK-funded
NORC through nurturing a cohesive group of obesity and nutrition researchers in Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska."

Single-molecule fluorescent live-cell imaging impacts translational biology by correlating individual protein
function with biological outcomes. Fluorescent nanodiamond sensors are capable of reporting on local
electromagnetic fields, free radicals, temperature, pH, and rotational orientation through nitrogen-vacancy color
centers. At molecular-level sizes (10-20 nm), however, these NV- emitters are destabilized to become inactive
and thus are not useable. In this proposal, we produce ultrasmall NDNV sensors with stabilized NV- by
fluorination and nitridation surface treatment as demonstrated by our preliminary results and guided by theory.
We use a plasma generated at atmospheric pressure through a dielectric barrier discharge to generate reactive
species that lead to surface chemical modifications at room temperature. A prototype reactor demonstrated
successful treatment of NDNV at sizes above ~50 nm. To develop ultrasmall nanodiamond-based sensors,
diamond nanomaterials from 10-40 nm size range will be functionalized by fluorination or nitridation to stabilize
NV-. In both cases, the excited state populations of the feedstock gases will be controlled by gas composition,
flow rate, and base pressure in combination with the plasma parameters. Chemical functionalization will be
verified and then correlated with optical properties which represent NV- content. Optimized candidates will then
be assessed to demonstrate changes in NV- content and quantum-relevant characteristics (T1 and T2). Because
the surfaces generated will be novel, cell viability screening to confirm that particles are consistent with
nanodiamond’s well-demonstrated biocompatibility will be also performed. To meet the growing demand as
predicted by commercialization estimates, scaled-production (grams-quantity per day) of functionalized
nanodiamond particles could be achievable by the end of phase II if successful. These ultrasmall NDNV quantum
sensors are expected to impact our understanding of disease and enable new modalities for drug and biomarker
discovery."
10923519,"Project Summary/ Abstract.
Glioma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is a major cause of neurological morbidity and
mortality, with no effective therapies. Low-grade gliomas invade healthy brain tissue over decades and as a
result fundamentally alter cellular and circuit level interactions responsible for information processing. As a
result, nearly all patients experience cognitive and behavioral impairments. New treatments have been
obstructed by limited understanding of the cellular and circuit level mechanisms governing the integrity of
neural circuits following low-grade glioma infiltration.
The influence of glioma infiltration on neuronal circuits have traditionally assumed that neurological
impairments occur because of glioma induced neuron death. However, it is now known that tumor cells make
electrical and chemical synapses with excitatory glutamatergic neurons. Neuronal signaling within cognitive
networks are however both balanced synchrony between excitatory and inhibitory signals and directional,
enabling the transmission of information to be organized in a hierarchy. The extent to which whether low-grade
gliomas cortical infiltration influences cortical laminar structure and GABAergic inhibitory signals remains
incompletely studies. This knowledge gap contributes to a paucity of therapies. Our long-term goal is to
accelerate the development of precision-medicine therapies to treat cognitive impairments through the
modulation of neuronal inputs. The objective of this application is to determine how glioma infiltration
influences cortical structure and function. The central hypothesis is that inhibitory GABAergic inputs are
reduced within lower feedback layers of cortex (Aim 1). Furthermore, we propose that information processing
of sensory representations (Aim 2) and speech production (Aim 3) will be demonstrated as loss of neuronal
population tuning responses which may be recovered with GABAergic restoration.
Aim 1 will define the cortical neuron laminar structure and excitatory-inhibitory transcriptional programs of
glioma-infiltrated cortex using histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics for neuronal density and subtype
within each cortical layer. Aim 2 will determine the functional consequences of glioma infiltration on information
processing in sensory regions. High-density local field potentials will be recorded from superior temporal and
somatosensory regions during speech perception and tactile tasks, examining task-related changes in
neuronal responses. Aim 3 will identify the functional consequences of glioma infiltration on information
processing in higher-order speech and motor regions. To do so, we will measure the spatial and temporal
responses from ventral pre-motor and motor regions to five clinically administered language paradigms of
varying complexity. We expect this work to advance understanding of information loss in low grade glioma.
These results will motivate and clarify potential target mechanisms for future clinical trials focused on restoring
excitatory-inhibitory balance to treat patients."
10933926,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ESI PROJECT
Lung transplant outcomes are the worst among solid organ transplants in large part due to the nearly universal
development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) in lung transplant recipients. CLAD is characterized
by progressive fibrosis of the small airways and less commonly of the alveolar spaces. Our group has contributed
to an evolving model of lung fibrosis that is initiated by injury to the small airways and alveolar epithelium and
can be interrupted by successful epithelial repair.
We focus on an intermediate epithelial cell population expressing genes characteristic of both AT2 and AT1 cells.
These “transitional cells” are expanded during postnatal development and in several models of lung injury and
fibrosis, but are rare in the normal adult lung. In a recently published paper (Nature 2023), we reported that lung
epithelial-specific knockout of a gene necessary to complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain during
development (Ndufs2) results in failed postnatal alveologenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an
accumulation of transitional cells in mice lacking epithelial Ndufs2 with upregulation of genes induced by the
integrated stress response (ISR). In our preliminary studies, knockout of Ndufs2 in adult AT2 cells results in
spontaneous lung fibrosis that was fatal after several months. A small molecule inhibitor of the ISR (ISRIB)
rescued postnatal alveologenesis and attenuated bleomycin- and asbestos-induced fibrosis in adult mice. More
importantly, ISRIB improved CLAD in a mouse model. Activation of the ISR results in a global inhibition of
translation accompanied by activation of a transcriptional program mediated by ATF4, both of which are inhibited
by ISRIB. We hypothesize that impaired mitochondrial function in the airway and alveolar epithelium, induced by
ischemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation, activates the ISR to enhance ATF4-mediated transcription,
precluding normal epithelial differentiation and allograft repair after PGD- (Project 1) or acid- (Project 2) induced
lung injury. The resulting failed repair leads to the recruitment of profibrotic MoAM and progressive fibrosis
(CLAD, Project 3). We will test this hypothesis in the following interrelated specific aims:
Aim 1: To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction causes pathological ISR activation to preclude
normal lung allograft repair following lung transplant.
Aim 2: To test whether epithelial ATF4 is necessary and sufficient to preclude alveolar epithelial
differentiation and promote fibrosis during CLAD.
We propose a series of causal experiments in a murine model of lung transplantation to link mitochondrial
dysfunction, activation of the ISR, and failed epithelial differentiation to the development of CLAD. With Core B
and C, we pair our experiments with samples collected and analyzed from lung transplant patients with a goal of
credentialling mitochondrial function and the ISR as targets for therapy to prevent and treat CLAD."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Yale Cancer Center Administration encompasses the Office of Research Affairs, YCC Finance and Clinical Trials
Office, and Public Affairs and Communications, all of which work actively and collaboratively to support the
essential components of the CCSG in carrying out the YCC mission. Administration is responsible for 1) providing
efficient administration and management of essential CCSG functions; 2) facilitating and stimulating innovative
cancer research, training, and outreach activities; and 3) monitoring and evaluate Center finances and
administrative operations.
During the current project period, Administration made significant changes to improve workstreams. A core
facilities management system was implemented to manage and track Shared Resource usage requests,
equipment reservations, sample processing, billing, and invoicing. An improved database system to track
membership and publication data was adopted and a system was developed to track and monitor return on
investment for YCC’s internal grants program. All these changes allow for faster reporting of key Center metrics.
Administration plays a key role in planning and evaluation activities through the organization of advisory board
meetings and was instrumental in the development of the Strategic Plan. The 2023 -2028 Strategic Plan focuses
the Center’s efforts in five main areas including, 1) research, discovery and innovation; 2) reducing cancer burden
and disparities; 3) culture, equity and Inclusion; 4) training and career development; and 5) increasing access to
unsurpassed care. Administration is responsible for monitoring and tracking progress towards the Strategic Plan
and provides updates to leadership regularly.
An important goal of YCC is to promote high impact interdisciplinary cancer research. Administration contributes
to this goal by fostering collaborations through the organization of Research Program meetings, retreats and
administratively supporting the internal grants program. Over the current project period, cancer-relevant
research funding increased to $94.9M and NCI funding increased to $26.5M (+9.5%). YCC’s grant portfolio
includes three SPOREs, a UM1 and 10 U01 grants. The 305 YCC members published 2422 papers in the
current period, 30% of these were in high impact journals and 82% represent inter-institutional collaborations.
Administration’s efforts were key to supporting all these advances.
Future plans for Administration include re-evaluation of membership criteria, continue to work with Center
leadership to implement the Strategic Plan, support the newly launched Initiative to Address Disparities, and
foster high impact interdisciplinary cancer research by supporting the growing translational research
infrastructure."

next generation of diverse cancer immunology researchers and translationally-focused clinicians."
10913380,"Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) affects a significant number of VA patients, and has serious
consequences, including overdose and death. While medication is recognized as the most effective treatment
for OUD, it remains under-utilized within VA. This is particularly true for rural patients, who are 37% less likely
to receive a medication for OUD than Veterans residing in urban areas. Addressing the rural disparity in
access to medication has become increasingly important as rural areas have been disproportionately impacted
by the consequences of the opioid crisis, including opioid-related mortality.
Significance/Impact: Enhancing access to medication for OUD for all Veterans is a major priority within VA.
The research proposed will address a substantial disparity in health care access for rural Veterans, and has
the potential to positively impact thousands of rural Veterans with OUD who currently lack access to evidence-
based OUD treatment.
Innovation: The proposed research leverages the knowledge and experience of rural facilities that have been
successful in integrating buprenorphine into primary care to inform the design of an implementation strategy to
support rural, primary care buprenorphine treatment.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Characterize a) VA facilities’ rates of primary care buprenorphine prescribing over time and b)
differences in primary care-based buprenorphine prescribing for rural versus urban Veterans.
Aim 2) Among rural facilities with improved primary care based buprenorphine prescribing, qualitatively explore
implementation strategies utilized, facilitators to success, and methods to overcome implementation barriers.
Aim 3) Develop and pilot test an implementation strategy to facilitate the initiation and scale-up of
buprenorphine prescribing in rural CBOCs within one VA facility.
Methodology: This study utilizes a mixed methods sequential explanatory design, in which findings from each
Aim inform the design and conduct of subsequent Aims, which themselves contextualize and elaborate upon
initial findings. Aim 1 is a retrospective cohort study utilizing national VA data. Aim 2 utilizes qualitative
interviews with a sample of clinical administrators and direct care providers embedded within rural facilities that
have improved their rate of primary care-based buprenorphine prescribing over time. Aim 3 is a pilot trial of the
implementation strategy that will be evaluated via formative evaluation methods.
Next Steps/Implementation: The Aim 3 pilot will inform IIR #2 in year 5 of the CDA, which will be a multi-
center trial of the implementation strategy within rural CBOCs of VISN 20, comprising Alaska, Washington,
Oregon, and Idaho—states with a considerable number of rural primary care locations."
10921933,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), comprising 90% of esophageal cancer (EC) worldwide,
has a 5-year fatality rate of 90% in low- to moderate-income countries, or LMICs, primarily due to an
inability to diagnose the disease before it becomes fatal. Indeed, the value of low-cost, accurate, and
assessable diagnostics is central to the current Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) we are responding to,
which highlights EC as one of the four “highest-priority cancers” (NCI SBIR/STTR Program
Announcement Regarding Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Technologies for Low-
Resource Settings, NOT-CA-21-062). To address this pressing need, we developed an affordable,
accessible, safe, and accurate diagnostic strategy applying our novel ESCC-specific methylated DNA
biomarkers to esophageal cells retrieved using our noninvasive, swallowable sponge-capsule device. In
our Phase I studies (n = 94), we developed, optimized, and validated a multivariate biomarker panel,
which accurately diagnosed ESCC in sponge-capsule samples (sensitivity = 92.3%, specificity =
86.7%; AUC = 0.94). Building on this success, our Phase II project will perform a robust independent
validation of this assay and achieve commercialization in the USA while implementing assessments and
feedback toward early commercialization in Uganda, an LMIC. In Aim 1, we will transfer the EsoFind
assay from Johns Hopkins University to Capsulomics and perform extensive analytical validation,
simplifying workflow to improve throughput, efficiency, and accuracy while reducing cost and complexity.
In Aim 2, a cohort of 300 new patients from the US and Uganda will be studied to develop rigorous
models using advanced biostatistical methods, including earlier ESCC cases. We will first generate data
in a training set (n=200 patients), building new models based on our SBIR Phase I biomarker panel
(cg20655070, SLC35F1, TAC1, ZNF132, and ZNF542) but also including clinical features (e.g., age and
gender). We will then independently validate this new algorithm in a test set (n=100 patients) for
validation. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on establishing the commercialization of EsoFind in the USA,
including submission for FDA clearance of our sponge-based Cell Extraction Device (CED) and
preparation for its launch as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT). Additionally, we will garner user
feedback in Uganda, while developing a plan for transfer and marketing as a model for use in other
LMICs. Thus, this Phase II SBIR project will streamline, expand, validate, and achieve early
commercialization of this safe, affordable, accurate, noninvasive streamlined assay to diagnose ESCC
in the USA and Uganda. If successful, our strategy has the potential to be applied in larger, longer-term
asymptomatic at-risk population-based screening studies to improve ESCC detection and survival."
10922280,"Abstract/Summary
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disorder driven by inflammation, fibrosis, and microvascular disease
that effects 75,000 Americans and over 2.5M people word wide. The common histopathological features of SSc
are endothelial and fibroblast dysfunction resulting in excessive extra cellular matrix deposits that disrupts the
normal tissue architecture. Interstitial lung (ILD) disease is very common in SSc (SSc ILD) and is the main driver
of mortality with a 10-year survival of 60%. Nintedanib and Tocilizumab are FDA-approved treatments for SSc
ILD, however, their overall impact for prolonging life is limited and patients either succumb to the disease or
undergo lung transplantation. Therefore, new therapeutic interventions that slow down or reverse fibrosis are in
great need. Data from several reports have demonstrated significant activation of the master transcriptional
regulator STAT3 (pSTAT3-Y705) in SSc patient samples. Significant STAT3 activation was observed in skin SSc
compared to healthy subjects. In follow-up studies, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 or STAT3 knockdown
ameliorated skin fibrosis in experimental mouse models demonstrating its role as a key driver of SSc. Our group
has demonstrated significant STAT3 activation in SSc ILD patient tissues. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that targeting STAT3 will block profibrogenic pathways and reduce inflammation and ECM
accumulation in SSC ILD. Although TFs are attractive therapeutic targets, they are challenging to target with
small molecules due to lack of clear small molecule binding pockets; domains important for protein-protein
interactions; and large stretches of intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs). At Altay, we developed a platform
that enables identification of small molecule binding pockets within IDDs, allowing a novel approach for specific
targeting of STAT3 and development of potent STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3is). Using our platform, we identified
next generation inhibitors that reduced STAT3 DNA binding. Importantly, these STAT3i had minimal STAT1
inhibitory activity, low cytotoxicity and demonstrated potent inhibition of STAT3 targets and fibrosis genes. We
propose three aims to characterize the most promising lead to treat SSc ILD based on inhibiting STAT3. In Aim
1, we will measure cytotoxicity and STAT3 target gene inhibition in a panel of normal fibroblasts and SSc-ILD
fibroblasts isolated from patients through our collaboration with Dr. Paul Wolters at UCSF. In Aim 2, we will
determine the anti-fibrotic efficacy of STAT3is in SSC ILD patient tissues and determine target engagement by
measuring STAT3 target gene expression. In Aim 3 we will demonstrate in vivo efficacy of lead STAT3i using a
bleomycin-induced fibrosis model where we will determine the therapeutic and prophylactic effect of our lead
STAT3i. The proposed studies will establish the potential for targeting STAT3 in treating SSc ILD and guide new
therapeutic strategies in this setting. The successful completion of the proposed studies will define a lead STAT3i
candidate, after which, we will pursue a phase 2 SBIR grant that will include extensive pharmacological studies
to ultimately commercialize our STAT3 inhibitors to effectively treat patients who are suffering from SSc ILD."
10922019,"ABSTRACT: Smoking kills over 480,000 people in the US each year and results in suffering by millions due to
lung disease, heart disease, vascular disease and 13 types of cancer. Unfortunately, FDA approved smoking
cessation medications (varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement) result in a smoking abstinence rate
of only 16-24%. To address this significant need, Predictably Human is developing “NoMore,” positioned to be
the first FDA-approved prescription-only digitally controlled aerosolized nicotine replacement therapy. Unlike e-
cigarettes, NoMore delivers a nicotine aerosol with no Harmful or Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs).
Initially, NoMore aerosol approximates the pharmacokinetics of smoking to facilitate transition from cigarettes
to NoMore. After the smoker quits smoking, NoMore gradually tapers nicotine to help the patient overcome
nicotine dependence. Studies on nicotine aerosols suggest that NoMore will be highly effective, with roughly
two times the efficacy of existing FDA approved medications. Preliminary studies have de-risked this project
including a study by the PI showing that a nicotine aerosol approximating NoMore had significantly higher
biochemically-verified 8-week smoking abstinence and 6.7 fold greater smoking reduction compared to a
placebo control. This is a considerably larger effect than normally seen with medications. Predictably Human is
now submitting this STTR Fast-Track application to fund continued development of NoMore. Phase 1 (Year 1)
aims include: Prototype Completion, Prototype Proof-of-Concept Testing, Pre-IND Package Preparation and
Submission. Milestones that will be completed before transitioning to Phase 2 include a completed prototype
with integrated vibrating mesh aerosolizers, and firmware connected to existing app-based software. Protype
testing will show aerosol mass conversion of 20 mg per 2 second puff, droplet size range of < 2 to >10
microns, and no detectable HPHCs. Finally, the Pre-IND meeting will result in CDER agreeing with our
proposed study plan with only minor modifications. Phase 2 (Years 2 and 3) activities will include GLP
Toxicology Testing, IND Application Submission, and two human studies – a Feasibility Study on the Use of
NoMore Aerosol, Device and Software, and a Single-Arm Open-Label Clinical Trial of NoMore for Smoking
Cessation. Completion of this Fast-Track program will advance development of NoMore from our current stage
(prototype development) though IND approval and into human treatment trials. Institutional investors have
stated that entry of NoMore into human trials will result in funding support sufficient to complete Phase 3
efficacy trials and submission of an NDA. The urgency of this application is predicated on the many smokers
unable to quit using current medications and the high expected efficacy of this product."

 This application is to request a renewal of the BLR&D Research Career Scientist (RCS) award for Dr.
Catarina Hioe. Dr. Hioe is a Research Health Specialist (GS14 Step 6) at the James J. Peters VA Medical
Center (JJP VAMC), Bronx, NY, and a tenured Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai. She joined the VA in 1998 when she initiated her research laboratory with funding from the Merit Review
Entry Program at the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System–Manhattan. In 2015, she moved her lab to the
JJP VAMC. She received her first RCS award (10/1/12-9/30/17), plus a one-year Cost Extension through
9/30/18 in part for recovery from Superstorm Sandy (10/29/12). She successfully renewed the RCS award for
the period of 4/1/2019-3/31/2024. Despite the lab closure during the first wave of COVID-19 in New York City
(March-September 2020) and pandemic-related disruptions through the rest of 2020 until 2022, Dr. Hioe’s lab
continues to excel, as evidenced by an array of accomplishments in each of the key measures that are
highlighted in this application.
 Since 1998, Dr. Hioe has built a VA research program to study HIV immunology and pathogenesis. This
program is also supported by a robust non-VA research program. The Hioe lab is investigating the
immunogenic and pathogenic properties of the HIV envelope (Env), a heavily glycosylated protein that
interacts with the host to influence virus transmissibility and infectivity. In particular, Dr. Hioe’s studies have
focused on antibodies against the HIV Env which mediate not only conventional virus neutralizing activity but
also Fc-mediated effector functions and novel factors influencing the antiviral potency of these antibodies. After
the emergence of SARS-COV-2 and its rapid spread to cause the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Hioe promptly
applied her expertise and resources cultivated in the field of HIV to tackle the new coronavirus. Similar to HIV
Env, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is the target for antibodies that neutralize the virus and mediate
Fc-dependent activities for clearance of virus particles and virus-infected cells. The Spike glycoprotein is the
viral component of all COVID-19 vaccines currently used clinically in the US and other countries, and these
vaccines are designed mainly to elicit antibodies. Hence, during the current RCS period, Dr. Hioe’s lab
continues to focus on antibody research while expanding the scope to encompass both HIV and SARS-CoV-2.
 As outlined in her CV (Appendix 1), in the past 10 years Dr. Hioe has published 25 peer-reviewed research
papers, 2 review papers and 1 book chapter. She served as first or senior authors for 20 of these articles. Ten
publications were published during the current RCS award period to report research findings in the areas of
HIV and SARS-CoV-2. She has mentored >35 research trainees throughout her career at the VA; during this
RCS award, the trainees include 10 postdoc/junior faculty, 4 graduate, 3 undergraduate, and 1 high school
student. Dr. Hioe also taught medical and graduate students, and participated in numerous local and national
committees in and outside the VA. Her lab has received continuous support from VA or non-VA grants.
Currently, she has 5 active grants as PI that include an NIH R01 award (non-neutralizing antibodies against
HIV), an NIH R01 grant (HIV immune complex vaccines), an NIH R21 grant (HIV and bacteria interactions), a
VA Merit Review (HIV vaccine based on V1V2 of Env), and another VA Merit Review (Fc functions of SARS-
CoV-2 antibodies). She is also a co-investigator on an NIH R01 grant (HIV Env signal sequence)."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in adults over
the age of 65 and is expected to affect ~288 million people worldwide by the year 2040. Recently, induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived RPE generated from AMD patients and those with phenotypically similar
monogenic diseases have been shown to approximate elements of AMD disease phenotype in culture,
including the formation of sub-RPE deposits resembling drusen, dysregulated complement, and mitochondrial
dysfunction. Our groups and others have measured metabolite usage, glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and
lipid metabolism in a variety of iPSC RPE model systems. While in vitro RPE models show significant promise
in the discovery of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, there is also increasing awareness of
potential limitations, including reproducibility across model systems and fidelity to native conditions. A
comprehensive review of recent iPSC RPE studies shows that the most used traditional culture media are
highly diverse in nutrient and metabolite content which may significantly alter RPE metabolism. Moreover,
multiple types of plating substrates used could contribute to the variability in nutrient environments. A lack of
consensus on baseline nutrient environments and knowledge of their impact on RPE metabolism makes
comparisons between findings challenging. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the metabolic and
disease-relevant phenotypic profiles of AMD iPSC RPE cells in three distinct and commonly used traditional
media and physiological medium closely approximating the composition of human blood. Two AMD iPSC RPE
lines and their CRISPR-corrected isogenic controls will be used in this study. RPE will be differentiated from
one NIH/NYSCF AREDS2 subject iPSC line with multiple known high-risk alleles, selected to gender and
complotype-match RPE lines generated from an individual with early onset macular drusen (EOMD). A splicing
mutation in the CFH gene results in this severe subtype of AMD, and our preliminary data show that EOMD
iPSC RPE display AMD disease-relevant features, including complement dysregulation, sub-RPE deposit
formation, and altered metabolism. iPSC RPE will be cultured on twp substrates (Matrigel®, vitronectin), and
maintained in four media preparations (MEM-α based, DMEM/F-12 based, X-VIVO 10TM and PlasmaxTM). This
project aims to determine the impact of culture microenvironment on AMD and EOMD iPSC RPE metabolism
and disease phenotype. The outcome of this project will be a new and more comprehensive understanding of
how traditional and physiologic media influence the metabolic profile and phenotypic characteristics of normal
and diseased RPE cells. This new understanding will aid in the interpretation of metabolite studies across
model systems and help to inform the design of more physiologic cell culture media for future studies."

Current therapies for sickle cell disease largely fail to meet patient needs, particularly for the management of
acute pain crisis associated with this devastating disease. Healthcare systems are largely ill-equipped for
managing patients in the midst of these extremely painful and life-threatening events, leaving patients with
medical distrust and no effective treatment option. We are therefore developing IHP-100 for at-home self-
management of pain crisis, thus empowering patients and providing significant freedom from disease. IHP-100
is a novel P-selectin and complement inhibitor that is administered by subcutaneous injection at the onset of
early symptoms of pain crisis. This is a major paradigm shift in care that builds on our recent understanding of
sickle cell pathology and incorporates direct patient feedback to provide a truly effective treatment.
IHP-100 is a novel glycan-based therapeutic, designed to target the key underlying pathology of vaso-occlusive
crisis (VOC). VOC is multi-factorial and includes both cellular adhesion via selectins as well as complement
activation. Glycans are a prime drug class for such complex pathologies given their pleiotropic activities. We
have therefore engineered IHP-100 as a single agent that potently inhibits P-selectin as well as complement.
IHP-100 is therefore highly differentiated both in its biological activity and in its treatment paradigm at the earliest
symptom of pain crisis.
We have shown that IHP-100 inhibits P-selectin mediated cell binding to inflamed endothelium, inhibits
complement-mediated cell lysis, and reduces vaso-occlusions in the Townes sickle cell disease mouse model
of VOC. In the proposed work, we will optimize the dose level for in vivo efficacy, transfer manufacturing and
analytical testing to a GMP facility, and complete non-clinical IND enabling dose-range finding studies. We will
also further investigate mechanisms of IHP-100 in a P-selectin-deficient Townes sickle cell mouse model, and
establish an adhesion-based biomarker strategy for clinical development."
10910231,"ABSTRACT
Peri-implant (PI) diseases, mucositis and peri-implantitis, eventually affect ~25-50% of dental implants after
placement, resulting in soft tissue and bone destruction. Current treatments target dysbiosis of the oral
microbiome (mature plaque) on the implant surface as the primary etiological factor of PI diseases. Conventional
treatment options include mechanical and/or chemical debridement, laser treatment, ultrasonic scaling, and
implantoplasty. Despite improvements in biofilm removal, decontamination may inadvertently worsen PI disease
prognosis by damaging the implant surface, generating ions/particles that exacerbate the host inflammatory
immune response. Furthermore, these detoxification protocols do not address the chronic inflammatory
environment sustaining PI host tissue destruction. The lack of controlled immunomodulation at the PI diseased
site can hinder re-integration of host tissue with a previously biofilm-contaminated implant surface. Thus, the
ideal PI disease treatment should (i) eliminate infection, (ii) preserve Ti surface condition, and (iii) possess
immunomodulatory activity conducive towards healing at the tissue-implant interface. Previously, our research
group demonstrated the use of dicationic imidazolium-based ionic liquids (IonLs) with amino acid-based anionic
moieties as multifunctional coatings on dental implants. In particular, we showed that IonL functionalized with
phenylalanine (IonL-Phe) formed stable coatings on Ti, imparting host cell compatibility, antimicrobial activity,
anti-corrosive ability, and lubrication in vitro in addition to in vivo biocompatibility and oral osseointegration in a
rat model. During in vivo assessment, IonL-Phe-coated Ti implants also differentially upregulated inflammation
resolution and bone matrix marker genes versus non-coated implants. This observed immunomodulatory activity
motivated evaluation of IonL-Phe application as a multifunctional therapeutic agent for PI disease treatment. To
assess the potential of IonL-Phe in combination with detoxification regimens to promote implant re-integration,
the following aims are proposed. In Aim 1, a standard method for application of IonL-Phe will be determined
based on release kinetic studies and its effect on detoxified Ti surface properties. In Aim 2, an in vitro evaluation
of IonL-Phe application on plasma protein deposition and subsequent effect on mammalian cell growth under
bacterial challenge or multispecies bacterial adhesion on detoxified Ti will be performed. In Aim 3, the in vivo
impact of IonL-Phe application on protein layer formation, host tissue re-integration with Ti implant surface, and
oral microbiome composition will be assessed after induction of PI diseases in a rat model. The proposed study
will address the current clinical gap in treatment of PI diseases by elucidating the ability of IonL to (i) protect the
implant surface during the acute healing phase, (ii) mitigate regrowth of bacterial biofilm, and (iii) actively
modulate the immune response towards soft tissue healing and re-osseointegration. If successful, this project
will enable application of IonL-based treatment modality in combination with current detoxification methods to
target dysbiosis and immune balance during the onset of PI diseases."
10910235,"The revolutionary advances in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiretroviral therapy (ART) which could
reach and maintain viral suppression have gradually transitioned HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) to a manageable, chronic disease in the past 2 decades. However, it is still one of the leading public
threats in the world with approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV (PLWHA), 1.7 million new infections,
and 770,000 HIV-related deaths in 2018. As a comprehensive strategy for improving the clinical management of
HIV, the World Health Organization (WHO) specifically calls for improved accessibility of not only ART, but also
HIV testing to reach untested high-risk populations and to help PLWHA ascertain their viral load (VL) and
potential for transmission. In response, this project seeks to develop a diagnostic technology for rapid, affordable
and easy-to-use HIV VL detection that is amenable for self-testing and even in-home testing. Unlike conventional
diagnostic technologies that are impractical for self-testing due to requirements of sophisticated devices and
instruments, our platform employs magnetofluidic technology to replace bulk fluid transport with magnetic particle
manipulation, enabling the integration of sample processing and PCR without the need for complex fluidic
cartridges and supporting instrumentation. Miniaturization of instrumentation and assay facilitated by
magnetofluidics minimizes reagent consumption and the thermal mass, leading to >10-fold reduction in cost and
assay time. The integrated device facilitates HIV RNA detection from finger-stick blood in a facile “sample-to-
answer” manner, promising a rapid, inexpensive and user-friendly strategy for VL self-testing.
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise and strong track record and history
of collaboration in team science. In order to achieve the above goal, we propose (i) to develop a streamlined
assay protocol for sample processing and PCR detection of HIV in whole blood, (ii) to develop an inexpensive
magnetofluidic cartridge implementing the HIV detection assay as a simple blood-to-result test, (iii) to develop a
portable instrument to enable facile HIV self-testing, (iv) to develop a method for ambient cartridge storage, and
finally (v) to evaluate performance and patient acceptability of the HIV self-testing platform in both acute care
and resource-limited settings. The development of this HIV VL self-testing technology has the potential for
dramatically increasing the accessibility of detecting acute infections and monitoring viral suppression in PLWHA,
thus presenting a game changer in the global HIV prevention strategy."
10909815,"Military service in young adulthood is typically accompanied by a variety of combat exposures
that are known to increase the risk for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in
later life (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and body mass index). Although
the significant healthcare and societal costs of combat exposure are well documented, it is
possible that these primary young adulthood exposures additionally promote later life secondary
conditions that are only now being uncovered. Identification of factors that contribute to
advanced risk for diseases of aging in older Veterans provides the opportunity to test and
initiate treatments that may slow progression of these conditions. Additionally, these data could
be used to inform care for the younger, current generation of veterans, including the initiation of
lifestyle and medical changes that may ameliorate progression of conditions that promote later
life cognitive and behavioral conditions. It is possible that combat-exposure in young adulthood
initiates a trajectory of ‘unhealthy aging’ with progressive elevation in biological risk that
promotes aging-related neural ‘disconnection’ of structural and functional brain networks.
However, limited work to date has been performed linking young adulthood combat exposure to
alterations in neural structure and function in older Veterans. Additionally, whether combat-
exposure in young adulthood is related to the accumulation of late life biomarker hallmarks of
AD, known as the amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration (A-T-N) framework, is currently unknown.
Thus, intermediary mechanisms linking young adulthood combat exposure to late life risk must
be examined. In the large Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders
(TRACTS) cohort study, we find that younger Veterans with combat exposures and symptoms
additionally 1) have elevations in systemic biological risk; 2) show alterations in critical brain
network circuitry such as amygdala and default mode network (DMN); and 3) show accelerated
aging trends in structural connectivity and white matter microstructure. We aim to conceptually
link these findings in the proposed work. We propose that late life risk is conferred first through
elevation in systemic health conditions starting in young adulthood (i.e. ‘cumulative biological
risk’) that lead to damage to critical brain connections. Combined effects of cumulative biological
risk accelerate the deterioration of structural and functional brain networks that support higher
cognitive function, including memory systems and/or compensatory systems that provide
cognitive reserve in the face of AD pathology. We will test a model of combat-associated
amygdala network dysregulation promoting systemic health risk in young adulthood. This
cumulative biological risk in turn contributes to neural and cognitive deterioration that is
pronounced in older Veterans. This work will elucidate mechanisms that contribute to elevated
risk for cognitive impairment in combat exposed military Veterans and can be used to inform
treatments in older Veterans but also may inform preventative measures for young Veterans at
risk for later life neurological disorders."
10905790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Programmed cell death (self-induced) is intrinsic to cellular life, including unicellular species. However, cell
death research has focused primarily on animal models to understand cancer, degenerative disorders, and
developmental processes. In contrast, there is comparably little knowledge of how prokaryotic and eukaryotic
microbes die, and cell death mechanisms in human fungal pathogens (multi- or unicellular) are nearly
unstudied. Over a million fungal infections are diagnosed annually, many causing significant mortality, and
resistance to conventional therapies continues to increase. Building on the principles of cell death discovered
in the metazoan cell death field, we propose to characterize novel cell death pathways in unicellular fungal
species using the tractable Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system. Targeted genetic approaches, cell
biological and biochemical approaches will be used to dissect a vesicle trafficking cell death pathway in yeast
that results in lysosome/vacuole membrane permeabilization and cell death, with implications for the human
pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. This new mechanistic understanding is intended to provide fundamental
knowledge needed for the future development of new therapeutic strategies analogous to successes in
targeted cancer therapy by inducing intrinsic cell death mechanisms."

This application will provide urgently needed analytical methods to develop the field of imaging genetics.
SOLAR-Eclipse is an integrated suite of resources for genetic and epigenetic analyses such as heritability,
pleiotropy, high-resolution genome-wide association (GWA) and Whole-Genome Analyses (WGA), gene
expression, quantitative trait loci-linkage (QTL-L) and methylation analyses optimized for traits derived from
structural and functional neuroimaging data. Our focus is on phase 3 development to support full-resolution
voxel-and-vertex-wise analyses of imaging genetics networks involved in complex polygenic illnesses. During
the first two funding periods, we demonstrated the utility of SOLAR-Eclipse for imaging genetics applications
and developed strong “Pull/Push” collaboration with three major NIH brain imaging initiatives: the NIH Big Data
2 Knowledge (BD2K) Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA), Human
Connectome Project (HCP), MRI-GENIE, CHARGE and UK Bio Bank. During these funding periods, we
released over 20 software updates and this support was acknowledged in ~250 manuscripts. We focused the
next phase of SE development on the needs identified by our Big Data partners. The first aim is to revise our
software to support “Repeat, Rerun, Replicate (R3)” initiative, including Python based application programming
interface for straightforward integration of SOLAR-Eclipse into modern processing workflows. It will include a
new data format optimized for voxel-and-vertex wise imaging genetic analyses including GWA and WGA, as
well as recording the provenance of imaging genetics data analysis workflows. Aim 2 is focused on enabling
GWA and WGA at full voxel-vertex-and- genetic resolution. This will derive and perform causality testing and
annotation for the imaging-genetic networks while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and spatial
dependency patterns and correcting for multiple comparisons. We will perform causative inference testing for
the vertical and horizontal pleiotropies - the two main mechanisms that govern genetic risk factors for complex
polygenic illnesses such as schizophrenia. Aim 3, we will execute collaborative studies to tune novel methods
in large and diverse samples assembled by our Big Data partners: ENIGMA, HCP, SiGN, UKBB and others.
This collaborative piloting and honing of novel methods will serve to popularize and disseminate our
developments for individual imaging genetics labs."
10907034,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-surgical pain causes significant suffering to patients and an over-reliance on opioids for pain reduction.
However, opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and a risk of accidental death from overdose.
Unfortunately, effective non-opioid pain therapy remains lacking. We aim to determine if human cell and
tissue product (HCT/P), such as amniotic membrane and umbilical cord, can be developed for use as a novel
and safe treatment of post-surgical pain. In Aim 1, we will first prove the concept by demonstrating the
efficacy, receptor mechanisms, and safety of HCT/P for inhibiting post-surgical pain in murine models. Our
preliminary studies showed that intraoperative treatment with HCT/P reduced the development of
post-surgical pain in rats. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that HCT/P targets immune cells as an indirect mode
of anti-pain action. We hypothesize that HCT/P promotes regenerative wound healing by suppressing
immune cell recruitment and inducing anti-inflammatory effects. Our recent studies suggested that the heavy
chain-hyaluronic acid-pentraxin 3 complex (HC-HA/PTX3) is a biologically active component uniquely
present in HCT/P. We will further explore how HC-HA/PTX3 polarizes macrophages differentiated from
human THP-1 cells to an M2 phenotype and whether HC-HA/PTX3 inhibits the activation of human LAD2
mast cell and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In Aim 3, we will examine the targeting of primary
sensory neurons as the direct mode of anti-pain action by HCT/P and HC-HA/PTX3. We will test whether
HC-HA/PTX3 reduces intrinsic membrane excitability and inhibits membrane ion channels in dorsal root
ganglion neurons. Furthermore, we will investigate whether the neuronal inhibition by HC-HA/PTX3 involves
a novel mechanism that depends on CD44-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. To achieve these goals,
we will combine the expertise of preclinical and translational pain researchers from Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine and the GMP manufacturing of HCT/P at TissueTech, Inc. This study will provide
important rationales for developing HCT/P-based bioceuticals as a viable non-opioid treatment of
post-surgical pain. Such drugs will act not only directly, by dampening neuronal excitation, but also indirectly,
by changing the wound environment and orchestrating regenerative healing. Through the complementary
dual mode of action, we envision that birth HCT/P may lead to an optimal therapeutic effect with lasting pain
relief and a potential “cure” of post-surgical pain."
10907045,"Project Summary
This project is based on recent advances in metabolic glycoengineering (MGE), a technology platform where
non-natural monosaccharides intercept the biosynthetic pathways for cell surface-displayed glycans. As a
result, chemical functionalities not naturally found in carbohydrates are installed in the glycalyx, which can alter
cell adhesion, receptor activity, and downstream events (e.g., apoptosis, differentiation, and motility). In
previous work, we developed the N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) analog “Ac5ManNTGc” to install thiol
groups into sialic acids in human embryonic cells and found that – when the cells were grown on a “high affinity”
surface (e.g., gold, which forms coordinate covalent bonds with thiols) – Wnt signaling was upregulated in the
absence of extracellular Wnt proteins and neuronal differentiation was induced. In vivo translation of this
approach, however, was hindered by the requirement for a non-degradable gold scaffold. We recently
overcame this impediment by designing new ManNAc analogs with thiols presented on longer linkers, which
extends this functional group further away from the core monosccharide and increases analog potency.
Critically, the new analogs provide pro-neurogenic activity in the absence of a scaffold thereby simplifying in
vivo translation. This project will explore analog mechanism in hNSCs in Specific Aim 1; this aim will define
how the chemical structure, kinetics, and dose of thiol-modified ManNAc analogs (along with chemically inert
size-matched controls) modulate cellular glycans in Aim 1a; evaluate changes to cell adhesion and motility in
Aim 1b, and evaluate the differentiation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in Aim 1c. Next, in Specific Aim
2, we will apply the optimized analog-treatment conditions to improve neural regeneration in a rat cardiac
arrest (CA) model of brain injury by transplanting MGE-modified into injured animals. We will compare hNSCs
treated with our new thiol-modified analogs with appropriate controls on functional recovery after CA by
evaluating survival, adhesion, distribution, and migration of transplanted hNSCs in rat brain. In Specific Aim 3,
we will evaluate biochemical (Wnt signaling and cadherin involvement) and cellular (tissue infiltrating immune
cells) level mechanisms we propose contribute to the healing effects of MGE in brain injury recovery (in Aim
3a). Finally, in Aim 3b we will characterize cell-wide “glycosites” by mass spectrometry and use
glycobioinformatics analyses to identify unknown biochemical mediators of MGE. Specifically, we anticipate
identifying new mediators of the beneficial effects of MGE in the implanted hNSCs as well as trans-acting host
proteins. We hypothesize that thio-analogs modulate hNSC fate through a complex combination of receptor-
specific effects on cell signaling and adhesion providing a pleiotropic suite of healing effects that cannot be
achieved through conventional therapies. Accordingly, our innovative approach opens a new avenue to
improve stem cell therapy with our new thiol-based MGE technique."
10927244,"FACULTY DEVELOPMENT CORE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Recruitment and retention of a diverse biomedical faculty workforce is necessary for the National Institutes
of Health mission of discovery and innovation toward improving human health. However, the success of this
mission requires institutions to change their culture so that faculty who belong to historically disadvantaged and
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups do not face challenges such as marginalization, lack of appropriate
mentoring, lack of visibility and recognition of scholarly achievements, and tokenism. Our long-term goal is to
transform institutional culture at The University of New Mexico (UNM) to systemically achieve diversity of the
biomedical workforce and sustained inclusive excellence. Recent efforts led by the National Science
Foundation UNM ADVANCE program have begun to support cultural change towards inclusive excellence at
UNM. Yet, transformation requires hiring, promoting, and retaining diverse early career faculty, a recalcitrant
challenge among NIH-funded institutions across the U.S. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the
UNM FIRST program will successfully hire, promote, and retain a cohort of early career faculty who will
accelerate significant discoveries in the interdisciplinary fields of neuroscience and data science. The specific
aims of the UNM FIRST Faculty Development Core are: to establish a program that reduces isolation and
increases community building for the UNM FIRST faculty hires (AIM #1); to develop personalized faculty
career and research development plans for each of the UNM FIRST faculty hires (AIM #2); to develop a
retention toolkit for the UNM FIRST faculty cohort (AIM #3). The proposed mentoring plan, networking
activities, professional development resources and retention toolkit will be institutionalized thanks to the
Institutional Innovation Implementation Board (I3 Board), that includes key administrators and stakeholders at
UNM who have committed to UNM Institutional support of the UNM FIRST program. The significance of the
proposed work is that careful implementation of the Faculty Development Core activities will not only increase
the likelihood of the UNM FIRST cohort to secure extramural R01 or equivalent NIH funding and achieve
professional legitimacy in their fields but will also impact all future diverse faculty hires at UNM. Importantly,
supporting faculty development of a diverse workforce in a majority-minority state and Hispanic Serving
Institution will subsequently provide a pipeline for increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce by
offering diverse faculty representation as role models for female and historically underrepresented trainees.
UNM will be the home of diverse faculty who will attain professional legitimacy while building careers they love
in a welcoming scientific community where they belong, feel valued, and contribute to ongoing institutional
efforts to change the culture at UNM to promote inclusive excellence via systemic changes."

The Evaluation Core of the UNM FIRST program will use cutting edge theoretical, measurement, and statistical
approaches to conduct an innovative test of the effects of implementing a cohort model of faculty hiring,
sponsorship, ongoing mentoring and support, and faculty development. Our long-term goal is to transform
institutional culture at The University of New Mexico (UNM) to increase diversity and inclusive excellence. Our
central hypothesis is that increasing and supporting faculty diversity and inclusion in STEM fields requires
ongoing evaluation and self-reflection, and that evaluating implementation progress and challenges is critical to
changing institutional culture. The specific aims of the UNM FIRST Evaluation Core are: to coordinate with the
FIRST Coordination Evaluation Center (CEC) to evaluate the impact of the cohort cluster hiring model at
multiple levels of analysis (AIM 1); to build upon data collection established by the NSF funded UNM
ADVANCE Program, including characterizing faculty perceptions of the institutional climate and culture and the
inner and outer context of research support in STEM related fields (AIM 2); to apply promising practices
grounded in the science of team science to increase stakeholder engagement in the implementation and
evaluation of UNM FIRST at all levels across UNM (AIM 3); and to test the implementation and effectiveness
of UNM FIRST using a multilevel and multimethod analysis examining individual and institutional outcomes
over time in the years proceeding and following the hiring of faculty by the UNM FIRST program (AIM 4).
Specifically, we will use a mixed-methods longitudinal within- and between-subjects design to continuously
monitor, track, and evaluate FIRST program activities and the outcomes of the FIRST program in changing
institutional culture toward inclusive excellence and greater scientific discovery. Primary outcomes to be
evaluated, include common data elements identified by the FIRST CEC, as well as metrics that are important
to the UNM FIRST program, such as: (1) success among UNM FIRST Faculty hires in obtaining NIH R01-level
funding; (2) transformation of institutional culture and climate to support diverse faculty; (3) promotion and
tenure of UNM FIRST Faculty and other diverse faculty; and (4) retention of UNM FIRST Faculty and other
diverse faculty. The science of team science and implementation science strategies and methods will serve as
the guiding frameworks for evaluation of the UNM FIRST program. We will use implementation
science methods to maximize the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of
evidence-based practices by the UNM FIRST program in promoting inclusive excellence. The significance of
the proposed research is to determine the impact that faculty cohort hiring models can have on institutional
culture change and to increase the NIH biomedical workforce."

The proposed Faculty Initiative for Improved Recruitment, Retention and Experience (FIIRRE) seeks
to expand the diversity of our health sciences faculty and transform the culture, policies, and practices of the
University of South Carolina (UofSC) to promote inclusive excellence. The Administrative Core, led by MPIs
Angela Liese from the Arnold School of Public Health and Coretta Jenerette from the College of Nursing, will
ensure the full integration of all FIIRRE cores, drawing strong administrative, intellectual and fiscal support
from our institutional leadership, Internal and External Advisory Councils and other core personnel. Serving as
the nucleus of FIIRRE at UofSC, the Administrative Core will: 1) provide the organizational structure, senior
leadership, and infrastructure necessary to enable the success of all core goals, 2) oversee the administrative
and financial operations of FIIRRE, including recruitment and retention of a cohort of ten new tenure-track
Assistant Professors who are committed to inclusive excellence and conduct health disparities and
equity research, 3) advocate for FIIRRE and serve as a liaison to institutional leadership, funders and other
stakeholders, and 4) identify and redress ways in which current policies and practices foster racial bias
and other forms of discrimination at all levels of the institution, including tenure and promotion. Our leaders are
interwoven into key leadership positions and decision-making committees within the institution, enabling our
team to introduce and help advance key policy and practice change recommendations from the “ground up”. In
addition, FIIRRE builds off the substantial institutional investments made towards inclusive excellence
at UofSC in the past five years, including a Strategic Plan “A Path towards Excellence” that prioritizes diversity
and inclusivity at all levels: executive, faculty, staff and student. Working closely with the Office of the Provost
and Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at UofSC, as well as other FIRST awardees and the Coordination

processes and outreach efforts."
10927251,"SPECIFIC AIMS
African American/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian, and Alaska Native individuals make up 34% of the
population, however they are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. Underrepresented minorities (URM)
make up 15% of PhD graduates and representation further along the pipeline in academia shows further attrition
with URMs comprising only 9% of Assistant Professor and 4% of tenured faculty positions. Lastly, URM scientists
receive only 6% of NIH research grants which are a necessity for establishing and maintaining a successful
research career. The inability to maintain a diverse pool of faculty who conduct biomedical and health related
research has wide spread implications. Increasing representation within research institutions will allow academic
medicine to meet the needs of a diverse nation and address persistent health inequities and disparities, such as
those illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the critical gap of underrepresentation, institutional
strategies must establish equitable and inclusive recruitment and faculty development that directly address
existing barriers to this population.
The University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the University of Maryland Baltimore County
(UMBC) have longstanding individual and collaborative efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the
biomedical sciences, with programs supporting trainees from middle school to graduate and medical school
training. Collectively UMSOM & UMBC pipeline programs and partnerships stemming from these programs have
increased the recruitment of UR students and enhanced trainee diversity at all levels; however, recruitment and
retention of faculty from underrepresented groups signifies a key gap in this trajectory. Currently, at UMSOM
and UMBC URMs make up only 5.3% and 12% of total tenure track faculty, respectively.
URM in the biomedical sciences have expressed low representation leads to social and professional isolation.
Lack of critical mass of minority faculty, coordinated programs and resources to support retention and promotion,
and senior leader who serve as diversity champions have been identified as key barriers to the recruitment,
retention, and promotion of URM faculty. To address existing barriers to URM faculty retention and promotion
we will build off prior experience from UMBC’s nationally renowned Meyerhoff Scholars Program. The success
of students within the Meyerhoff Scholars Program has been attributed to addressing 4 critical factors: academic
and social integration, knowledge and skill development, support and motivation, and monitoring and advising.
The overall goal of the faculty development core is to transform our faculty development approach
through adaptation of the Meyerhoff model using coordinated programs and resources to: 1) support
the development, retention, and promotion of URM faculty, 2) create a network of senior leaders who
serve as diversity champions to sustain inclusion and equity and, 3) over the long term increase the
critical mass of URM faculty within the University of Maryland. Towards this goal, the specific aims of the
faculty development core are:
 • To ensure the University of Maryland (UM) FIRST faculty cohorts achieve academic & social
 Integration. We will utilize existing campus networks and events, combined with individual support for
 integration, to ensure UM FIRST faculty are included within the fabric of their academic department and
 institution. In addition, a pilot grant program will encourage academic integration through the formation
 of new collaborations between UM FIRST and UMSOM and UMBC investigators.
 • To use monitoring & advising of UM FIRST faculty cohort progress to support long term success.
 We will combine individual development plans, mentoring committees, and administrative support to
 provide continual monitoring and support for UM FIRST faculty career progression.
 • To ensure UM FIRST faculty develop skills & knowledge in scientific writing, grant writing, and
 scientific management, leadership, and teaching. UM FIRST faculty will participate in a pre-defined
 curriculum, the FIRST Curriculum, that will focus on developing the skills and knowledge essential for an
 independent research career, including the required milestones to achieve promotion and tenure.
 Informed by their IDP and mentoring committee, UM FIRST faculty will select the most appropriate
 training based on their current needs in each of the following focus areas: 1) scientific writing; 2) grant
 writing; and 3) scientific management, leadership, and teaching.
 • To provide support & motivation to the UM FIRST faculty cohort through peer-mentoring and
 individual coaching. UM FIRST faculty will participate in peer mentoring groups and receive individual
 coaching to receive support while pursuing their professional and research goals.
By adapting the Meyerhoff model for faculty development we will implement a scalable model to increase
coordinated programs and resources to support retention and promotion of URM and create a network of senior
leaders who serve as diversity champions. The success of the UM FIRST program is central to the mission of
both institutions and a key priority to establish a critical mass of diverse faculty while continuing to enhance
equity and inclusion, specifically in the recruitment, retention, and promotion of URM faculty on both campuses."
11166256,"The National NeuroHIV Tissue Consortium (NNTC), currently funded by NIMH, NINDS, NIDA, and NIA, was originally established in 1998 to collect, store, and distribute samples of central and peripheral nervous system tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and other organs such as heart, lung, liver, and kidney collected from HIV positive and negative patients, to support researchers around the world who wish to pursue sound research projects and further our knowledge of neuroHIV disorders. In addition to brain banking operations, the clinical sites follow and collect ante-mortem data from an active cohort of HIV positive patients including an extensive neurobehavioral battery including neuropsychological testing and psychiatric assessments, neuromedical evaluation, laboratory results, and fluid sample collection for toxicology and sample banking. The new site contract will include revisions to the existing data collection protocol adding new RDoC assessments, neuroimaging, biomarker testing, and updates to various neurobehavioral battery. Detailed pathological evaluations of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs are conducted post-mortem and samples are then banked according to strict established protocols to ensure uniformity across the four clinical sites. The DCC for the NNTC under the current contract is tasked with serving as the central data repository, monitoring site adherence to study protocols and SOPs and providing data management, biostatistical and bioinformatic support to enable the clinical sites to effectively catalogue and maintain specimens and clinical data while also facilitating the sharing of resources with the broader scientific community."
10935474,"Project 1: Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS): Linking Tumor Biology to Social - Abstract
 Black women suffer worse stage-specific mortality, in part due to higher relative frequency of late stage,
ER-negative, high grade, and high genomic risk tumors (such as Basal-like and Luminal B tumors), but
mortality differences are also persistent among those with ER+/HER2- disease. Early onset, severity, and poor
survival in Black women’s breast cancer occurs in context of higher risk of multiple conditions, including
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and most recently, deaths due to coronavirus. As such, breast cancer can be
understood as part of a racialized syndemic, a convergence of multiple overlapping chronic and infectious
disease epidemics related to structural racism in the United States. Measures of racial discrimination and racial
animus are strong predictors of mortality but have rarely been linked to breast cancer outcomes specifically.
Previous research has also linked ‘accelerated aging’, ‘premature age’ and ‘biological weathering’ to early
onset of multiple diseases of aging in Black women, but not to breast cancer. Thus, ‘race’ is recognized as
distinct from ancestry-related risk and should be understood in the social context of racism and must be linked
to breast cancer outcomes in that context. Toward this goal, we seek to elucidate the specific, multi-level
influence of racialized social determinants on tumor tissue and treatment patterns and resulting implications for
breast cancer progression and recurrence. Using data from the diverse study population of Carolina Breast
Cancer Study (50% black, 50% younger, 3000+ survivorship cohort), we have previously demonstrated
important tumor biological variation by race. We have found that Black women have higher proliferation scores,
higher risk of recurrence scores, more frequent p53 mutation status, and differential expression of DNA repair,
stromal, and immune response signatures. We have also found that Black women have higher prevalence of
treatment delay as well as different distributions of individual-level social and clinical factors such as quality of
life, education, income, and comorbidities. More recently, we have observed racial differences in CBCS
participant exposure to community-level factors (such as community advantage/disadvantage). Studying each
of these domains individually is important, but joint analysis is needed to identify the most effective health
equity interventions. Under a cells-to-society conceptual model of racialized breast cancer outcomes, we
hypothesize that poor breast cancer outcomes arise due to aggregation of inequities across multiple levels
(biological, individual, community, and structural). In context of race and racism, we propose to evaluate how
inequities in individual (e.g., obesity, comorbidities) and community-level (disadvantage, advantage) exposures
lead to biological (and especially immunologic and DNA repair) differences in tumors (Aim 1). We further
hypothesize that multilevel social determinants alter treatment response and breast cancer recurrence and
survival (Aim 2). Across both aims, our project will use innovative data integration tools to identify novel
intervention targets in precision medicine, extending previous studies of molecular determinants of disparities."

immune responses. Project 2 will investigate the role of DDIN as a determinant of response to RT plus anti-
PD1 combination therapy using preclinical TNBC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and
correlative biomarker analyses of pre/post-treatment primary tumor, metastatic lymph node, and blood
specimens from an ongoing clinical trial of preoperative anti-PD1 therapy, with or without RT, in early-stage
TNBC with lymph node metastasis. In Aim 1, we will develop a gene signature of necroptosis proficiency and
evaluate it as a predictive biomarker of RT/aPD1-induced spatial reprogramming of the tumor
microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will determine whether RT/aPD1 can elicit systemic neoantigen-directed T
and B cell responses, and whether neoantigen vaccination can overcome RT/aPD1 resistance induced by
necroptosis deficiency. Project 2 will be supported in bioinformatics and statistical analyses by Core B and in
spatial transcriptomics and clinical trial biospecimen analyses by Core C. The proposed studies will identify
predictive biomarkers to guide future clinical trials of RT plus anti-PD1 combination therapy in early-stage
TNBC—including testing strategies to reduce treatment toxicity by minimizing chemotherapy in patients
expected to respond to RT/aPD1—and establish contexts where neoantigen vaccination may help to overcome
radio-immunotherapy resistance."
10935476,"Project 3: Development of Novel Therapies and Biomarkers for TNBC Patients - Abstract
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC = Estrogen Receptor-negative, Progesterone Receptor-negative and
HER2-negative) is amongst the most clinically challenging to treat because of its poor prognosis and limited
treatment options. TNBC is a known heterogenous clinical group that shows significant variation based upon
histology, gene expression patterns, response to therapy, and even for patient survival outcomes. Despite this
heterogeneity there are key recurrent biological features of clinical importance including consistently high
proliferation rates, and a likelihood of having immune infiltrates. The typical association with immune cell
features led to the testing, and now approval, of drugs that target the immune system, thus highlighting the
importance of tumor cell to immune cell interactions in TNBC. We will build upon this foundation and our
genomic profiling data coming from human TNBC clinical trials and Genetically Engineered Mouse Models, to
develop and test here new combinatorial therapies for possible use in TNBC, and which will be guided by
biomarker-based patient selection. Specifically, we will evaluate combination regimens with an anti-PD1
backbone containing CD40LG agonist antibody to boost Bcell and/or Dendritic cell function, and combinations
containing drugs that inhibit macrophage function. Lastly, we have identified a unique metabolic vulnerability in
TNBC that is a high dependence upon pyrimidine biosynthesis. Here we will target pyrimidine biosynthesis
alone in mouse models and in human clinical trials, and we will perform combinatorial screens in vitro and in
vivo to identify optimal partner drugs that would synergize with pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors. In all cases,
single cell genomics using RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics imaging will be performed in order to inform
about biological responses and to develop and validate biomarkers for future patient selection."
10935606,"Core Summary
The mission of the Biostatistics Core is to work with Project leaders, CEP, and DRP awardees to ensure
statistical integrity in the design of their experiments and enhance rigor and reproducibility in the interpretation
of their data. The development of novel statistical methodology for cancer research and the access to low-cost,
fast computing have resulted in an expanded role for biostatisticians in the research process as well as a
higher standard in the definition of acceptable scientific evidence. In acknowledgement of these developments,
NIH has recently reiterated its long-standing commitment to rigor and reproducibility in its extramural research
endeavors. Important progress has been achieved in laboratory studies, including the experimental control of
both systematic and random variations as well as the integrative analysis of data sets with many variables
collected at multiple time points.
At the same time, methodological advances in the planning, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials have
emerged rapidly and have been translated into widely accepted requirements for high quality medical
investigations. Examples include sequential methods for clinical trials with time to event endpoints and
statistical models for repeated measurements, and the application of such methods to complex data require
highly rigorous scientific processes that can facilitate reproducibility of the analysis and inference. The
Biostatistics Core will support collaborations with all SPORE investigators and leadership in order to ensure
that the research studies will satisfy the prevailing and emerging scientific standards for statistical rigor. The
funding requested will allow the Biostatistics Core to collaborate and consult with SPORE investigators on
the design and analysis of their proposed studies using state of the art statistical and computational methods.
The members of the Biostatistics Core will perform study design, write, and execute statistical analysis plans,
perform data management and statistical programming, interpret the results of statistical analyses, write
technical reports, generate tables and figures, and contribute to abstracts, presentations, and peer-reviewed
publications. The Core members will collaborate with the other members of the SPORE study team, including
the Pathology Core, to achieve the aims of the SPORE Projects. Dr Wendy B. London (3.6 calendar months)
will serve as Director of the Biostatistics Core and will meet regularly with the SPORE leaders, Drs.
Batchelor, Haas-Kogan, and Suva, to update them on progress of the Core, and to identify and address unmet
needs."
10935404,"SUMMARY - OVERALL
Ovarian cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers in the United States and a major cause of cancer morbidity
and mortality. This Johns Hopkins-University of Pennsylvania Ovarian Cancer SPORE application focuses on
reducing ovarian cancer incidence and mortality by translating new laboratory-based discoveries into
improvements in ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment. This highly translational program contains three
hypothesis-driven Research Projects, three Core Resources, the Career Enhancement Program (CEP), and the
Developmental Research Program (DRP). The objective of Project 1 is to develop a novel brush-based
approach to sample fallopian tubes and ovaries for precursor lesions and to define the molecular attributes of
detected precursors for proper clinical management. The goal of Project 2 and Project 3 is to provide critical
preclinical and early clinical data for developing more effective combined therapy to treat advanced ovarian
cancer, especially for recurrent diseases. Specifically, Project 2 will evaluate cyclin E1 protein as a biomarker
of ovarian cancers responsive to a new WEE1 inhibitor. Resistance will be addressed with combination WEE1
and ATR inhibition and underlying mechanism of response and resistance will be defined by treatment-related
proteins identified at stressed replication forks. Project 3 will exploit a DNA repair vulnerability in ARID1A mutant
ovarian cancers. Specifically, the clinical efficacy of the combination of temozolomide and the PARP inhibitor,
senaparib, will be evaluated in a Phase II trial. All the three new projects originate from the current CEP/DPR
projects. These Projects are supported by an Administrative Core, a Biorepository/Pathology Core, and a
Computation/Biostatistics Core. Finally, the CEP and DRP comprise pipelines of human capital and innovative
ideas, respectively, which will fuel future SPORE advances. This application is strongly supported by institutional
commitment to ensure its success."
10923956,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite a steady rise in cure rates, cancer remains deadly for many children, especially those with relapsed or
refractory disease. Precision medicine holds great promise for these kids, but matching children to available
clinical trials remains a challenge due a lack of up-to-date information and highly complex eligibility criteria
based on clinical information and genomic and immunophenotype biomarker data. In collaboration with The
Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Pediatric Cancer Data Commons (PCDC) team has developed GEARBOx
(Genomic Eligibility Algorithm at Relapse for Better Outcomes), a clinical trial matching tool to allow clinicians
to quickly find potential matches for their patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML). We now endeavor to expand GEARBOx to include several more tumor types, including acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Additionally,
we will augment the often-manual abstraction of eligibility criteria from clinical trials with new automated
methods. The information available to clinicians about trials will be supplemented to include critical data for
how to quickly and efficiently enroll a child on a matched study. Finally, the PCDC team will partner with a
third-party flow cytometry lab (Hematologics) to create ways to automatically pull and incorporate structured
immunophenotype data directly into the GEARBOx tool. These enhancements will greatly enhance the process
of finding appropriate clinical trials for patients and then getting them enrolled, thus improving access to critical
precision therapy for these children."

The Virginia Advancing Cancer Control Equity Research Through Transformative Solutions (VA-ACCERT)
Center is an academic-public partnership between an interdisciplinary team of investigators from the Virginia
Commonwealth University, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and Virginia’s U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development-administered public housing communities. The goal and cross-cutting theme of the VA-
ACCERT Center is to improve dissemination and implementation of health promotion and cancer prevention
services within income-based communities and across the state-wide public housing system in an effort to close
the unjust gaps in cancer health outcomes among marginalized populations. The VA-ACCERT Center will utilize
two essential theoretical models: the Collective Efficacy Mechanism of Action Model to build social capital,
community empowerment, and collective efficacy and elements from the Social Cognitive Theory and Social
Ecological Model to inform multi-level behavioral change. Community members will engage with the VA-ACCERT
Center through these frameworks to aid in the cultural adaptation and delivery of evidence-based intervention
practices, and their participation may include serving on the Housing Collaborative Community Advisory Board,
as Co-Leads and participants in Center-supported research projects, and/or serving as peer-to-peer health
advisors. Led by a Multiple Principal Investigator triad with demonstrable experience in conducting both health
equity and community-engaged cancer control research, the VA-ACCERT Center includes four interdependent
components: a large, five-year, multi-level, interventional Social Drivers of Health Research (SDOH) Project
designed to improve healthy dietary patterns and reduce sedentary lifestyle through gains in low and moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity; a Community Responsive Research Projects initiative that will support the
design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of four research projects; a Research Methods,
Measures, and Data Management Core that will provide integral qualitative and quantitative research services
spanning the data management, study coordination, measure development, study or methods adaptation, ethical
considerations, and data sharing for all Center-supported research initiatives; and an Administrative Core
supporting essential internal and external communications and coordination, guided by several advisory entities.
In addition, VA-ACCERT leadership will be engaged in national Consortium-wide efforts involving four other
National Cancer Institute-funded ACCERT Centers and a Central Coordination Center. The VA-ACCERT Center
will also be a hub for growing a more diverse workforce of early-career investigators. These investigators will be
equipped with the skills and support to shape new directions in promoting health equity within income-based
housing communities focused on cancer prevention and control efforts. Ultimately, the VA-ACCERT Center will
disseminate and promote its findings and best practices for wide-scale adoption and sustainability across
income-based housing communities locally and throughout the country."
10925407,"The trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG, aka oncofaeto protein, 5T4) is restrictively expressed in adult retina
in rod bipolar cell and the wide-field GABAergic ON/OFF amacrine cell, TH2-AC. Knocking out the Tpbg
gene in mice does not alter scotopic or photopic ERG responses but photopic contrast sensitivity was
enhanced, indicating that TPBG in TH2-AC participates in retinal information processing through
unidentified mechanism. We have found that TH2-AC intrinsic excitability is enhanced in the absence of
TPBG. We hypothesize that TPBG regulates TH2-AC excitability and that TH2-AC regulates retinal circuits
responsible for contrast and/or motion encoding. Given that amacrine cell is the most diverse but lthe
east understood retinal neuron thus far, studying TPBG in TH2-AC provides a rare opportunity to
understand how wide-field amacrine cell works in the mammalian retina. We will use mouse genetics
and electrophysiological approaches to 1) Use the DATIRESCre driver mouse line to manipulate TH2-AC to
understand the molecular and cellular basis of the enhanced photopic contrast sensitivity phenotype of
the Tpbg knockout animals (Aim-1) and 2) Genetically and/or virally ablate TH2-AC from retina to study
how retinal contrast and motion encoding are affected at the behavioral level by OKR and at the cellular
level in TH2-AC’s eight postsynaptic RGC partners (Aim-2). Completion of these independent aims will
lead to a better understanding on how a wide-field amacrine cell works in a mammalian retina."
10921463,"Lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems, encompasses a diverse range of
clinical manifestations. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most prevalent form of lupus, presents with
considerable heterogeneity, posing substantial challenges in disease management for patients, providers, and
caregivers. Despite overall improvements in SLE outcomes, disparities persist across racial and ethnic
minorities and socially disadvantaged populations. For instance, Black and Hispanic individuals exhibit higher
SLE disease activity, poorer pregnancy and cardiovascular outcomes, reduced quality of life, and elevated
mortality rates. These disparities often stem from inadequate social determinants of health (SDoH), which also
contribute to SLE deterioration and suboptimal outcomes.
 Recognizing the critical role of addressing these unmet social needs in SLE management, we integrate real-
world data (RWD), artificial intelligence (AI), and natural language processing (NLP) to tackle data and methods
challenges and propose to develop a social risk management tool that aims to transform SLE clinical care by
integrating social care, facilitating a much-needed paradigm shift in US health care delivery. This SBIR project
is an interdisciplinary collaboration among Polygon Health Analytics LLC and the University of Florida.
 By leveraging RWD from the OneFlorida+ network and an exposome database capturing contextual SDoH,
we aim to (1) establish an individualized polysocial risk score (iPsRS), which assesses increased social risk
essential to SLE flares, and (2) employ causal AI models to estimate the causal effect of SDoH on SLE flares
to identify the effective targets for social interventions. (Aim 1) Moreover, collaborating with diverse
stakeholders, our team will prototype a digital health tool named iSMILE (Individualized Social Risk
Management In Systematic Lupus Erythematosus CarE) through a user-centered design (UCD) approach and
develop thoughtful qualitative studies to develop next-step implementation recommendations and
commercialization plans. (Aim 2)
 This project is highly feasible and potentially transformative for creating novel social care for SLE patients. It
will deliver a prototype of a social risk management tool tailored for individual SLE patients with input from various
stakeholders along with a set of prioritized strategies for implementation. We will also refine a step-by-step
commercialization plan to identify a viable business model, targeting various stakeholders (e.g., patients, payers,
and pharma companies), in order to further develop the ISMILE into a real commercial tool with a bigger scope
through a SBIR Phase II project."
10920501,"Project Abstract
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are globally prevalent neurobehavioral disorders where individuals consume
excessive alcohol despite its adverse effects on their lives. The global incidence of deaths related to AUDs was
estimated at 3 million in 2016, while in the US, 140,000 deaths annually are alcohol-related. While there are
FDA-approved treatments for AUDs, they require chronic treatment to remain effective. In contrast, psychedelics
offer a potential paradigm shift in addiction treatment because a single dose can cause long-lasting abstinence
from alcohol. However, natural psychedelics, such as ibogaine, have serious side effects that make them
unsuitable neurotherapeutics. Pyschoplastogens are non-hallucinogenic derivatives of psychedelics with
improved safety profiles that make them good candidates for new neurotherapeutics for AUDs. NemaLife, Inc.’s
Infinity Screening System 2.0 (ISS 2.0) is a high-throughput in vivo screening platform that uses the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans for drug discovery. ISS 2.0 records video data that is automatically processed by our AI
pipeline for metrics such as live/dead and animal activity. This Phase 1 project will combine the novelty of a
targeted psychoplastogen library and new machine learning-based behavioral screening. This foundational
capability will allow us to perform AI-assisted behavioral profiling of worm models of AUDs to screen for new
neurotherapeutics for alcohol addiction.
 AIM 1: Develop high-throughput AI-assisted behavioral profiling assays for alcohol use disorders
The ISS 2.0 platform offers the ability to conduct high-throughput drug screens using the nematode C. elegans.
In Aim 1, we will optimize assays for alcohol use disorder and test a series of well-established psychedelic
compounds to identify positive controls. We will examine two AUD paradigms and develop behavioral metrics.
Finally, we will correlate these metrics to create phenotypic profiles of animals exhibiting AUD behavior, which
will be used to train and implement additional machine learning algorithms into ISS 2.0 to allow it to distinguish
between addictive and non-addictive behavior in real-time.
 AIM 2. Identify potential AUD therapeutics from a targeted library of psychoplastogens
Psychoplastogens have better safety profiles than psychedelics and might make effective treatments for AUDs.
We can leverage our AI-enabled platform for screening psychoplastogens and establishing their therapeutic
value. Therefore, we propose to use the ISS 2.0 behavioral profiling capabilities developed in Aim 1 to screen
about 200 compounds for their potential as therapeutics for AUD. We will then characterize the potential
mechanisms of action of the hits through transcriptomic profiling, laying the groundwork for future studies using
rodent models of AUD in a Phase 2 application. Combining rapid identification of anti-addictive compounds with
high-throughput worm screens and validation in rodent models will significantly de-risk clinical trials of lead
candidates and accelerate the development of next-generation AUD treatments."
10920523,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At least 400,000 people in the United States are affected by Multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most prevalent
chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The current non-invasive MRI gold-standard
of MS characterization is through volumetric biomarkers, primarily characterizing lesion load (number and
volume of lesions), or brain volume atrophy (which is accelerated in MS brains). However, volume loss
associated with underlying neurodegeneration in MS over a 6-12 month period, while abnormal, may still be less
than the precision of the volumetric measurement, such that volume changes in individual MS patients may only
be confidently diagnosed over 18-24 months and based on multiple measurements. The volumetric
measurement also is most valid and precise only when obtained on the same MRI scanner each time, which is
often impractical in the current US healthcare environment.
Our approach is to derive quantitative MRI biomarkers from diffusion MRI (dMRI), which describe properties of
the microscopic environment and has been shown to outperform volumetrics. There has been a global effort to
reparametrize the WM dMRI signal, through the standard model (SMI) of white matter, as the summation of
tissue compartments typically over intra-axonal, extra-axonal and free-water compartments, enabling
disentangling inflammatory and degenerative processes.
Aim 1. Curate database of age- and sex-matched normative reference SMI parameters. In collaboration
with NYU’s Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Center (MSCC), we will retrospectively reprocess multi-shell dMRI
data in adult populations for normal (N=544) and MS (N=418) patients to define clinically relevant SMI ranges.
Aim 2. Develop a software platform to automate biomarker analysis. Using data from Aim 1, an FDA-
compliant backend software pipeline performing image processing, statistical comparisons and end-user
reporting will be developed in Python and containerized for cross-platform generalization. The end-product is the
ms-MICSI report to aid clinicians in prognostic decision making and inform pharmaceutical drug trials.
Aim 3. Verification and Validation of the ms-MICSI report will be performed on (A) 15 healthy volunteers, (B)
40 MS patients, 15 of which will return for a follow-up in 9 months to be imaged, and (C) scan-rescan (N=20
age/sex matched healthy volunteers) to evaluate bias and precision of SMI parameters. Cross sectional and
longitudinal changes observed by ms-MICSI will be compared against commercially available volumetrics."
10921095,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally and detection, continuous monitoring and effective
treatment are critical for improving patient outcomes. Currently, cancer diagnosis and genomic analysis for
personalized treatment often require invasive procedures such as biopsies, which can be costly,
time-consuming, and carry risks to the patient. An alternative, less invasive method for detecting cancer is the
detection of tumor-derived circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in biological fluids such as blood. This method has
shown promise as to detect cancer as it reflects the genetic changes, such as mutations present in the tumor
tissue. In addition to primary cancer diagnosis, highly sensitive disease monitoring is crucial in the minimal
residual disease (MRD) setting, which refers to the low-level presence of cancer cells in the body after surgery
and treatment and can predict cancer recurrence and overall survival and is therefore of great interest to
clinicians as a biomarker. Saliva is a biological fluid that has been explored as a source of cfDNA and blood
cells but has not yet been utilized as a basis for assay development due to a lack of characterization of cfDNA
levels and validation of consistent tumor DNA presence. As the efficiency of monitoring residual disease and
cancer detection relies on frequent, repetitive sampling of cfDNA from the patient, saliva represents an
attractive modality as it is an easy-to-obtain sample type, including in an at-home setting. In this proposal, we
aim to develop and evaluate an assay to detect and monitor the level of cfDNA from tumor in saliva and
compare the sensitivity of detection to cfDNA obtained from plasma/blood for patients with head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where we recently described the evolutionary trajectories and early vs.
late genomic driver event emergence, in both HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC. Despite its high prevalence as the
sixth most frequent cancer worldwide, most HNSCC patients continue to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer,
underscoring the need for sensitive early detection as well as disease monitoring for treatment response. To
achieve the necessary degree of sensitivity for what is often a low tumor DNA fraction in saliva, we will use
duplex sequencing to minimize sequencing errors, develop algorithms and machine learning models for
genomic analysis of cfDNA, and increase sensitivity by integrating signal with DNA methylation data. As a
result of this Phase I proposal, we will investigate the use of cfDNA from saliva samples, compare it with
plasma cfDNA testing, develop the experimental and computational methodology for saliva cancer genomic
tests, quantify the cost-effectiveness of this approach, and aim to develop a reliable, non-invasive method for
detecting and monitoring cancer."
10921425,"Project summary/abstract
This proposal seeks the development of a novel therapeutic for acute pancreatitis, which is a major unmet
medical need with no effective treatment in both human and veterinary medicine. Our approach builds upon a
body of clinical and preclinical data that strongly implicate lipolysis and lipotoxicity as major driving factors in
converting mild acute pancreatitis to severe, which is defined by sustained organ failure. In addition, this work
is supported by data demonstrating that inhibition of lipase activity is able to abrogate the organ failure and
indicators of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) found in clinically relevant animal models of
severe acute pancreatitis. Our status as a company is that we have a lead compound that has been validated
in IND-enabling safety studies in dogs and rats, and multiple preclinical efficacy models with outstanding
efficacy, as expounded below. We further have in place an expert team in the fields of clinical and translational
research, pancreatitis research and treatment, entrepreneurship, business development, pharmaceutical
partnering, and clinical trials. We are here proposing a companion animal trial to study the clinical response to
RABI-767 using different dosing schedules, with two primary goals, 1) to establish the efficacy of RABI-767 in
the treatment of spontaneous canine acute pancreatitis (CAP), and 2) to inform and optimize the treatment
regimen for a phase 2 human clinical trial. This is expected to have a major impact on acute pancreatitis
outcomes within a One Health framework, as recently advanced by the NIH and others. One Health
encourages a holistic approach to human, animal, and environmental health. In light of our strong feasibility
data, we are submitting this as a Phase IIb proposal, which will allow us to complete the key missing step in
our commercial development plan, which is to optimize the dosing schedule for clinical use in both humans and
canines. The objectives of this proposal are the completion of the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Initiate a canine companion clinical trial to evaluate RABI-767 as a novel therapeutic for canine acute
pancreatitis. Year 1 milestones: 1) drug product manufacturing suitable to initiate the companion animal trial, 2)
initiation of enrollment in the companion animal trial.
Aim 2: Establish the therapeutic efficacy of RABI-767 delivered to canines presenting with CAP using multiple
dosing schedules. The Milestones of this aim include the significant improvement of clinical signs of CAP, and
significant reduction of CRP within 3 days following administration of RABI-767 relative to the placebo control.
At the completion of this proposal, we will have an IND-ready asset, with a committed, experienced, and
successful clinical development team ready to take it through clinical trials."
10921694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the proposed Direct to Phase II SBIR project is to commercialize Continuous
Countercurrent Tangential Chromatography (CCTC) for recombinant AAV purification. This
novel platform will enable column-free, continuous, and single-use purification of rAAVs.
Successful commercialization of the CCTC system in this field will lead to at least a 50% reduction
in downstream production costs, increased recoveries (by 40%) and improved product quality for
these life saving therapies that provide effective treatments and cures for such conditions as
cancer, hemophilia and many others.
Continuous and flexible single-use processing for biologics has been established as a significant
unmet need. Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research,
stated in a 2011 AAPS meeting: “It is predicted that manufacturing will change in the next 25
years as current manufacturing practices are abandoned in favor of cleaner, flexible, more
efficient continuous manufacturing.” Significant bottlenecks in downstream processing as well
as the explosive growth in the number of gene therapies and specifically rAAVs in development
are the primary drivers of this unmet need.
Our aim is to commercialize CCTC for the purification of rAAV to significantly improve
recovery, product quality, and process productivity when compared with status-quo column
chromatography. CCTC provides a steady state purification platform with >10x reduction in
cycle time and greater productivity compared to current column-based purification. Preliminary
data obtained with a commercial rAAV product show at least a 5-15x increase in productivity
and 15-20% improvement in recovery for a capture operation. In addition, because the
CCTC platform runs at low pressure, small particle size resins may be used to significantly
increase binding capacity and resolution. This feature could enable finely tuned and gradient-
free operation for the separation of empty vs. full capsids. The promise of this system was
recognized by 2 market leading rAAV companies – Batavia and Spark – both of which will
support this work by providing hundreds of liters of material, access to their facilities and
analytical support. Additional collaborations with MIT and BTEC will assist with process
modeling, integration and scale up evaluations.
The proposed work will enable:
1) Development of a comprehensive process development toolkit for benchtop
 experimental design, modeling and analytics required to execute CCTC capture and
 polishing operations for rAAV purification
2) Generation of pilot scale process CCTC data with at least 3 rAAV serotypes including
 at least 2 AAVs from commercial partners Spark and Batavia
3) Integration of CCTC capture and polishing operations for at least 2 rAAV at pilot scale
4) Demonstrated scale up operations in cGMP environment at 50 – 200 L scale
5) Economic modeling via Biosolve platform to enable objective comparison to status-quo
 platforms and other modalities.
We are thrilled to be at the forefront of innovation in such an important industry with a solution
that can truly transform clinical and commercial manufacturing of life-saving gene therapies."

The purpose of the Imaging Tumor Heterogeneity & Metabolism Core is to provide to all Projects of the P01 with
the high degree of research and clinical imaging support required, apply advanced imaging methods and novel
data analysis procedures to facilitate the collection of image-guided tissue samples during surgical resection,
and providing metabolic and physiologic imaging correlates of gene expression that describe intra- and inter-
tumor heterogeneity in patients with glioblastoma and meningioma. Core functions will include the development
of new methods and the translation and maintenance of technologies developed in the Projects from the prior
and upcoming cycles into the clinic. The Core will comprise experienced investigators with broad expertise and
a proven track record in working together, as well as with their collaborators.
There are four major aims: (1) To translate the advanced MR data acquisition protocols and pulse sequences
developed in the current and prior cycles of the P01 from research to clinical scanners and to provide ongoing
maintenance for them in order to accommodate changes in clinical practice, as well as updates to the scanner
hardware or software. (2) To develop and maintain post-processing capabilities for analysis, visualization and
interpretation of the multi-parametric and multi-dimensional imaging examinations used in Projects 1, 2 and 4
with a special emphasis on providing consistent and reliable metrics to describe tumor heterogeneity, evolution,
and spatial extent. (3) To support the acquisition and analysis of pre-surgery imaging data, the selection of
targets of interest and the collection of image guided tissue samples from patients with GBM and meningioma
so that tumor heterogeneity can be studied in the context of imaging, histological, and genomic properties as
required in Projects 1 and 2, and validation of abnormal metabolism (Project 4). (4) To incorporate novel
hyperpolarized dynamic [1-13C] pyruvate (and later [1-13C] alanine) imaging acquisition, processing, and
quantitative analysis pipelines developed in Project 4 that will facilitate the integration of metrics of dynamic
metabolism into guiding the prospective collection of metabolically diverse tissue samples for analyses of intra-
and inter- tumor heterogeneity described in Projects 1 and 2.
Upon completion of the proposed P01 cycle, the developments proposed in this Core will provide the required
tools to acquire, analyze, visualize, and interpret relationships between advanced metabolic and physiologic
imaging features and underlying tumor biology of spatially mapped tissue samples. The methods developed will
create the required framework to support spatial analyses relating imaging phenotypes to underlying genomic
drivers of intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity and corresponding histopathology."

PROGRAM CODE: CSN
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer Signaling Networks (CSN) is a transdisciplinary research program that leverages advances in knowledge
of signaling networks to develop groundbreaking therapies that address clinical needs. The Program includes
world-class investigators who study fundamental aspects of signaling and metabolic networks relevant to cancer
and who develop novel technologies to study signaling that can be harnessed for basic and translational cancer
research. CSN clinical investigators provide expertise with signaling targeting agents in the clinic and bring
patient-driven perspectives to the program. CSN initiates and facilitates research activities and collaborations
across three overarching programmatic synergistic themes: cancer metabolism, metastasis and drug
resistance. These areas of strategic focus leverage program member’s expertise to overcome challenges in
treating YCC priority cancers for our catchment area, including lung, breast, prostate and liver cancer
that have higher (or rising) incidence in CT, and/or disproportionately affect specific populations. CSN research
priorities also address disparities-associated risk factors and co-morbidities in our catchment area. These
align with YCC priorities including cancers tied to metabolism (obesity and fatty/fibrotic liver syndrome-
associated cancers) and tobacco use (smoking-related malignancies). CSN Aims are to: 1) Elucidate intra-
cellular signaling and metabolic networks that contribute to cancer; 2) Understand how cells communicate with
one another and with the microenvironment during malignant progression; and 3) Exploit this knowledge to
identify new therapeutic targets, improve impact of existing agents, and overcome treatment resistance. In
pursuit of our Aims, CSN investigators pioneer cutting edge spatial profiling technologies, sensitive biomarker
assays, and novel model systems. With our efforts to assemble unique biorepositories of patient specimens, we
are well positioned to enable further high-impact discoveries. CSN has 51 members from 16 different Yale
departments. Funding is robust, with total cancer-focused funding of $12.9M (direct costs) including $9.8M in
peer-reviewed funding, $4.0M from the NCI. Program members published 399 papers during this award period
of which 44% are high impact and include both inter-programmatic (37%) and intra-programmatic (14%)
collaborations. We are focused on expanding intra-programmatic collaborations in strategic areas, an effort
which has recently yielded multi-PI grants – with others being submitted. CSN members also lead training and
mentorship initiatives for the next generations of cancer researchers. Finally, since the last cycle, CSN members
play key roles in the Yale SPOREs and provide leadership on clinical trials. CSN members are also involved in
vigorous inter-programmatic collaborations – most notably with Developmental Therapeutics (DT) – to promote
efficient and effective translation of CSN science. With its translational and clinical expertise, CSN has
successfully moved discoveries to the clinic during the last funding cycle and incorporated research relevant to
clinical observations into its portfolio, a strength it will continue to exert in the next project period."

The Yale Cancer Center (YCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is the internal, independent
peer review and monitoring system for all cancer-focused clinical studies involving human subjects conducted
across all sites at Yale University. The PRMS provides scientific review, prioritization, and ongoing scientific
progress review and accrual monitoring, for alignment with the Center’s mission and goals within the catchment
area and beyond. This is accomplished through an integrated two-stage process with Stage I conducted through
14 Clinical Research Teams (CRTs), where initial evaluation of scientific value, fit with the patient population,
overlap with current studies, and prioritization within the current disease or modality portfolio is conducted along
with operational feasibility and reasonableness of achieving accrual targets. Stage II is the role of the Protocol
Review Committee (PRC), which provides the definitive determination of whether a protocol is approved,
requires a response, or disapproved. The PRC membership is composed of highly qualified individuals across
all disciplines required for effective review. The PRC is functionally subdivided into two committee panels which
each meet biweekly. PRC leadership ensures consistency and quality across individual members and committee
panels. The PRC has the final authority for approving cancer-related protocols and closing studies that are either
not achieving their accrual goals or no longer meet scientific merit standards. It is the PRC’s responsibility to
ensure that cancer-related studies are scientifically sound; well designed, including from a biostatistical
perspective and inclusion of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespan; appropriately prioritized;
relevant to the mission of the YCC and its catchment area; assessed for risk and appropriateness of the data
and safety monitoring plan; and monitored at appropriate intervals for accrual and scientific progress.
Significant improvements during the project period include: 1) Implementation of a Study Prioritization Rubric to
further standardize and add rigor to the first stage CRT review; 2) Implementation of a REDCap tracking system
to improve recording and reporting of CRT review and determinations; 3) Expansion of PRC membership to form
a second committee panel to improve time from submission to initial review; and 4) Streamlining of amendment
reviews by PRC and IRB.
In FY23, CRTs assessed over 400 studies, disapproved 65% and approved 35% to move to PRC. Of the 134
submitted to PRC in FY23, 26 received expedited review since they previously received appropriate peer review
(e.g., NCTN), 100 studies received full PRC review and 8 administrative PRC review. In total, 118 (88%) were
approved, 15 required a written response before approval, and one was disapproved. During this same period,
PRC conducted on-going scientific and accrual reviews for 346 actively accruing interventional studies; of which
338 were approved to continue, seven were closed due to low accrual and one was closed as it no longer met
requirements for scientific merit."
10934206,"Project 1 Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to improve chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for
patients with T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) via the use of ‘off-the-shelf’ universal
allogeneic CAR-T (UCART) cells. T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) are a
promising cancer immunotherapy. However, T cell malignancies pose a challenge to CAR-T cell therapy due to
the shared expression of target antigens between normal and malignant T cells. CD7 is highly expressed in T-
ALL and the majority of normal peripheral T cells and NK cells. To overcome this shared antigen expression
problem, our group has developed CAR-T cells targeting CD7 that are genetically edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to
lack both CD7 and the T cell receptor alpha chain (TRAC) in order to avoid fratricide and permit the use of
allogeneic T cells for treatment of T-ALL. In our preclinical studies, these universal allogeneic CAR-T targeting
CD7 (UCART7) prevented fratricide and efficiently killed human T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived primary T-
ALL in vitro and in vivo without causing xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We hypothesize that
the administration of allogeneic UCART7 cells to patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) T-ALL will be
safe, tolerable, and provide anti-tumor activity resulting in improved clinical outcomes. We plan to test
this hypothesis in Aim 1 by conducting a phase 1 trial titled “A Phase 1/2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of
Anti-CD7 Allogeneic CAR-T cells (WU-CART-007) in Patients with r/r T-ALL/LBL”. Correlative studies will
characterize the phenotype and function of UCART7 and their effects on (1) serum cytokines, (2) endogenous
CD7-expressing cells, (3) other cell subsets lacking CD7 and (4) T-ALL using cytokine bead arrays, flow
cytometry, CITE-seq, and single cell cytokine analyses. Three obstacles to effective CAR-T cell therapy,
including potentially UCART7, are (1) cytokine release syndrome (CRS), (2) suboptimal CAR-T cell cytotoxicity
and persistence and (3) relapse due to antigen escape via downregulation or mutation of the CAR-T target
antigen. IL-7 and IL-15 are the main regulators of peripheral homeostatic expansion of CD4 and CD8 T cells.
NT-I7 and N-803 are long-acting derivatives of IL-7 and IL-15, respectively, that are safe and well tolerated in
mice and man. Furthermore, duvelisib, a dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta/gamma (PI3Kdg) inhibitor, may
provide effective prophylaxis against CRS while enhancing the persistence and efficacy of CAR-T cells. We
hypothesize that NT-I7 or N-803 in combination with duvelisib can promote UCART proliferation,
persistence, and T-ALL killing in mice resulting in long-term tumor-free survival in the absence of CRS.
We plan to test this hypothesis in Aim 2 using xenogeneic and immunocompetent mouse models of T-ALL.
Finally, multi-antigen-targeted CAR-T cells are a promising direction to overcome single antigen relapse issues
following CAR-T cell therapy. As part of Aim 2, we will evaluate if “dual-targeting” of CD7 and CD2 in T-ALL can
mitigate the risk of antigen escape and relapse."
10935307,"Resource Core: Abstract
Nearly all neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive accumulations of pathological
deposits of disease protein aggregates within cells, blood vessels or in the neuropil. These deposits are the
signature CNS lesions that define these disorders as exemplified by specific alpha-synuclein aggregates which
are required for the postmortem diagnosis of Lewy body disease. However, Alzheimer’s disease
neuropathologic change consisting of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in addition to TDP-43
proteinopathy also contribute to cognitive dysfunction in the setting of Lewy body disease. A major focus of
this Resource Core is to provide resources to investigators and collaborators in support of scientific studies to
better understand the mechanisms that cause dementia in Lewy body disorders. A comprehensive post-
mortem brain examination of individuals followed longitudinally in the Clinical Core provides definitive
classification of the underlying neuropathology using standardized criteria in addition to the exhaustive
documentation of co-morbid neurodegenerative disease pathologies in each case irrespective of clinical
phenotype. Fixed and frozen tissues, DNA, biofluids and alpha-synuclein proteopathic seeds are banked and
distributed to investigators in all four projects to further both clinicopathologic and basic research studies.
Thus, this Resource Core is a vital component of this Program Project Grant by grounding mechanistic
research projects to the human disease by use of human and recombinant resources in support of the overall
goal of better understaning how genetic, biochemical and pathologic alpha-synuclein diversity drives cognitive
dysfunction and dementia."

10935309,"PROJECT I: ABSTRACT
The overall objective of this project is to develop predictive models of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) propagation in the
human brain in Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients to define biologically meaningful subgroups of LBD and
guide the development of prognostic biomarkers to track the propagation of aSyn. There are shared clinical and
biological underpinnings within the spectrum of Parkinson’s disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD), and
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), collectively referred to as LBD due to the shared pathological substrate of
underlying alpha-synuclein aSyn inclusions in the central nervous system. Our previous histopathological and
autopsy-confirmed biomarker work finds that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) tau co-pathology associates with more
rapid decline and specific features of language and memory dysfunction in LBD. Thus, biological classification
of LBD based on the presence or absence of AD tau co-pathology (i.e. LBD+AD vs LBD-AD) is more clinically
informative than classic LBD phenotypes (i.e. PDD vs DLB) alone. While aSyn pathology propagation within the
nervous system is an important driver of neurodegeneration, there is limited data on specific cellular
vulnerabilities to aSyn in the human brain and how these relate to heterogenous cognitive symptoms of dementia
in LBD. Network science is a powerful approach to study relationships between the complex hierarchical
structure of the human brain and cognitive symptoms, but thus far, has largely been limited to study of in vivo
imaging of relatively small groups of PD or DLB patients without autopsy or biomarker confirmation needed to
account for AD co-pathology and to study cellular aSyn pathologic contributions to network breakdown on the
macroscopic level. Here, we propose two specific aims to uniquely apply network science to our large autopsy
cohort using graph theoretical analyses to analyze gold-standard digital histopathology metrics postmortem and
integrate these cellular models on the microscopic and mesoscopic levels with antemortem autopsy/biomarker-
confirmed in vivo MRI data to comprehensively examine the cellular substrates of neurocognitive degeneration
and cognitive impairment in LBD. This project integrates seamlessly into the overall aims and objectives of this
program project grant by providing critical human clinical and pathological data to guide future imaging
biomarkers sensitive to tracking aSyn and tau propagation and identify neuronal populations selectively
vulnerable to aSyn and tau. Moreover, this project informs the mechanistic work in Projects II-IV, while insights
gained from Projects II-IV enhance the study of human brain tissue and in vivo MRI and clinical data here."
10935311,"PROJECT III SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heterogeneity of Outcomes in Synucleinopathies: Insights from Genomics and Proteomics
While patients with Lewy body disorders (LBD) share the core feature of deposition of misfolded alpha-synuclein
(aSyn) into neuropathological inclusions, they exhibit pronounced heterogeneity in both initial clinical
phenomenology, as well as in trajectory of cognitive outcomes. The reasons for these differences in
phenomenology among synucleinopathy patients are not well understood, but these differences matter greatly
for quality of life for patients and their families, as well as costs to the healthcare system. The central tenet of
this Project is that host characteristics play an important role in determining which LBD patients manifest with
cognitive impairment at disease onset vs. years into disease vs. decades into disease vs. not at all. The goal of
Project III is to investigate the host characteristics represented by common genetic risk variants (associated
with risk for DLB, PD, and cognitive impairment in the LBD), as well as those host characteristics represented in
protein biomarker signatures, in order to uncover mechanisms that drive cognitive decline in the LBD. We will
do this through three specific aims.
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Assign target genes to loci associated with risk for LBD as well as cognitive decline
within PD. More than 90 loci have been reported to associate with PD risk or DLB risk by GWAS, with additional
loci reported to associate with cognitive decline within PD. The vast majority of these loci are non-coding, and
target genes are unclear. We will assign target genes based on colocalization analyses, comparing our work
with existing reports and confirming expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effects in PD brain tissue with
allele-specific expression (ASE) assays.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Perform causal inference analyses for biomarkers associating with cognitive outcome
in PD. We will perform CSF biomarker screens and investigate biomarker leads emerging from these CSF
screens as well as our previously-performed plasma biomarker screens of thousands of proteins in multiple
cohorts of PD patients. We will evaluate these leads for a causal role in cognitive decline by performing
Mendelian randomization-based causal inference analyses.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine effects of nominated targets on development of aSyn pathology in cortical
iPSC-N. Preliminary data suggest that Aims 1 and 2 will generate 20-40 potential targets for downstream
manipulation in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (iPSC-N). We will prioritize these leads based on
the strength of both the genomic and proteomic evidence in order to select 5-15 targets. We will use CRISPR-
based techniques to manipulate expression of the selected targets in cortical iPSC-N, in order to determine
effects on uptake of fibrillar aSyn, cell-to-cell transmission of aSyn species, and development of aSyn pathology."
10911716,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nearly two thirds of the 18 million new cancer patients each year fail treatment due to resistance that is not
fully understood. Even in state-of-the-art clinical trials, oncologists struggle to select patients likely to respond
to next-generation therapies. The outdated, imprecise pathology tools currently in clinical use (e.g. IHC) fail to
reliably deliver critical information such as the extent of drug target expression and accurate assessment of cell
states. Newer research tools including immunofluorescence analysis and mass cytometry also fail to bridge
this gap due to complex workflows that limit adoption to expert users, incur high sample size requirements,
and/or represent a prohibitive expense. There is a significant unmet clinical need for the development of an
improved diagnostic tool capable of generating precise, accurate, single-cell information to enable improved
diagnostic and treatment outcomes across tumor types. The goal of this project is to commercialize a platform
for rapid molecular analysis for minute and fragile cell populations, in order to generate data on protein
expression, cell state, and co-localization (including of immune cells) in single cells with the precision of flow
cytometry, while preserving the sample. The successful completion of this project will result in a validated panel
for profiling of immune cells with accompanying computational services, which can be used on standard
immunofluorescent microscopes. A successful project of this service is expected to translate into the ability to
profile many more biomarkers from a range of biopsy samples than is possible at present. Ultimately, the
technology is well suited to translate to clinical settings, where it can be used to optimally select responders for
precision cancer therapies."

The scope of our product development project is to develop our novel CD1d-binding natural killer T (NKT) cell-stimulatory glycolipid, called 7DW8-5, as a versatile vaccine adjuvant. Initial partner vaccines are based on a nucleic acid-based priming and whole parasite-based boosting liver-targeted malaria vaccine. We have published that that the 7DW8-5 glycolipid significantly increases the immunogenicity and efficacy of the nucleic acid prime-and-parasite trap malaria vaccines in a mouse model and have additional data showing that the adjuvant simplifies formulation and administration of this vaccine. Here, we will evaluate non-GMP-grade 7DW8-5 for formulation, solubility, release, stability, and toxicology. We will also confirm safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the 7DW8-5/malaria vaccine in non-human primates (NHPs).

There is a need and opportunity to improve the supports, transitions, and life outcomes of people with autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Compared to their neurotypical peers, autistic teenagers and adults report poorer
mental health and quality of life (QOL), and have higher rates of unemployment or underemployment and low
participation in post-secondary education. Nearly 40% spend little or no time with friends. Although autism
awareness has grown considerably in recent decades, much more can be done to improve the life outcomes
for people with autism. Cost-effective, affordable and scalable support systems are needed as well as ongoing
assessments and personalized treatment plans that focus on individual strengths and challenges in different
contexts (college, work, community life) across the life span. This requires adaptive interventions and regular
consultation with and between stakeholders. It also requires a rigorous approach to measuring outcomes that
are not one-size-fits-all and do not expect everyone to reach, or have, the same goals. To meet these needs,
the applicant organization, care.coach corporation (care.coach, Millbrae, CA), proposes to leverage its already
successful conversational and relational avatar technology platform to be a virtual companion and coach to
autistic people without intellectual disability in early adulthood (AYA, ages 18 to 35 years). Furthermore, we
propose to use this technology platform to scale a strong theoretical and conceptual approach that has proven
successful in meeting the individual needs and personalized outcomes of autistic students through a collabora-
tive consultation model for promoting competence and success (COMPASS) combined with Goal Attainment
Scaling (GAS). To deliver personalized coaching, empathy, and outcomes at scale, care.coach will translate
GAS/COMPASS into software-driven evidence-based protocols in collaboration with clinical, academic, and
community partners (Aim 1). Using the care.coach platform, the digital program is executed with the help of
cutting-edge conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and a team of human staff that oversee and can remotely
control the avatars and conversations as well as coordinate with AYA and clinical professionals as needed.
Barriers to the acceptance of this virtual health assistant by AYA will be assessed and removed (Aim 2). The
optimized digital intervention will be piloted tested in a small feasibility trial (Aim 3), after which the technology
platform and all intervention and research protocols are finalized. The efficacy of the digital intervention com-
pared to standard practice using traditional coaching methods (in-person clinic visits, all-human care coordina-
tion, paper-and-pencil assessments and adherence monitoring) is tested in a properly-powered randomized
control trial (RCT) with AYA (Aim 4). Effects on mental health, QOL, and self-directed, individualized functional
goals and outcomes will be assessed. If successful, the deliverable of this Fast-Track SBIR is an effective,
meaningful, and ready-to-be-commercialized digital health intervention that adapts to the needs, preferences
and goals of transition-age autistic adults to support and benefit their health, functioning, and outcomes in life."
10921921,"Project Summary
BioCircuit Technologies’ Nerve Tape® is a biologic wrap with integrated microhooks for sutureless repair of
injured nerves. This SBIR Phase IIB project comprises activities critical for promoting adoption of Nerve Tape
upon commercial launch.
Nerve injuries are common and result in paralysis, sensory loss, and chronic pain. In current repair techniques,
the ends of a cut nerve are microsutured back together under high magnification by a specialized surgeon.
Microsuture repair techniques are technically challenging and time intensive, and repair quality is not consistent.
Nerve Tape was developed as a simple and easy-to-use alternative to microsuture repair. The device consists of
flexible columns of microscale Nitinol hooks embedded in a biologic wrap. The device easily wraps to align and
hold together the two ends of a severed nerve. The microhooks are designed for safe, shallow penetration into
outer connective tissue layers of the nerve, evenly distributing tension for a firm hold. Nerve Tape is easily and
quickly applied, reliably and safely aligning nerve ends for consistent, high-quality repairs.
To promote adoption of Nerve Tape upon commercial launch, the proposed work will 1) extend the size range of
the device for greater market capture and 2) gather key preclinical data to guide surgeon perception and support
key marketing claims. To address commonly injured nerves such as small digital, facial, and branched motor
nerves, the Nerve Tape size range will be expanded to include 1-2mm nerve diameters. Addition of the new size
requires design optimization and subsequent verification and validation testing to support regulatory clearance
of the smaller sized device. Separately, performance data in specific scenarios will be collected to proactively
dispel perceived clinician concerns that might hinder adoption. Specifically, Nerve Tape’s performance will be
demonstrated in areas of flexion (using a rabbit knee flexion model) and in long-term implant scenarios (using
a 9-mo. pig model). Finally, we will gather evidence of Nerve Tape’s superior efficiency and repair quality
consistency. These advantages will be demonstrated through a rabbit transected nerve repair study comparing
surgical time and regeneration outcomes achieved by surgeons of varied microsurgery experience using Nerve
Tape or conventional microsuture-based repair.
The steps proposed in this project will position Nerve Tape for maximal market penetration after commercial
launch, enabling widespread adoption as a nerve repair device that reduces surgical time and complexity for
consistent, high-quality repairs and improved recovery outcomes."

Over 14,000 people die of prescription opioid misuse per year. Opioid-based medications are a mainstay of
postoperative pain management with approximately 80% of surgical patients receiving opioid prescriptions for
postoperative pain management. However, their use is associated with a variety of adverse events such as
addiction, respiratory depression, cognitive impairment, nausea, constipation, and death. Surgery is a critical
point where patients are at risk of developing or worsening opioid-misuse disorders with upwards of 10% of
patients going on to long term use. Additionally, adverse events related to opioids for postoperative pain
management are associated with increased cost of care, hospital length of stay, and readmission rates. A safe
and effective alternative to opioids for postoperative pain management can provide significant value to the
customer, patient, and society alike by reducing opioid-related adverse events and the costs associated with
them. Local anesthetics can temporarily control the pain at a surgical site, but the duration is limited to only a
few hours, after which pain returns and systemic pain medications (e.g. morphine, oxycodone) are required. If
local control of pain at the surgical site can be extended, it could lessen or completely mitigate the need for
systemic opioid medication. The current options for long-acting local anesthesia (e.g. liposomal bupivacaine,
indwelling catheter-based infusion pumps) are plagued with substantial drawbacks such as inadequate efficacy,
high-cost, cumbersome equipment, and risk of complications, which have limited their use and impact. Rebel
Medicine has developed a proprietary oil-based gel to deliver local anesthetics over a period of 3 day, mitigating
the need for prescription opioid use in the acute post-surgical period. While this formulation has shown extended
effect duration in rats, drug loading limitations of the system require larger injection volumes (>3mL) to achieve
effective pain management. Lipophilic salts of local anesthetics may provide not only increased solubility of local
anesthetics in Rebel’s oleogel delivery system, but may provide additional benefits of increased potency and
tunability of drug release from the gel system, allowing for extended pain treatments up to 7 days from a single
dose. Our aim for Phase I is to demonstrate our characterized lipophilic bupivacaine oleogel formulation has
superior in vivo safety and efficacy over with the current clinical standards in a standardized porcine model. We
have an assembled team with demonstrated expertise in medical technology development, drug delivery and
material science, pre-clinical analgesic drug evaluation, pharmacokinetic assessment, and pharmaceutical
commercialization."
10920628,"Abstract
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1 million U.S. citizens. PD is most
often diagnosed in people over the age of 60, while only 4% of cases of PD are diagnosed before age 50, making
age the biggest risk factor for the development of PD. The four cardinal features of PD include tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia, and postural instability, often associated with non-motor symptoms including depression, anxiety,
sleep behavior disorders, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and cognitive impairment. The most prominent
PD pathology is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral tier of the pars compacta of the
substantia nigra in the midbrain and the formation of α-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions throughout the brain.
While current medical therapies for PD significantly improve the quality of life of PD patients, none of these
therapies has been convincingly shown to slow or prevent the progression of PD, requiring the development of
treatments that can provide greater neuroprotection. To address these issues, Entobee Therapeutics
proposes to repurpose N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-studied, safe, FDA-approved drug, to manage PD.
Given the pathogenetic role of oxidative damage in PD, Entobee hypothesizes that targeted antioxidant
intervention with NAC may reduce or halt the progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with
PD. However, the administration of NAC has limitations in both intravenous and oral forms. Thus, Entobee
proposes the creation of a novel intranasal (IN) nose-to-brain (N2B) treatment option to bypass first-pass hepatic
gastrointestinal metabolism and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for faster outpatient and simple chronic care. The
overall objective of this Phase I project is to identify a safe IN N2B dose of NAC with equivalent or better brain
bioavailability compared to the 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC dose associated with dopaminergic improvement in PD
patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure NAC-derived GSH in disease-relevant regions of
the brain. This will be accomplished through the following aims: 1) Establish the regional (striatum, midbrain, and
cortex) and temporal (1–6 h and 24 h) single-dose bioavailability profile of 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC in PD patients, 2)
Compare the single-dose bioavailability and safety profiles of 200 mg and 400 mg IN N2B NAC versus 50 mg/kg
i.v. NAC bioavailability profile in PD patients, 3) Confirm the single-dose safety and tolerability of an equally
bioavailable IN N2B NAC dose in PD patients."
10921366,"Critical health- and treatment-related outcomes such as adherence to antiretroviral therapy (number of doses
taken out of those prescribed), substance-related problems (e.g., number of problems endorsed), and frailty
(e.g., number of Fried Frailty Phenotype criteria experienced) frequently take the form of fractions or
proportions. However, fractional and proportional outcomes generally have not been appropriately analyzed in
the behavioral HIV field and health outcomes research more broadly, which may lead to invalid conclusions.
For example, outcomes such as the proportion of prescribed doses taken are highly skewed with both floor and
ceiling effects (i.e., at 0 and 1), which violate the assumptions of commonly used statistical models, such as
linear regression. We propose the marginalized zero- and N-inflated binomial (MZNIB) model to assess the
overall effects of covariates (e.g., treatment effects) on proportional outcomes. The MZNIB model produces
regression estimates that share the familiar interpretation of logistic regression by focusing on the mean
probability of the target outcome (e.g., medication adherence) across the entire population. The MZNIB
approach provides a more straightforward estimation of an overall effect than traditional zero-inflated models or
other alternatives, which produce multiple sets of estimates on fractional outcomes that distinguish, for
example, between those who (1) potentially engage in the behavior (e.g., take HIV medication at least
occasionally) and (2) never engage in the behavior. In clinical research, it is critical to quantify the overall effect
as a benchmark to compare effects, identify reasons for heterogeneity in effects, and improve on effects. Lack
of appropriate methods, especially for HIV research, remains a barrier to innovative treatment development
and evaluation. To address this gap, this R21 study has three aims: (1) provide best practice recommendations
via simulation study regarding when and how the MZNIB model would be preferred over existing approaches
for evaluating medication adherence and other proportional outcomes with floor and ceiling effects, (2) produce
tutorials for implementing the MZNIB approach to estimate effects of treatment and other predictors using real
data from three HIV intervention/prevention trials and a large-scale HIV cohort study (Ns = {70, 73, 224,
9336}), and (3) develop and disseminate the first-ever open-source computational tool for the MZNIB model.
This R21 study leverages an established research group with combined expertise in HIV, substance use, and
frailty. Findings from this study will empower behavioral HIV research communities by introducing novel
statistical models and explaining their assumptions, advantages, and disadvantages in one coherent analytic
framework. Simulation studies, accessible tutorials, and substantive application papers that address fractional
count outcomes will improve statistical inference and scientific rigor. In addition, we will develop computing
tools for greater dissemination and implementation of the methods studied. The R21 will support extensions of
the MZNIB model to clustered and longitudinal data, and additional computational tools in a future R01 study."
10910931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder that imposes a significant burden on
public health. The most recent large-scale genetic study of BP identified 64 associated genetic loci, providing
initial insights in BP pathogenesis. Yet, genetic discovery in BP lags behind other key psychiatric disorders. The
reported genetic loci only capture a small proportion of the total BP genetic liability, with many more variants
across the common and rare allele frequency spectrum remaining to be discovered. In addition, the previous
studied samples were of European ancestry, leaving population specific BP variants uncovered and uncertainty
in how the BP genetic findings generalize to other populations, exacerbating health disparities, and these studies
rarely employed “deep” phenotyping or assessed relevant environmental risk factors. This proposal brings
together an international collaboration of leading investigators from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore,
India, and Pakistan to form the Asian Bipolar Genetics Network (A-BIG-NET) and carry out a large-scale genetic
study of BP in East and South Asia. A-BIG-NET will generate a BP genetic resource of 27,500 cases and 16,000
controls with rich phenotypic information, measures of key environmental stressors and genetic data from 4x
low-pass whole genome sequencing (4xWGS). This will complement a schizophrenia genetics resource of
22,778 cases and 35,362 controls of Asian ancestry previously assembled by leaders of this network that will be
available for cross-disorder comparisons. Studying BP genetics in Asia is important to the world and the U.S.,
as Asia constitutes 57% of the world population, and Asian American comprises 6.6% of the U.S. population
(21.4 million). The five countries in A-BIG-NET cover 47% of all Asian populations. The specific aims of the
proposal are to: 1) recruit and deeply phenotype 17,500 BP cases, with a focus on BP-I to maximize homogeneity,
and 14,000 controls from four Asian countries; 2) carry out 4xWGS on all recruited samples plus 10,000 BP-I
cases and 2,000 controls collected by a previous study using similar procedures in Pakistan; and 3) carry out a
range of analyses to discover new genetic associations with BP-I across the allelic spectrum in East and South
Asian populations, examine the comparative genetic architecture of BP-I across major world populations and
with other major neuropsychiatric disorders, and perform a novel statistical fine-mapping analysis that leverages
the multi-ancestry genomic diversity and pleiotropy across psychiatric disorders to identify putative causal
variants. Aim 3 will also explore the genetic “validity” of various BP-I subtypes and fit models with joint genetic
and environmental risk factors. This proposal will dramatically increase the worldwide diversity of genetics data
on BP, an important step to accelerate gene discovery in this disorder and advance global mental health equity."
10909816,"The primary research question of the proposed study is this: Is a water-based exercise plus cognitive
training intervention efficacious in improving cognitive outcomes for Veterans with Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI)? We address the need to improve cognitive function in this vulnerable population through
a novel combined training program that will combine two interventions: water-based exercise and cognitive
training. The proposed four-year randomized controlled trial will compare water-based exercise + cognitive
training (WATER+CT) to a Usual Care Control Condition (UC). The primary aim of the proposed research
is to evaluate the efficacy of WATER+CT to improve cognitive function in Veterans with MCI. Secondary
aims of the proposed research are: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of WATER+CT to improve peak oxygen
consumption and 2) to evaluate the durability of the cognitive benefits derived from WATER+CT.
Exploratory aims of the proposed research are to evaluate moderators and mediators of treatment
response.
These aims will be tested in a single-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare the efficacy of
WATER+CT to UC. This trial will include 190 Veterans meeting criteria for MCI age 50-90 with half
randomized to WATER+CT and half randomized to UC. For the WATER+CT condition, the exercise
training (i.e., WATER) consists of a six-month long individualized exercise program of water-based
exercises. During this phase, Veterans will come to thrice-weekly group sessions at Aquatic Therapy
Center at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS). After completion of the exercise program,
Veterans will begin classroom-based cognitive training at the VAPAHCS for up to two months. The CT is
based on an efficacious training program that is structured around two components, pre-training and
mnemonic training, both of which have been used successfully in persons with MCI. Veterans randomized
to the UC control condition will receive educational materials about brain health in addition to their usual
care, which is the care they would typically receive in the VA. After completion of the active treatment
phase, Veterans will transition to the six-month long follow-up phase. At the end of the six-month long
follow-up phase, participants will return to the VA for a final follow-up visit.
Participants will complete a variety of neuropsychological measures taping into areas of cognition such as
attention, executive functioning, and memory. Participants will also undergo physical fitness assessments
including a 6-minute walk test and an exercise treadmill test. To study possible predictors of response to
treatment, we will also collect biological (cardiovascular functioning and BDNF plasma levels) and genetic
data (APOE and BDNF genotypes) from these participants. We hope to provide evidence of the efficacy of
an exercise training augmentation for cognitive training thus laying the groundwork for future VA health care
system wide deployment of a lifestyle intervention to prevent Alzheimer’s disease."
10907401,"Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL
reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While
previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered
motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may
be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage
homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured
in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic
feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction.
Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response
of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage
degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during
loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we
will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior
to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of
high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo
loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition
(using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant
biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and
meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication
may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will
be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a
predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological
factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health.
Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high
risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will
enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non-
pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration.
Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on
degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for
cartilage degeneration."
10907559,"This renewal grant application represents a deepened extension of the current grant (DE25681) focusing
on the bone-enhancing effects of microRNA (miR)-335-5p, first identified and characterized in our laboratory. We
have published over 9 peer-reviewed papers and won many prizes and awards in reporting the results. We have
recently reported our new discovery of the function of miR-335-5p in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and bone
resorption. We further found that miR-335-5p exerts its inhibitory effect through its binding to the 3’UTR elements
of igsf3 (immunoglobulin superfamily, member 3). Igsf3’s increased expression during the process of osteoclast
differentiation is reversely correlated with the expression of miR-335-5p. This new discovery together with the
well-characterized anabolic osteogenic effect of miR-335-5p, has led us to speculate that miR-335-5p is a potent
pharmaceutical candidate for treating osteoporosis and its related bone disorders, where the balance between
bone formation and resorption is disturbed. At present, osteoporosis treatments include anti-resorptive drugs
and anabolic bone-forming drugs. However, these drugs target either the bone-resorption or bone-formation
pathway, but not both. Many protein-based therapies have the disadvantages including side-effects and the high
cost. We have generated both miR-335-5p gene knockout (loss-of-function) and overexpression
(gain-of-function) mice. These two mouse lines will provide the most advanced and sophisticated approaches
for gene manipulation to achieve our research purposes. Collaborating with scientists and bioengineers at the
New Jersey Institute of Technology, we have developed novel and cutting-edge targeted nanoparticles for
the first time to precisely deliver miR-335-5p to the target cells where it can exert its dual-effects in both
bone-resorption and bone-formation pahways. Aim 1. To explore the molecular mechanism of the newly
discovered function of miR-335-5p in suppressing osteoclast activity and bone resorption; Aim 2. To use our
newly generated miR-335-5p gene knockout and overexpression mice to characterize the multilayered functions
of miR-335-5p in bone metabolism; Aim 3. To apply newly developed targeted nanoparticles to deliver
miR-335-5p to specific cell types and determine its therapeutic effects on bone wound healing and reversal of
osteoporosis. We will determine the therapeutic effects of miR-335-5p given effective concentration, optimal
frequency, and accurate duration of administration to maximize its functions at both cellular and organismal
levels. This renewal project is conceptually, technically, and interventionally innovative. The advantageous
features of miRNA-based therapy will allow this translational study to shift the paradigm in understanding,
treating and ultimately curing osteoporosis and its related bone disorders. An interdisciplinary team of
investigators with complementary and synergistic skills will conduct the studies (Jake Chen – experimental
pathology and bone biology; Qisheng Tu – cell and molecular biology; Xiaoyang Xu – biomaterials and drug

10907714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance. The overall goals are to define mechanisms and therapies for the acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) due to septic bacteremia of the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA).
These mechanisms remain undefined. Our premise is that blood-borne PA cause ARDS by rapidly
internalizing in the lung endothelium. Consequently, there is activation of the gasdermin D mechanism of
membrane pore formation. Ca2+ enters the endothelial cytosol through the pores, destabilizing f-actin, and
thereby inducing barrier failure – the major cause of ARDS.
Approach. We will evaluate the premise in two Specific Aims by means of real-time confocal microscopy
(RCM) of live mouse lungs, as well as other general approaches. In SA1, we will determine the effects of LPS
transfection of the lung endothelium, a model of PA-associated LPS internalization. In SA2, we will determine
lung-endothelial effects of bacteremia, modeled by intravenous PA injection, and extra-pulmonary sepsis by
intraperitoneal PA infection. The premise will be evaluated in genetically manipulated mice to evaluate (i) the
gasdermin D and other hypotheses of membrane pore formation; (ii) mechanisms of pore repair by the ESCRT-
III system; (iii) the role of pore-induced Ca2+ and f-actin mechanisms in barrier failure; (iv) effects of PA
internalization in the lung endothelium; and (v) the efficacy of endothelial actin enhancement by cell-
permeable proteins as effective therapy against ARDS due to PA peritonitis induced.
Impact. Our studies will for the first time, reveal the importance of lung-endothelial pore formation as a
mechanism of the endothelial barrier failure that underlies sepsis-induced ARDS due to extra-pulmonary
infection by PA. The endothelial internalization of PA will be understood as the critical mechanism in this
pathology. The dynamics and mechanisms of endothelial pore formation will be revealed for the first time.
Molecular strategies directed against endothelial pore formation, therefore barrier failure, will be evaluated as
therapies for ARDS due to PA sepsis. Outstandingly novel understanding will be achieved in mechanisms and
therapies of sepsis-induced ARDS due to PA-induced pore formation."

The draft pangenome reference provides a solid foundation upon which to build a mature, more complete human
pangenome that better serves humanity. In the next phase of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium
(HPRC), we will identify individuals of broad biogeographical ancestry to include in the reference and ensure that
the global population equitably benefits from representation within the pangenome. We will provide the
community with a stable foundation for myriad downstream uses and value-added resources by building and
validating haplotype-resolved reference assemblies, creating alignments of these assemblies, and creating gene
annotations of each assembly. We will support core formats and tooling that make it possible to obtain and work
with the pangenome and coordinate the community of downstream tool builders who will ultimately determine
the success of the resource. We will coordinate these efforts with the broader scientific community to develop
and maintain a pangenomic tool ecosystem that is flexible, adaptable and responsive to user needs. We will
solicit and respond to community feedback to incorporate ‘lessons learned’, and identify and respond to
challenges to adoption of the pangenome. To maximize its downstream utility and use, and truly function as a
reference for all science, all samples included in the core resource will be consented for open access sharing.
For high-priority communities who opt to retain control of their own data, we detail a strategy for transferring
technology and expertise to these groups so they can work alongside us and benefit from the pangenome data,
resources and methods. We will continue to work closely with the embedded HPRC ethical, legal, and social
implications (ELSI) team of scholars for guidance on issues such as consent and participant community
engagement, and we will continue to initiate and foster collaborations with sister consortia and international
partners to develop a democratized resource that is representative of, and useful to, the global populations

10906789,"Project Summary / Abstract
Native Hawaiians are one of the most understudied, ethnic minority population in the United States. Compared
to their European or Asian American counterparts, Native Hawaiians exhibit alarming rates of obesity, diabetes,
and other related chronic health conditions, even after adjusting for common modifiable risk factors. Yet few
genetic research has focused on Native Hawaiians. Genomic resources such as imputation reference panels
are also generally lacking for Native Hawaiians, preventing comprehensive genetic investigations to be
undertaken with this population. Therefore, compared to other continental populations, Native Hawaiians are not
on pace to reap the benefits we have gained from large scale genomic studies of diseases.
 While there are growing recognitions of the need to include more non-European individuals in genomic
studies, an often-ignored fact is that the disease risks for members of a population are intimately tied to the
evolutionary history of that population. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that the demographic
history of a population will impact the genotype-phenotype relationship in ways specific to that population.
Therefore, a better incorporation of evolutionary thinking will help better understand the genetic basis for
differences in disease risk among diverse populations today. To this end, we are proposing to develop an
integrative framework that combines principles of both population genetics and genetic epidemiology to
understand why Native Hawaiians show excess risk in obesity and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Specifically, by
leveraging newly generated whole genome sequences (WGS) and existing array genotype data on >5,600
Native Hawaiians, we will first characterize the demographic history of the Native Hawaiians and the impact of
this history to the enrichment of functional alleles. These alleles are likely under natural selection, important for
the health of Native Hawaiians, but would be easily missed if one only studies other continental populations that
exist in large number. Secondly, by combining with existing WGS from Samoans, we will construct the first
Polynesian-specific imputation reference panel. We will then impute and conduct the largest association study
to date in >10,000 Polynesian individuals and >2,000 Micronesian individuals for obesity and T2D. Thirdly, we
will evaluate the transferability of risk stratification models for obesity and T2D based on polygenic risk scores
(PRS) in Native Hawaiians, determine the population genetic and non-genetic factors that may have contributed
to the expected poor transferability of these models, and assess if Polynesian-specific summary statistics will
improve the risk stratification models. Finally, we will conduct pilot studies in the form of focus groups to
understand the concerns Native Hawaiian community may have in future participation of genomic research. The
results from this proposal will help motivate and guide the design of future genomic studies in this understudied
population, identify population-specific alleles influencing obesity and T2D, and improve future risk stratification
models of diseases in Native Hawaiians and other Polynesian populations."

The goal of the proposed UM FIRST program is to catalyze institutional change through the
recruitment of URM faculty with a stated interest in diversity, equity, and inclusion. A
collaboration between the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and the
University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) will capitalize on the strengths of each
institution in developing and maintaining inclusive programs to encourage diversity in the
biomedical research workforce and developing NIH-funded faculty from junior investigators,
respectively. The role of the Administrative Core is to ensure the program activities are effective
and well-integrated across both institutions through collaboration with the Faculty Development
and Evaluation Cores, oversee sound fiscal management through a team-based plan that will
ensure strategic deployment of resources, recruit a diverse cohort of new faculty by capitalizing
on a series of novel activities that will transform search and recruitment practices at both
institutions, and implement new institutional policies and procedures that codify the importance
of a diverse faculty and provide an embracing infrastructure that leads to sustainable
institutional change.
The Administrative Core will span both institutions and will be directed by the PIs and Co-Core
Leaders, Drs. Kaper and LaCourse, and Co-Directors, Dr. Prasad and Ms. Johnson. Additional
oversight and guidance will be provided by the Program Steering Committee and the Fiscal
Oversight Committee, as well as the Internal and External Advisory Boards."

The Faculty Initiative for Improved Recruitment, Retention & Experience (FIIRRE) Faculty Development Core
(FDC) has the overarching goal of meeting the career and professional development, training and mentoring
needs of a cluster hire of ten new tenure-track Assistant Professors who are committed to health disparities
and equity research. The FDC is central to the broader goals of FIIRRE to develop and implement institutional
programs and policies that promote inclusive excellence and dismantle barriers to academic career
advancement of faculty from diverse backgrounds. FDC activities will be centered around the following Specific
Aims: (1) Establish and implement a faculty mentoring and professional development program to enhance
academic advancement and retain minoritized faculty. As part of a multi-mentor network, new faculty hires will
be matched to two peer mentors, one senior sponsor, and two other senior mentors, at least one of whom is a
member of a minoritized group. The FDC will coordinate access to both newly developed and existing
professional development trainings and workshops aimed at enhancing mentoring relationships, research
productivity, work-life integration, and tenure and promotion; (2) Develop and implement an institution-wide
education program for senior faculty and unit leadership (Chairs, Deans, Center Directors) to foster a culture of
inclusive excellence. Unit leadership will strengthen their strategic diversity leadership capacities through
participating in a collective leadership development initiative that will include personal pledges to advocate for
inclusivity at all levels at the University of South Carolina, hosting roundtable discussions to translate inclusive
principles into leadership, and integrating best practices into each Unit’s search committees and tenure and
promotion processes; (3) Reduce isolation, build an inclusive and supportive community, and develop an
institution-wide consortium of faculty with health disparities and equity research interests. The newly
established consortium will serve as a coordinating body for cross-disciplinary health disparities scholarship. It
will host opportunities for scientific networking, enhancement of leadership skills, and provide a vehicle for
collaboration, nurture research capacities of promising early-career faculty, and create a multidisciplinary
climate that is responsive to funding agency and societal priorities. It is expected that Consortium members
could become co-investigators, co-authors, and consultants on scholarly investigations and other works. The
FDC will work closely with the Administrative and Evaluation Cores to coordinate shared activities and ensure
the monitoring of our progress toward meeting the specific aims as well as the development of skills and career
progress of mentees and mentors. We anticipate the FDC will produce promising outcomes from our
innovative mentoring and professional development offerings and will work closely with our University
leadership to integrate our collective learning and best practices for the benefit of our University community."

The Administrative Core (AdminCore) will drive the mission of the NURTURE: Northwestern University
Recruitment to Transform Under-Representation and achieve Equity Program. It will provide the administrative
support and leadership necessary to accelerate transformative institutional change at Northwestern University
(NU) that fosters a culture of inclusive excellence. We will recruit and hire a cohort of 15 exceptional early-career,
tenure-track faculty from underrepresented groups (URGs). The AdminCore will guide and support activities of
the Faculty Development Core and deploy structures that will support our new faculty. The AdminCore will also
ensure the seamless integration of the Faculty Development Core and Evaluation Core, which will assess the
efficacy of NURTURE and its constituent components, using those assessments to adapt as needed to maximize
outcomes. Finally, the AdminCore will serve as the interface between NURTURE and FIRST Cohort programs
across the US. The AdminCore has three MPIs who are leaders and role models in research excellence with
commitments to, and outstanding track records in, fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion, mentorship, and
program administration. These leaders will coordinate a governance structure containing a diverse group of
administrative, scientific, and professional development leaders within NURTURE, senior NU administrators,
and an External Advisory Committee. We will leverage the collective expertise and guidance provided by this
structure, along with the MPIs’ experience, to continuously evolve NURTURE to improve operations,
implementation of structural change elements, faculty support, communications, and fiscal management. The
AdminCore will oversee the achievement of NURTURE’s overall goals through the following Specific Aims: Aim
1: Provide overall administrative management for NURTURE activities, ensuring integration, coordination,
collaboration, and fiscal administration. Aim 2: Conduct strategic planning for promoting inclusive excellence at
NU and cluster hiring in the Scientific Neighborhoods of NURTURE: (1) Brain, Mind, and Behavior; (2) Cancer;
and (3) Cardiovascular, which will each support a transdisciplinary theme of “Cells to Community,” in part, to
promote higher valuation of community-related research across NU. Aim 3: Oversee faculty recruitment
strategies and procedures for the cluster hiring of 15 outstanding early-career, tenure-track URG faculty. A
central goal will be to transform processes for recruitment of qualified applicants and selection of competitive
finalists based on a commitment to inclusive excellence and synergy with existing institutional research strengths
and resources, ensuring that all new faculty hires have a supportive, scientifically nurturing environment in which
to launch successful independent research programs. Aim 4: Coordinate with the Faculty Development Core to
provide resources for career progression and retention of the newly recruited faculty, ensuring strong institutional
investment for the success and wellbeing of the NURTURE faculty cohort through tenure and beyond."
10928506,"Healthy cerebral cortex function requires population neural activity that is coordinated across a
wide range of timescales. Neural circuits must operate with quick, momentary sensorimotor
responses (~10 ms), but also maintain persistent activity for short-term memory (~10000 ms),
and many other timescales between these extremes. Depending on behavioral context, faster or
slower timescales may be more useful, but there is no single most-important timescale. The
status quo in computational neuroscience is to pick one particular function (usually associated
with one, or a few particular timescales) and then build theory and experiments which address
it. While useful, this cottage industry approach leaves open an important knowledge gap; we lack
a unified theory that accounts holistically for the many timescales that coexist in real cortical
circuits. How can a single, local population of cortical neurons generate dynamics with a broad
repertoire of coexistent timescales? How is the repertoire of timescales tuned to accommodate
behavioral context? Here we propose to develop fundamental theory and data analytic tools to
answer these questions and to directly test important hypotheses in awake mice. Our preliminary
theoretical efforts and experimental data strongly support the following hypotheses which frame
our proposed work. Central hypothesis 1: Neural populations in awake cortex manifest with a
very broad repertoire of timescales because they operate near criticality, which is a dynamical
regime defined by an infinite range of scale-invariant timescales. Central hypothesis 2: Changes
in arousal and behavior tune the cortical operating regime around criticality, allowing the system
to shift the repertoire of timescales to be faster or slower. Our proposed work will be organized
into four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal renormalization group theory (tRG)
for describing and explaining the origins of multiple timescales in local cortical population spike
recordings. Our theory will build upon traditional RG from physics, but specifically modified for
spatially local, high-density recordings with single cell resolution. In Aim 2, we will generate an
easy-access data analysis toolbox for investigating the timescale repertoire of spike
recordings. In Aim 3, we will determine how timescale repertoire shifts with vigilance and
behavioral context. In Aim 4, we will identify biophysical mechanisms which impact the timescale
repertoire. Our theory and tools will perform fair comparisons of multiple competing theories
(criticality and others) based on a holistic view of cortical timescales. We expect our results to
unify and differentiate the zoo of different possible explanatory models for the timescale repertoire
of cortical population dynamics."
10935789,"In 2016, we initiated the first large-scale clinical trial to personalize screening based on individual risk, which
varies significantly among women. The WISDOM Study is a multi-center, randomized comparative
effectiveness trial to determine if personalized screening recommendations based on a woman’s individual
breast cancer risk is as safe and causes fewer morbidities than the current US approach of annual screening
for all women. In the intervening time, there have been a number of important advances in breast cancer risk
assessment. In particular, there is evidence that models of risk can not only predict a woman’s risk for breast
cancer, but can predict risk for specific breast cancer subtypes.
This Project will extend the WISDOM Study for a period of five years, integrating models of risk that predict
specifically for the development of fast-growing and slow-growing cancers. Women with high-risk for fast-
growing cancers will be recommended earlier and more frequent screening with more sensitive imaging
methods. Women at high risk for slow-growing cancers will be offered endocrine risk reduction. In order to
compare the impact of this subtype-specific approach on screening outcomes, we will first acquire and
determine the subtype of cancers that arose in the original WISDOM cohort as well as the new cohort
assessed with subtype-specific models. The primary aim is to determine if the subtype-specific models indeed
enrich for the type of tumor detected (fast or slow-growing). We will see if this approach increases the
efficiency of screening (cancers/1000 women screened) compared to the reported rates from the BCSC model.
We will also compare whether the fast and slow prediction increases the fraction of fast-growing cancers that
are screen detected compared to the first cohort in WISDOM prior to subtype tumor prediction. The secondary
aims include the fraction of women at high-risk for slow growing tumors that take up risk reducing interventions
and whether those that do develop fewer cancers. As well, we will look to reduce morbidity of screening.
Project 1 will implement and help validate advanced cancer and subtype-specific risk models that integrate
family history, mammography (2D and 3D)-based artificial intelligence algorithms and refined polygenic risk
scores developed from large external cohorts. A collaboration with the leadership of the CISNET/MISCAN
model of breast cancer screening will allow us to evaluate the potential healthcare impacts of these new
subtype-specific risk models to determine whether they should be adopted as part of subtype specific risk
prediction models. The goal is to increase health care value of screening by the end of this P-01.
Extending the utility of the existing WISDOM infrastructure represents exceptional value for a ground-breaking
research program that will significantly advance our understanding of the potential for risk-based approaches
to impact breast cancer screening outcomes. WISDOM’s team is an extremely diverse, multidisciplinary and
seasoned investigator group that is passionate about improving and personalizing screening and prevention."

10919722,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Herein we propose a field-deployable, cost-effective, highly sensitive and specific Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for
the surveillance of lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Brugia species. Our new test, termed Brugia Test Plus (BT+),
was developed during a previous project phase funded jointly by the US Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the Gates Foundation. It has been shown to perform exceptionally well both in the laboratory (100%
sensitivity, 100% specificity) and in the field (85% sensitivity, Belitung-East/Indonesia) and to satisfy all key criteria
of WHO’s Target Product Profile (TPP) for the surveillance of LF (sensitivity, specificity, shelf life, time-to-result,
portability, cost). With BT+ on the verge of programmatic adoption, we now request Direct-to-Phase II funding
from NIH to quickly progress BT+ to manufacturing and commercialization within a maximum of 2 years.
LF is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease which affects 40 million people globally and causing 1.6 million
Disability Adjusted Life Years. In 2021, over 882 million people in 44 countries were threatened by LF, requiring
preventive chemotherapy to stop a further spread of the disease. LF is caused by two species of parasites:
Wuchereria bancrofti found globally (90% of cases), and Brugia species confined to Southeast Asia (10% of cases).
Elimination of LF is a WHO top priority project: the Global Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis
(GPELF), launched by WHO in 2000, is the most ambitious mass drug administration (MDA) program ever
deployed by WHO with an astounding 9 billion preventative treatments having been distributed between 2000
and 2021. WHO’s NTD Road Map requires all LF endemic countries to implement post-MDA or post-validation
surveillance by 2030. In 2021, WHO released a Target Product Profile (TPP) for LF surveillance defining the criteria
for new RDTs, which is the strongest signal WHO can give regarding the urgency of developing such new tests.
Current methods for diagnosing infection by Brugia spp. include examination of nighttime blood by microscopy
and PCR. This is logistically too complicated and costly for programmatic use. ELISA formats exist, but remain
confined to laboratory use. One field-deployable test is available, the Brugia Rapid Test (BRT, Reszon Diagnostics).
However, over the years, BRT has been plagued by erratic quality, which has led some countries (notably
Indonesia, the country with the highest disease burden) to abandon its use for Transmission Assessment Surveys.
This, combined with the absence of any tests to substitute the BRT, leaves many Brugia programs in a quandary.
Given the exciting results obtained with BT+, the massive relevance for public health, and the big momentum
already garnered with key players (USAID, Gates Foundation, WHO), there is now a shared desire that DDTD’s
new Brugia test be progressed without delays to large-scale manufacturing followed by commercialization.
Direct-to-Phase II funding from the NIH would enable us to achieve this objective within a maximum of 2 years."

 Preventable deaths in children are on the rise. Adolescent deaths by drug overdose more than doubled
between 2019 and 2021 (with over 90% of deaths involving opioids), and school shootings have more than
doubled in the past 5 years. The number of pediatric deaths from opioid overdose and penetrating trauma can be
reduced by timely use of simple-to-use rescue tools if they are immediately accessible: naloxone is an effective
antidote for opioid overdose that can restore consciousness and breathing, and tourniquets and hemostatic
dressings can stem life-threatening bleeding and avert hemorrhagic shock. Whereas automated external
defibrillators (AEDs) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are widespread (3 million in the US) and accessible
in schools, naloxone and hemorrhage control kits rarely are publicly accessible in schools and other institutions
caring for adolescents. This lack of preparedness means that preventable adolescent deaths continue to accrue
unnecessarily. The AdvanceBox system publicly positions rescue tools and pairs them with technology,
instructions, and links to training resources to ensure that the tools are reliably monitored, maintained,
discoverable, and effectively used.
 The AdvanceBox cellular-connected modular storage system houses simple lifesaving tools with just-in-time
rescue infographics / instructions for opioid overdose and traumatic hemorrhage, provides Web links to training
videos and established learn-ahead resources, enables remote viewing and container monitoring, communicates
system status, sends text/email notifications when opened, maps installations so 9-1-1 dispatchers can direct
callers to nearby rescue tools, and facilitates rescue tool re-supply. In this NIH SBIR Phase I program, Nimbus
Research Laboratory (NRL) will accomplish the following Aims to establish the utility and value of Design
Validation Testing (DVT) prototypes and to support development of a market-ready product that can be
manufactured at scale, sold, and broadly deployed:
 - Aim 1: Design, build, deploy, and field-test AdvanceBox Design Validation Testing (DVT) prototypes
 - Aim 2: Deliver just-in-time instructions and promote learn-ahead training for staff and bystander rescuers
 - Aim 3: Explore fit of AdvanceBox innovations with institutional needs and determine best applications
 The proposed SBIR Phase 1 work consists of system design, construction, and field testing with health
communication and health technology consultant experts to demonstrate feasibility and utility while preparing for
economic production at scale; development, packaging, and promotion of instructional and learn-ahead materials
for access via AdvanceBox units; and visiting and interviewing personnel at schools and organizations that care
for adolescents. NRL strives to deliver an integrated system of rescue tools, information, communications,
mapping, and supply management that helps educational and youth development institutions prepare for some of
the greatest risks that adolescents currently face. SBIR Phase II work will focus on preparing a reliable, user-
friendly, and commercially viable system product that can be nationally implemented at schools, with a longer-
term goal of addressing unmet rescue needs in high risk populations and additional age groups."

derived CRC xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDOs).
The HPM Core is established to support the overall goal of the TBEL application in determining how the
microenvironment of colonic pre-cancer lesions is shaped by its individual components (epithelial, microbial,
stroma, and immune cells). The HPM Core will coordinate efforts, consolidate resources, and share experimental
expertise by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) generate and characterize epithelial, stromal, and microbial
components of pre-cancer lesions; 2) establish culture and co-culture conditions of epithelial cells with colibactin-
producing E. coli and immune and/or stromal components; and 3) manipulate colonic organoids via genetic and
pharmacologic perturbations.
The immediate goal of the HPM Core is to provide support to all three of our projects and QB core. Core
personnel will work closely with project and core leaders to ensure effective support and two-way communication.
The longer-term goal of the HPM Core is the wider dissemination of these resources and expertise as we
welcome the opportunity to provide support to other TBEL recipients."
10926875,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Administrative Core
The overall goal of our leukemia focused ARTNet Research Center is to understand how the architecture of
resistance is governed by temporal extrinsic and intrinsic factors in order to identify novel therapeutic strategies
to stay ahead of tumor evolution and adaptation in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). To achieve this
goal, we have assembled an exceptional team of leukemia researchers that bridge basic/mechanistic and
preclinical/translational research who have worked extensively together for 15+ years studying AML biology. The
Administrative Core will provide leadership, scientific oversight, governance, integration, and administrative
support to the ARTNet Research Center to ensure effective operations, communication, internal and external
collaborations, compliance, and rigorous scientific evaluation of ARTNet Consortium funded projects. The
Administrative Core co-Leads, Dr. Jeffrey Tyner (Contact M-PD/PI) and Dr. Cristina Tognon, have been working
together for close to a decade, and they have also both worked closely for this entire time with Administrative
Core Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Lead and Overall M-PD/PI, Dr. Shannon McWeeney. They will be
supported by a highly experienced Research and Finance Administrator, Sarah Bowden. The specific aims of
the Administrative Core are to: 1) Provide overall administrative management by providing governance and
scientific integration of the Center and developing and implementing a staffing plan; 2) Create an environment
that fosters a focused and synergistic relationship between the Projects and the Cores; 3) Provide ARTNet
Research Center compliance oversight and evaluate scientific progress; and 4) Enable rapid dissemination of

10926876,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Core B: Functional Phenotyping Core
In the last 20 years, a number of pivotal new treatments have changed the world of cancer as a disease.
Despite these advances, not a single treatment offers a guaranteed cure to everyone who is diagnosed with this
disease. The overall goal of our leukemia-focused ARTNet Center is to understand, on a mechanistic level, how
tumors evolve and adapt under therapeutic pressure leading to loss of tumor control and ultimately disease
progression. Specifically, this application interrogates the temporal extrinsic and intrinsic factors that influence
tumor evolution and its influence on tumor microenvironment in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In
order to achieve this goal, we have assembled an exceptional team of leukemia researchers, clinicians and data
scientists that have a long history of working together to bridge basic/mechanistic and translational research in
order to tackle AML biology and how this biology changes upon drug treatments.
The Functional Phenotyping core will support this ARTnet project in the standardization, optimization,
and implementation of state-of-the art advanced molecular and functional assays. Additionally, the FP team will
assume oversite, governance as well as integration and standardization of all data collected from each of these
functional genomic assays used in this ARTNet Center. This is an important and essential part of a well-executed
multiparametric and multidisciplinary project, which will allow for extraction of the most meaningful data that can
be cross-compared and interpreted.
The specific aims of the Functional Phenotyping core are to: 1) Optimize standard operating
procedures and provide oversight for the processing, tracking, and dissemination of biospecimens from
AML patients; 2) Work with all ARTNet leaders and researchers to develop and execute SOPs for
functional genomic platforms to facilitate standardized data acquisition and analysis; 3) Serve as data
stewards with regard to governance, security, storage, management, standards, integration, and
dissemination to support intra- and inter-Center analyses and modeling.
In order to achieve these aims, the Functional Phenotyping core will establish and implement SOP-driven
work flows with well-defined milestones and quality check ins across all stages and assays implemented in this
proposal. Further, the FP Core will focus on quality assurance for all assays and help with communication in the
case that unforeseen troubleshooting is required. Overall, the FP core will serve as a resource for all researchers,
making sure the goals of this application are achieved in successful and timely matter."
10926879,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 1
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex and genetically heterogenous disease and one of the most common
hematologic malignancies. After 30-40 years without new therapies, several recent drugs have been approved
for AML, including inhibitors of FLT3, IDH1/2, and BCL2. Despite improved initial response rates, none of these
regimens lead to durable remissions. Acquired resistance to these agents develops due to diverse mechanisms
that include tumor cell adaptation, often driven by microenvironmental signals. For the past decade, our
collaborative team has employed numerous techniques, models, and analytical approaches to studying acquired
drug resistance in AML – partly as a Center in the Drug Sensitivity and Resistance Network (DRSN) – the
predecessor to ARTNet. We have developed the largest-to-date functional genomics platform of primary AML
patient samples and implemented genome-wide CRISPR screening. Computational integration of these datasets
has generated many predictions for mechanisms of drug resistance and nominated rationally selected drug
combinations, some of which are in clinical trials. This analysis has led to a central hypothesis that tumor
intrinsic biology can adapt in the face of therapeutic pressure, often with support from cell extrinsic
signals, to undergo a multi-step process where early drug resistance is formed via cross-talk with
immune and stromal cells that leads to an eventual late, cell autonomous resistant state with features of
clonal evolution. For this project, our long-term goals are to optimize and translate the most effective drug
combinations into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals are to understand tumor
intrinsic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. To accomplish these goals, three Aims are proposed: 1)
Next-generation genome-wide interrogation of key acquired resistance scenarios – We created a panel of AML
models of acquired drug resistance. These models have been generated with long-term drug exposure,
sometimes with support from extrinsic cytokines. We will subject these drug resistant cells to genome-wide
CRISPR screens with overlay of drugs or drug combinations. 2) Epigenomic evolution of acquired resistance –
We will use protocols for expansion of myeloid progenitor cells from primary AML patient samples to study
epigenetic adaptation. Using the same list of drugs and drug combinations as in Aim 1, we will profile shifts in
epigenetic landscape using single-cell sequencing. 3) Atlas of intrinsic drug resistance in AML – We have
expertise with broad data integration and modeling approaches. We will use these strategies to leverage our
existing functional genomic dataset combined with the new data generated in Aims 1 and 2 to generate an Atlas
of tumor intrinsic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance in AML. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative
analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of acquired drug resistance in AML, leading to successful
clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies."

Project Summary/Abstract. Rift Valley fever (RVF), a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease affecting ruminants and humans endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, is classified as Category A Priority Pathogen by the NIH/NIAID and the Blueprint priority disease by the World Health Organization. With One Health approach, a control of infected animals and mosquitoes are important to eradicate RVF from specific areas, whereas vaccinated humans will support overall activities including the handling of infected animals. There are, however, no licensed RVF vaccines for human use. Live attenuated MP-12 vaccine, which was conditionally licensed in 2013 as a veterinary RVF vaccine in the U.S., had Investigational New Drug (IND) vaccine status, it has now been replaced with weakly immunogenic inactivated RVF candidate vaccine under IND. To develop a highly immunogenic and safe RVF candidate vaccine for human use, we have generated a novel live-attenuated candidate vaccine for RVF, termed “RVax-1”, which encodes more than 500 silent mutations throughout the open reading frame and a truncation of 78kD/NSm genes. Our central hypothesis is that the RVax-1 candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in mice and sheep via the intramuscular route with a single dose, highly attenuated in pregnant rat placenta and in infant mice and disseminate poorly in mosquito vectors. The overall objective is to characterize the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of the RVax-1 candidate vaccine in mice, rats, and sheep, and to determine the level of viral dissemination in mosquitoes, in order to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding this candidate vaccine and move forward into IND-enabling preclinical and, subsequently, clinical evaluation. The work environment is ideal because the high containment facilities at the University of Texas Medical Branch are suitable for animal experiments, while SUNY Upstate Medical University and Kansas State University support mosquito and sheep experiments, respectively. The long-term goal of our study is to move the RVax-1 vaccine forward into preclinical evaluation, production under Good Manufacturing Practice, and Phase 1/2 trials. Specific Aim 1: To characterize the attenuation, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of RVax-1 in a mouse model. Specific Aim 2: To characterize the mosquito dissemination of RVax-1. Specific Aim 3: To characterize the attenuation, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of RVax-1 in a sheep model. Specific Aim 4: To characterize the attenuation of RVax-1 in rodent placenta. Successful completion of proposed project will qualify RVax-1 for further characterization in preclinical and clinical evaluation."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease with significant variation in
disease manifestation, progression, and outcomes. There is increasing interest in precision medicine strategies
in COPD to identify disease traits that, when targeted for treatment, result in improved outcomes. There has
been increasing recognition of the prevalence of allergic disease and allergic sensitization in COPD, but the
clinical significance of this overlapping trait has been unclear. Blood eosinophils have been recognized as a
trait to help target treatment with inhaled corticosteroids among individuals with COPD but are imprecise as a
biomarker of type 2 inflammation. We recently published compelling results showing that individuals with
COPD having both allergic sensitization as well as concomitant exposure to common indoor aeroallergens,
also having elevated total IgE, have a substantially higher risk of adverse outcomes. It is also well established
that individuals with allergic asthma having sensitization with exposure to common indoor aeroallergens have
significant benefit from treatment with omalizumab. Accordingly, we propose the Clinical trial of omalizumab for
allergen sensitized and exposed individuals with COPD (COPD OMA) a masked, randomized, placebo-
controlled multi-center phase 2 clinical trial of omalizumab versus placebo among individuals with COPD
having sensitization with concomitant exposure to common indoor allergens. The trial will enroll 330 individuals
with moderate to severe COPD in partnership with the American Lung Association-Airways Clinical Research
Centers (ALA-ACRC) and will test whether omalizumab leads to treatment response, including improvement in
exacerbation risk (primary outcome), disease status (measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and
COPD Assessment Test Score), and lung function (secondary outcomes) over the course of 12 months. The
study will be conducted at twenty centers throughout the US. In a mechanistic aim, we also propose to explore
molecular signatures of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines to understand drivers of disease morbidity as well as
treatment response in this population. Accordingly, this is an ideal phase II clinical trial with the goals of
detecting a signal for efficacy of omalizumab in improving relevant clinical outcomes among a high-risk
subgroup of individuals; and understanding relevant biologic endotypes with increased responsiveness to
treatment."
10922108,"Project Summary
There is a world-wide “twin epidemic” of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), with an urgent need to find new
drug treatments that induce weight loss and correct the concurrent metabolic dysfunction, including
hyperglycemia. Stable derivatives of the endogenous enteroendocrine hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP1), are in clinical use for the treatment of T2D and have more recently also been approved for the treatment
of obesity.
However, efficacy of even the most advanced GLP1-based drugs remains modest compared to what can be
achieved by bariatric surgery, an invasive procedure that carries considerable risks but results in rapid and
sustained normalization of blood glucose and then body weight. The therapeutic effects of bariatric surgery
appear to rely on the simultaneous, synergistic modulation of many different endogenous glucoregulatory
hormones. Inspired by this observation, there are now ongoing efforts to combine GLP1 treatment with
stimulation of other hormonal regulatory pathways of metabolism, which has been shown to further increase
treatment efficacy.
One promising pathway that could be co-targeted relies on the hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), which
is physiologically co-secreted from intestinal endocrine cells together with GLP1. However, PYY is rapidly N-
terminally cleaved in the blood stream by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4). As a result of
this truncation, PYY loses its ability to stimulate one of its targets, the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (NPY1R) which
mediates the hormone’s beneficial effects on islet integrity, insulin production, and maintenance of glucose
homeostasis. While truncated PYY maintains its ability to stimulate a complementary target, the anorexic
NPY2R in the brain, its therapeutic promise is diminished given the loss of concomitant NPY1R agonism.
In phase 1 studies leading to the current proposal, we have been able, for the first time, to N-terminally modify
PYY in a way that eliminates susceptibility to DPP4 and fully preserves this peptide’s ability to stimulate both
NPY1Rs and NPY2Rs. The main goal of the current phase 2 proposal is to take the next steps to transform this
stabilized NPY1R/NPY2R dual agonist into a drug, which requires further optimization to enable once-daily
dosing (Aim 1) and demonstrating efficacy in protecting islet function and in reducing obesity in mouse models
(Aim 2). These studies will set the stage for us to subsequently apply for IND-enabling studies. Such studies
would be to pursue further development into a dual NPY1R/NPY2R companion drug, one that can be applied
together with GLP1-based as well as related treatments for enhancing the treatment of diabesity. In
complementary experiments, we will also explore integrating PYY functionality into recently reported
monomolecular multi-agonists that are designed to, in addition to the GLP1R, simultaneously activate distinct
receptors for one or two other, synergistic hormones (Aim 3). The emerging multi-agonist strategy has shown
great promise for a potential next generation type of therapeutic that may be enriched by built-in PYY functionality
in the future."

Elucidating physiology of dormant bacteria to combat antibiotic persistence
PROJECT SUMMARY
Most antibiotics are ineffective for killing dormant bacteria and it is estimated that 50% of antibiotic tolerance cases are due
to phenotypic `persistence' rather than genetic resistance: bacteria can survive drug treatment simply because a few of them
are metabolically dormant. For example, nutrient and oxygen depletion in the center of biofilms renders bacteria
metabolically dormant and antibiotic tolerant. Once the antibiotic is withdrawn, recurrence gives bacteria the chance to
evolve antibiotic resistance. Common examples of recurrent infections include urinary tract infections of pathogenic E.
coli—the most common bacterial infection in women in developed countries—latent tuberculosis, and biofilm-forming
bacteria, like the P. aeruginosa infections that often complicate wound healing and commonly affect cystic fibrosis patients.
To develop new strategies to combat recurring infections and persistence, we need a better understanding of dormant
bacteria.
My laboratory aims to identify new antibiotic targets that are effective against dormant bacteria. By studying spontaneous
death rates of dormant bacteria, we have already identified key vulnerabilities. We found that death rates of dormant bacteria
critically depend on previous growth conditions. By correlating proteomics data with death rates, we have identified
hundreds of genes that may contribute to survival and adaptation processes of dormant bacteria. We have validated many
of our candidates using genetics, and discovered a crucial role of the bacterial outer membrane for the survival of dormant
bacteria. We now need to uncover how the outer membrane mechanistically contributes to survival during dormancy and
understand a complex interplay between the cell envelope, osmoregulation and energy metabolism that we have discovered.
A better understanding of these processes will reveal the most promising antibiotic targets and effective combinations of
existing drugs against dormant bacteria. My lab's interdisciplinary experience in quantitative biology and biophysics puts
us in a unique position to answer these questions and to provide key insights into the physiology of dormant states."
10925235,"Project Summary
The 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is the sequence between the stop
codon of the coding sequence and poly(A) tail. Importantly, the location where the 3’end processing machinery
adds the poly(A) tail to the pre-mRNA is not invariant, but changes in a controlled manner to generate 3’UTR
isoform diversity between mRNAs of the same gene. This process is known as alternative polyadenylation
(APA). Although the 3’UTR isoforms generated through APA do not alter the amino acid sequence of the
protein, they influence expression by adding or removing binding sites for microRNAs and RNA binding
proteins (RBPs) that influence mRNA export, stability, localization, and translation efficiency. Targeted 3’end
sequencing techniques have shown APA to be widespread and regulated between tissues and in specific
disease contexts. Despite the prevalence of APA , a regulatory understanding of which RBPs drive this process
remains limited. Cells of specific hematopoietic lineages were found to display pervasive APA, but no
comprehensive map of APA in the erythroid lineage exists. Other RNA processing events, like alternative
splicing and translational control, are known to be important for erythropoiesis and dysregulated in certain
anemias and thalassemias, suggesting that APA altering the length/identity of 3’UTRs may also influence
erythroid biology in health and disease. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by comprehensively
identifying and quantifying APA during erythropoiesis using targeted 3’end sequencing on RNA collected from
erythroid cells throughout differentiation. Preliminary data suggests several genes essential for erythropoiesis,
like transcription factors TAL1 (SCL) and TCF3 (E2A), undergo APA shifts during this process. The functional
impact of different 3’UTR isoform choices will be assessed by monitoring impact on mRNA and protein levels
(luciferase assays) and differentiation efficacy (CRISPR deletions to force isoform expression). Finally, this
project will identify key regulators of the APA shifts across erythropoiesis by analyzing a large compendium of
RBP knockdown, mutation, and knockout experiments from K562 erythroleukemia cells followed by
experimental validation. Preliminary data suggests splicing factors commonly mutated in myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS, a condition characterized, in part by ineffective erythropoiesis) like SRSF2, also influence
APA shifts observed in erythroid differentiation. Taken together, the studies outlined by this proposal will
provide insight into novel regulatory mechanisms of APA utilized during erythropoiesis that functionally alters
key genes. Identification of the molecular regulators of this process, some of which are already implicated in
disease, may suggest novel therapeutic avenues."

Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is the most common cancer in men 15-45 years old, and among adult
cancers results in the greatest years of life lost. Among children with gonadal/genital atypia (the applicant’s
specialty), the lifetime risk of gonadal germ cell tumor is up to 50%. However, which genes predispose to these
tumors, and thus would be targets for precision-medicine-based prevention and treatment approaches, remain
mostly unknown. The applicant recently identified both the first Mendelian gene predisposing to TGCT, and
new genome-wide association hits for TGCT. In the research project proposed here we will determine the
mechanisms through which these genomic variations impair cell-autonomous germ cell specification and/or
epigenetic reprogramming (Aim 1) and gonadal niche formation (Aim 2). I hypothesize that alleles which
predispose to TGCT impair specific stages of germ cell development. These aims will be accomplished using
innovative modeling of human germ cells with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and a genetic biobank of
~100,000 children with phenotypic data by which to identify those with gonadal/genital atypia and risk for
TGCT. This data will advance our understanding of TGCT predisposition and initiation, and will expand our
knowledge of typical gonadal development. The results from this study will provide rationale for future precision
cancer prevention and treatment strategies. This proposal describes a five-year plan for the applicant to
develop an independent research career as an academic oncogeneticist focused on germ cell tumor
predisposition and prevention. The applicant, Dr. Pyle, is an attending pediatric geneticist at Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia (CHOP) with PhD training in basic molecular biology and precision medicine. Her research
focuses on identifying germline genetic features that predispose to TGCT, and understanding their
mechanisms of action. The goals for this award are to further develop the skills required for a successful career
as an independent investigator, including expertise in bioinformatic analysis and handling of large genetic and
phenotypic data sets, modeling of human tissue with iPSCs, and cancer biology. The mentors for this award,
Drs. Hakon Hakonarson and Katherine L. Nathanson, are internationally recognized leaders in pediatric
genetic discovery and genetic predisposition to cancer, respectively. Dr. Pyle will be supported by a
mentorship committee comprising leaders in oncology, statistical genetics, and gonadal development. Dr. Pyle
will also benefit from the unparalleled resources and mentorship available at CHOP and the University of
Pennsylvania."
10920706,"Project Abstract
Widely overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues, Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) has become an
attractive target for both imaging and radionuclide-based therapy of prostate cancer. Despite exciting progress,
PSMA-targeted therapeutic agents could pose high radiation exposure toward normal organs that express the
receptor. In fact, salivary glands (SGs) are often the dose-limiting organ that determines how much
radioactivity can be administered, patient eligibility, and the treatment outcome thereafter. This application
addresses critical needs to reduce radiation exposure to normal organs while maintaining tumor uptake. We
therefore focus on constructing PSMA derivatives aiming to protect SGs from these radiolabeled agents.
In recent years, tremendous excitement has emerged over probes that can be diagnostic and therapeutic
(Theranostics). These agents not only can reveal disease sites but also emit radiation that can have therapeutic
effects, enabling localized and targeted treatments. Recently, the UNC team has established a trifunctionalized
TVS system to streamline the workflows to develop theranostic agents (patent pending and Tripill Biotech is
negotiating with UNC to license the technology). In our preliminary research, we have discovered that NOTA-
UNC-PSMA2 can demonstrate 2-3 times higher tumor uptake in rodent models (compared with PSMA-617),
while the SG uptake is only 1/10th of PSMA-617 at 24 h post-injection in non-human primates (NHP), potentially
due to the cation binding ability of the TVS system. These encouraging results clearly demonstrated the feasibility
of selectively reducing SG uptake with minimal impact on tumor uptake of PSMA-positive tumors. With the
promising imaging component completed in preliminary research, in this project, Tripill Biotech will partner with
Prof. Wu to validate the therapeutic potential of NOTA-UNC-PSMA2. The resulting agents will be labeled with
64Cu and 67Cu, and evaluated for stability, PSMA binding affinity, salivary gland uptake, and in vivo therapeutic
efficacy. This application reflects a joint effort from a multidisciplinary team composed of experts in chemistry,
drug delivery, radiochemistry, biology, clinical practice, and molecular imaging. The success of the proposed
approach would solve key issues in PSMA-targeted radiotherapeutics (in this case exposure to SGs), which
could greatly benefit prostate cancer management."
10921550,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV has a complex expression pattern of RNA with three different classes of transcripts: unspliced, singly
spliced, and multiply spliced. The unspliced transcripts encode the Gag and Pol proteins, and the singly spliced
transcripts encode the Env, Vif, and Vpu proteins. The multiply spliced transcripts encode the Tat, Rev, and Nef
proteins. The multiply spliced transcripts are translated early on following infection due to their more efficient
export from the nucleus. The unspliced and singly spliced transcripts, on the other hand, are retained in the
nucleus due to cis-acting elements including the Rev Response Element (RRE). However, the post-
transcriptional processing of these three classes of transcripts beyond their differential splicing is an
understudied area of HIV research.
Past research has revealed that alongside the virally encoded Rev protein, multiple host factors are also
necessary for the export of unspliced and singly spliced HIV transcripts. Among these are RNA binding
proteins including proteins that can recognize the RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A). The role of
m6A modification of HIV transcripts has been studied in active infection of cell lines but has yielded differing
results. Some reports suggest that m6A modification of HIV transcripts enhances HIV replication while others
suggest that it inhibits replication. Current maps of m6A sites on HIV transcripts cannot discern how the
different transcript classes are differentially modified. Additionally, how m6A mechanistically impacts post-
transcriptional processing of HIV transcripts and their nuclear trafficking is unknown. Preliminary data suggests
that the HIV RNA species are, in fact, differentially modified and the presence or absence of m6A at these sites
affects RNA expression levels. Therefore, I hypothesize that the presence or absence of m6A on HIV
transcripts impacts the interactions of HIV RNA with nuclear RNA binding proteins, and this, in turn, affects the
nuclear trafficking and stability of the RNA. To test this hypothesis, I will use nanopore direct RNA sequencing,
knockdowns of the m6A machinery proteins and m6A reader proteins in actively infected and latently infected
primary T cells, and HITS-CLIP to address the following questions: (i) where does m6A modification occur on
HIV transcripts from primary T cell models of HIV latency and HIV+ donor cells? (ii) how does perturbation of
the m6A machinery proteins and m6A readers affect the nuclear localization and distribution of the different
HIV RNA species during active infection and following latency reversal? Ultimately, the results of this project
will provide a better understanding of the post-transcriptional processing of HIV RNA in primary T cells which is
paramount to the design of new therapeutics for eradicating the latent HIV reservoir."

CAR T cell therapies have produced robust remissions in several hematological malignancies. However, they
have not achieved the same success against solid tumors. These treatments fail for multiple reasons, including
antigen escape and poor T cell persistence in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Additionally,
many patients receiving T cell therapy experience serious, sometimes life-threatening side effects. Here, we
propose a CAR T product – an armored split CAR – that combines 2 innovative strategies specifically tailored to
address the unique challenges presented by solid tumors, as well as an inducible suicide switch to enhance
safety. Moreover, we are developing this product on our proprietary allogeneic γδ T cell platform. These cells
display innate anti-tumor properties and do not mediate GVHD. We use a “Split CAR” approach, wherein two
CAR molecules, each targeting a different antigen, are expressed by a single T cell and dimerize upon antigen
binding. By targeting 2 antigens, we reduce the potential for antigen escape. Each CAR molecule contains either
a CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domain which are independently activated to cooperatively enhance cytokine
release, cell survival, and proliferation. The heterodimerized CARs trigger activation through a single shared
CD3ζ domain incorporated on one of the CAR chains. In addition, our engineered T cells express a binding
molecule to sequester and disable the tumor-secreted immunosuppressive cytokine, TGFβ. Lastly, we are
including a tEGFR safety switch so that the clinical product can be rapidly eliminated in vivo in case of severe
side effects. Efficient gene delivery of such a large cassette is made feasible by using the Tc Buster transposon
system, which can stably integrate transgenes as large as 10 kb with an acceptable copy number and a superior
safety profile compared to viral transduction. Transposon-based gene delivery also circumvents the long
manufacturing timelines and bottlenecks that beset viral methods. We are adapting the armored split CAR to
treat epithelial ovarian carcinoma by targeting the tumor antigens mesothelin (MSLN) and chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4). These antigens are overexpressed in at least 40% of ovarian cancer patients and are
associated with poor outcomes. We will test our armored split CAR in vitro using a co-culture target cell killing
assay with ovarian cancer lines that are single- or double-positive for MSLN and CSPG4. We will test how well
the engineered cells resist exhaustion in a serial killing assay in which T cells are exposed to antigen in co-
culture over ~14 days and multiple passages, then assessed for relevant activation and exhaustion markers. We
will also test the tEGFR safety switch by culturing the cells with the inducer, cetuximab, and measuring selective
lysis of engineered cells. Lastly, we will assay tumor killing by the armored split CAR in a mouse model of ovarian
cancer. These experiments are designed to collectively demonstrate efficacy of our product under stress
conditions and will lead into anticipated Phase II preclinical studies to assess toxicity and safety."
10920435,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and the Need for Advanced Treatment: AML is a prevalent hematological
malignancy in adults, with a 5-year survival rate of only 32%. While approximately 32,000 AML patients are
diagnosed annually in the US today, projections suggest this will rise to 36,000 by 2027. Current treatments,
such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, have limited applicability due to high morbidity and treatment-
associated mortality.
The Problem of Immune Evasion: AML cells employ immune evasion tactics, notably up-regulation of co-
inhibitory ligands like Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), which results in exhausted and non-functional T cells,
thwarting an effective anti-cancer response. Current immune check-point therapies using anti-PD1 and anti-PD-
L1 antibodies are ineffective in AML patients.
Solution - Development of ANT308-Fc3 Fusion: Cambium Oncology is a biotech start-up developing novel
immunotherapeutic drugs to treat cancer. Cambium Oncology’s research indicates that roughly 30% of AML
cells over-express VIP, which dampens T-cell activation. Cambium Oncology has a worldwide exclusive license
to patents covering VIP-receptor antagonists from Emory University. A peptide-based VIP-receptor antagonist,
VIPhyb, showed promise in pre-clinical studies but had a limited potency and a short half-life. Cambium Oncology
used in silico screens and in vivo testing to identify a novel VIP-receptor antagonist, ANT308, which, when fused
to the Fc region of the IgG protein, became ANT308-Fc3 fusion, Cambium Oncology’s lead candidate drug.
ANT308-Fc3 fusion exhibits enhanced potency against pre-clinical mouse models of AML with both high and low
levels of VIP expression. The work's future impact is increased by applying this approach to other cancers.
SBIR Phase 1 & 2 Objectives: Phase 1 will determine ANT308-Fc3 fusion's potency in human T cell activation
(Aim 1), its anti-leukemia activity in mice (Aim 2), and its stability and pharmacokinetics (Aim 3). Phase 2 will
focus on in vivo toxicology (Aims 4 & 5) and pharmacodynamic studies to identify responsive biomarkers for
clinical trials (Aim 6). The SBIR fast-track proposal aims to develop an IND package to submit to the FDA
supporting a phase 1 clinical trial of ANT308-Fc3 fusion in AML. The SBIR team is experienced in anti-cancer
immunology and drug development and is led by Dr. Gary Altman, Ph.D., a business executive with experience
in biotech start-ups and obtaining FDA approval for IND pharmaceuticals. The proposed project aims to advance
ANT308-Fc3 fusion as a first-in-class immunotherapy to enhance treatment outcomes for AML patients."

Rates of physical inactivity among people with physical disability (PWD) are significantly higher than in
the general population. PWD have less access to indoor and outdoor physical activity (PA); get less
unstructured PA across the day; and their incidence of chronic health conditions are substantially
higher than in the general population. Thus, there is a strong and growing need to provide
opportunities for PWD to achieve higher levels of regular physical activity.
One potential solution for improved exercise access is home exercise equipment, which if integrated
with engaging, interactive user experiences such as virtual workout environments, group classes, and
social networking, has been proven an effective means for people to participate in a wide range of
personal exercise programs. Exercise equipment supporting these functions is widely available for the
general public. Unfortunately, although a variety of simple, accessible home-based exercise devices
are available, few cost-effective accessible options exist that include these valuable features. In other
words, PWD are often denied the health and wellness opportunities available to the general public in
the form of interactive, engaging exercise.
Vortant Technologies and consortium partner UAB National Center on Health, Physical Activity and

accessible exercise in virtual workout environments, social network connectivity, online group exercise
participation, and will provide quantitative measurement and feedback of workout intensity and effort.
In Phase I, we will expand upon an experimental, patent-pending technology we’ve used to measure
generated power and speed on one example exercise device. The team will further develop the
prototype to upgrade two simple, commonly-available accessible exercise devices. Connecting to an
existing online virtual-workout environment, we will obtain expert therapist feedback, then quantify
functionality, usability, potential affordability, and user preferences with a group of end users at UAB."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), including closed-head injury (CHI), is a leading cause of disability in the United
States. Chronic neuropsychiatric comorbidities are associated with TBI, including depression, anxiety, and social
withdrawal, however our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these sequalae remains extremely
limited. Exacerbating this issue is a lack of any FDA approved pharmacotherapies for TBI. Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders; however, these
drugs typically fail to achieve desired efficacy in individuals with TBI. Serotonin (5-HT) is a monoaminergic
neurotransmitter linked to the etiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and
altered social function, however the effects of various forms of TBI on 5-HT neurotransmission are not well
understood. Using a preclinical model for TBI/CHI, we have discovered significant alterations in 5-HT levels and
signaling that originates from 5-HT neurons located with the raphe nucleus (RN). RNA sequencing analysis has
revealed significant repression in the expression of transcripts related to the identity and function of specific 5-
HT neuron subpopulations within the RN following TBI. Using informatics-based analyses combined with
immunohistology, we have identified a transcription factor (TF), neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF/REST),
novel in the context of mammalian 5-HT neurons, that we hypothesize drives alterations in function and/or identity
of specific subpopulations of 5-HT neurons. This is a remarkable as aberrant 5-HT neuron activity canonically
drives the generation of behaviours related to neuropsychiatric disorders, and 5-HT neuron subpopulations are
critically dependent on the maintenance of their basal transcriptional profiles to maintain their identities and
function. Specifically, we hypothesize that NRSF activity within 5-HT neurons following TBI, alters the functional
landscape of these neurons, driving aberrant behavior states associated with the generation of neuropsychiatric
disorders. Our Objectives are therefore to determine the cell specific transcriptional alterations occurring within
defined 5-HT neuron subpopulations following TBI; delineate the roles of NRSF within 5-HT neuron populations;
and determine whether increases in NRSF expression and activity underly altered 5-HT signaling and behaviors
following TBI. To pursue these objectives, we have three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Identify and characterize TBI-
induced alterations in the transcriptional identity of specific RN 5-HT neuron subpopulations; Aim 2: Delineate
the role of TBI-induced NRSF expression within 5-HT neurons on the maintenance and identity of 5-HT neuron
subpopulations; and Aim 3: Determine whether the blockade of NRSF signaling within 5-HT neurons ameliorates
TBI-elicited alterations in 5-HT signaling and behaviors reminiscent of neuropsychiatric sequalae. Cumulatively,
work proposed herein will, for the first time, delineate the specific actions of TBI on 5-HT neuron subpopulations
of the RN, experimentally delineate the role of NRSF within 5-HT neurons within the brain and determine whether
NRSF represents a novel candidate for the attenuation of TBI-induced neuropsychiatric complications."

 The overall goal of this program is the development and commercialization of a novel, safe, and effective,
therapy that synergizes with anthracyclines, such as Doxorubicin (DOX, Adriamycin), to maintain or improve
clinical outcome for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as well as significantly decrease long-
term cardiotoxicity-related mortality caused by anthracycline treatment.
 Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide and one of the leading causes
of cancer death among women in the U.S. More than 3.8 million women in the U.S. have a history of breast
cancer, which includes women currently being treated and women who have finished treatment. Over 43,000
women in the U.S. were estimated to die from breast cancer last year. Approximately 15% of all breast cancers
are categorized as TNBC due to the lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). TNBC patients, therefore, do not respond to
hormonal breast cancer therapies or medicines that target HER2. Although new therapeutic options for TNBC
are emerging, systemic anthracycline chemotherapy, notably DOX, remains the standard of care for TNBC due
to its superior clinical efficacy. However, DOX and other anthracycline-based therapies result in dose-dependent,
progressive cardiomyopathy. The leading cause of mortality for breast cancer survivors is heart failure often
observed years after cessation of treatment. Breast cancer patients with preexisting heart disease or risk factors
for heart disease become especially prone to the delayed cardiotoxicity. The development of a therapy that
provides protection against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy and has synergistic anti-tumor activity in TNBC
patients would be highly significant.
 NovoMedix has developed safe, orally-available, small molecules that have dual activity acting as both
specific mTORC1 inhibitors and allosteric AMPK agonists. These novel compounds have demonstrated
cardioprotective and anti-cancer activity in multiple in vivo studies. NovoMedix, in collaboration with Dr. Salloum
and Dr. Das at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), has shown that an NM lead compound potentiates the
anti-tumor effect of DOX, while attenuating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and left ventricular dysfunction, in a
TNBC mouse xenograft. We are also completing IND enabling studies which indicate that there are no significant
safety concerns.
 The specific aims for this project are: 1) develop and validate methods for analyzing API in dose formulations
and rat and dog plasma, 2) GLP toxicity and toxicology studies in rats, 3) GLP toxicity and toxicology studies in
dogs, and 4) submission and approval of an IND."

Genomic sequencing data is suitable for informing clinical decisions and advancing precision
medicine. While fresh-frozen tissues are the gold standard for next-generation sequencing, only
fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are widely available in clinical workflows. The
fixation process enables a readily available, cost-effective resource repository with preserved
morphology and cellular data. However, extraction after fixation frequently yields low quantities of
degraded nucleic acids (NAs). The quantity and quality of nucleic acids can be improved during
extraction, however current workflows remain highly dependent on manual methods that are
labor-intensive, time-consuming, and vary in quality by operator skill.
Extracting nucleic acids from FFPE samples requires robust protocols with the ability to maintain
consistent performance. The translation from manual to reliable automated methods will be crucial
to advancing the field. In Phase I, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for extracting NAs from
FFPE using our microfluidic modules in combination with well-established sample prep
chemistries. In Phase II, we will fully automate the fluid processing from module to module using
our sample prep automation platform, NAxtract."
10935310,"PROJECT II: Summary/Abstract
 Pathological alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) accumulates in neurons as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites
(LNs) in Lewy body diseases (LBD) including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), PD
with dementia (PDD), and in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in multiple system atrophy
(MSA). Cognitive deficit is common in LBD and >50% of cases have Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs) but how Alzheimer’s disease (AD) co-pathology contributes to LBD is not entirely clear. This diversity of
aSyn pathology in brains of neurodegenerative disease patients supports the strain hypothesis of
synucleinopathies wherein pathological aSyn adopts different conformations or strains that drive clinical and
pathological heterogeneity of these disorders. aSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) has been widely used to study
these neurodegenerative diseases, but recently, we revealed that they do not fully recapitulate the biological
behavior of LBs [1]. Significantly, we have purified and successfully amplified LBs from human brain,
demonstrating that the pathological phenotypes observed in cultured neurons is maintained during the
amplification process. Thus, our application will provide a more in-depth characterization of aSyn ultrastructure
from different pathologies and decipher how these entities are internalized and hypothetically deregulate
lysosome function. We will use a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to
determine the molecular signatures of aSyn strains and elucidate the mechanisms of amplified LBs designated
as LBs-P1 and PFFs and to explain why they have different seeding abilities. By identifying aSyn signatures, we
will be able to confidently determine the molecular mechanism necessary for their internalization.
 Project II’s studies will provide unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture and
biological activity of aSyn derived from human brain tissue of DLB, PD and AD patients, allowing us to
better understand the heterogeneous nature of the synucleinopathies."
10935312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Project IV: In Vivo Dissection of Genetic Modifiers on Different Stages of Synucleinopathy
Lewy body diseases (LBDs) are defined by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions containing misfolded alpha-
synuclein (aSyn). Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are also prominent in ~50% of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) patients. Postmortem studies of individuals with LBDs show that LB/LN distribution and burden in the
central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems (CNS, PNS, ENS) closely parallels disease progression. Despite
a clear link between aSyn pathology and neurodegeneration, the mechanisms that combine to give rise to the
stereotypical non-uniform evolution of pathology observed during LBD progression remain unresolved. In
particular, there is limited knowledge of how the majority of the >90 genetic risk factors currently identified for
LBD modulate susceptibility to disease and contribute to the clinical heterogeneity observed in LBDs. We
hypothesize that this clinical heterogeneity likely results from interactions between emerging aSyn pathology and
host genetic background. Endo-lysosomal proteins are highly represented in LBD risk loci and our recent work
has demonstrated that two risk genes TMEM175 and GPNMB modulate aSyn pathology through different
functions. We postulate that different endo-lysosomal LBD risk genes, although ubiquitously expressed, may
exert distinct effects during prodromal vs. advanced stages of disease. We will address these central questions
by examining the effects of TMEM175 and GPNMB gene dose on outcome in mouse models of LBD, where
synucleinopathy is seeded into different circuits representative of early vs. advanced LBD. Using aSyn fibril-
based models we previously developed, we will interrogate both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous
contributions of genetic factors on disease progression by comparing the pattern of pathological aSyn spread,
degeneration and subsequent phenotypes between following inoculation of aSyn PFFs or human LBD-derived
aSyn to different in vivo circuits that recapitulate REM-sleep disturbances that characterize prodromal LBD, or
motor and limbic typically representative of later LBD stages. For each target, animals will be compared at
multiple timepoints using behavioral, histological, and in silico modeling tools, thus identifying the mode and time
window of influence for each specific LBD risk gene. Project IV’s studies therefore extend the work of Projects I,
II and III into a whole-animal context, allowing for in vivo modeling of the roles key genetic modifiers and
aSyn strains play in the spread of synucleinopathy, at different stages of disease."

The Biorepository/Pathology Core will collect and distribute clinically annotated human biospecimens related to
ovarian cancer and will provide pathologic expertise and support for tissue-based analyses for investigators in
the Johns Hopkins-University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) Ovarian Cancer SPORE. The main resource and
operation of this Core will be based on the current Gynecologic Cancer Biorepository (GCB) Bank that has been
a co-joint operation among the JHU Oncology Center, the Kelly Gynecologic Oncology Service in the Department
of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and the Division of Gynecologic Pathology. The GCB bank was established in
2000 and expanded through the support of a US DoD-sponsored program project and subsequently by the DoD-
sponsored Ovarian Cancer Consortium Program. The GCB supports the current Ovarian SPORE Program and
the on-going NCI Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) studies at JHU.
The Cellular Therapy Tissue Facility (CTTF) at UPENN will provide all tissue procurement and processing for
Project 2 (at UPENN) and will procure and process tissue to support Projects 1 and 3 at JHU. The CTTF collects
and processes fresh tumor tissue acquired directly from the operating rooms at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Hospital, as well as from external institutions, including Chester County Hospital.
Tissue will be shared between JHU and UPENN, as well with other collaborating institutions. Thus, the Ovarian
Cancer SPORE Biorepository/Pathology Core will incorporate and build on a pre-existing infrastructure. In the
last few years, the Repository has been expanded to include expert diagnostic pathology and molecular
pathology consultation to investigators, including guidance for quantitative digital image analyses-guided
molecular studies of tissues. Specimens are collected under the supervision of pathologists with expertise in
gynecologic pathology, in close collaboration with gynecologic oncology surgical colleagues. Clinical information
for subjects enrolled in our clinical protocols is entered into a password-protected web-based tracking system,
which follows the recommendations of the National Research Council. A review mechanism is in place for
prioritization of distribution of requested resources to investigators within and external to this Ovarian Cancer
SPORE."
10935410,"Project Summary - Computational and Biostatistics Core
The Computational and Biostatistics Core (CB Core) serves as a pivotal resource within the context of the
Ovarian Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE). Our overarching mission is to ensure the
availability of essential computational expertise, software, and data infrastructure to empower the successful
execution of the SPORE mission. In recognition of the unique collaboration between investigators at both Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), where each SPORE project represents
a partnership between these institutions, the CB Core fosters collaboration and partnership between biostatistical
staff at both institutions. This strategic placement offers numerous advantages, streamlining access to critical
resources and minimizing redundancy. A hallmark of the SPORE program is the convergence of recurring
analytical themes across projects, including the analysis of high-dimensional data, the discovery of genome-
based predictors, evaluation of immunologic endpoints, examination of in vivo treatment studies, and the
assessment of treatment effects on biologic targets. The CB Core promotes a cohesive and unified approach to
these common analyses and facilitates the development of a single, standardized strategy for data storage,
management, and dissemination. Of note, the Core in collaboration with the Biostatistics Division in both JHU
and UPENN Cancer Centers will provide a suit of computational expertise for all SPORE investigators.
Furthermore, the CB Core's integration of biostatistics and bioinformatics support positions its members ideally
to cultivate interdisciplinary interactions among projects, nurturing the vital bi-directional exchange between
fundamental research and clinical science.
 In pursuit of these goals, the CB Core has delineated three core aims: (1) Comprehensive Biostatistical and
Bioinformatics Support: We provide essential consultation and support to all SPORE projects, collaborating
across a spectrum of activities, from data acquisition and quality control to data analysis and results
interpretation. (2) Ensuring Study Integrity and Rigor: We are committed to upholding the integrity of research
conduct, supporting investigators in sample selection, data collection methods, bias control, and early stopping
rules for safety and futility, particularly in clinical trials. (3) Facilitating Secure and Efficient Data Storage and
Management: We champion robust data management practices, safeguarding data integrity, ensuring patient
protection, and enabling efficient research execution, while facilitating data sharing and dissemination within the
scientific community.
 The CB Core's alignment with the overarching goals of the SPORE program positions it as a driving force
in advancing translational research. Through our multidisciplinary expertise, we are dedicated to elevating the
quality of quantitative analyses, enhancing research rigor, and optimizing data management practices. The CB
Core envisions a future where it continues to play a central role in propelling the frontiers of translational
research within the SPORE program, contributing to breakthroughs that benefit patients and the broader
scientific community alike."

Infants born prematurely are predisposed to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury such as periventricular leukomalacia
(PVL), resulting in developmental disturbances to the thalamus, white matter, and cerebral cortex. As a
consequence, survivors of PVL frequently demonstrate visual impairments to varying degrees. Because the
thalamus is critical to visual processing, visual dysfunctions may be more severe if the thalamus is affected as
a consequence of the HI insult. Yet, the effects of PVL on the developing thalamo-cortical network are unclear.
In particular, it is currently not known how aberrant thalamo-cortical connectivity or altered volume of thalamic
nuclei contribute to the deficits in visual processing that are commonly observed in individuals with PVL. To
this end, the overall goal of the current study is to address the hypothesis that visual perceptual processing
deficits may be more severe in individuals with PVL who have decreased volume of visual thalamic nuclei,
distinct changes in myelination of thalamo-cortical networks, or atypical thalamo-cortical connectivity. We have
developed a cutting-edge multimodal MRI approach consisting of morphometric analysis of individual thalamic
nuclei, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), myelin water
fraction maps, and network connectivity analyses that will be used in conjunction with a battery of tests of
visual perceptual functions to determine the link between thalamic neuronal loss, thalamo-cortical connectivity,
and visual perceptual processing abilities. A total of 36 individuals with PVL will be recruited, along with a
cohort of 36 typically-developing controls. A rigorous statistical plan will use multiple levels of analysis to
investigate the differences in behavioral and neuroimaging variables between individuals with PVL and
controls, as well as the correlation between outcome measures. A series of regression analyses will evaluate
the associations of neuroimaging variables with PVL and functional vision. Models will also consider the effects
of age and gender on neuroimaging and behavioral outcomes. The unique combination of neuroimaging
modalities utilized in this proposed study will provide complementary insight regarding the complex interplay
between preterm HI damage in PVL and the resulting changes in thalamic development, and ultimately relate
these findings to visual perceptual deficits. This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact of PVL
on the establishment and myelination of the thalamo-cortical networks involved with visual perceptual
processes, providing evidence-based biomarkers that can be used to evaluate future therapeutic approaches."

Although undergraduate research training programs have made progress in engaging underrepresented
minority (URM) students in biobehavioral science, disparities in the community college-to-university pipeline
remain given the focus has been on undergraduates at 4-year universities despite the fact that URM students
are more likely than non-URM students to enroll in and receive part of their training at a community college
(CC). The purpose of the proposed Educational Modules to Broaden Academic Research Cultures (EMBARC)
program is to invite, retain, and support transfer of CC students in the biobehavioral sciences through
innovative, culturally-informed educational modules, rigorously tested through a partnership with the largest
community college district and system of higher education in the country (Los Angeles Community College
District [LACCD], California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office [CCCCO]) and distributed nationwide with
some of the largest professional organizations for URM students in biomedical and behavioral sciences
(Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students [ABRCMS], American Psychological
Association [APA], Society for Advancing Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science [SACNAS]). We
accomplish this through the following specific aims: (1) Develop interactive educational modules using
qualitative (inductive, student-based) and quantitative (deductive, empirical and theory-based) approaches,
providing multiple formats (summer-intensive face-to-face [SI-FTF], annual-year face-to-face [AY-FTF]
facilitated by peer trainers in a Train-the-Trainer [TTT] model, or self-paced online [SP-O]) to maximize
accessibility for CC URM students with a variety of circumstances and needs; (2) Extensively test the
educational modules using experimental and control groups for each presentation format at 9 LACCD
campuses to ensure relevance and validity of the modules as accessible options that increase biobehavioral
self-efficacy, belonging, and transfer; (3) Establish and disseminate our modules through online repositories
designed for students, trainers, and institutions who can access and customize a menu of materials on
scientific skills and scripts that connect students’ passion and vision for their role in biobehavioral research;
and (4) Evaluate the effect of high impact practices, such as mentored conference travel and speaker series, to
strengthen professional networks and scientific belonging by creating access to role models and opportunities
for students to practice and maintain skills learned. EMBARC will result in rigorously-tested, culturally-relevant
training modules across multiple formats, a publicly-accessible repository with a suite of training and workshop
offerings, 99 trained CC facilitators, and the potential to impact 100,000+ students, scientists, and educators
interested in health research through our CC networks and professional organization partnerships."

Over the past several decades, little has changed in reported experiences of faculty of color at predominately
white institutions (PWIs). Underrepresented minority (URM) scholars at PWIs often contend with numerous
challenges that impact their research success and productivity. There are empirically supported problems with
recruiting and retaining URM faculty in academia and the biomedical workforce. Faculty advancement and faculty
research productivity are closely intertwined with psychological wellness. Faculty that are most well, as defined
by having high levels of social support, mentoring, an enhanced sense of belonging at their institution and a
satisfactory work-life balance are the most successful in academia. There are several programs largely focused
on increasing the pipeline from undergraduate to graduate and post-doctoral scholars, leaving a gap in the
training and mentoring needs of new and mid-career tenure-track faculty that often feel isolated and devalued at
their home institutions. Success for URM faculty is largely driven by knowledge coupled with motivation, self-
efficacy, and tangible support. The overarching goal of the Faculty Accomplished Community that Cultivates
Equity and Success in Science (ACCESS) Program, focused on racial/ethnic URM scholars across the career
trajectory at PWIs, is to provide faculty with tools and resources needed to be successful biomedical scientific
leaders. The Faculty ACCESS Program will center wellness and resiliency to equip multiple marginalized
faculty members to persist towards advancing biomedical research despite systemic, institutional, cultural, and
environmental challenges. To this end, the objectives are 1) To provide programming and mentoring for URM
faculty at PWIs centering wellness and focused on skill building to increase rigorous research
productivity, 2) To provide targeted training in grant-writing to increase NIH grant submissions by URM
faculty, 3) To provide a network of funded URM faculty mentors for trainee participants to enhance social
and tangible support. Expected outcomes of the Faculty ACCESS Program are to facilitate skill development
in rigorous research through wellness to increase publication outputs, increase NIH grant submissions and
resubmissions, and support and prepare faculty for the promotion and tenure processes. Additional outcomes
include increased sense of belonging, self-efficacy, reduced stress, and increased social and professional
networks. The overarching goal is to facilitate success of URM faculty and increase retention in the biomedical
research field which is a stated priority for NIH in the fight to end structural racism."

This Fast Track STTR project focuses on developing and demonstrating a high-volume manufacturing
technology for microfluidic oxygenators for applications requiring ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
(ECMO) to treat respiratory failure. Unlike heart disease and cancer, mortality from lung diseases continue to
rise, and a combination of increasing patient populations suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
and acute lung injury associated with respiratory infectious diseases and trauma represent an enormous health
care challenge in the US and across the world. The gold standard treatment for respiratory failure, invasive
mechanical ventilation, carries significant risks of mechanical and biochemical injury to the lung along with
microbial exposure. As a result, ECMO has emerged as an alternative therapy that allows injured lungs to rest,
directly oxygenating and removing carbon dioxide from the blood in an extracorporeal circuit. However, ECMO
use is limited due to the extreme complexity of the blood circuit, which includes a hollow fiber membrane
oxygenator (HFMO) as the functional unit, and bioinspired microfluidic oxygenators capable of more safely
oxygenating the blood have emerged. Our preliminary data demonstrates the first large-scale, extended duration
microfluidic oxygenators in large animals, with distinct safety and efficacy advantages over HFMO, but the
method of construction is very complex and costly. We have engaged with high precision injection molding
companies to identify a path to produce the devices at high volume and low cost, and the focus here is to develop
and demonstrate the injection molded microfluidic oxygenator technology in safety and efficacy studies in a
porcine model. Toward this end, we propose a fast track proposal comprising two phases and four overall aims.
In Phase I, we will 1) Define the target product profile for the adult clinical scale microfluidic oxygenator and
conduct fluid mechanical and thermal modeling to identify the process window required for high yield injection
molding of these devices, 2) Iteratively apply computational models to verify the oxygen transfer and blood flow,
pressure and shear properties of oxygenators resulting from these designs, and 3) Build a casted replica of the
injection molding design to confirm gas transfer performance. Successful identification of a microfluidic
oxygenator design that meets the requirements from manufacturability, cost and performance perspectives will
lead to advancement to Phase II of the program. Here we will 1) Fabricate the injection molds required for
fabrication or larger numbers of microfluidic oxygenators at pediatric and adult scale, and 2) Test these pediatric
and adult scale oxygenators in extended duration studies in porcine models to confirm safety and efficacy in
comparison with HFMO control devices. This demonstration of safety and efficacy, enabled by the high-volume
injection molding process developed on this project, will accelerate the advancement of the technology toward
commercialization and clinical translation for treatment of critically ill patients suffering from respiratory failure."

Vaginal washing is a common practice that many women perceive as hygienic. However, vaginal washing has
been linked to adverse reproductive health outcomes including increased HIV acquisition risk. The mechanism
linking vaginal washing to HIV risk remains unknown. Although it has been hypothesized that disruption of vaginal
microbiota may mediate the relationship between vaginal washing and HIV acquisition, results of studies
evaluating this relationship are mixed. In preliminary studies, we found associations between vaginal washing
and higher concentrations of IL-1 in cervicovaginal fluid and CD4+ T cells from cervical biopsy specimens.
These associations were independent of the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), leading us to hypothesize that
vaginal washing may increase HIV susceptibility by causing persistent activation of the IL-1 pathway, recruitment
of HIV-susceptible target cells, and disruption of the mucosal barrier. The primary objective of this proposal is
to test the hypothesis that a vaginal washing cessation intervention will lower concentrations of soluble
inflammatory mediators in cervicovaginal fluid, lower total immune cells in mucosal tissue, reduce cervical
epithelial disruption, and increase concentrations of protective vaginal Lactobacillus spp compared to control.
These biologic changes have the potential to reduce HIV susceptibility based on substantial evidence that
cervicovaginal inflammation, tissue breakdown, the absence of a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota,
and the presence of suboptimal vaginal bacteria increase HIV susceptibility. To achieve this objective, we will
conduct a randomized controlled trial of vaginal washing cessation in a cohort of women who engage in sex work
in Mombasa, Kenya, and compare the following outcomes between participants randomized to the intervention
versus control arms of the study: i) concentrations of cervicovaginal cytokines, measured using a multiplex bead-
based immunoassay (Luminex platform); ii) concentrations of activated CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting
cells, measured from cervical biopsy specimens using flow cytometry; iii) expression of mucin and tight junction
proteins detected by immunofluorescent staining of fixed cervical biopsy tissue sections and quantified using
HALO image analysis software; iv) presence of cultivable Lactobacillus spp; and, v) concentrations of key
Lactobacillus spp measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Together, these data will provide
mechanistic evidence for a causal link between vaginal washing and HIV acquisition risk and could be used to
support expansion of public health programs to reduce vaginal washing and lower HIV susceptibility among
populations at increased risk for HIV acquisition, such as women who engage in sex work. Furthermore, the
detailed evaluation of the cervicovaginal immune system and mucosa may provide valuable insight into the
mechanisms underlying other adverse reproductive health outcomes linked to vaginal washing, including
increased risk of BV, sexually transmitted infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and reduced fecundability.

Black women are 42% more likely to die from breast cancer than White women. While social,
economic, structural, and cultural factors contribute to this disparity, differences in Black and
White tumor biology are a major driver. New therapeutics that address these biological
differences could resolve the racial disparities in breast cancer survival. Unfortunately,
developing new therapeutics is slow, risky, and expensive: despite an average pre-clinical
investment of $238 million, 95% of new therapeutics fail FDA clinical trials. Keliomics’ patented,
groundbreaking technology is the first that can keep human breast tissue alive in the lab. Using
this breast tissue, we can produce breakthrough models of breast cancer for use therapeutic
development. Unlike existing technologies, our models can be specific to Black breast cancer,
White breast cancer, early breast cancer, and advanced breast cancer. Our long-term goal is to
use these models to develop new therapies for these different subtypes of breast cancer. In our
Phase I studies, we will identify the specific conditions that will generate models of Black breast
cancer, White breast cancer, early breast cancer, and advanced breast cancer. With that
accomplished, in Phase II we will perform large, definitive studies of our breast cancer models
to show that they respond to chemotherapy in the same ways that human patients do. This will
revolutionize therapeutic development for breast cancer by reducing the failure rate and
reducing costs. Our target customers, breast cancer therapeutic developers, have 1,000 new
treatments in development. We estimate this to be a $1-2 billion market opportunity."
10922502,"Summary
The pathway to a successful drug development program is getting more challenging and expensive every year.
Currently, bringing a single therapeutic compound to market starts in early discovery by the broad screening of
tens of thousands of molecules and is usually followed by a series of precise assays to reduce the number of
compounds to a handful of candidates. For these candidates to enter clinical trials, regulatory agencies are now
demanding that the molecular mechanism of action is well understood. Traditionally, that meant years of basic
research using low throughput and complicated assays within a research program. The combination of the
secondary screening assays together with the basic research needed to understand the mechanism of action
can not only be very costly, but also create delays for these new therapeutic agents to reach patients. Currently,
some of the secondary screens measure gene expression levels using transcriptomics, shotgun proteomics as
well as a combination of other omics approaches. Recently, regulation of translation has emerged as a new
mechanism by which drugs can act on cellular functions. For example, the mTOR pathway that regulates cell
proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and other cellular processes, participates in multiple cell-signaling pathways
directly influencing translation of specific mRNAs. Several compounds inhibiting the mTOR pathway have been
identified, including Torin 1 and Sapanisertib, and their mechanism of action have been shown to be through
direct inhibition of translation. Eclipsebio’s eRibo Count will be modified for higher throughput screening of small
molecules and used to commercially deploy a secondary drug screen platform, called eMOA, that will use both
transcriptomics and translatomics to rapidly narrow down the number of candidate molecules of interest. Phase
I will focus on screening for a monoclonal antibody that will reduce signal to noise as well as identify basic
parameters, such as sequencing depth and library complexity, that will allow for successful identification of
candidate compounds with precise mechanism of action information. Phase II will incorporate the Phase I
development and findings to allow drug screening via the eMOA platform to be performed in a 96-well plate,
allowing for mid throughput screening. In addition, eMOA will be used to screen a library of ~1,500 distinct,
clinically relevant compounds with detailed mechanism of action. This will be used to train a machine learning
model that will enable classification of unknown compounds for rapid identification of their mechanism of action.
This drug screening platform will be further developed to include a rich user interface enabling customers to
better understand their new therapeutics. Eclipsebio will provide the eMOA platform as a white-glove service for
biotech and pharma to shorten their research cycle, providing better compounds to patients in clinical trials."
10925218,"Project Abstract: There is growing evidence that targeting genetic risk evaluation (GRE) in families where a
cancer susceptibility gene pathogenic variant (PV) has been identified may be the most cost-effective
approach to reduce the population burden of cancer through prevention. However, there are enormous
challenges to implementing successful cascade genetic risk evaluation in families with hereditary cancer
syndromes. The clinical context of GRE after cancer diagnosis is increasingly complex: As MGP testing has
become the norm, guideline organizations have converged on a list of >40 cancer susceptibility genes in which
PVs are clinically actionable, with wide variability in cancer threat and a myriad of strategies for prevention and
early detection. A daunting challenge is that the cancer patient is responsible for communication and
engagement of relatives for GRE. Despite the shared health threat among at risk relatives (ARRs), the social
and contextual factors that affect family communication are complex. Furthermore, ARRs are dispersed world-
wide and receive care in disparate health care practices. Importantly, there is little incentive and limited
resources for clinicians to engage cancer patients’ relatives and genetic counseling services are increasingly
strained. Given the lack of guidance for families, it is not surprising that most ARRs of cancer patients with PVs
do not undergo GRE. We are uniquely positioned to develop and optimize a direct-to-family virtual genetic risk
evaluation and testing solution offered to all at risk relatives of a population-based sample of adults recently
diagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California who tested positive for a clinically relevant PV. We will use a
unique data infrastructure we pioneered to identify and invite a diverse cohort of cancer patients with clinically
relevant PVs and their families to participate in our study. We propose a 2 x 3 factorial randomized trial of 900
patients diagnosed in 2018-2019 in the two states who had a clinically significant PV detected by genetic
testing that will offer genetic risk evaluation and testing to all 1st and 2nd degree relatives. We will evaluate the
effects of two intervention design features on patient- and relative-centered outcomes: 1) the level of
personalized family genetic risk support (a technology assisted personally tailored patient and family member
education and communication tool called the Family Genetic Health Program, FGHP) vs. the FGHP plus direct
assistance from a human FGHP Navigator); and 2) the price offered to the relatives for the genetic test
(standard $200 vs. $100 vs. $50 per test). We will determine the independent effects of the two design
features on 1) the cancer patient’s appraisal of communication and their engagement with relatives about
hereditary cancer and GRE; 2) the invited relative’s appraisal of decision-making and receipt of genetic testing;
and 3) on the enrolled relative’s completion of formal GRE. We will also explore the effect of the features on
the outcomes across patient SES subgroups. The findings of this study have enormous potential to improve
cancer prevention and early detection in families at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes in the US."

The proposed Measurement Core of this Developmental AIDS Research Center will support researchers to
develop, adapt, and incorporate improved measurement of stigma into their HIV and mental health research to
meet the Center's overarching goal to improve response to stigma as a threat to mental health and individual-
and population-level HIV outcomes. Specifically, the Stigma Measurement Core's goal is to support the
creation and use of rigorous stigma assessment strategies that incorporate quantitative, qualitative, and mixed
methods to better characterize relationships between stigma, mental health - including depression, anxiety,
and drug/alcohol dependency - and HIV outcomes in epidemiologic investigations, intervention research, and
program implementation science. Despite a proliferation of research on stigma within the HIV epidemic, a
significant dearth of rigorous stigma research still exists in key areas of the HIV treatment cascade and in the
roll out of new prevention methods. Additionally, important gaps in our understanding of how to best assess
and characterize stigma persist; for instance, how to harmonize across a multitude of commonly used scales
with populations for whom measures do exist, to create standardized scales when possible without
compromising validity and utility in diverse settings, adapting and validating metrics for other understudied
populations, simultaneous consideration of empowerment factors and a strengths-based approach, and ways
to understand structural stigma including efforts to characterize intersectional stigma from a systems. Further,
while there is a significant body of research on mental health among people living with HIV, rigorous study of
how mental health and substance use may play a role on the pathway between minority stressors including
stigma and HIV outcomes and exacerbate experiences of stigma continues to be needed. Building upon
existing collaborative research between JHU and Emory to better understand stigma and mental health as
drivers of the HIV epidemic, we propose the following Measurement Core specific aims: Aim 1. To expand the
rigorous development, adaptation, and validation of measures of stigma processes occurring at multiple
socioecological levels related to diverse identities, behaviors, and conditions relevant to HIV research. We will
accomplish this aim by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among HIV, mental health, and social science
researchers across our institutions. Aim 2. To promote the use of validated stigma scales in epidemiologic and
intervention mental health and HIV research. We will curate and make available an online, searchable library of
publicly available tools to assess stigma and mental health among populations affected by or at high risk of
HIV. Aim 3. To support the development of analytic skills for characterizing the complexities of the
interrelationships between stigma, mental health and HIV related outcomes.

Surfactant deficiency in preterm infants causes the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). NRDS
directly causes mortality and morbidity. NRDS also increases the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and nosocomial infections. The burden of NRDS has been conservatively
estimated at 1% of all live births, or 1.4 million neonates globally, with a reported case fatality for untreated NRDS
of 57 to 89% in low- and middle-income countries. Although animal-derived surfactants for treating NRDS
developed in the 1980s greatly decreased preterm infant morbidity and mortality, fewer than one-third of
premature infants receive surfactant treatment (based on surfactant sales). Cost constraints and lack of supply
are primary factors for why the remaining two-thirds are not treated. To help fill this need, Molecular Express,
Inc. is completing the late-stage development and preclinical activities for ME-1001, an investigational lung
surfactant comprised of the Super Mini-B peptide, which mimics Surfactant Protein B, the protein component
primarily responsible for lung surfactant activity, as well as the three major lipids of natural human lung surfactant.
ME-1001 is a fully synthetic lung surfactant - i.e., it is not limited by supply as is the case with animal derived
products and has significant advantages in being well-defined with consistent activity, product uniformity, and
economy of manufacturing over currently marketed animal and synthetic lung surfactants. In this SBIR Phase II
application, the Company will perform the pre-clinical activities that are needed to advance ME-1001 into the
clinic. Successful execution of the proposed activities will advance the development of a synthetic lung surfactant
with commercial attractiveness due to advantages over other synthetic and native surfactants in activity and
manufacturing economy. Reduced cost to consumers can potentially translate into broadened surfactant
treatment of NRDS and potentially other indications for use thus exerting a significant impact on improving global
public health."

With the advent of modern antiretroviral therapy, life expectancy in people with HIV (PWH) now approaches that
of the general population. Nonetheless, PWH continue to experience earlier onset and accelerated progression
of complications of aging, including impaired physical function and frailty, which in turn may predispose to
morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life. While exercise is the mainstay of therapy to prevent and to treat
these conditions, we have shown that PWH display a limited clinical and biologic response to exercise as
compared to uninfected controls. We have further found that long-term adherence to exercise among PWH is
limited, even following a supervised exercise intervention. Based on these observations, novel pharmacologic
strategies are critically needed to slow or reverse progression of impaired physical function and frailty in HIV with
the potential for broader translation to other high-risk groups. In the proposed clinical trial, we will test for the first
time the novel hypothesis that tesamorelin as an adjunct to exercise (the current standard of care) will ameliorate
impaired physical function and frailty in PWH. Tesamorelin is a growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone
analogue that is FDA-approved to reduce visceral fat accumulation in PWH with the pivotal Phase III trials led
by our team. Unlike recombinant human GH which leads to non-physiologic, sustained elevations in GH levels,
tesamorelin augments physiologic, pulsatile GH secretion while keeping feedback inhibition intact. Tesamorelin
has a proven track record of safety and efficacy in PWH, having been used clinically for >10 years. As key
Preliminary Data, we have shown that tesamorelin mitigates multiple metabolic features of frailty by increasing
muscle mass, reducing muscle fat, and improving mitochondrial function. In the proposed study, a total of 100
community-dwelling older adults (age 50-80 years) with HIV, ≥1 feature of frailty, and excess abdominal adiposity
will be randomized to tesamorelin or identical placebo in combination with a home-based exercise intervention
for 24 weeks. In a subsequent 24-week extension phase, participants will be monitored off study drug and
supervised exercise to determine the extent to which changes in study endpoints are sustained following
treatment cessation. Outcomes will include measures of physical function (primary endpoint: repeated chair
stand time), muscle mass, exercise adherence and self-efficacy, and quality of life (Aim 1). Biologic effects of
tesamorelin on muscle quality, including muscle fat and mitochondrial function, also will be assessed (Aim 2).
This proposal leverages the complementary expertise of its investigative team in HIV-associated frailty (Multi-PI
Dr. Erlandson, University of Colorado), GH biology (Multi-PI Dr. Fourman, Massachusetts General Hospital),
exercise physiology, advanced imaging, mitochondrial phenotyping, and biostatistics. If our hypothesis is proven
correct, tesamorelin will become the first function-promoting therapy in HIV, which may have key implications for
other high-risk populations. Furthermore, by studying short-term and sustained effects of tesamorelin on physical
function, we will be poised to identify a treatment schedule that minimizes polypharmacy and cost."

Our project aims to investigate the mechanisms behind the loss of Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in
antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated People Living with HIV (PLWH) and the subsequent impact on intestinal
epithelial barrier integrity. Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of HIV infection that persists in PLWH on ART
and is linked to non-infectious comorbidities. Microbial translocation (MT) due to decreased mucosal barrier
integrity is in part responsible for driving HIV-associated inflammation. Therefore, it is critical to understand
mechanisms underlying barrier integrity in ART treated PLWH. ILC3s are essential for the maintenance of the
gut epithelial barrier and are depleted during early HIV infection and are not restored with ART. Decreased
frequency of these cells during HIV infection likely contributes to decreased epithelial barrier integrity leading to
increased MT. Since ILC3s are not susceptible to direct HIV infection and a viable model to study their loss has
yet to be developed, the mechanism behind their loss remains poorly understood. To address this gap in
knowledge, we will use human intestinal explants as a model system to study early HIV infection. These explant
tissues contain ILC3s, epithelial cells, and other immune cells that are susceptible to HIV infection. Our
preliminary data show that these explant tissues remain viable for up to 7 days, can harbor HIV infection and
ILC3s are depleted following HIV infection, providing this as a viable model to study HIV-associated ILC3
depletion. Furthermore, we and others have shown that ILC3s respond to specific bacteria found in the gut
microbiome. This is emphasized as PLWH have a distinct enteric microbiome that is not reverted with ART. To
fully model the intestinal environment during HIV infection, and the subsequent impact on ILC3 function, we will
introduce an HIV-associated microbiome to the intestinal explant tissues. Ultimately, using these explants with
HIV infection and HIV-associated microbiomes will shed light on the underlying mechanisms behind the loss of
ILC3s and the effect on intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. This understanding could lead to the development
of new therapeutic approaches to improve barrier integrity and reduce HIV-associated inflammation and
comorbidities in PLWH."

Sinonasal surgery is extremely common (>600,000 outpatient procedures annually). There are three issues
that can be mitigated with a single device: surgical staff pathogen and toxin exposure, patient blood ingestion,
and periodic obstructed endoscopic visualization. Only blood ingestion has a current solution: packing the
pharynx with absorbent materials with regular associated adverse events. Here we propose the further
development of PharynVac, a balloon aspiration catheter that simultaneously addresses all three of these
problems passively. If successful, PharynVac will decrease surgical staff exposure, reduce post-procedure
nausea, and minimize operative times, potentially becoming a standard sinonasal surgical tool. This Phase I
application would allow for the implementation of GMP (SA1), demonstrated blood and particle aspiration in a
bio-realistic oral/nasal model (SA2), and demonstrated device safety/feasibility in a large-animal sheep model
(SA3). At this point, PharynVac will move into Phase II: FDA engagement and first-in-human clinical trials."
10920891,"Abstract: Calcium phosphate (CaP) deposition is characteristic of several life-threatening kidney and cardio-
vascular diseases; thus, understanding CaP biomineralization is essential for developing new clinical
therapies. Previous studies either analyzed extracted stones from patients or reproduced CaP deposits in
quasi-2 dimensional (D) in vitro systems. However, such approaches fail to capture real-time kinetic
information of mineralization and the 3D cellular microenvironments found in vivo – both of which are essential
for understanding CaP biomineralization. Despite extensive research, mechanisms by which crystals nucleate,
grow, and aggregate into stones are still poorly understood due to a lack of suitable bioanalytical tools that
offer dynamic control over the microenvironments. Using our novel 3D microfluidic (MF)-based workbench that
we achieved previously with unattained precision in controlling dynamic, spatiotemporal biological conditions of
in vivo tubular systems, we will elucidate the origin and mechanisms of calcium mineralization and CaP stone
formation. To recreate in vivo-like conditions, we will use an improved functional 3D-renal tubular system
(RTS) using porous membranes to examine apical↔basal transport. This transformative strategy will allow us
to evaluate/validate the contribution of dynamic microenvironmental cues (e.g., cellular regulations, microscale
hydrodynamics) in CaP stone formation. Our overall hypothesis is that the combined interplay between
tubular epithelial cells and its luminal fluid within these vivo-like RT structures would recapitulate normal and
pathophysiological biomineralization by identifying precise microenvironmental dynamic factors influencing
CaP stone formation. We will systematically evaluate the role of molecular factors (e.g., ionic supersaturation,
stone forming activators/inhibitors) and dynamic microenvironmental cues that underlie CaP stone formation.
We propose to (i) reprogram/recreate a fluidic microenvironment in improved 3D MF devices using polarized
tubular epithelia, and (ii) mimic the in vivo stone-forming conditions by regulating cellular microenvironment
(oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis) within these 3D in vitro microsystems. Our rationale is that the
sequential introduction of factor(s) of stone formation within the perfused constructs will allow us to identify
currently unknown molecular bases of pathophysiological biomineralization. In Aim 1, we will validate the
functional 3D-MFs by examining the endogenous (biomolecules), exogenous (environmental) factors, and the
effects of inner lumen topological defects to determine factors regulating nucleation, growth, and dissolution of
CaP crystals. In Aim 2, we will map and characterize real time step-by-step dynamic growth patterns/rates of
crystal towards stone formation. In Aim 3, we will invoke the processes of fibrosis, inflammation, calcification,
and apoptosis at controlled times to determine the impact on CaP crystal dynamics within 3D tubular structures
in MFs. The proposed study will lead us to i) find strategies to prevent and treat calcium stone disease in
kidney and other organs; ii) gain new insights on the abnormal CaP deposition in soft tissues; and iii)
revolutionize our understanding of calcium biomineralization at the systems level, which will be useful for
clinical interventions in several diseases."

Pathogenic members of the genus, Leptospira, in particular L. interrogans, cause leptospirosis, a zoonotic
bacterial disease of global importance, which affects more than 1 million people annually with a conservatively
estimated 5-20% case fatality rate. Early diagnosis of leptospirosis leading to specific antimicrobial treatment is
thought to prevent progression to severe disease, which is characterized by fever, refractory shock, pulmonary
(and other) hemorrhage, and acute oliguric renal failure. Because the initial manifestations of leptospirosis -
acute undifferentiated fever — are non-specific, the diagnosis of this disease is often missed or delayed. The
potential market for a diagnostic test that identifies early, acute leptospirosis is substantial and an unmet need,
both in terms of clinical care as well as for quantifying the burden of leptospirosis disease that is of prime
interest to public health authorities. In the developing tropical world, leptospirosis affects large swaths of
endemic populations as well as those subject to major weather-related events such as flooding in large urban
settings that occur with predictable regularity. Clinically-actionable tests to diagnose acute leptospirosis remain
unavailable. This proposal aims to address this gap by developing tests capable of rapid, point-of-care,
actionable diagnosis. The premise of this application is that tests based on leptospiral antigen in body fluids
(whole blood, serum, urine) will rapidly and specifically diagnose leptospirosis, leading to improved clinical care
and providing more precise public health data related to burden of disease policymaking. The hypothesis
underlying this proposal is that detecting abundant leptospiral antigens including Virulence Modifying proteins
(VMP) (based on new preliminary data), pathogenic Leptospira-specific LipL32, and Icterohaemorrhagiae
serogroup lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in patient blood will lead to actionable therapeutic interventions and
enable burden of disease studies to justify further leptospirosis product development such as vaccines and
biologics. Specific Aims: 1) Optimize and validate solid phase VMP-based antigen-detection leptospirosis
diagnostic tests. 2) Determine sensitivity and specificity of multiplex antigen-detection solid phase assays,
adding LipL32 and LPS antigen-detection leptospirosis diagnostic tests. The performance of new ELISA and
lateral flow assay prototypes will be determined using in vitro spiked specimens using normal human
blood, serum and urine matrices, ex vivo specimens from acute and chronic animal models, and endemic
country-obtained de-identified leptospirosis human samples. This Phase I STTR project will yield intellectual
property and prototypes of solid phase leptospiral antigen-detecting assays for diagnosis of human
leptospirosis. In a Phase II project, we will scale-up manufacturing for ELISA kits and LFA devices, and expand
field-based clinical testing in humans in established leptospirosis-endemic regions and at US-based clinical
reference laboratories."

Alveolar type II (ATII) cells produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant and restore the epithelium after damage.
Due to their energy-demanding functions and location in the lung, they are highly dependent on mitochondria.
Aerosols produced from e-cigarette devices contain both the particulate and gas phases, nicotine and flavors.
The effect of flavored constituents and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) aerosols on ATII cells is unknown.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is susceptible to damage due to the lack of histones that serve as a barrier against
damaging factors. MtDNA damage can lead to mitophagy and ATII cell death. Our preliminary results
demonstrate the harmful effect of e-cigarette aerosols with fruit and dessert flavors on human and murine primary
ATII cells. DJ-1 has a cytoprotective role and participates in transcriptional regulation and mitochondrial function.
Our hypothesis is that flavored constituents and e-cigarette aerosols with fruit and dessert flavors cause
mitochondrial dysfunction due to the impairment of DJ-1 function leading to ATII cell death. In SA#1, we will
determine mitochondrial dysfunction induced by flavored constituents and e-cigarette aerosols in human primary
ATII cells. The mechanism of DJ-1 cytoprotective function in ATII cells will be studied in SA#2. In SA#3, we will
analyze the respiratory injury risk of flavored constituents and e-cigarette aerosols in wild-type and DJ-1 KO
mice. The current project will fill the gap in our knowledge on the effect of this exposure on primary ATII cells
and respiratory function and can provide novel therapeutic targets for lung regeneration."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur and are associated
with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. Military Veterans are at increased risk for co-
occurring AUD and PTSD, with prevalence rates 2-4 times higher than the general population. Our group
developed an integrated intervention entitled Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders
using Prolonged Exposure (COPE). COPE incorporates empirically validated cognitive-behavioral techniques
for AUD with Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for PTSD. Several randomized controlled trials among Veterans
and civilians demonstrate efficacy of COPE in significantly reducing AUD and PTSD symptoms. Despite the
positive findings, there remains substantial room for improving treatment outcomes and enhancing retention.
Accumulating data suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is a promising candidate to enhance
psychosocial interventions for co-occurring AUD and PTSD, as OT targets neurobiological and behavioral
dysregulation common to both disorders. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the ability of OT to
ameliorate a variety of alcohol-related behaviors (e.g., craving, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, ethanol self-
administration), enhance fear extinction, and promote prosocial behaviors associated with successful
psychosocial treatment outcomes (e.g., trust, social cognition). In a randomized controlled pilot study, our group
found that OT administration prior to weekly PE therapy sessions was safe, well-tolerated, and resulted in
accelerated reduction in PTSD symptoms as compared to placebo. Although the empirical and theoretical
support for augmenting psychosocial interventions such as COPE with OT is robust, no studies to date have
examined this combined approach. The primary objective of the proposed Stage II study is to examine the
efficacy of OT as compared to placebo in reducing (1) alcohol use, and (2) PTSD symptoms among Veterans
receiving COPE therapy. To accomplish this, we will employ a manualized, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral
intervention (COPE); a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design; standardized, repeated
dependent measures of clinical outcomes at multiple time points; and we will leverage close collaboration with
well-established VA clinics prepared to efficiently translate positive findings into practice. In addition, to evaluate
purported neurobiological mechanisms of change, we will employ functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
at pre- and post-treatment and examine AUD biomarkers. The proposed study directly addresses the mission of
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in that it aims to identify pharmacologic
treatments to address co-occurring AUD and PTSD simultaneously. The findings from this study will provide new
information and mechanistic insights to directly inform clinical practice and accelerate the research in this highly
understudied area."

 Chromatin folding is a key step to pack DNA molecules 10,000-fold into a germ cell, but exactly how the
meiotic chromatin is folded and how spatiotemporal folding impacts transcription, chromosome pairing, and
recombination remains largely mysterious. Homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are required
for accurate chromosome segregation. Mis-segregation of homologous chromosomes is a major cause of
miscarriage and birth defects (e.g., Down Syndrome). Three papers have recently reported that high-order
chromatin organizations/domains dynamically shape recombination landscape and germline transcriptomes.
These dramatic chromatin reorganizations depend on chromatin axes because the domain boundary proteins
(e.g., cohesins) are located in the axes. What remains unknown is 1) how meiotic chromosome axis
contributes to meiotic gene transcription, homologous chromosome pairing, and chromosome stiffness via
chromatin reorganization; and 2) whether the meiotic chromosome structure dynamics are sex- and stage-
specific. Our long-term goal is to decipher the meiotic genome organization and its roles in transcription,
homologous pairing, and recombination. The proposed work here will specifically test the overall hypothesis
that meiotic chromosome axes regulate transcriptome and homologous pairing via controlling local and global
chromatin folding in a stage- and sex- dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three
specific aims: Determine whether meiotic chromosome axis regulates 1) transcription and homologous
pairing via reorganizing local chromatin loops 2) chromosome stiffness and pairing by mediating global
chromatin folding. 3) Uncover the temporal and sexual differences of meiotic transcriptomes and chromatin
organization. Method: In aim 1, local chromatin reorganization in spatial domains will be detected by
chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) contact map and the corresponding changes of transcriptional levels
within these domains can be measured via RNAseq. Chromosome interactions will be examined locally by Hi-
C analysis (aim 1) and stiffness will be measured globally by micromanipulation (aim 2). Fluorescent in situ
hybridization will be used to verify the intra- and inter-chromosome interaction found in Hi-C map. Hi-C, single-
cell RNAseq, and micromanipulation will be introduced to reveal the 4D meiotic genome reorganization and
sexual dimorphism of transcriptome and chromatin folding in aim 3. The approach is innovative because
multiple advanced methods including Hi-C, single-cell RNAseq, micromanipulation, nano-newton force
measurement, and quantitative immunocytology will be integrated to generate a more complete picture of
meiotic chromosomes. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a deeper
understanding of chromosome structure and how the structure varies in different stages and genders.
Ultimately, insights from these studies will help us develop diagnosis and treatment for infertility, miscarriage,
and birth defects."

 The care of critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) involves life-or-death decisions.
Ideally, intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians should include patients or their families in shared decision making,
which promotes goal-concordant care, reduces psychological distress for both families and clinicians, and
shortens ICU length of stay. However, racial disparities have been documented in all components of shared
decision making and its associated outcomes. In outpatient settings, clinicians treat Black patients differently
from White patients, providing fewer treatment options, less prognostic information, and less emotional support,
and making assumptions about rather than eliciting patient preferences. Racial disparities in shared decision
making are likely to be amplified in the ICU because clinicians often do not have long-standing relationships with
families, and decisions are time-pressured and highly emotional. To promote equitable ICU care, we must fill
two critical knowledge gaps: (1) we do not fully understand how or why ICU clinicians differently engage Black
and White families in shared decision making about ARF, therefore (2) we do not know how to develop a shared
decision making intervention to reduce racial disparities in SDM for patients with ARF.
 To address these evidence gaps, I propose three specific aims: (1) Compare how ICU physicians engage
Black and White families of patients with ARF in decision making using mixed methods to analyze existing
transcripts of ICU physician-family meetings; (2) Elicit family and ICU physician experiences with decision
making about ARF through focus groups and interviews to identify ICU physician-level barriers to shared decision
making with Black families; and (3) Use a human-centered design approach that is guided by feedback from
families and ICU physicians to adapt and feasibility test an existing shared decision making intervention
(“Jumpstart”) in order to mitigate racial disparities for patients with ARF and their families. This work addresses
a key NHLBI priority to “better integrate palliative care concepts, such as respect for treatment preferences, in
the management of patients” with acute respiratory failure.
 I will be supported by the robust research environment at Duke University and an interdisciplinary team
of dedicated, nationally respected mentors: Drs. Christopher Cox, Kimberly Johnson, Sharron Docherty, and
Meeta Kerlin. At the completion of the proposed project, I will have developed key scientific skills in clinical trials,
health disparities research, mixed methods research, and intervention development. I will also collect preliminary
data necessary for a follow-up R01 Award to conduct a clinical trial of the adapted intervention. In sum, this K23
Award is critical to my career development, and the results will have a substantial public health impact by
promoting equitable shared decision making for patients with acute respiratory failure and their families."

Protein phosphorylation plays a vital role in cellular communication, regulating cellular state and activity. It is a
dynamic process controlled by kinases and phosphatases, which are precisely regulated in healthy cells but
dysregulated in diseases like diabetes, inflammation, and cancer. The study of protein phosphorylation and its
signaling function is a rapidly advancing field, driving methodological and conceptual advancements and
contributing to therapeutic development. In cancer research, protein kinases are frequently deregulated and
have gained significant attention from the pharmaceutical industry. Many FDA-approved cancer drugs target
kinases, and numerous kinase inhibitors are currently in development. This clinical relevance establishes an
exciting connection with translational science.
To support the advancement of knowledge in this field, we seek funding to enable the attendance of trainees,
junior faculty, and underrepresented groups at the 2024 FASEB Summer Research conference on Protein
phosphorylation in healh and disease. This biennial conference, which began in 1983, serves as a key
interdisciplinary gathering, bringing together scientists with diverse expertise. It focuses specifically on the
biochemical mechanisms and fundamental principles of phosphorylation, setting it apart from other conferences
that focus on signaling networks and systems approaches.
The FASEB meeting has a rich history of announcing breakthroughs and aims to enhance and disseminate
knowledge that can lead to improved therapies targeting abnormal kinase activity and protein phosphorylation
in human diseases. The 2024 FASEB Science Research Conference on Protein phosphorylation in health and
disease will highlight cutting-edge discoveries in the field. By uniting disciplines such as structural biology,
biochemistry, systems biology, chemical biology, protein engineering, and medicine, the conference will foster
the interchange of ideas and stimulate new research directions.
Our objectives include promoting communication, collaboration, and career advancement for diverse scientists
in the field. Ultimately, we aim to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing vital
biological processes and identify critical targets for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and cure of human
diseases.

The IKS channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel found in the heart. After a cardiac muscle cell is
depolarized, the IKS channel opens and allows a potassium current to leave the cell, returning it to resting state.
Dysfunction in this channel is associated with numerous acquired and inherited arrhythmias, including long QT
syndome, a leading cause of sudden cardiac death. The channel itself is made of two protein components:
KCNQ1 (Q1), the pore-forming subunit; and KCNE1 (E1), a single transmembrane accessory protein. When Q1
is expressed alone, the channel opens at a negative voltage and conducts a small potassium current, but with
E1 bound, the channel opens at a high positive voltage and conducts a large potassium current. Thus E1 acts
as an intrinsic gating regulator of the channel. The IKS channel is also regulated transiently by phosphorylation
in response to signaling by the sympathetic nervous system. When phosphorylated, the channel opens more
quickly and more often, which leads to an increaed potassium current. This leads to faster cell repolarization and
facilitates increased heart rate. However, the molecular mechanisms of both intrinsic regulation by E1 and
transient regulation by phosphorylation are not currently understood. The goal of this research is to gain a high-
resolution understanding of these mechanisms of regulation. Intrinsically, phenylalanine (Phe) has been shown
to play a role in many ion channel mechanisms because despite being overall nonpolar and largely hydrophobic,
it has a quadropole moment that creates a negative charge in the center of its aromatic ring. This means that it
can behave like an anion and form strong charge-charge interactions with other charged residues, despite being
in the hydrophobic core of the channel. Preliminary data has been found that shows a particular Phe residue in
the IKS channel participates in a previously uncharacterized charge interaction that slows IKS channel response
to voltage, and is thus a key player in intrinsic regulation. This work will characterize this interaction, determine
how E1 binding alters it, and determine the specifc role this interaction plays in regulating IKS channel function.
As well as intrinsic regulation by E1, Q1 is transiently regulated by phosphorylation at two sites on the N-terminus.
Cumulatively, the channel response to phosphorylation is an increase in current, but the mechanism of this
increase is unknown. Additionally, the individual roles of the two phosphorylation sites are not understood. This
research will use caged serine, a modified serine residue that can only be phosphorylated after photolysis of a
bound caging moiety. Encoding caged serine into each of the sites individually and observing the effects of
phosphorylation at each site on the channel will provide this key information about phosphoregulation of the IKS
channel. This work, which will provide mechanistic explanations of intrinsic and transient regulation of the IKS
channel, will pave the way for development of novel therapies for long QT syndrome and other arrythmias
attributed to this channel."

The early life microbiome plays a significant role in health and disease, including immune development and
maturation. Maternal microbiota is a major determinant of infant microbiota. Studies investigating maternal-
infant microbiota transmission and its consequent influence on infant immunity have focused on the bacterial
component. Yet the impact of maternal virome on infant virome is largely unknown, and studies of the virome
in early life are limited. Infants born to mothers living with HIV are more vulnerable to diseases, have stunted
growth, and have altered immunity, including immune activation, even when they are not infected with HIV
themselves. Much work has gone into understanding the reasons for this phenomenon. Given that the enteric
virome is expanded in HIV infection, it is not surprising that our preliminary data show that infants born to HIV-
infected mothers inherit a wider range of viruses than unexposed infants. Thus, similarly to the bacterial
microbiome, the gut virome could also play an important role in modulating immune responsiveness and
growth of infants. We hypothesize that the infant enteric virome is vertically transferred, and the expanded
enteric virome of infants born to mothers who are HIV-infected leads to accelerated immune ontogeny and
activation, which influences the morbidity of infants exposed to HIV. We propose to:
1: Determine the influence of maternal virome on the infant enteric virome and compare the virome succession
in infants exposed and unexposed to HIV through the first 9 months of life. The viromes of matched mother-
infant pairs will be determined via metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid isolated from purified viral particles.
Maternal fecal and vaginal virome composition will be correlated with that of the infants’ gut in the first week
postpartum. The composition of the enteric virome will be compared between infants exposed and unexposed
to HIV during the first week, 4, 15 and 36 weeks of life.
2: Evaluate the relationship between the virome and the bacterial microbiota in infant stool. We will assess the
relationship between bacteriophage and their bacterial targets longitudinally.
3: Evaluate the relationship between the infant enteric virome and intestinal inflammation, immune ontogeny
and linear growth. To test the hypothesis that the expanded enteric virome in uninfected infants exposed to
HIV contributes to greater immune diversity in early life, we will longitudinally assess circulating NK and T cell
ontogeny using CyTOF analysis over the first 9 months of life. To test whether the virome causes altered
immune ontogeny, we will feed infant mice with phages with and without their bacterial hosts and evaluate the
effect on immunity.
Understanding the factors that shape the infant gut virome and its consequent impact on bacterial microbiota,
immune ontogeny and linear growth could facilitate the development of interventions to reduce infant morbidity
and mortality, particularly for those who are exposed to HIV."
10906880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: This study seeks to better understand maternal trauma history as a driver of behavior health
problems in 4-year-old children. We will examine the impact of maternal trauma across four time periods 1)
maternal experience of pre-pregnancy abuse in childhood (when mothers < 18 years), 2) maternal experience
of pre-pregnancy of abuse in adulthood, 3) maternal experience of abuse during pregnancy, and 4) maternal
report of postnatal abuse (after childbirth to time of assessment) on their children’s behavioral problems
(internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Using a lifecourse theory approach within an intergenerational
context, we will test three models to determine whether the effect of maternal trauma 1) depends on the timing
of exposure (Sensitive Period model); or 2) is strongest when it is most proximal to the child outcome
examined (Recency model); or 3) increases with the number of exposures (Accumulation model). A primary
study aim is to investigate how “experience gets under the skin” by examining associations between maternal
trauma history with children’s salivary DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. Finally, we will test whether the
effects of maternal trauma history on child health outcomes are mediated by children’s salivary DNAm profiles
and maternal caregiving sensitivity. Study Design: Building on an existing prospective longitudinal cohort of
Peruvian women, recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy, established as part of a prior NICHD-funded
grant (n = 4,472 live births), the study has well-characterized data on maternal trauma history, maternal lifetime
psychopathology, and extensive data on birth outcomes. This sample has a high prevalence of childhood
maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and other traumas (88% report at least one trauma and 30% report 3
or more traumas), and psychopathology (e.g., 33% PTSD, 26% depression, and 33% generalized anxiety). We
will collect follow-up data on a subset of mother-child dyads (n=1,700). Implications: By examining modifiable
risk (maternal trauma history) and protective factors (maternal caregiving sensitivity), particularly in sensitive
periods of development, and by determining whether and how these factors impact biological systems, this
study can inform future research and interventions to address the significant intergenerational public health
burden of trauma."
10906884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD1), enable CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-
tumor immunity and produce durable responses in a portion of patients with metastatic melanoma. However,
most patients do not benefit from ICI and the underlying mechanisms of resistance remain elusive. The overall
goal of this work is to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to ICI mediated by cancer cells, and develop novel
molecular or immune-based therapies to overcome resistance. Prior work demonstrated that expression of co-
stimulatory protein CD28 on CD8+ T cells is required for efficacy of aPD1, however, we show that expression of
CD28 is frequently absent in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs), including those with preserved
progenitor function. In contrast, all TILs maintain expression of CD2, the most potent alternative co-stimulatory
protein. Indeed, we find that patient-derived CD28- TILs had preserved capacity for proliferation, clonal
expansion, cytokine production and lysis of autologous cancer cells. The ligand of CD2 is CD58, and we
discovered that CD58 was expressed on melanoma cells. The role of the CD58:CD2 axis in anti-tumor immunity,
and response and resistance to ICI is unexplored. In preliminary studies, we established patient-derived pairs of
melanoma cells and autologous TILs. We developed Perturb-CITE-seq, a novel method enabling pooled
CRISPR-Cas9 screens with single-cell RNA-seq and protein readouts. We performed a Perturb-CITE-seq screen
in patient models, perturbing hundreds of genes with putative roles in ICI resistance, followed by co-culture with
TILs and profiled survivor cells that escaped T cell killing. We recovered known mechanisms of cancer immune
evasion and novel ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. In humanized mouse models, loss of CD58 in
tumor cells resulted in impaired T cell infiltration and resistance to adoptive cell transfer (ACT). Additionally, we
observed compensatory PD-L1 upregulation in CD58 loss. Using genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens and co-
immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry screens, we identified a putative regulator of this interaction, CMTM6.
Rescue of CD58 re-sensitized cancer cells to T cell killing, increased T cell activation, enhanced T cell infiltration
in vivo, and abolished compensatory PD-L1 expression. Based on these findings, we will dissect the role of the
CD58:CD2 axis in anti-tumor immunity, cancer immune evasion and resistance ICI resistance in three aims: i)
to determine the mechanisms by which CD58 loss confers cancer immune evasion, ii) to determine the role of
CMTM6 in regulating compensatory PD-L1 upregulation in CD58 loss, and iii) to determine whether aPD1
resistance is associated with an impaired CD58:CD2 axis in patients. We propose to systematically address
these using genetic, biochemical, patient and in vivo models, and multi-modal single-cell genomics analyzed
with novel machine-learning tools. We further test two therapies that overcome resistance to ICI due to defects
in the CD58:CD2 axis. Upon completion, this work will shed light on the role of the CD58:CD2 pathway in cancer
and cancer immunotherapy, and may provide novel avenues for therapeutic development."
10906887,"SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. The majority
of COVID-19 deaths are caused by lung disease characterized by alveolar filling and severe hypoxemia.
Descriptive studies of human patients, animal models and cultured cells have supported numerous pathogenic
mechanisms for COVID-19 lung disease, including direct epithelial cell infection, vascular cell infection and
thrombosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite intense investigation, these hypotheses remain
unproven due to a lack of cellular functional evidence for causality. SARS-CoV-2 infection requires viral binding
of the human ACE2 (hACE2) cell surface protein, and wild-type virus cannot bind mouse ACE2. Existing hACE2-
expressing mice either drive disease through non-endogenous transgenes that do not permit conditional analysis
or fail confer severe illness after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, powerful mouse genetic approaches have
not yet been harnessed to test COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms. To address this gap in knowledge we have
generated new mouse genetic models that (i) express hACE2 from the mouse Ace2 locus at levels sufficient to
confer lethal disease and hypoxia like that observed in human patients, (ii) permit Cre-mediated loss of hACE2
expression to functionally identify cells required to confer COVID-19 disease, and (iii) permit-Cre mediated gain
of hACE2 expression to functionally identify cells sufficient for COVID-19 disease. Our preliminary studies
identify both epithelial cell infection and vascular disease associated with extensive intravascular thrombosis in
the lungs of hACE2 knockin animals. We therefore hypothesize that COVID-19 lung disease arises due to
synergistic infection and/or dysfunction of both lung epithelial and lung vascular cells. To test this central
hypothesis we will (i) use established Cre-expressing transgenes to test the requirement(s) for epithelial and
vascular cell types during COVID-19 lung disease, (ii) use lung slice explants from human and hACE2 knockin
mouse lungs to map the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, and (iii) compare acute and chronic lung responses
to infection by the influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses to identify the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the
exceptional lethality of COVID-19 lung disease. These studies are expected to yield a functional and integrated
understanding of the events that underlie COVID-19 lung disease and provide a solid scientific foundation for
the development of novel therapeutic approaches."

from a Culturally Responsive Evaluation approach, recognizing that culturally defined beliefs and values are
central elements of evaluation. These evaluation frameworks and approach align with the overall program
framework for FIIRRE, the Systems of Career Influences Model that depicts the interrelationship between
systems of organizational policies, practices, and culture and personal choice decisions and their impact on
career advancement. Grounding our evaluation plan in established theory ensures that our approach is
practical, flexible, and comprehensive. The Evaluation Core will accomplish the following aims: (1) Monitor and
evaluate Core activities and provide timely feedback to FIIRRE leadership to improve quality and increase
efficiency; (2) Engage institutional leadership to align FIIRRE and institution-wide evaluation strategies and
activities towards achieving inclusive excellence; (3) Determine the impact and effectiveness of FIIRRE in
achieving its goals, including assessment against benchmarks of culture change, faculty development, and
career advancement; and (4) Engage with FIRST awardees and the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation
Center in building the evidence for implementing and sustaining cultures of inclusive excellence. A variety of
qualitative and quantitative data collection approaches support our work plan, recognizing that flexibility and
feasibility are necessary to optimize participation by key stakeholders (e.g., FIIRRE faculty cohort) and ensure
the sustainability of data collection (and reporting) efforts. The Evaluation Core will actively participate in the
FIIRRE Leadership Team, as well as work closely with the Internal and External Advisory Councils, and
institutional leaders to provide evaluation feedback, assist with adjustment of specific programmatic activities,
and adjust tracking and evaluation processes over time to guide decision-making and accountability. Given the
momentum established by UofSC’s institutional leaders over the past two years towards achieving inclusive
excellence, FIIRRE can serve as the “incubator” to test existing and new strategies and methods that achieve

and continuously improving. It will monitor and track the progress of the program and participants; assess
interventions; map interactions and networks; monitor timelines; deeply examine knowledge, skills, attitudes,
and behaviors; and report progress toward the stated overall aims. These activities have been designed to both
limit any evaluation burden on program participants and ensure that the NURTURE leadership, investigators,
and advisors have a deep view into the complex and layered structure and operations of NURTURE, and can
therefore refine, improve and empower its activities. Program evaluation will be accomplished through the
following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Coordinate with other FIRST programs. The EvalCore will collaborate with the
FIRST CEC and the FIRST awardee institutions to develop and coordinate evaluation activities, reporting, and
cross-institution research metrics and approaches. Aim 2: Develop the evaluation framework and operations
needed to assess the primary outcomes. EvalCore will use well-established strategy, metrics, workflows, and
quantitative and qualitative data measures and sources for evaluation in a systems approach to evaluation and
research. Our approach is based on participatory and utilization-focused assessments that integrate evaluation
data, reflection and feedback from across the system to advance the goal of NURTURE to create inclusive
excellence. This evaluation framework will help NURTURE test the hypothesis that a cohort model of faculty
hiring within a sustaining culture valuing inclusive excellence will achieve significant improvements in metrics of
institutional culture and scientific workforce diversity among biomedical research faculty. Aim 3: Implement
existing formative evaluations, and develop new ones as needed, for continuous improvement. The EvalCore,
in collaboration with the other cores of NURTURE, will employ mixed methods to evaluate the efficacy of the
NURTURE program elements. By exploring how each program element impacts the members of the NURTURE
cohort and the broader Northwestern community, we will adapt program elements as needed to achieve success.
Aim 4: Communicate results for maximum impact. The EvalCore will establish a robust dissemination
infrastructure to drive accountability and transformative impact at Northwestern and beyond. It will provide and
leverage FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) dissemination channels to support
equitable knowledge translation and capacity building for the NURTURE program and its recruited cohort. These
channels will be used to communicate the results of NURTURE and the broader FIRST program."
10927277,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer screening can detect cancer early and reduce mortality. However, high false positive rates and low
sensitivities of lung (LC) and ovarian cancer (OC) screening result in unnecessary surgeries and missed
cancers. Our overarching goal is to develop circulating biochemical biomarkers that reduce the false positive
rate of the CT scan for LC and increase the positive predictive value of OC screening in combination with
CA125 and trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVUS). We hypothesize that LC and OC patients have different antibody
immune responses from subjects with benign diseases that can be explored for detecting cancer and excluding
non-cancer. We will take a systems approach working with 3 types of antibodies: autoantibodies, anti-microbial
antibodies and anti-aberrant glycoprotein antibodies. Our proposal builds on our extensive experience with
cancer biomarker discovery and immunoproteomics technology. Our previous results on autoantibody
biomarkers have been confirmed in blinded PRoBE phase 2 multicenter validation studies. Our results showed
that autoantibody biomarkers are highly specific for cancer; although, multiple autoantibodies are needed for
adequate predictive value. There is increased attention to the role microbes play in cancer vs. benign disease
development, which can be observed by different overall infection rates and / or immune responses to different
individual antigens from various microbes. Aberrant protein glycosylation is a hallmark of LC and OC, and we
will exploit our unique capability to display glycosylated proteins in high throughput. The successful
implementation of our study entails high throughput methods for assessing antibodies at the proteome level.
With EDRN support, we have developed a set of innovative immunoproteomics technologies, namely high-
density nucleic acid programmable protein array (HD-NAPPA), contra-capture protein array (CCPA) and
multiple in solution protein array (MISPA), that, combined with the largest full-length human and microbial gene
collection (DNASU plasmid repository), enable us to study antibodies against the full human proteome,
microbial proteomes and the human O-glycoproteome for antibody biomarker signatures in cancer. Our
previous success, Videssa® Breast, which is a CLIA-certified blood test for breast cancer used clinically with
mammography, includes a panel of both autoantibody markers and serum protein markers. As with Videssa®,
we will also use the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) MultiArray platform to assess reported serum protein
markers for their utility to complement our antibody markers for LC and OC. We will collaborate with experts on
LC and OC screening at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Boston University, MD Anderson Cancer
Center, and German Cancer Research Center, who will also provide access to high quality well-characterized
samples from our target populations. We will perform Phase I (PRoBE) discovery by screening protein arrays
with cancer and control sera for cancer- or control-specific antibodies. Candidate biomarkers for both LC and
OC will be Phase 2-validated using ELISA or MISPA assays."
10927280,"Abstract
 The Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) core of the Arizona State University (ASU) Biomarker
Characterization Center (BCC) has two primary goals. The first is to adapt assays developed in the Biomarker
Discovery Laboratory (BDL) to the commercial assay platform from Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC. (MSD) for
clinical validation. The second goal of the BRL is to participate in larger EDRN collaborative validation studies,
with support for optimization and verification of assays and improvement of diagnostic methods.
 This collaboration between ASU and MSD aims to identify and validate biomarkers related to lung cancer
and ovarian cancer. Serological markers represent a promising class of novel markers for early cancer detection.
These include autoantibodies [AAbs] against aberrant proteins from tumors, anti-glycosylated protein antibodies
(AGPA) against proteins aberrantly glycosylated in cancer, and anti-microbial antibodies against microbial
antigens that differ due to microbial differences between cancer and benign disease. Through replication of
antibody-producing B-cells, these antibodies amplify a signal from antigens at very low concentrations and at an
early stage in tumorigenesis when the corresponding antigens may not themselves be detectable in the
circulation.
 ASU’s Biodesign Institute developed a high-throughput immunoproteomics platform: Nucleic Acid-
Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA), which replaces the complex process of spotting purified proteins with the
simple process of spotting plasmid DNA followed by translation. This platform was used to identify promising
antibody candidates for both cancer types. MSD’s core expertise is development and validation of robust
multiplexed immunoassays (direct analyte detection and serology assays). The present proposal is directed
towards transferring established lung and ovarian cancer biomarkers and biomarkers discovered by the BCC
BDL onto the MSD platform. This platform is appropriate for large-scale validation testing and future clinical use.
Samples will be tested in MSD’s Bioanalytical Laboratory under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and at ASU.
 Up to ten biomarkers per year will be transferred to the BRL. The BDL will perform extensive clinical
validation to downselect markers for both types of cancer. Assays for the final set of approximately ten serology
and/or antigen detection assays will be validated to a level required for a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) and
manufacturing procedures that would support the production of kits for ~10,000 samples will be developed.
 Additional collaborations of the BCC BRL with EDRN members may include development and/or scale-up
of critical reagents such as recombinant proteins or monoclonal antibodies, antibody affinity maturation, protein
assay development, extracellular vesicle detection, nucleic acid detection, multiplex panel development, assay
validation, and sample testing in MSD’s GLP laboratory."
10927285,"Abstract – User Training and Outreach
It is imperative that the users of ALS-ENABLE have the training and information necessary to immediately and
effectively use the mature synchrotron technologies of the Resource. The User Training and Outreach
component of the ALS-ENABLE Resource ensures that individual broad-based training provides a strong basis
for users on the operations and best practices of data collection at ALS-ENABLE beamlines. Safety is of the
utmost importance and begins before beamtime is scheduled: users are required to complete the ALS
Experimental Safety Assessment Form (ESAF) describing their samples and the presence of any toxic or
hazardous materials which is then reviewed by the beamline scientist and the ALS Biological Safety Officer. Prior
to beamtime users receive training from the ALS on the proper use of PPE, cryogen handling, emergency
procedures, storage and safe use of chemicals, and laboratory safety (if applicable). At the beamline, staff
provide on the job training on the safe, efficient use of beamline hardware. Additionally, a multifaceted approach
that incorporates face-to-face onsite training, the use of online and remote materials, and group training is used
to help users achieve their goals. Workshops and seminars will train large groups at once and our unique
“reverse” synchrotron trip provides training at the NIH user’s home institution. Outreach activities are a
fundamental component of informing the scientific community of the capabilities, availability, and modes of
access to the ALS-ENABLE Resource. We will continue to publish results in peer-reviewed journals, participate
in and host meetings and workshops, and strive to reach out to under-represented communities to promote the
Resource, recruit new users, and engage the structural biology community. Specific efforts will be made to
engage and recruit projects from scientists that may not use structural biology as their main technique. A robust
web presence (als-enable.lbl.gov) supports these efforts and provides access to all beamline manuals, training
materials, scientific highlights, and descriptions of the technologies available in the different ALS-ENABLE cores."
10927286,"Technology Operations Core 1: Abstract
Technology Operations Core 1 (TOC1) of the ALS-ENABLE resource supports the rapid response to
macromolecular crystallography diffraction data collection. It joins forces, and groups together the effort and
expertise of three world-leading groups operating macromolecular crystallography beamlines at the ALS. They
are the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology (BCSB), the Molecular Biology Consortium (MBC) and the
University of California at San Francisco. The ALS-ENABLE facility includes eight macromolecular
crystallography beamlines with a broad range of capabilities to address all structural biology projects. NIH
investigators can request beamtime and, following a positive review, will get beamline access within a month.
Three modes of access are made available to users under the rapid response in TOC1. The vast majority of
users take advantage of the remote access capabilities available at all beamlines. Users ship their samples
and the ALS-ENABLE staff will prepare the beamline and load users’ samples in the robotic system. The
investigators will then operate the beamline from their home or institution for the acquisition of diffraction data.
A new mode of access proposed in this effort is to use the fully automated data collection pipeline. Here,
diffraction data are acquired automatically without manual intervention. This has been exploited heavily in
fragment-based drug discovery campaigns in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. The automated data
collection pipeline has shown to be powerful and acquire diffraction datasets on crystals that appears to be
unusable. Users can also rely on the collaborative crystallography programs. More often novice structural
biologists will need help in their effort to determine the structure of biological molecules. Collaborative
crystallography relies on expert scientists available from the ALS-ENABLE staff to collect diffraction data on
their behalf. The range of provided expertise can start with guidance with crystallization up to publication of the
results. The collaborative crystallography program will also support the automated data collection pipeline by
identifying challenging projects that may need manual intervention. This will ensure that users are getting the
best diffraction data from their precious samples. Altogether TOC1 intends to quickly respond to the need of
macromolecular crystallography NIH investigators for access to diffraction data at the ALS."
10927289,"Project Summary TOC2: High quality and high throughput Small Angle X-ray Scattering
A sequence scale structural perspective coupled to an understanding of how these structures change during
function is fundamental for mechanistic insights into bio-molecules and can be obtained by combining Small
Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) with high-resolution snapshots of structure. This strategy has been recently been
greatly enabled with the advent of accurate structure prediction from sequence. Furthermore, efficiently
identifying the conditions and constructs by SAXS that promote the greatest structural homogeneity in
conformation and assembly is hugely advantageous to capture a high-resolution snapshot whether from electron
microscopy (EM), macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The TOC2
funded SIBYLS group has been instrumental in developing a productive SAXS community and advancing
powerful SAXS tools for structural biology.
By applying and improving a pipeline that promotes planning, scheduling, executing, analyzing and distributing
results for for high-throughput (HT-SAXS) and size exclusion coupled (SEC-SAXS) SAXS, SIBYLS is increasing
SAXS utilization by biomedical investigators many-fold. TOC2 at the SIBYLS beamline has explored a unique
platform for collecting HT-SAXS data that has had an important impact on protein engineering. The system was
designed with a large capacity to increase throughput. Over the course of this renewal we will take advantage of
this capacity. TOC2 has also implemented an SEC-SAXS program modelled after the mail-in/hand-in HT-SAXS
program. SEC-SAXS is best deployed at synchrotrons as the collection speed matches sample elution speed.
SEC-SAXS has had a large impact in the characterization of transient complexes. The increased efficiency and
largely remote data collection is particularly important during the pandemic and in the build up to synchrotron
shutdowns.
Over the next five years through ALS-ENABLE, TOC2 will provide efficient access to SAXS analyses for
hundreds of biomedical investigators. The advanced technologies TOC2 employs will generate abundant data
that will require analysis by a combination of automated scripts, web applications developed in TOC2 and those
developed by peers. We will make use of shared resources and an economy of scale through ALS-ENABLE to
support programming of advanced web tools delivering a pipeline that relies heavily on a robust computational
infrastructure to organize, process, and store data. By following through on TOC2 aims ALS-ENABLE will
increase the value of SAXS experiments and increase accessibility – providing quality in quantity."

molecular, immunological, translational, and epidemiological cancer research.
Breast cancer-specific efforts that have and will support SPORE aims include centralized tissue and specimen
banking, receipt and processing of breast-related human specimens including: freshly procured, snap-frozen
and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block specimens, preparation of tissue microarrays (TMAs), cell
microarrays, morphological evaluation and morphology-based assays (immunohistochemistry,
immunofluorescence, in-situ hybridization, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization), assay development &
training, immunogenetics, flow-cytometry, and digital imaging and image analysis for spatial quantification of
molecular analytes in intact specimens. Project # 1, CBCS, has used the Core for over two decades with
ascertainment of tumor samples from hospitals across North Carolina, demonstrating consistent success with
CBCS tumor block accrual of over 95%. Projects #2, #3, and #4 will specifically use the Core to track samples
from clinical trials with special provisions for obtaining fresh tissue in protocol-specific procedures. Additional
support for Projects #2, #3, and #4 will include procurement of fresh tissue from human and PDX samples to
flow sort cells for assays and the identification of regions of interest in tumors and the tumor microenvironment
for spatial transcriptomic analysis."
10918654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Viral entry tropism, largely governed by receptor specificity, is a major determinant for virus cellular and tissue
tropism, pathogenesis, and host range. Alteration in receptor specificity could be closely related with viral
pathogenesis, such as the process of “coreceptor switch” in HIV infection that is associated with faster
progression to AIDS, and may contribute to host-jumping, as exemplified by coronavirus and influenza virus.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying viral receptor usage alteration is a fundamental gap in
knowledge. Recent studies of our group elucidated the evolutionary process of coreceptor switch in natural HIV
infection. The findings demonstrate that “driver mutations” responsible for coreceptor switch can confer complete
escape to V3 broadly neutralizing antibodies. These observations, together with the fact that the receptor binding
regions of many viruses overlap with antigenic epitopes, prompted us to propose a potentially paradigm-shifting
concept termed “escape by shifting”. The central hypothesis is that for viruses with entry pathway flexibility, entry
pathway alteration can function as an evolutionary mechanism of immune evasion. We coin the term “receptor
utilization space” to describe the repertoire of receptors that can be used by a particular virus. Under immune
pressure, a virus explores its “receptor utilization space” while exploring the sequence space and fitness
landscape. Immune escape mutations and compensatory mutations could both confer novel receptor usage,
which functions as a mechanism to maintain viral entry capacity while evading host immune recognition. We aim
to test this novel concept by elucidating the biological mechanisms for HIV coreceptor switch. To this end, we
will leverage a highly unique opportunity of the RV217 cohort which has longitudinal samples from participants
identified in acute infection from East Africa and Thailand. The “escape by shifting” concept will be tested through
three specific aims: 1) Determine the moment of coreceptor switch by identifying driver mutations in participants
infected by different HIV subtypes. 2) Characterize the function of driver mutations in evading autologous
neutralizing antibodies. Participants who did not undergo coreceptor switching will be used as controls to better
understand viral and host factors governing coreceptor switch. 3) Elucidate the impact of coreceptor switch on
CD4 hemostasis, reservoir landscape, and immune reconstitution on ART. The proposed work is significant for
both the HIV field and general virology. It is expected to answer a long-standing question in the HIV field which
has direct implications for HIV pathogenesis, therapeutics, and functional cure. While we use HIV as a model,
the central hypothesis of the “escape by shifting” concept is generalizable to viruses with flexible entry pathways.
Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral entry pathway evolution under the
immune pressure, which has direct relevance for viral pathogenesis, transmissibility, as well as therapeutic and
vaccine design. In summary, this application has the potential to exert long-term impact in general virology."
10920167,"Project Summary/Abstract
31 million Americans suffer from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with numbers growing in the elderly and
children. Also, 84.1 million prediabetic Americans risk becoming diabetic. Current pharmaceutical therapies
are expensive and have negative side-effects with poor patient compliance. Bariatric surgery provides a high
initial complete, or partial T2DM remission. However, these procedures are complex, prone to potentially
harmful side-effects, treatment durability is questionable and typically indicated only for morbidly obese
patients unresponsive to pharmaceutical therapy. We propose Diabetes Targeted Dual Neuromodulation
Therapy (TDN Therapy), an innovative approach to blood glucose reduction. TDN implantable pulse
generators (IPGs) block conduction of the hepatic branch of the Vagus nerve w/ High Frequency Alternating
Current (HFAC) while stimulating the celiac branch. This SBIR Phase I study will successfully demonstrate
feasibility of TDN Therapy for treatment of T2DM by validation of our hypothesis that decreased TDN
HFAC signal amplitude will maintain glycemic control. Specific Aim 1: We have demonstrated that a TDN
HFAC amplitude of 8 mA increases glycemic control in alloxan treated swine. However, the minimum current
amplitude for effective TDN is unknown. A safe and efficient commercialized TDN device depends heavily on
an optimal HFAC current amplitude. We propose testing HFAC TDN amplitudes below 8 mA in alloxan treated
swine during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Feasibility: Demonstrated by determining if lower HFAC
amplitudes than 8 mA can maintain TDN efficacy. Aim 2: Low HFA current amplitudes are advantageous to
decrease off-target effects as well as increase device efficacy. Feasibility: Demonstrated by preservation of
euglycemia with downward HFAC titration. Aim 3: Autonomic function changes precede T2DM development
and are resolved following effective treatment. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a surrogate for vagal tone. Lower
HRV precedes cardiovascular T2DM co-morbidities and has been observed in diabetic swine. Feasibility:
Demonstrated by increasing HRV with TDN during Aim 1 and Aim 2 experiments. Aim 4: Patients report
esophageal sensations and heart burn when receiving monopolar HFAC delivered to the abdominal vagal
trunks. This is presumably due to stray current exciting esophageal smooth muscle. Feasibility:
Demonstrated by determining thresholds of TDN induced esophageal contractions & heart rate changes.
Demonstrating minimal to no acute cardiovascular effects would set TDN apart from all other VNS approaches
and give TDN commercial advantages. We envision the future commercial TDN device with Bluetooth
capabilities allowing patients device/therapy interaction through smart devices with a possible closed-loop
system to work with non-calibrating continuous glucose monitors and therapy refinement with the use of AI
and machine learning."
10919305,"Project Summary:
Arthritis is a significant economic and health burden in the United States which is estimated to exceed $394
billion in healthcare costs by 2030. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting over 32
million adults in the United States and represents over 25% of medical office visits according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. Over 40% of individuals over 65 have
symptomatic OA and reduced mobility due to the disease. OA pain is often mitigated with conservative treatment
approaches such as water therapy, walking, cycling, and pharmaceuticals. Regular use of NSAIDs can have
adverse side effects on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal systems. As such, topical NSAIDs and intra-
articular corticosteroids are often used to provide localized pain relief for patients. However, neither of these
therapeutic approaches provide pain relief without risks including skin irritation, infection and accelerated loss of
cartilage. Long-duration ultrasound has been used to reduce pain and improve joint function in patients with knee
OA. When ultrasound is used in conjunction with topical pharmaceuticals, sonophoresis drives the molecules
deeper into tissue, providing improved pain relief compared to ultrasound or topical application of NSAIDs alone.
In our SBIR Phase I/II project, we developed a novel diclofenac sonophoresis patch for the management of knee
OA. We demonstrated that the sonophoresis technology could increase tissue penetration of NSAIDs by 3.8x
compared to standard of care (p<0.01) and exhibit an excellent safety profile. We completed regulatory testing
including sensitization, cytotoxicity, packaging/formulation stability, biocompatibility, microbial growth, shelf-life
and home-use application of the sonophoresis patch. We also completed a human-factors study, clinical
diathermy study and two knee OA clinical studies on patients with radiographically confirmed mild to moderate
knee OA. The sonophoresis patch reduced knee pain by up to 2.96 points after 1-week (p<0.001) and by 3.43
points after 8-weeks (p<0.0001) of daily use; significantly more than topical diclofenac arthritis medication alone.
Over 98% of study participants found the device easy to use and would continue treatment for their knee OA
symptoms. For this SBIR Phase IIB renewal we (1) complete 3-year validation testing of the device to meet all
remaining federal requirements for the sonophoresis patch, and (2) complete a 12-week, 3-arm, multi-site,
placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical superiority study to expand upon our Phase I/II results and demonstrate
the combined benefit of multi-hour ultrasound + diclofenac in reducing pain, improving mobility and quality of life
for patients with knee OA. The overarching goal of this SBIR program is to bring a non-invasive, non-opioid,
targeted, clinically superior, easy-to-use, knee OA treatment option to the aging patient population regardless of
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographical barriers to healthcare."

10926883,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 2
Outcomes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have improved little over four decades. This is largely due
to the development of acquired drug resistance and refractory disease. Thus, there is an urgent need for new
strategies to target residual AML cells or refractory clones before they trigger disease relapse. The tumor
microenvironment is a key factor in the development of malignant progression and therapy resistance. The bi-
directional communication between cancer cells and microenvironmental cells is much more complex than
initially perceived. Thus, one strategy to reduce relapse is to target the signaling mediated by growth factors
secreted by stromal or immune cells within the bone marrow microenvironment that play a critical role in
promoting leukemia cell survival, development of drug resistance, and immune evasion. Therefore, the long-
term goal of this project is to deconvolute the comprehensive network of events and cellular heterogeneity that
contribute to acquired resistance in a context dependent manner to identify new therapeutic approaches. As part
of our prior U54 DRSN funding, omics-based analysis of 350 primary AML patient samples found that multiple
secreted cytokines and immune factors may contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, we hypothesize that
reprogramming of the bone marrow niche modulates drug response and drives acquired resistance in AML.
Comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms will lead to the identification of new combination therapies.
We will focus on 5 essential therapeutic targets in AML: BCL2, FLT3, JAK2, MEK, and epigenetic pathways and
will address this hypothesis following three well integrated aims. In Aim 1, we will map microenvironmental
signatures and tumor cross-talk mechanisms against drug response features of AML by performing single cell
gene expression and epigenetic analyses in the context of bone marrow niche. Tumor microenvironment cross-
talk will be further explored in Aim 2 focusing on monocytes and stromal cells and in the context of NK and T
cells in Aim 3 by performing CRISPR/Cas screening with co-culture platforms. Identified targets/pathways will
be validated to fully define microenvironmental mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. These results will build
predictive models of signaling crosstalk in response to therapeutic stress and identify combination therapies to
overcome acquired resistance, particularly in the context of the microenvironment. We will test the effect of these
inhibitors on cell viability, cellular heterogeneity, differentiation, and target inhibition using multi-parametric flow
cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis. We will integrate these findings with Project 1 and prioritized
targets will be tested for their translational impact in Project 3. Overall, elucidating the influence of
microenvironment-driven signaling on drug response and survival of AML cells will help identify novel tractable
targets for combination therapies to overcome acquired drug resistance in AML."
10926885,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 3
The goal of this Project is to translate newly discovered mechanisms of acquired drug resistance in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) from Projects 1 and 2 into novel drug combinations that can be deployed early in disease
evolution to prevent disease relapse and improve patient outcomes. Disease relapse in AML is fueled by a
complex cross-talk of tumor cells adapting with support from the bone marrow microenvironment. Our prior work,
which was conducted by Leads and Personnel in this Project collaborating closely with Projects 1 and 2 as part
of the OHSU DRSN U54 – the predecessor to ARTNet – has shown that acquired drug resistance in AML
proceeds via a multi-stage process. Early resistance is driven by cell state changes stimulated from tumor-
extrinsic signals, and this early resistance eventually transitions to a late stage of resistance with features of
clonal evolution. Understanding this process creates immediate translational opportunities for intervention during
the early stage of resistance. Indeed, our work from the DRSN Center has already led to novel drug combinations
that have been translated into clinical to mitigate resistance to important new therapies for AML, such as FLT3
and BCL2 inhibitors. This prior work has led to a central hypothesis that delineation of pathways driving
early detection of drug resistance will lead to the development of improved drug combinations, at the
earliest time possible, to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. For this project, our
immediate goals are to prioritize the most promising drug combinations and most reliable resistance
signatures for clinical translation. To accomplish these goals, three Aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate
signatures of resistance using primary AML samples in ex vivo assays: We will use our long-standing expertise
of testing primary AML patient samples against drug combinations using both high-throughput screening
platforms, imaging and flow-based readouts to evaluate phenotypic effects in single-cells, and an advanced, 3D
model of the bone marrow microenvironment that facilitates long-term drug testing of primary patient samples
(Humarrow). 2) Longitudinal evaluation of samples from patients receiving rational therapeutic regimens: We will
perform detailed characterization of longitudinal specimens from patients enrolled on our cutting-edge
combination therapy clinical trials to evaluate signatures of resistance at early stages of therapy. 3) Employ
sensitive detection techniques to detect low levels of resistance in primary samples: We will use single-cell and
cell enrichment analytical techniques in specimens from newly diagnosed and early-stage AML patients to define
the earliest point at which resistance signatures can be detected. All of these data will inform and refine the work
of Projects 1 and 2 and will be leveraged to support the development of future clinical trials and clinically-
informative signatures of acquired drug resistance. Collectively, this work will identify new regimens to treat
patients at the earliest possible stage, thereby, preventing disease relapse and improving durable outcomes."

11004177,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Mast Cell Expressed Membrane Protein 1 (MCEMP1) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in
lung-resident mast cells. Interestingly, MCEMP1 is one of the top inducible genes in several inflammatory lung
diseases including asthma. Indeed, asthma patients at exacerbation stage show higher expression of MCEMP1
than asthma patients at recovery stage. However, a cellular function of MCEMP1 in mast cells and a pathological
role of MCEMP1 in asthma are entirely unknown. In preliminary study, I discovered that MCEMP1 interacted
with KIT receptor on the surface of mast cells. While an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–FcεRI complex activates mast
cells to induce degranulation, KIT surface receptor and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) are critical for the
proliferation of mast cells. Upon SCF stimulation, peritoneal mast cells from Mcemp1–/– mice showed decreased
proliferation compared to those from wild-type mice. In addition, SCF-mediated in vivo expansion of lung mast
cells was significantly reduced in Mcemp1–/– mice. Importantly, Mcemp1–/– mice showed reduced lung
inflammation in asthma model. Based on these, I hypothesize that MCEMP1 is a critical adaptor for KIT
receptor signaling that promotes SCF-mediated mast cell proliferation and contributes to asthma
exacerbation. Herein, I seek to address the following: (i) a cellular role of MCEMP1 in SCF-induced mast cell
expansion by potentiating KIT receptor signaling. (ii) a pathological role of MCEMP1-mediated mast cell
expansion in the progression of severe asthma. (iii) Lastly, I will develop therapeutic approach to inhibit the
pathologic function of MCEMP1 in asthma. Collectively, this study will not only define the pathobiological role of
MCEMP1 in mast cell expansion and asthma progression, but also provide novel insight into a new therapeutic
target for asthma. This award will support a new molecular mechanism of mast cell proliferation and an important
mechanistic finding in the field of asthma."

reduce cancer risk; (2) define screening determinants and advance guideline concordant cancer screening; and, 
(3) define the treatment and behavioral determinants of living with, through, and beyond cancer to improve 
outcomes, patient well-being, and length of survival. These aims are aligned with two central themes, disparities 
and interventions, which provide a context and framework for addressing the needs of the catchment area and 
beyond. Unique strengths and major accomplishments include: early-detection methylation biomarkers 
associated with lung cancer risk; prospective assessment of the impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer

10933568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adhesion proteins on the pilus-covered surface of Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are required for attachment
to host cells to facilitate colonization and disease progression in urinary tract infections (UTIs). The primary
adhesion proteins associated with UPEC virulence are FimH, which binds D-mannose on uroepithelial cells, and
FmlH, which binds N-acetylgalactosamine on kidney and inflamed bladder cells. This proposal aims to develop
UTI treatments that prevent the attachment and subsequent internalization of UPEC in uroepithelial cells,
eliminating bacteria from the urinary tract. Treatments that block the highly conserved binding pockets of
FimH/FmlH prevent UPEC attachment to host cells and clear bacteria from the urinary tract6,9,11. However,
designing inhibitors that reach the urinary tract to reduce the risk for recurrent infections (e.g., through a long
half-life and without disrupting commensal bacteria) remains challenging. Our goal is to use mirror-image phage
display to identify D-peptide inhibitors of UPEC adhesion to eliminate bacteria from the urinary tract. We
hypothesize that D-peptide inhibitors that prevent attachment to host cells could serve as novel
antibiotic-sparing UTI treatments. D-peptides are ideal for this application because they are cleared via kidney
filtration (accumulate in urine), have a long half-life, and can be formulated as a long-acting injection.
 To screen for D-peptide inhibitors, we will first chemically synthesize the mirror-image D-target proteins
(FimH/FmlH) using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) with D-amino acids and native chemical ligation (NCL).
These D-proteins will be validated by comparison to recombinant L-proteins for secondary structure and binding
activity. Using mirror-image phage display, we will screen diverse phage libraries for L-peptide binders to the
synthesized D-target proteins. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) will be used to identify high-affinity hits that
will then be synthesized in D- to inhibit the natural L-target.
 We will determine the affinity of our inhibitors via direct binding and competition studies. The crystal structures
of our D-peptides in complex with FimH or FmlH will be obtained using X-ray crystallography and will inform
inhibitor affinity optimization. In vitro assays will be performed using a panel of 40 UPEC strains to validate D-
peptide inhibition of host cell attachment, hemagglutination, and biofilm formation. We will determine the
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the most promising D-peptides in mice. Finally, we will evaluate the efficacy of
treatments in mouse acute and chronic UTI models. This project will contribute valuable information about UPEC
pili binding interactions, advance our chemical protein synthesis knowledge, and generate D-peptide inhibitor
leads for precision UTI treatment."

Millions of Americans suffer from Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and experience severe disability and diminished
quality of life. This chronic widespread pain syndrome is accompanied by a range of symptoms including chronic
fatigue, non-restorative sleep, functional disability, and cognitive and mood disturbances. Currently used animal
models of FMS suffer from deficits in face, construct, and predictive validities, which has resulted in a translation
gap; new therapies that appear to be promising in animal models have failed in human clinical trials. One strategy
to improve the evaluation of face and construct validities of FMS animal models would be to measure several
symptoms that correlate with the human disease in the same animal. We will therefore develop a Fibromyalgia
Analog Model (FAM) that will serve as a diagnostic index similar to those used clinically. We hypothesize that
this index will improve the evaluation of face and predictive validities of animal FMS models, and will provide a
defined method to compare them. A secondary endpoint is a comparison between the established reserpine
model of FMS and an innovative model: the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat. Our preliminary studies show that SS
rats are a model of spontaneous allodynia, as they exhibit mechanical pressure sensitivity without an external
precipitating intervention. Accompanying the decrease in mechanical thresholds, these rats also fail to mount a
diffuse noxious inhibitory control response to painful stimuli. This strain demonstrates additional phenotypes
consistent with FMS such as anxiety, systemic and neural inflammation and dysfunction in stress response
systems (construct validity). These rats also demonstrate predictive validity as gabapentin, but not indomethacin
or dexamethasone provides >30% improvement in hyperalgesia. We hypothesize that the FAM index will allow
us to determine the suitability of the SS strain as an FMS model. The R61 phase will comprise three experiments.
(1) Six behavioral endpoints will test for FMS traits in the same individual female reserpine treated Sprague
Dawley rat; behavioral aspects of fatigue, muscle tenderness, disrupted sleep, widespread pain, anxiety, and
depression. The results will then be analyzed using regression modelling within a rigorous multivariate framework
to define relationships in observable clinical phenotypes to develop the FAM index. The data will also be used
to maximize the internal validity of the measurements. (2) We will certify the external validity of the FAM index
using two additional strains, female SS and Brown Norway (BN) rats. (3) We will repeat the studies in males of
all three strains. Five statistical milestones will determine whether to move forward with further experiments. In
the R33 phase, we will externally validate the SS model and FAM index and examine its predictive validity via
three sets of experiments: (1) externally validate the FAM index in additional rat strains; (2) establish the SS
model in another institute; (3) test the therapeutic effect of indomethacin, pregabalin and duloxetine on multiple

well as a novel model of FMS. This model will be highly desirable for drug screening and pharmacologic testing."
10932994,"Measuring and manipulating metabolic fluxes in the tumor microenvironment
 Tumors have altered metabolism compared to normal tissues, which suggests that drugging
metabolism could kill tumors while sparing healthy tissues. However, tumor metabolism has chiefly been
measured in vitro, while recent studies have showed that tumor metabolism in the body is distinct from in vitro
systems. Therefore, the field needs approaches to measure tumor metabolic fluxes in vivo. During my
postdoctoral fellowship, I developed methods to measure glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) flux in
vivo using kinetic infusion of isotope-labeled tracers. These approaches revealed that tumors have much lower
TCA flux than healthy tissues (5 mouse tumor models examined). Though the tumors had higher glycolytic flux
than healthy tissues, the total ATP production rate from glycolysis plus TCA cycle-driven oxidative
phosphorylation was significantly lower in tumors than in healthy tissues. Moreover, feeding mice a high-fat
ketogenic diet increased tumor TCA flux and slowed tumor growth synergistically when combined with
chemotherapy.
 These findings raise two key questions. First, since tumors in vivo are a mix of cancer cells and other
infiltrating cells, what is the metabolism of cancer cells versus immune cells or fibroblasts in tumors? Second,
can directly upregulating tumor TCA flux slow tumor growth? I propose first to combine my glycolysis and TCA
cycle measuring techniques with immunomagnetic and sorting strategies to measure fluxes in cancer cells,
immune cells, and fibroblasts (Aim 1). I will apply this strategy to melanoma, a tumor type infiltrated by CD8 T
cells which can help control the tumor, and to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a tumor type where fibroblasts and
myeloid cells can be even more abundant than cancer cells. Next, I will directly upregulate TCA flux in tumor
cells by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches: overexpressing the NADH uncoupler protein mito-
LbNOX, knockout of the TCA suppressor protein PDK, and inhibition of PDK with dichloroacetate. I will confirm
that these strategies increase TCA flux using the method I developed and will test whether increased TCA flux
slows tumor growth in primary and metastatic breast tumors. Successful completion of these aims will reveal
the metabolism of different cell populations in the tumor microenvironment and will test TCA upregulation as a
therapeutic strategy in cancer."
10923360,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In South Africa's large generalized HIV epidemic, male-to-female transmission comprises a large
proportion of transmission events, but men are much less likely to seek HIV testing, and disproportionately
remain undiagnosed. HIV-related stigma is a key barrier to recruiting men to HIV testing in South Africa, as
they report feeling blamed by their partners and communities for HIV transmission. This barrier must be
addressed to increase testing among men and other testing-avoidant people in order to locate “hard-to-reach”
undiagnosed cases and make progress towards 95-95-95 goals. Peer recruitment via social networks is an
effective mechanism for promoting HIV testing, because people seek health information from peers, and peers
influence health behavior norms within networks. However, standard risk network recruitment is limited in that:
1) recruiting one's own risk partners can trigger stigma and blame for HIV; and 2) it excludes people who have
not engaged in HIV risk behavior recently and/or who no longer have contact with their risk partners. We
developed an expanded social network recruitment to HIV testing (E-SNRHT) intervention to address
these limitations and reduce stigma as a barrier to testing. E-SNRHT asks newly diagnosed HIV+ (NDP)
“seeds” (i.e., initial participants) to recruit their expanded social network members (i.e., anyone they know) who
they think could benefit from HIV testing or could be HIV+ unaware, tests these network members, and refers
them to ART (if positive) or follow-up testing (if negative). By asking participants to recruit non-risk partners, E-
SNRHT is designed to increase their comfort and likelihood of recruiting others, especially those who have
avoided testing due to stigma. Our two pilot studies of E-SNRHT found that it recruits men to HIV testing at
much higher rates than standard risk network recruitment; locates previously undiagnosed cases (NDP) at a
much higher rate per seed than standard risk network recruitment; and recruits people who have not tested in
years, have never tested, and/or have not engaged in HIV risk behavior recently but are HIV positive-unaware.
We also found that E-SNRHT reduces HIV-related stigma and increases HIV-related social support among
networks; and that 76% of E-SNRHT NDP started ART within 10 weeks. As participants recruit each other,
their discussions help to normalize talking about HIV, thereby improving levels of stigma and support, which in
turn should increase HIV service use and improve HIV care cascade outcomes. We will conduct a site-
randomized trial of E-SNRHT, with 32 Department of Health clinics in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa serving as
sites. We will compare E-SNRHT clinics to business-as-usual control clinics on: their rates of recruiting men to
testing (Aim 1a) and locating NDP (1b); participants' reports of HIV-related stigma and social support (Aim 2a);
and treatment cascade outcomes (2b). We will also use implementation science methods and qualitative
methods to develop best practices (Aim 3) for future scale-up in South Africa and adaptation to other settings."

Integrative medicine, including meditation, yoga, tai chi, massage, and other modalities are widely used by
Americans in the hope of obtaining health benefits. Evidence for the health effects of these practices, however,
has important limitations. The goal of the “Training for Research in Integrative Medicine” (TRIM) fellowship is to
train outstanding pre- and postdoctoral behavioral and social scientists, physicians, and other qualified health
professionals to design and conduct rigorous clinical and translational research in preparation for research
careers in integrative medicine. The program has four postdoctoral positions and two predoctoral positions.
The UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine provides an exceptional context in which to offer the
program, and TRIM is designed to leverage the extensive training opportunities available as a result of being
embedded in the rich UCSF research environment. Since its inception 14 years ago, TRIM has maintained a
record of attracting extremely well qualified candidates who collectively have had a substantial impact on the
field of integrative medicine research. Nine of 20 post-doctoral fellows who have completed training have gone
on to receive K career development awards. The TRIM program provides an interdisciplinary clinical and
research environment; strong mentoring by an experienced research faculty; advanced training in clinical,
biological, and psychological research methodologies; special attention to research methodology issues that
are particularly relevant to integrative medicine research; extensive training in methods to enhance
reproducibility in research; opportunities to conduct original research; training in research ethics; and exposure
to diverse integrative approaches to patient care involving all age groups from early childhood through old
age. The interprofessional TRIM faculty is strongly committed to mentoring and has 11 core and 10 affiliated
members representing internal medicine, family medicine, psychology, neuroscience, molecular biology,
anthropology, biostatistics, psychoneuroendocrinology, women's health, pediatrics, health services research,
medical ethics, and psychiatry. A major strength of the training program is the clinical advisory faculty who are
available to provide technical assistance and consultation on specific integrative medicine approaches that
trainees might want to study. TRIM faculty provide expert and comprehensive mentoring, as well as required
and optional academic activities that are tailored to each trainee's individual learning objectives. New
curriculum components include a greater emphasis on social determinants of health. The program is strongly
committed to addressing issues of health equity and diversity, equity, and inclusion among its faculty and
trainees; as one metric, 43% of pre-doctoral fellows since the last renewal are underrepresented minorities in
medicine. The TRIM program provides research training and career development opportunities that will equip a
new generation of researchers to expand our knowledge-base of whether and how integrative medicine
approaches work for specific health conditions."

This project addresses the lack of diversity in the field of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science. We
propose a summer internship experience called the interdisciplinary summer research experience (ISRE) in the
Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Ohio State University. The ultimate goal of this project is to
encourage and support underrepresented students who are interested in careers in BMI and data science. We
take a unique approach to the internship in two ways. First we focus on interdisciplinary dual mentorship. This
means that each student will have two mentors from different fields and research backgrounds. The goal is to
help the student gain a broader perspective of the field by exposure to different viewpoints. The second
innovation as part of this grant is to offer a mentored experience in an artificial intelligence challenge
competition instead of a traditional research experience. AI competitions foster teamwork, creativity, and quick
thinking. We will study whether this experience has the same impact as the traditional mentored research
experience. We have a supportive departmental environment, institution, and dedicated and engaged faculty
members. It is the responsibility of the faculty current in the field to work to increase diversity and support those
that are underrepresented to build a stronger and more diverse workforce for the future."

Current vaccines for influenza need help as they are only effective for short durations, particularly in elderly individuals and patients with chronic diseases. Also, new vaccines must be prepared yearly to protect against new strains of influenza virus. Thus, there is substantial demand for the development of new immune boosting adjuvants to improve existing influenza vaccines. Our contract supports the development of a new vaccine adjuvant, Fos47, that improves vaccines durability and cross-protection in animal models. The protective efficacy of vaccine adjuvant Fos47 will be assessed in influenza virus challenge models to identify an optimal dosage, route and frequency of immunization. The vaccine adjuvant will be prepared in a large scale for the initiation of human clinical trials."

10922240,"Project Summary / Abstract
Targeted alpha therapy is an emerging technique for treating cancer showing great promise to deliver a precise and potent
cell-killing treatment to multiple cancer varieties. The design of these targeted radiopharmaceuticals combines a tumor-
selective carrier molecule bound to an alpha-particle-emitting radionuclide. The carrier molecule selectively binds to the
intended cancer cells, and the limited lethal spatial range of alpha particles emitted by the attached radionuclide yields a
targeted therapeutic effect by destruction of the cancer cells. Researchers are designing a variety of carrier molecules and
experimenting with radionuclide isotopes to get the best therapeutic effect. The novelty of the field means that tools are
still lacking to help researchers and other medical innovators to (1) characterize the spatial distribution of the therapeutic
resulting from carrier molecule design and (2) fully understand the fate of their chosen isotopes which chain-wise decay
into progeny isotopes which may have different affinities, toxicities, and effects. Our goal in this grant is to develop an
innovative, quantitative radiation imaging tool that allows researchers and radiopharmaceutical developers to not only
see the spatial distribution of targeted alpha therapy molecules at a near-cellular level, but to also see the emitting
molecules labeled by their emitting isotope, effecting a form of isotopic spectroscopy. This work builds upon our previous
research in which we demonstrated a non-optimized but innovative algorithm for labeling parent and progeny isotopes.
We now aim to refine this algorithm to achieve real-time isotopic spectroscopy, combine it with a highly optimized
hardware design for isotopic imaging, and bring the combined result to market. This device will be an extremely useful
tool for radiopharmaceutical experts, producing quantitative, quality-assured results to support their development of the
next great cancer treatments. We believe this project brings together our expertise in image science, real-time algorithm
design, and product development to produce an invaluable tool for researchers working in this most-promising area of
cancer therapy research."
10922543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer (BC) is a formidable global health challenge, affecting millions of women worldwide annually. This
malignancy is a leading cause of death among women, underscoring its profound significance. Detecting BC at
an early stage not only improves treatment outcomes but also significantly enhances survival rates. Currently,
mammography is the standard of care for diagnosis of BC, and it is recommended that screening procedures
commence at the age of 40, particularly due to the rising incidence of BC in women who are under the age of
50. Although mammography decreases BC-associated mortality, there exist distinct challenges with
mammography alone for general population screening. For example, there is often inadequate healthcare
accessibility for certain populations that exist due to socioeconomic disparities. BC mortality is heightened for
Black women relative to White women, which is attributed to lack of access to regular screening, earlier age of
disease incidence, and higher rates of triple-negative breast cancer. Inaccessibility of mammography to rural
populations and a fear of painful mammogram experience also contribute to the lack of timely BC diagnosis in
underrepresented populations. Screening mammography also exhibits inherent sensitivity limitations and often
misses BC at earlier stages, especially for women with dense breasts, who comprise approximately 47% of
women in the U.S. It is thus recommended that women with dense breasts upon mammographic exam undergo
supplemental screening procedures such as ultrasound or MRI. Unfortunately, these imaging procedures are
expensive and/or dependent upon the availability of specially trained breast sonographers and are not widely
available to underserved populations. There is thus an urgent need for the development of innovative screening
methods that facilitate BC detection in nascent stages and that are also deployable to the primary care setting
and can be operated independent of user experience level. To address these problems, iSono Health has
developed the ATUSA imaging platform, which represents a major advancement in supplemental BC screening.
This novel system consists of an adjustable wearable imaging device that can rapidly perform whole breast
scans in ~2 minutes coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted algorithms that accurately identify and
diagnose BC at an early stage. The goal of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to develop and validate Lesion
Classification, Lesion Segmentation, and Density Calculator AI models for 3D ATUSA images. Successful
outcomes of this project will establish baseline measures of the ATUSA diagnostic performance. Validation
results will allow iSono Health to submit a second FDA clearance of AI indications and commercially launch
ATUSA. The ATUSA platform will transform how women access supplemental breast imaging and increase the
number of women receiving adequate breast imaging and timely diagnosis, thus saving lives."
10923431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the realm of drug development and clinical evaluation, there is a pressing need to address the historical
exclusion of underrepresented populations such as children, women, racial minorities, elderly individuals, and
disease-specific groups. Regrettably, excluding these populations from drug testing results in unintended health
disparities, such as disproportionate occurrences of unforeseen adverse events and reduced efficacy of already
approved drugs. In the absence of diverse participation in clinical studies, a recent paradigm shift at the FDA
allows for new drug application submissions to utilize physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling
to describe the pharmacokinetic properties of a drug in specific populations. Although PBPK modeling is
promising, two fundamental challenges make these models less applicable to underrepresented populations.
First, the physiological data within current PBPK modeling tools have been derived from the reference population
(Caucasian/White). These inputs also include the levels of drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and
receptors (drug target proteins, DTPs). Second, the in vitro reagents used to model the drug-specific data are
not characterized in diverse human populations, thus limiting the accuracy of in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)
predictors. In Phase I of our proposal, Precision Quantomics Inc. aims to fill these critical knowledge gaps
through development of the Underrepresented Population DTP (UpDTP) database of abundance of DTPs in
human liver and the creation of meticulously characterized population-specific in vitro reagents (PQ-ivR).
Together, these advancements will enable the generation of key data and reagents for PBPK models that will
more accurately predict drug pharmacokinetics and tissue drug concentration as surrogates of drug safety and
efficacy across diverse populations. The successful completion of Phase I will serve as a proof of concept, setting
a strong foundation for an expanded Phase II, where we will i) expand the UpDTP database to include other
tissues, populations, and animal models for PBPK modeling to pharmaceutical and biotech organizations ii)
develop custom reagents with precise scaling factors for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and iii) validate
commercially available reagents with precise scaling factors for drug testing. In conclusion, our technology has
potential to advance drug development practices, elevate predictive accuracy, and ultimately contribute to
improved patient care across the currently underrepresented patient populations."

 This proposal describes the framework of a DP1 grant for Alejandro B. Balazs, PhD.
Dr. Balazs is currently an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a principal
investigator at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard. Dr. Balazs' research is focused on
engineering the immune system via gene transfer as a novel means of creating protection against
infectious disease. This proposal represents an entirely new research direction for his laboratory
and is focused on the creation of vectors capable of producing multi-specific polyclonal antibodies
in vivo which can neutralize both the highly-mutable HIV-1 virus as well as addictive substances.
These will test the hypothesis that engineered polyclonal immune responses can permanently
suppress HIV-1 infection more effectively than separate antibodies. The proposal aims to test this
concept by first comparing multiple designs of vectors engineered to produce multi-specific
antibodies that can both neutralize HIV in a series of cell-based assays. Designs with optimal
activity will advance to testing in both mouse and non-human primate models to identify those
with maximal expression potential in vivo. Optimal designs will be tested in animal models of HIV-
infection. These experiments aim to determine whether polyclonal engineered immune responses
can more effectively control HIV replication than multiple individual antibodies while resisting the
emergence of escape mutants to achieve a functional cure of HIV infection in people with
substance use disorders. Such a finding would have profound implications for treatment of HIV in
the context of substance use disorder offering an improved therapeutic intervention against HIV,
particularly for people who are unable to comply with existing antiretroviral drug regimens.
Moreover, this technology will also test the development of a single therapeutic intervention
targeting both HIV and addictive substances, to improve health outcomes for people living with
HIV with underlying substance use disorders, consistent with the mission of NIDA and the NIH."
10907888,"Project summary (16 lines):
The brain constantly communicates with the rest of the body through a complex network of nerves,
hormones, and immune cells. Brain-body communication is crucial for maintaining homeostasis
and overall health. This communication can be affected by aging, as some parts of the brain
shrink, some nerve cells lose their connections, and some blood vessels become clogged [1].
These changes can impair the brain’s ability to send and receive signals to and from the body,
resulting in cognitive decline and physical deterioration. Therefore, studying how aging affects
brain-body communication is essential for finding ways to prevent or treat age-related conditions
and to promote healthy aging. Meanwhile, brain-body communication during aging is a complex
and dynamic process that varies among individuals. To unlock the potential for personalized
interventions, a deep comprehension at the individual level is paramount. Yet, comprehensive
exploration of cellular-level brain-body communication in individuals has remained challenging
due to a dearth of suitable tools and model systems. My proposal seeks to introduce an
interdisciplinary approach, integrating an innovative single-whole-organism single-cell
sequencing platform and cutting-edge machine learning methodologies, to construct aging
trajectories. This innovation aims to elucidate age-induced alterations in brain-body
communication at the individual resolution, enabling a profound understanding of these dynamics
in complex organisms."
10910049,"This project aims in developing treatments for an atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) variant, usually affecting
the left hemisphere and comprising the logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), thus, PPA-AD.
There are no pharmacological treatments available for PPA, and the only treatment shown to alleviate language
deficits is speech-language therapy. Treatment research in AD has emphasized targeting neuronal synaptic
transmission. We were amongst the first groups in the world to show the efficacy of a neuromodulation technique
that targets synaptic transmission (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) in providing significant
symptomatic relief of language impairments in PPA. In the largest-to-date, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical
trial we demonstrated the efficacy of tDCS as an adjuvant for speech-language therapy for the treatment of
naming and spelling deficits in PPA. However, the efforts to slow language degeneration are hindered by the
fact that these individuals also suffer from additional cognitive deficits. This is especially true for individuals with
AD etiology (pathology and atrophy distribution). Early in the disease, individuals with PPA-AD present with
additional cognitive deficits such as verbal short-term memory impairment, even believed to be a primary
underlying cause of language deficits. However, treatment of these deficits has not been investigated in PPA-
AD using neuromodulation approaches. To address this gap, the proposed research aims to answer the following
question: How can we implement neurostimulation-based treatments to maximally generalize their
benefits to vital language/cognitive functions? We will do that by employing: (a) a behavioral therapy that
directly targets verbal short-term and working memory (vSTM/WM) deficits and that has been shown to
effectively generalize even to untrained language functions in post-stroke aphasia, and, (b) targeted neuro-
stimulation (high-definition tDCS) based on recent network-neuroscience and neuro-rehabilitation models. In
Aim 1, we will compare the efficacy of tDCS delivered over the left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG) vs. the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC), both coupled with vSTM/WM behavioral treatment, specifically
examining the generalization of treatment effects to untrained vital language-specific and executive cognitive
functions in PPA-AD. In Aim 2, we will implement neuroimaging techniques to understand the mechanisms of
tDCS-induced changes in terms of: (a) network functional connectivity, (b) previous and novel metabolites such
as GABA and glutathione (related to oxidative stress in neurodegeneration), and (c) blood oxygenation, using
perfusion imaging. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate novel predictors of responsiveness to tDCS such as
perfusion, sex and sleep, thus complementing our previously identified clinical, neural and behavioral predictors
(variant, brain volume and initial language/cognitive performance). A better understanding, based on recent
advances in network neuroscience, of how tDCS benefits may generalize to untrained language and executive
cognitive functions has the potential to revolutionize the development of effective treatments for PPA-AD."

10908091,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Co-use of fentanyl with the animal tranquilizer xylazine, a compound for which naloxone, the standard
of care for opioid intoxication is ineffective, is a major cause of overdose death in the US. Co-use of
fentanyl and xylazine (an adulterant) has reached crisis levels, with xylazine-positive overdose deaths increasing
by 1,127% in the South and over 100% in all other regions between 2020 and 2021. In July 2023 the White House
released the “Fentanyl Adulterated or Associated with Xylazine Response Plan,” a first-of-its-kind National
Response effort. A key part of the Plan is reversal agents for overdose from fentanyl/xylazine combinations.
Our goal is to develop a reversal agent for combinations of xylazine and fentanyl, delivered by
intramuscular (IM) injection, that is compatible with naloxone. Our antidote is a small molecule
sequestrant that encapsulates intoxicants, immediately reversing their toxidrome, followed by accelerated
clearance into urine. The indication is to simultaneously reduce the level of fentanyl and xylazine in the human
body, with restoration of respiration and reversal of sedation. We envision two use cases: (1) use alone if sedation
is the major symptom, and (2) use after naloxone if respiratory depression is also present.
In the R43 we identified five compounds with good binding to both fentanyl and xylazine. Two candidates were
selected for further study: (1) CS-1103, an acyclic cucurbituril compound, currently in advanced development
to treat methamphetamine and fentanyl intoxication, and (2) CS-1105, a CS-1103 analogue. CS-1103 and CS-
1105 are highly effective against fentanyl, restoring breathing in 2-3 min in rat, and compatible with naloxone.
Both significantly reduce xylazine level and duration of sedation in rat, with about equal effectiveness.
For combinations of fentanyl and xylazine, CS-1103 restored respiration in 2-3 min, reversed
sedation caused by xylazine in 10-20 min, and accelerated clearance of fentanyl and xylazine into
urine 73-fold and 7-fold, respectively, in 2 hr, vs saline control. Naloxone was less effective in restoring
respiration, and showed no improvement in sedation reversal or intoxicant clearance vs saline control. In the
R44, the first Aim will study the effect of CS-1105 on fentanyl/xylazine combinations, to select a lead candidate.
The R44 will address four key questions: (1) Does xylazine affect the dose response of candidate against
fentanyl, and vice versa?; (2) Does candidate simultaneously restore respiration and reverse sedation?; (3) Is the
candidate compatible with naloxone?; (4) What is the regulatory pathway for treating polysubstance overdose?
Aim 1 will select a candidate against co-use of fentanyl and xylazine, in rat. Aim 2 will optimize formulation of
lead candidate for IM injection. Aim 3 will establish the dose response of lead candidate against combinations
of fentanyl and xylazine in rat. Aim 4 will establish the dose response of lead candidate against co-use of fentanyl
and xylazine, in canine. Aim 5 will complete pre-IND package, including nonclinical plan and clinical strategy."

Candidate: Dr. Nicholas Douville is a critical care anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology at
the University of Michigan. Through completion of the Medical-Scientist Training Program (MSTP) and clinical
training in Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Dr. Douville has developed expertise in bioinformatics
and perioperative outcomes research. This proposal builds on Dr. Douville’s expertise, providing protected time
for training in bioinformatics, data science, and statistical techniques necessary to drive forward the prediction
of patients at risk for postoperative acute kidney injury (poAKI).
Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes
Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with
perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Douville, and is
the Director for MPOG and ex-member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed
research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Cristen Willer, PhD
(genetics) and Michael Heung, MD (nephrology), and Daniel Clauw, MD (general career guidance).
Background: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurs after 6-13% of non-cardiac procedures, and is associated with a
six-fold increase in postoperative mortality. Numerous metrics for identifying at-risk patients have been
developed incorporating preoperative and intraoperative data. Family and linkage studies have demonstrated
renal dysfunction to be a heritable trait, however, the specific genetic underpinnings of acute, as opposed to
chronic, kidney injury has only recently been explored in the perioperative period. These studies were limited
by small sample size, did not consistently identify variants, and failed to utilize advanced genetic analysis, such
as polygenic risk scores (PRS). Furthermore, predictive algorithms for poAKI fail to incorporate any genetic
data, despite evidence that this may explain a substantial portion of the overall risk.
Research: Our goal is to assist perioperative providers in improving patient outcomes through a unified
platform that identifies patient attributes that may affect their care and stratifies the risk of key perioperative
complications. Our proposed algorithm will combine clinical information (divided into preoperative and
intraoperative data) with genetic information to identify patients with greater than baseline risk for developing
poAKI. We will validate our methodology using clinical and genetic data from our institutional Michigan
Genomics Initiative (MGI), where we have genetic data on over 70,000 individuals who have had surgery at the
University of Michigan. We will first develop a polygenic risk score for poAKI (Aim 1). The polygenic risk score
(developed in Aim 1) will then be integrated with other variables from the electronic health record (EHR) to
provide a comprehensive risk assessment which will be benchmarked against a validated metric (Aim 2)."

 Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are sustained by continuous self-renewal and differentiation of
stem cells. Failure to balance these processes is associated with diverse and common public health issues, such
as cancer and degenerative diseases. Discovering the mechanisms that regulate stem cell decisions is
fundamentally important but has been stymied by the inability to study these dynamic processes in an intact
mammal. My group overcomes this obstacle by leveraging the unique accessibility of the skin and our novel
intravital imaging approaches to track epithelial cells in real time in live animals. We have so far used this
approach to comprehensively identify all fate decisions within the epidermis, allowing us to uncover complex
relationships between stem cell behaviors. This has led to our conceptually innovative model that stem cells are
on a continuum of differentiation, coordinating their progression through the continuum based on tissue demand.
Despite these advances, how cell fate decisions are molecularly orchestrated on the tissue-level remains
unclear.
 Here, we adapt our intravital imaging techniques to visualize key molecular events – changes to
transcription, chromatin structure, and signaling pathway activation – and determine their role in population-level
coordination of cell fate decisions. We hypothesize that a global mechanism underlies the local coordination of
stem cell states, and that this mechanism is essential to ensure skin homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we
will determine how differentiation is initiated (Aim 1). We identified a population of cells in the basal layer that co-
express stem- and differentiation-markers but do not display morphological signs of differentiation. To determine
if these cells are in a reversible transition from stemness to differentiation, we will interrogate their transcriptional
plasticity, chromatin rearrangements, and cell-extrinsic regulators. In Aim 2, we will define intercellular signaling
patterns that coordinate stem cell and differentiation behaviors. Calcium signaling acts as a signal integrator in
the late stages of epidermal differentiation and in wound-healing, and our preliminary data show that calcium
signaling is prevalent and dynamic in the basal epidermis. To define how calcium signaling intersects with the
coordination of stem cell fate decisions, we will uncover the high-order dynamics of calcium signaling in the basal
layer and determine how calcium signaling regulates the coordination of cell cycles, self-renewal, and
differentiation of basal cells. To achieve these aims, we will use an integrated approach of cutting-edge imaging
technology, transcriptomics, mouse genetics, and machine learning. This research is significant because we
expect to uncover global molecular mechanisms that coordinate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in a
live mammal. Our findings will likely drive innovation in related fields, given that many principles of stem cell
biology are conserved in other organs."

This application seeks to establish a network for the investigation of gene-environment interaction in autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and outcomes among people with ASD. Much like the Psychiatric Genetics
Consortium launched a unifying infrastructure for scaling genome-wide association studies in ASD, the
Combining advances in Genomics and Environmental science to accelerate Actionable Research and
practice in ASD (GEARs) Network effort will allow a centralized mechanism for GxE activities in ASD across
multiple studies. Robust evaluation of GxE requires a large sample size, harmonized data on both genetics
and the environment, and novel statistical methods for measuring and summarizing environments, genetics,
and phenotypes. The GEARs Network seeks to compliment work in population studies with experimental
models leveraging 3D brain organoids, reflecting multiple ASD-associated genetics backgrounds on which the
impact of environmental risk can be evaluated on ASD-relevant neurophysiology endpoints. Finally, the
GEARs Network will develop and implement a pipeline for outreach and dissemination of GxE findings. The
successes of ASD genomics, emerging environmental evidence, and models of effective network
collaborations for large-scale efforts make this the ideal time to create a GxE infrastructure for ASD research.
Our team is uniquely poised to lead the GEARs Network, creating this opportunity at scale for the first time,
and with a focus on both etiology and health outcomes among people with ASD. We have experience in
leading multi-site collaborations, expertise in population and laboratory science, and required partnerships to
foster communication across researchers and with the broader ASD community. This translational approach,
informed by public health, will lead to improved understanding of both causes and consequences of ASD."

Worldwide, 70% of new HIV infections every year occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), home to 74% of people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), of whom over 50% are women. Furthermore, the highest rates of cervical
cancer (CC) incidence and related death also occur in SSA, where approximately 60% of all CC cases are in
women living with HIV/AIDS (WLWHA). Human Papillomavirus (HPV), amajor cause of CC, is the most
common sexually transmitted infection in SSA and nearly all WLWHA worldwide who develop CC are co-
infected with HPV. CC is largely preventable by HPV vaccination and cervical screening for early detection and
treatment. In high income countries (HICs), these strategies have led to a steep decline in CC; however they
remain largely inaccessible to women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Self-sampling-based HPV
(SS-HPV) tests have been shown to be a cost-effective and feasible approach to identifying women infected
with high-risk HPV strains (hr-HPV) who need more advanced diagnostic tests and treatment. However, SS-
HPV testing has not been widely implemented in most LMICs, including SSA despite high HIV prevalence.
Leveraging our decade-long, extensive, and successful training partnership and research collaborations in Mali
and Nigeria, we propose to implement a novel West African Self-Sampling HPV-Based Cervical Cancer
Control Program (WA-SS-HCCP). The project capitalizes on existing strengths and resources including the
HIV systems of care with Community Health Workers (CHWs) who have established relationships with
WLWHA and can provide HPV and CC education/counseling and SS specimen collection guidance, rapid
transportation of specimens to hospital laboratories, personalized delivery of test results directly to the women,
and facilitation of clinic referrals for women with hr-HPV for advanced diagnostics and treatment. The study will
conduct in-depth assessment of barriers, challenges, and needs to contextually adapt, implement, and
evaluate the effectiveness and success of WA-SS-HCCP. The specific aims are to (1) Assess barriers and
needs for contextual adaptations of WA-SS-HCCP among WLWHA in Mali and Nigeria, using qualitative risk
assessment and observation methods; (2) Contextually adapt, using a learning collaborative approach (e.g.,
monthly webinars, rapid-cycle small tests of change) and an implementation framework (e.g., training to
competency of CHWs, data coordination across settings, implementation dashboard) to optimize the WA-SS-
HCCP across all four sites; and (3) Conduct a dual evaluation of the effectiveness (e.g., % WLWHA fully
screened and % change in) and implementation (e.g., reach, adoption, implementation fidelity, and
maintenance or sustainability) and develop a “WA-SS-HCCP Scale-Up Toolkit” for wide dissemination of this
“detect-to-treat” program that can be expanded to HIV- women and across LMICs."

 Despite assumptions that inter-hospital transfer (IHT, the transfer of patients between acute care
hospitals) is done to provide patients with necessary specialized care, IHT also exposes vulnerable
hospitalized patients to the risks of discontinuity of care. Our recent research suggests that a subset of
transferred patients may experience harm during IHT without clear benefit; however, we currently lack data on
how to identify in which patients harm outweighs benefit of transfer, i.e., experience inappropriate IHT.
 The long-term objective of this research is to rigorously define and evaluate the incidence and patient
safety impact of potentially inappropriate IHT among hospitalized medical patients, identify patients at risk for
inappropriate transfer, and develop an intervention toolkit to reduce potentially inappropriate IHT. To achieve
this, we will work with diverse stakeholders involved in IHT, including patients/families, accepting and admitting
clinicians, transferring clinicians, and hospital leadership to define potentially inappropriate IHT. We will then
determine the incidence and patient safety impact of potentially inappropriate IHT via standardized adjudication
of 1800 hospitalized medical patients from 18 US hospitals that participate in a national research collaborative
(HOMERuN) and contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Adjudication tools
will be based on those used in similar prior research and will be informed by stakeholder definitions of
potentially inappropriate IHT. We will incorporate rigorous adjudicator training and continuous review to ensure
reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. We will then use standard modelling techniques to
retrospectively characterize a population(s) of potentially inappropriate patient transfers based on several
patient, transfer process, and system-level factors. This will be followed by advanced machine-learning
methods to prospectively identify patients at risk for potentially inappropriate IHT and validation of the model's
performance. Finally, we will utilize key results from the above analyses and stakeholder input to create a
prototype intervention, refine the prototype based on feedback from participating sites using a mixed methods
approach, and develop a toolkit of best practices to prevent potentially inappropriate IHT (e.g., by replacing it
with a safer alternative) for future dissemination. This research will establish a foundation from which
healthcare systems can achieve excellence in providing patients with the right care, in the right setting."
10919233,"Cellular Senescence Network: New Imaging Tools for Arthritis Imaging
Senescent cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of major musculoskeletal diseases, such as chonic
inflammatory joint disorders, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Cellular senescence in articular
joints represents a response of local cells to persistent stress that leads to cell-cycle arrest and enhanced
production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn perpetuates joint damage and leads to significant
morbidities of afflicted patients. It has been recently discovered that clearance of senescent cells by novel
“senolytic” therapies can attenuate the chronic inflammatory microenvironment of RA and OA, and thereby,
prevent further disease progression and support healing processes. In order to identify patients who might
benefit from these new senolytic therapies and to monitor therapy response, there is a significant unmet need
in identifying and mapping of senescent cells in articular joints and related musculoskeletal tissues. To fill this
gap, we propose to develop a new imaging biomarker that will significantly improve our capabilities to identify
and characterize senescent cells in human musculoskeletal tissues. We have generated exciting preliminary
data that show that 3-D-galacto-2-nitropyridine (PyGal), a known hydrophilic b-gal substrate, can be labeled
with 18F-fluorine. Upon intravenous injection, 18F-PyGal enters senescent cells and is selectively cleaved by b-
galactosidase, a senescence-specific enzyme in these cells. The trapped radiotracer can be detected with
positron emission tomography (PET) and autoradiography, thereby serving as an imaging biomarker for
senescent cells. We propose to introduce 18F-PyGal as the first clinically translatable radiotracer which
can detect senescent cells in vivo, in bones and joints of animal models and human volunteers. In the
initial UG3 phase of our project, we will demonstrate proof-of-principle of this new imaging technology in a
mouse model of RA and a large animal model of OA. In the subsequent UH3 phase, we will scale, optimize
and validate 18F-PyGal PET for mapping human tissues, first in human joint specimen and second in a first-in-
human phase I clinical trial. At the end of the UH3 phase, we will have delivered a novel imaging tool that can
visualize and quantify the presence and distribution of senescent cells in multiple musculoskeletal tissues
directly, non-invasively and longitudinally in vivo. Results will be catalogized in a planned senescence cell atlas
and shared with the cellular senescence network. Our 18F-PyGal-PET imaging tool will significantly improve
upon state-of-the-art imaging technologies for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal disorders, can be integrated
with other imaging technologies, such as MRI, and is ultimately capable of being scaled to map senescent cells
in multiple human tissues in a high-throughput fashion. Since 18F-PyGal targets senescent cells in multiple
different tissues and can be easily imaged with widely available medical imaging technologies, our
proposed new senescence imaging biomarker can be expected to be used widely by tissue mapping
centers and relevant research communities."
10928812,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. On the one
hand, senescent cells are a barrier for tumorigenesis and promote wound healing and embryogenesis. On the other
hand, senescent cells accumulate in aged and diseased tissues, where they impair tissue renewal and contribute to
inflammation and disease progression. Identification and characterization of senescent cells in human tissues will
contribute to our understanding of human diseases. Thus, mapping senescent cells at the 3-dimensional level and
single-cell resolution in human tissues is an important biomedical objective.
Accurate mapping of senescent cells requires reliable markers to specifically identify senescent cells.
Currently the senescence field has limited markers to unambiguously distinguish between senescent cells and
cells in other pathological states. In addition, the available markers do not address the heterogeneity of senescent
cells in tissues. To overcome these limitations, we propose to employ a novel single-cell proteomic technology
to investigate the proteomes of senescent cells at the single-cell level, with the goal to reveal novel markers of
senescence which can be used to identify and map senescent cells in human tissues.
Our group has recently developed a novel technology termed Single-Cell ProtEomics by Mass
Spectrometry (SCoPE2). This platform combines automated cell lysis, improved detection sensitivity, and
optimized data acquisition and analyses, allowing detection and quantification of thousands of proteins within a
single cell. We have applied this technology to study embryonic stem cell differentiation and macrophage
polarization, revealing their heterogeneity and alterations of proteomes at the single-cell level.
In this application, we will use the lung as a model system, which accumulate senescent cells that
contribute to aging and lung diseases. In the UG3 phase, we will isolate senescent cells from the lungs of naturally
aged mice. The isolated senescent cells together with control cells will be subjected to SCoPE2 procedure to
quantify their proteomes at the single-cell level, allowing us to create unique signatures for potentially diverse
senescent cell populations. This will help discover novel markers of senescent cells that are not possible with
traditional technologies. In the UH3 phase, we will apply this technology to human lungs, to validate and to
identify new markers of senescence. In aggregate, we will establish new ways of identifying senescent cells
that should offer new tools to probe senescent cells in human tissues, facilitating tissue mapping of senescent
cells of the SenNet initiative. In addition, this study has the potential to reveal new biology of senescence,
addressing the heterogeneity and proteome alterations at the single-cell level."
10915692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Single cell profiling has recently exploded into mainstream biology. Single cell profiling has been employed
in myriad applications in biology, including multiple diseases, embryonic development, comparative
evolutionary studies and aging. Most recently, single cell profiling has informed the phenomena of cellular
senescence. This proposal has two phases, UG3 (model systems), and UH3 (human validation).
 Cellular senescence is a multi-faceted cell fate that arrests cell proliferation, essentially irreversibly, and
activates the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases
and lipids, termed the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The SASP can influence tissue
microenvironments, and thus senescent cells can strongly affect tissue function and likely the systemic milieu.
Senescent cells increase with age and can drive a growing list of age-related pathologies, ranging from
neurodegeneration to cancer, in part through the SASP.
 There is increasing evidence that there are no universal markers for senescent cells. Instead, senescent
cells, while sharing certain characteristics and biomarkers, are remarkably heterogeneous, varying in
characteristics with genotype, cell and tissue type, senescence inducer, tissue (and cell culture)
microenvironment, and chronology (time after initial senescence induction).
 While some of the more commonly employed senescence markers have utility in superficially identifying
senescent cells de novo, the onus remains on the investigator to demonstrate why a cell should be considered
senescent, rather than relying on historical markers such as p16INK4a or p21Cip1. Thus, new technologies
designed to identify novel senescent cells and phenotypes are necessary that will require validation
both in culture and in tissue.
 The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new technologies to map senescent signatures back to
intact human tissue. This goal will enable us to identify and spatially characterize senescent cells in each
tissue, uncovering unique markers depending on tissue and cell type.
 Pilot 1: Identify senescent cells in the mouse vasculature, and determine if they can be detected by
ultrasound, and verified in human tissue; Pilot 2: Develop a microphysiologic ex vivo tissue-on-a-chip to model
ovarian senescence, and human tissue-tissue interactions via the SASP.
 These two pilots will use a combination of cell surface markers identified in our initial profiling, and Digital
Spatial Profiling (DSP, Nanostring) or Visium (10x) to localize senescent signatures to morphological structures
and cells in tissue sections. Our proposal will develop validated markers of senescence in multiple tissues and
cell types not previously characterized to deploy these technologies to the broader community."
10907289,"PROMOTING FAT LOSS IN PREGNANCY IN WOMEN WITH OBESITY
PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal obesity and excess weight gain in pregnancy are the leading causes of maternal and fetal
morbidity. Randomized trials in women with obesity have shown that lifestyle interventions in pregnancy
produce modest reductions in gestational weight gain, yet unfortunately fail to produce clinically significant
improvements in maternal and child outcomes as long hoped. Several well-defined prospective cohort studies
suggest that for women with obesity, weight maintenance during pregnancy – and specifically loss in fat mass
– may be required to reduce adverse maternal and child outcomes. However, there are no randomized
controlled trials testing the health effects of weight maintenance and significant maternal fat mass loss during
pregnancy in women with obesity. Our novel preliminary energy balance and body composition data showed
that weight maintenance during pregnancy could be achieved with careful timing of caloric restriction during the
second trimester and eucaloric goals during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Based on these and our other
preliminary data, we propose a highly rigorous proof-of-principle trial to determine the effects of a 6-month
gestational intervention with calorie restriction and food provision to promote maternal weight maintenance and
fat loss in women with obesity. Pregnant women with obesity (N = 100; 30% Hispanic; 30% Black) will be
randomized to usual care or a gestational fat mass loss (FML) intervention. The principal aims are to determine
the effects of FML during pregnancy on changes in 1) maternal weight, fat mass, and cardiometabolic risk
factors; and, 2) safety measures, including fetal and neonatal growth. All women will be assessed at baseline
(13-16 weeks), 27-29 weeks, and 35-37 weeks gestation and at 2 weeks postpartum; safety measures are
collected every 4 weeks throughout the trial. This project is significant because findings have the potential to
set the stage for a revision in national recommendations that currently encourage weight gain during
pregnancy in women with obesity; findings may lead to new guidelines that encourage practitioners to not
delay intensive weight management treatment in women with obesity who become pregnant and present for
healthcare. The study is also innovative; there have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects
of an intervention intensive enough to actually achieve weight maintenance during pregnancy and provide
much needed safety and efficacy data to inform practice recommendations for diverse women with severe
obesity who lack effective treatment options."

The primary goal of this Project is to translate near-infrared optical contrast agents for image-guided
bronchoscopy and surgery. When a patient is found to have a lung nodule, the two procedures are a
diagnostic bronchoscopy and a therapeutic surgery. However, these two procedures are plagued with
problems such as discriminating between cancerous and non-cancerous nodules, finding second
cancers, identifying positive margins, and performing an accurate back table pathological assessment.
Therefore, the success rate for bronchoscopy and surgery for lung cancer are both around 60%. There
are urgent unmet needs to develop new and innovative technologies that can assist the clinician in
localizing cancer cells, delineating tumor margins, and identifying micrometastases and draining lymph
nodes. We propose a new technology to image patients during standard-of-care bronchoscopy and
surgery in order to identify cancerous lesions, to discover residual local disease before completing the
procedure, and to render a diagnosis. While the proposed technologies are broadly applicable to solid
tumors, this project is specifically committed to improving detection of lung cancer, one of the most
aggressive human malignancies. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled a collaborative team at
University of Pennsylvania with synergistic expertise in clinical trials, lung pathology, thoracic surgery,
and imaging. The proposed work will optimize four distinct types of contrast agents in a combination or
cocktail for a translational intraoperative imaging clinical trials. The tracer combination will be evaluated
in a first-in-human clinical trial of lung cancer patients in order to determine if there is a benefit of
intraoperative imaging to standard-of-care bronchoscopy and surgery. The combination contrast agent
strategy will allow better imaging of diseased cells more deeply buried in the tissues. This will allow for
precise tumor localization and more accurate resection of cancers without violating the tumor capsule

Detection
Project Summary
One of the most significant advances in surgery has been the development of minimally invasive devices and
technologies for endoscopic, laparoscopic, and robotic assisted surgical and diagnostic procedures. In comparison
with conventional or “open” surgery, a major problem in minimally invasive surgery is however that the surgeon
loses his or her sensory/tactile feedback and cannot visualize the full field of surgical view. This problem arises
because the incisions are often so small, that surgeons cannot use their hands/fingers to directly inspect or search
for tumor nodules and lesions. Thus, there are still major technical challenges and unmet clinical needs in
developing miniaturized devices for surgical navigation and guidance under minimally invasive conditions, especially
for robotic in-body manipulation and navigation, and for real-time capturing of both anatomical and molecular
information. To address these challenges, we have assembled an academic and industrial team of senior
investigators with interdisciplinary expertise in optoelectronic imaging chip design, miniaturized instrumentation,
software engineering, and medical robotics. The overall goal is to integrate multispectral sensors, flexible robotic
manipulation, and clinically applicable targeted tracers for image-guided biopsy and surgery of undiagnosed lung
nodules and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, we will develop a multispectral imaging sensor
comprised of vertically stacked photodetectors with pixelated multispectral filters, with low readout noise (less than
one electron) and individually controlled exposure for both color RGB (red-green-blue) and near-infrared (NIR)
pixels in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) architecture. We will also develop hologram
wearable goggle devices for providing three-dimensional (3D) visualization and augmented reality display during
surgery. The hologram-based goggles will provide an augmented or mixed-reality display during surgical settings
because the surgeons can observe the patient with their natural eyesight while viewing a 3-D hologram display of
cancer tissue locations acquired by the bio-inspired multispectral imaging sensor. Furthermore, through an
academic-industrial partnership, we will collaborate with Johnson and Johnson to develop and incorporate near-
infrared molecular imaging into a robot-enabled flexible bronchoscope to locate malignant deposits in lung lesions
and lymph nodes. In summary, the overall rationale and strategies are to improve the sensitivity and specificity of
intraoperative tumor imaging during minimally invasive procedures by combining tumor targeted near-infrared
molecular tracers with bio-inspired multispectral imaging devices and three-dimensional (3-D) holographic displays.
The proposed work is expected to yield cutting-edge molecular imaging systems for surgical navigation and
guidance under minimally invasive conditions, as well as the first in-human demonstration of Johnson & Johnson's
flexible robotic bronchoscope with molecular fluorescence guidance and 3D hologram augmented reality
visualization."

The Imaging Core (Core B) provides centralized imaging support to all levels of this Program Project grant, from
small animals to human imaging. The Core combines resources from the Small Animal Imaging Facility in
Radiology, the Matthew J Ryan Veterinary School of Medicine and the Center for Precision Surgery to create a
facility with state-of-the-art instrumentation, and dedicated faculty and staff to apply NIR optical imaging to
intraoperative pulmonary surgery. The Core will focus on developing and implementing back table imaging
protocols for fluorescence imaging of tumors in situ and in surgical specimens. The goals are to improve co-
registration of fluorescence images with histopathology, accurately determine tumor margin detection and detect
micrometastases, secondary tumor deposits and cancerous lymph nodes. We will apply these techniques to
pulmonary tumor resections, bronchoscopies, and lymph node specimens. In addition, Core B will provide
imaging support to both large animal (canine) and small animal (mouse) components of this program to aid in
the translation of the new novel targeted imaging agents into the operating theater in patients with pulmonary
cancers. Part of the mission of the Core is to refine tissue processing protocols in order to co-register macro
and microscopic tissue images between surgical images and pathology. In doing so we will compare the
sensitivity and resolution of different imaging platforms and determine the sensitivity of NIR imaging and the
depth of detectable fluorescence. The Core facilitates testing of new imaging cameras, calibrating against
fluorescent standards and phantoms, and benchmarking to existing clinical and preclinical imaging scanners.
Our goal is to establish a paradigm bridging surgical imaging and pathology for the establishment of an optical

management and prognosis of lung cancer patients."
10907453,"To improve treatments for breast cancer, it is critical to understand the mechanisms mediating metastasis.
Importantly, breast cancer metastasis is driven by paracrine and juxtacrine signaling between tumor and
stromal cells, such as macrophages and platelets. In the primary tumor, macrophages enhance tumor cell
invasion and intravasation, and in the lung, macrophages enhance tumor cell extravasation, survival and
growth. Platelets also play a major role in tumor metastasis, as platelets protect circulating tumor cells from
immune surveillance, induce tumor cell EMT, and recruit neutrophils to the metastatic site. Platelets also
enhance tumor cell adhesion and extravasation at distal sites.
This proposal examines the hypothesis that the Class I PI3K, PI3Kβ, is a key regulator of metastasis. Selective
inhibitors of PI3Kβ are available, but clinical trials have largely focused on the growth of PTEN-null tumors and
have not directly addressed metastasis. Our published data show that PI3Kβ in tumor cells is required for
invasion and experimental metastasis. New preliminary data in this grant show that macrophages and platelets
expressing mutant PI3Kβ are defective for stimulating a variety of pro-metastatic responses in tumor cells.
Importantly, we also show that pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kβ in mice causes a dramatic reduction in
tumor cell extravasation in vivo.
This project will directly test the role of PI3Kβ in metastasis. Aim 1 examines the role of PI3Kβ in juxtracrine
and paracrine signaling between tumor cells and macrophages, using in vitro co-culture experiments, in vivo
tumor studies, and intravital imaging. Aim 2 examines the role of PI3Kβ in platelet-tumor interactions, focusing
on platelet modulation of tumor cell signaling and stemness. Aim 3 will study the role of PI3Kβ during
spontaneous metastasis in vivo. We will express mutant PI3Kβ in tumor cells, globally in stromal cells, and
selectively in macrophages and platelets. These studies will use intravital imaging and a novel lung window
supported by Core A to define the behavior of tumor cells, macrophages and platelets during and after
extravasation. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of the role of PI3Kβ in tumor metastasis,
and provide important preclinical data supporting the use of PI3Kβ inhibitors for metastatic disease."
10907454,"Project Summary (Project 2)
Metastasis remains a critical problem in cancer treatment. While the early steps of the metastatic
cascade are well-characterized, the mechanisms underlying late steps of metastasis, including
extravasation, survival and growth at distal sites, remain poorly understood. Breast cancer is a
heterogeneous disease comprised of functionally diverse cancer cells, among which a minor
subset of cells is highly tumorigenic and shows stem-like properties. These stem-like cells are
believed to drive tumor regrowth and propagation at the distal sites. However, genetic programs
that control cancer stemness in metastasis remain to be determined. The master regulators of
normal stem cell programs are thought to be hijacked by CSCs. We and others have recently
identified the transcription factor SOX9 as a key regulator for stemness that contributes to
metastasis. Using mammary tumor models expressing a novel SOX9 reporter, we found that
SOX9-high cancer cells are enriched in tumor-initiating and metastasis-initiating abilities.
Interestingly, early-stage metastases contain a high frequency of SOX9-high CSCs relative to
primary tumors, suggesting the metastatic niche promotes CSC expansion or induction leading to
distant metastasis. However, the exact cell-intrinsic/-extrinsic mechanisms that regulate SOX9-
mediated stemness and the signaling pathways that contribute to metastatic outgrowth
downstream of SOX9 remain unknown. Our preliminary data identified a novel role of ROS-
upregulated HIF1a in inducing SOX9 expression. In addition, results from Project 1 and 3 suggest
that cancer-stromal cell interactions promote stemness through paracrine/juxtacrine signals. Based
on the cumulative preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that SOX9-driven stemness is
potentiated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals in the metastatic niche, leading to
extravasation and metastatic outgrowth. We will determine the role of ROS/HIF1a signaling in
potentiating SOX9-driven stemness (Aim 1), understand how paracrine/juxtacrine signals from
macrophages and platelets regulate SOX9-driven stemness (Aim 2), and define the downstream
pathways mediating the action of SOX9 in extravasation and metastatic growth (Aim 3)."

formation of tumor foci within distant organs. However, only a subpopulation of cancer cells within the primary
tumor microenvironment is capable of completing the entire metastatic cascade, which includes intravasation,
survival in circulation, extravasation, and tumor growth at distant sites. We identified a population of highly
invasive, non-proliferating, non-apoptotic, chemo-resistant cancer cells capable of intravasation (published) and
extravasation (preliminary results). These cells express high levels of MenaINV, a pro-metastatic isoform of the
actin-regulatory protein Mena required for maturation of invasive protrusions called invadopodia, which enable
cancer cells to cross endothelium and disseminate. MenaINV localization to the cell membrane, which is required
for its function, may be regulated by PI3Kβ through phosphoinositide signaling. We found that MenaINV
expression (published) and a stem cell program (preliminary results) are induced in tumor cells by direct contact
with tumor-associated macrophages. Interestingly, we also found that chemotherapy co-induces MenaINV and
the stem program in a macrophage-dependent manner. The emergence of MenaINV expressing stem cells may
be one of the crucial steps to metastasis because these cells are not only transendothelial migration-competent
but also have tumor-initiating capability. In primary breast tumors, cancer cells expressing high levels of MenaINV
are able to enter blood vessels through Tumor Microenvironments of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways. These tightly
controlled transient openings in capillary walls were first described by our group and are composed of
macrophages, endothelial cells and Mena-expressing tumor cells in direct physical contact. TMEM doorways
and cancer cell re-dissemination from lung metastases are also observed in lung metastases, but it is currently
unknown if stem program is required for cancer cell dissemination from this secondary site. Interestingly, we and
others found that chemotherapy in a macrophage-dependent manner increases the proportion of cancer cells
co-expressing high levels of MenaINV and stem cell transcription factor SOX9. Thus, we hypothesize that
induction of the transendothelial migration-competent phenotype in cancer cells (identified by the expression of
MenaINV) is mechanistically linked to the stem program, and that the induction of this transendothelial migration-
competent stem phenotype is potentiated by chemotherapy. We will use high resolution intravital imaging of the
lungs in combination with stem and Mena biosensors to determine in vivo how the interplay of stemness and
MenaINV regulate extravasation and metastatic colonization of the lungs and determine the mechanism by which
chemotherapy induced hypoxia and macrophage influx affect cancer phenotype in metastatic foci in the lungs.
The successful completion of this project will increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in
development of distant metastases, and provide a base for development of anti-metastatic therapies needed for
improvement of survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer."
10907461,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The Advanced Imaging Core provides to each of the projects of this Program Project Group the staffing,
expertise, equipment, and interpretive skills needed to evaluate and test mechanisms of metastasis at the
secondary site of the lung. The services provided are unique to this Core as they have been assembled from
advances in microscopy and intravital imaging made by a number of independent laboratories within
Einstein’s Gruss-Lipper Biophotonics center. As described in detail within the research strategy, these
services consist of 1) A custom-built multi-laser multiphoton microscope; 2) Longitudinal intravital imaging at
single cell resolution; 3) In vivo lung and other secondary site imaging; 4) In vivo cell fate mapping; 5) Large-
Volume High-Resolution Intravital Imaging (LVHR-IVI); 6) A repository of biosensors for stemness,
dormancy, invasiveness, and hypoxia; 7) Correlative microscopy combining intravital imaging with
histopathology (IVITA); and 8) Quantitative digital pathology services for fixed tissue studies. In general, the
use of advanced multiphoton microscopy; the preparation of animals for imaging including anesthesia and
surgery; and the analysis and interpretation of the data collected require skill developed through practice.
 With dedicated expert staff members, Core A will centralize the equipment and knowledgebase needed
to ensure prioritized access, and proper validated usage of all of the services, to the members of this Program
Project Group in a way that ensures the rigor and reproducibility of all of the experiments. Investigators in
the various Projects of this PPG will use Core A by first consulting with senior staff to define the goals for the
experiments and prepare a protocol to achieve these goals. The staff of this core will then work with a
representative from the project to execute the experiment, with the core staff supplying the hands-on skill
during the demanding steps in animal surgery and handling, imaging and data collection to ensure uniformity
of application of the method and the quality control needed to obtain and interpret the data. Without the
services provided by Core A, our understanding of these processes would be derived from model systems
and/or end-stage assays that only approximate the physiology of lung metastasis. In contrast, our approach
is uniquely able to provide information about mechanism of in vivo behavior at the single cell level."
10907463,"Core B – Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core (Core Lead: Porcelli) Program Lead: Backer, Jonathan M.
ABSTRACT
The Flow Cytometry Analysis and Cell Sorting Core (Core B) will provide access to equipment and expertise
for a variety of advanced flow cytometry-based technologies for single cell level analysis and isolation. The
core will support and maintain a range of advanced instruments for analytic and sorting applications, and will
actively guide the program investigators in applying these to their studies on cancer metastasis. These
methodologies will be applied for the identification, isolation and detailed profiling of cell types of interest and
relevance to the goals of the program project. The resources of the core will be used extensively in all projects
comprising this program, and their organization and support under this structure will provide the Program
investigators with access and technical support in a cost effective way. The key personnel of the core will
have effort dedicated to directly assisting the program PIs in the development and implementation of single
cell analysis techniques relevant to their projects, and assist them in innovating new approaches using the
core technologies. By providing an organizing nucleus for a portfolio of flow cytometry-based single cell
analysis and isolation methods, Core B will create an infrastructure and environment for adapting these
evolving technologies to the needs of the PPG investigators. All of the essential equipment and expertise
required for this core are already in place and available at our institution. Key personnel with the necessary
background and expertise have been recruited from existing faculty and staff, and these individuals have
been designated appropriate levels of effort to ensure proper functioning of Core B. While some of the
equipment and personnel associated with the core are physically housed and partially supported within our
NCI CCSG (P30) funded Flow Cytometry Core Facility, the creation of Core B is essential to the successful
accomplishment of the goals of the PPG, as it will enable the implementation of these technologies for new
and innovative applications that specifically address the studies of cancer metastasis that form the theme of
the current program application.

The purpose of the Administrative Core is to support the objectives of the MATCHES Telehealth Research
Center by serving as the organizational hub to optimize collaboration and scientific interactivity among
MATCHES (Making Telehealth Delivery of Cancer care at Home Effective and Safe) investigators. The
services centralized in the Administrative Core provide the scientific, administrative, communications, and
fiscal infrastructure that serves all components of the proposed P50 Program. The specific aims of the
Administrative Core are to: 1) maximize operational efficiency through coordination, communication, execution,
and oversight of all Center activities; 2) engage and foster synergy and knowledge exchange among Center
members; national experts in telehealth and health system performance; and patients, leaders and workforce;
3) provide training opportunities for investigators from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, equipping them
with infrastructure, resources, skills, and mentorship to foster innovation and expand the evidence base for
when and how to integrate telehealth into cancer care; and, 4) support Center activities with strong theoretical
models, conceptual frameworks, and approaches for implementation and overall impact. The Core will
organize meetings and coordinate a Center website to disseminate knowledge; obtain ongoing feedback from
both national experts in telehealth and MSK leaders; and engage with diverse stakeholders across all Center
activities. The Core will evaluate the capacity for telehealth to enable patients to receive safe, equitable, and
effective oncology care in their own homes using the MSK@Home platform that includes support for laboratory
tests, nursing, and pharmacy supervision without necessitating a clinic visit. The Core will prioritize
measurement of the digital divide and provide the support necessary to mitigate disparities among patients at
high risk for poor-quality care resulting from racism, age, poverty, or disability. It will track utilization metrics
and help implement strategies to support equitable access, including provision of training, equipment, and web
access. To fulfill the Center's education and mentoring mission, the Core will recruit postdoctoral fellows and
provide opportunities for young investigators to learn from senior researchers in collaboration with the
Research & Methods Core. The Administrative Core will be led by M. Morris, MD, K. Panageas, DrPH, and
P.D. Stetson, MD, the PIs of MATCHES, with support from a dedicated Center Manager. This Executive Team
will share overall authority for the scientific and administrative decision-making and for the day-to-day running
of MATCHES. The Core will include six support units—Regulatory and Fiscal Unit, Clinician and Staff
Engagement Unit, Patient Engagement Unit, Training Unit, Internal Advisory Board, and External Advisory
Board—led by faculty with diverse, synergistic expertise. The Core will use cohesive conceptual frameworks to
ensure that the evidence generated by Center investigators builds on existing knowledge and is informative for
the design of telehealth-based cancer care delivery worldwide."

 The goal of the Administrative Core for the Stanford Vision Research Core grant is to provide overall
coordination, scientific and budgetary oversight to the P30 projects. The Administrative Core will continue to
foster and coordinate activities between the four Service/Resource Cores: (1) Advanced
Computing/Computational Core, (2) Device Design and Development, (3) Neurogenetics of Vision, and (4)
Imaging Structure and Function. The Administrative Core Director will liaison directly with the 4 Core Directors,
an internal Steering Committee, and an External Advisory Board to enact decisions made across these groups.
The Administrative Core Director will continue to ensure the functioning of the Administrative Core with the
following functions: 1) encourage entry into vision research by investigators not yet funded by the NEI, through
advertisement, collaborative meetings and quarterly presentations to the vision research community as part of a
new vision research minisymposium; 2) promote new collaborative activity by ensuring dissemination of new
approaches and technologies, transfer of reagents, and exchange of ideas across the campus; 3) maintain
scheduling for Core resources and an evaluative process for Core usage; 4) coordinate meetings of the
Steering Committee to oversee Core usage and overall strategy, budgetary decision making, and personnel
management, and coordinate meetings of the External Advisory Board to provide feedback on scientific
feedback and strategy to the P30 PI and Steering Committee; and 5) assure fiscal responsibility of the cores
to maximize breadth and utility in serving Aims 1 and 2 above."
10927265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human sense of sight involves the development and action of billions of neurons and glia to process the
signals in millions of photoreceptors. Understanding how vision works and how it fails in disease requires the
acquisition, storage and computational analysis of large datasets derived from human and animal studies, all to
be supported by this core to increase our knowledge of the visual system. The Stanford Vision Advanced
Computational Core will provide support in computer storage, high performance computing and programming,
bioinformatics, and biostatistics for vision research. A second aspect of the Core is to facilitate collaboration
through the exchange of adaptation of special purpose software and algorithms between laboratories that have
a need for computational modeling and analyses, but whose personnel lack sufficient computational expertise."
10930336,"As a part of the US-Japan Brain Research Cooperative Program (BRCP), in collaboration
with the stroke investigators of the NINDS StrokeNet and the National Cardiovascular Center
(NCVC) and other stroke centers in Japan, we plan to organize and conduct a workshop entitled
“Making Acute Stroke Trials Succeed: Challenges and Potential Solutions.” The intent for this
workshop is to build upon the knowledge gained from the previous workshops and the
collaboration on the ATACH-2 (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage II)
and FASTEST(rFVIIa for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Administered at Earliest Time) Trials. The
workshop has two goals: 1) To exchange information about the opportunities and barriers to
conduct collaborative stroke clinical trials that are innovative in design, patient-centered, and
pragmatic whenever possible. Such trials must consider differences in cultures, the patient care
management and regulatory systems, and financial issues. 2) To explore the use of emergency
consent procedures, and other innovative methods to facilitate enrollment in acute stroke trials
in Japan and the U.S.
 In this seminar, two main topics will be discussed. One is innovative clinical trial
methodology, the other is about emergency consenting procedures. The first day will be
dedicated to discussions on the topic of clinical trial methodology. Several biostatisticians and
trialists from the US and Japan will discuss innovative clinical trial methodology including
pragmatic trial designs, platform trials, adaptive designs, and patient-centered outcomes.
These presentations will be followed by in-depth discussion by all participants. The participants
will identify ongoing or proposed trials that have potential for collaboration.
 The second day is dedicated to discussions on the topics of exception of informed content
and emergency consenting procedures. The US Researchers will present the EFIC (Exception
from informed consent) approach and its advantages and weaknesses as well as current state
of emergency consent in other countries. Japanese researchers will discuss the results of an
international survey on the regulatory status of emergency consent. Opportunities and next
steps for emergency consent in Japan will be identified.
 These collaborative discussions will enhance the mutual understanding of acute stroke
treatments in general, as well as the design, implementation and financing of future clinical trials
of acute stroke. The workshop can be viewed as an accelerator of patient-centered global
collaborative trials and a facilitator of enrollment using emergency consent procedures in Japan."

The overarching goal of the Ohio State University (OSU) Center for Clinical and Translational Science affiliated
K12 program is to develop a cadre of well-trained, diverse, early-stage faculty investigators through
individualized training to engage fully, succeed, and lead in clinical translational research and science
(CTR/CTS). The program is open to eligible early career faculty members at the Ohio State University (OSU)
and Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH). To accomplish this, we propose the following Specific Objectives
(S.O.): S.O.1) Provide training to foster the development and long-term success of diverse, early career faculty
engaged in clinical and translational research; S.O.2) Provide mentorship training and monitor progress for
scholars, mentors, and mentor-mentee dyads; S.O.3). Support the development of skills for scholars to lead in
translational science; and S.O.4) Conduct ongoing evaluation of program and scholar outcomes for continuous
improvement. Highlights of our comprehensive, impactful, and innovative programmatic training elements
include: development of monitored individual training plans (IDP); structured communication and grant writing
preparation; leadership skill development; understanding and thriving in a team science environment; training in
responsible conduct of research; training in research ethics; training to promote diversity and inclusiveness in
research teams and participants; research design and data interpretation; and training in rigor and reproducibility
in the conduct of research. Program elements will be opened to other institutional and individual K scholars at
OSU and NCH. Training in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility is provided to both K12 mentors and
mentors. Four early career K12 scholars will be trained with two-year appointments (2 per year) supported by
the K12, followed by institutional support to continue a third year of K12 training. Scholar success will be defined
based on research productivity (particularly independent research funding in CTR/CTS) and progression in the
characteristics of a translational scientist. Scholars will be monitored during the K12 based on their IDPs with a
dedicated team of senior mentors engaged and funded in CTR/CTS and experienced in mentoring early-stage
faculty. The K12 Program will regularly track progress of of its Specific Objective by evaluating career
advancement as CTR/CTS scientists (independent research funding, publications, academic promotion) and
participation and leadership in clinical and translational research and clinical and translational science. A RE-
AIM and Logic Model framework will be used for programmatic evaluation and programmatic adaptation. The
OSU campus research environment with our urban, suburban, and rural patient communities, and the ability to
look at questions across the lifespan through our partnership with NCH provides a range of opportunities to train
future leaders in clinical and translational research and science."

The University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is dedicated to reducing the cancer burden in Hawai‘i and the
U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) through research, education, patient care, and community outreach,
emphasizing the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of the region. Our comprehensive
approach is rooted in the unique ethnic and racial diversity of our catchment area, which is distinguished by
cancer health disparities, geographic isolation, socio-economic challenges, medical provider shortages
(especially in rural or isolated areas), an aging society, rich environmental biodiversity, and a history of
traditional medicine. These unique characteristics drive our efforts, enabling us to define research priorities,
develop interventions targeted for these unique populations, and promote cancer health equity for racial and
ethnic groups specific to our catchment area. Our work impacts the local community and addresses cancer
challenges in the broader Pacific region, making UHCC a vital hub for cancer research, control, and public
health policy in this underserved geographical area. To achieve our mission, UHCC is organized into two
Research Programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Each Program
combines exploration of basic cancer mechanisms and etiologies for targeted interventions, facilitating the
translation of discoveries into cancer prevention and treatment applications for our diverse population. Our
commitment to innovative research is evident through our funding base of $15 million in peer-reviewed
funding, with 60% from the NCI. Collaboration is at our core, with 37 Members in PSP and 40 in CB,
fostering an exceptional level of intra-programmatic, inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional research
collaborations and publications. Five vital Shared Resources support our research goals: Analytical
Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Nutrition Support, and the developing Body
Composition Lab. Our Research Programs, Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), Cancer
Research Training (CRT) initiatives, and clinical trials prioritize cancers that are causes for concern in our
catchment area while driving our Plan to Enhance Diversity through institutionally aligned Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion (DEI) strategies. Our unique community-network-based clinical research enterprise provides
access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population through a UHCC-led affiliation of four
health systems. Our impact also extends beyond our immediate region through cancer prevention activities
across the Pacific, including partnerships with the University of Guam and others. This collaborative approach
has influenced cancer control policy in the State and the USAPI, underscoring the significance of UHCC in the

This is a renewal of the NCI-supported Mayo Clinic SPORE in Hepatobiliary Cancers (HBC), with a foundation
built upon innovative translational science and utilizing state-of-the-art approaches to understand and treat liver
cancers; these are the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the country. The breadth of the projects spans
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and pediatric/young adult fibrolamellar (FLC).
Three unique translational projects promise significant steps forward, supported by three well-constructed and respon-
sive cores. Additionally, robust Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs continue to identify
and support talented HBC-investigators, many from underrepresented groups. Ongoing support from the Mayo
Foundation and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center benefit these components by enabling integrated
resources, skilled staff, and leadership guidance to ensure success. The approach remains comprehensive,
milestone focused, and patient centered. For example, the completion of former Project 3 has led to a novel first-in-
class compound that has advanced to clinical trial. Three projects have developed successfully into innovative renewal pro-
jects that utilize novel approaches of immunotherapeutics, computational biology, and chemical genomics. The translational
projects in this renewal proposal investigate HBC biology to enhance therapeutic response, building on recent,
promising clinical and preclinical advances, summarized below. Diagnostics and drug repurposing for FLC: Pro-
ject 1 demonstrates 1) differential therapeutic sensitivity of FLC but with 2) variability in patient responsiveness,

10935480,"Developmental Research Program - Abstract
The UNC Breast Cancer SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) has promoted novel breast cancer
research across the population, translational, and clinical arenas. This highly successful Program includes
mechanisms for stimulating grant applications, rigorously evaluating proposals, selecting projects with
advocate input, and monitoring progress. A new component will specifically solicit and evaluate DRP proposals
from underrepresented in medicine (URIM) faculty including those from our two historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCU) partners. Shelton Earp, MD, who has led this program since its inception in 1992 will
continue to oversee the DRP with process and evaluation with assistance from Marjory Charlot, MD, MPH,
MSc, LCCC Assistant Director of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), David Darr, MBA, MSc,
LCCC Associate Director for Administration, and Victoria Doyle SPORE Administrator. Application
mechanisms include both regular competitive awards as well as rapidly emerging opportunities. Evaluation and
selection processes include a well-established, independent peer review that includes patient advocates and
LCCC COE Community Advisors. The SPORE Multi-PIs, with input from the Executive Committee, make final
decisions regarding selection and budget. During the last cycle, we expanded formal solicitation to other UNC
system universities, including our U54 HBCU partner, NC Central University, the other public medical school in
NC at East Carolina University, and two STEM-focused partner institutions, NC State University, and more
recently NC Agriculture & Technical State University (NC A&T), the US’s largest historically Black institution.
The program has increased in the past decade due to increased institutional commitment. In this next cycle,
this commitment will total $225,000 yearly, the current commitment of $200,000 with an additional $25,000 to
match the new SPORE increment for grants to URIM applicants. This allows a robust twice-yearly solicitation
for competitive DRP awards across UNC and our sister UNC System universities. UNC Lineberger’s
commitment to the Breast SPORE goes beyond this, with the Multi-PIs and Cancer Center investing directly in
major programs (e.g., CBCS Phase 4), infrastructures (tripling of the size of the cellular therapy GMP facility)
and technology (a new NovaSeq and the recent COSMx purchase). The Multi-PIs co-conceptualize the
emerging investments with the needs of CEP recruits in mind. Since the last renewal, the program funded thirty
projects, initiating two renewal full SPORE projects as well as seeding preliminary research yielding extramural
funding from non-SPORE sources and important publications. In this renewal, we are requesting a $75,000
DRP budget to include the $25,000 yearly for research by URIM faculty; our CEP efforts have recruited eight
URIM faculty whose research programs we wish to develop."
10935481,"Career Enhancement Program - Abstract
The long-term success of national efforts to reduce breast cancer incidence and mortality rests in part on the
ability of Breast Cancer SPORE programs to attract and build the translational research careers of talented
young faculty. Since 1992, the UNC Breast Cancer SPORE has used career development funds to promote
the breast cancer research careers of selected investigators. The SPORE Career Enhancement Program
(CEP) both recruits externally and identifies internal faculty with interest in translational breast cancer research.
The CEP then matches junior faculty with training offerings and senior mentors. We seek to enrich the field
with our efforts to recruit qualified women and underrepresented in medicine (URIM) as both participants and
mentors in the program. DRP funding for junior investigators also adds to the pool of developing translational
faculty. Over the 29 years of the program, approaches to recruitment for funding by the CEP has included a
focus on women and faculty from underrepresented-in-medicine (URIM) groups. Our success in this regard is
accelerating; during this past cycle we recruited 17 faculty of eight of whom are URIM and twelve are women.
Co-recruitment with departments across campus attracts exceptional talent to UNC and its Cancer Center. The
SPORE CEP makes available extended training for junior faculty with an interactive group of respected and
successful investigators who can influence and help build careers. The combination of an excellent talent pool
and an effective training and mentoring program has resulted in an elite cadre of breast cancer researchers
contributing to national breast cancer effort.
As noted, during the last five years, the CEP has attracted 17 participants; 12 were women and 8 were from
URIM groups. Several have already been funded by NCI or foundations. Our CEP participants’ contributions
over the programs almost 30 years include published research, funded grants, clinical trials, and collaborative
breast cancer research across the spectrum of population, basic, clinical and translational research. Over this
time, CEP program participants have become SPORE leaders. On this renewal alone are past CEP awardees,
Charles Perou (Multi-PI and co-PI of Project #3), Lisa Carey (Multi-PI and co-PI of Project #3), Melissa
Troester (co-PI of Project #1), Katie Reeder-Hayes (co-PI of Project #1), Claire Dees (co-PI on Project #4), and
Katie Hoadley (co-Investigator on Project #1, #3 and the Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core), Gaorav Gupta
(co-PI on Project 2), and Benjamin Vincent (co-PI on Project #2).
To continue this success this UNC Breast Cancer SPORE requests $50,000 yearly to support career
development; these funds will combine with an average of $500,000 yearly in institutional funds provided for
recruitment, start- up commitments and career development. SPORE leaders will continue to identify, recruit,
and develop talented URIM and women faculty."
10934860,"Often serving as the initial point of contact between our research project investigators (users) and the
Neurometabolomics and Neuroproteomics Center on Cell-Cell Signaling, the Sampling and Separation Core
focuses on developing and advancing sample preparation and fractionation techniques for in-depth chemical
analysis of brain neurochemistry across various tissue, cell, and subcellular levels. Accurate and precise
sampling is essential for successful proteome, peptidome, and metabolome investigations. Unlike DNA/RNA-
based molecular techniques, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of proteins and metabolites in volume- and mass-
limited samples lacks a significant signal amplification step. This Core offers unmatched capabilities in the
sampling of tissues, cells, and organelles, enabling the chemical characterization of various classes of molecules
from an ever-increasing range of samples and animal models. Our philosophy is that directed sampling is
fundamental to reducing the intrinsic chemical and morphological complexity of heterogeneous neuronal systems
to achieving effective measurement of dynamic brain systems. The methodological advances we have
developed already provide better results for experiments that, in some cases, would have been considered
impossible to perform without these approaches. A unifying strategy for studies employing separation methods
is that they seek to fractionate complex tissue samples into components that make them more accessible for in-
depth chemical characterization via MS analysis in the Molecular Profiling and Characterization Core. Since our
inception, we have expanded our analytical toolset to include a number of both well-established and innovative
approaches for analyte sampling and separation, thus providing robust processing of nervous system samples
for metabolite, peptide, and protein characterization. Obviously, this Core is closely linked to the needs of our
users, and exists within the framework of the entire Center. Only when integrated with the Molecular Profiling
and Characterization Core, and the Bioinformatics, Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling Core, and also the
Pilot Research Project Core, are we able to generate the biological information required by our users. Simply
stated, the Sampling and Separation Core links the biological user base to the rest of the Center and lays the
foundation for successful Center-to-user project outcomes. The close interactions between the neuroscience
users and the Sampling Core chemists and biologists enables a robust synergy. Our user base has become
increasingly aware of the advantages provided by the analytical tools and expertise available to them through
our Core. So too have the facility chemists gained greater familiarity with the diversity of sample types, from a
fruit fly brain to a cow brain, with sample sizes ranging from whole brain extracts to single cells, to individual
organelles. We integrate the methodologies with the neuroscience to ensure that we continue to empower the
broader NIDA and neuroscience research community with advanced measurement technologies."
10934861,"The Molecular Profiling and Characterization Core is the heart of the UIUC Neuroproteomics Center on Cell-Cell
Signaling. Understanding the role of brain chemistry in health, pain management, drug addiction, and withdrawal
requires knowledge of the molecules within the brain and their associated neurochemical pathways. The large
assortment of chemical messengers and the diversity of their chemical and physical properties require a complex
suite of measurement techniques and integrated approaches for dissecting the molecular components of cell-to-
cell communication. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a central technique for precise molecular profiling and
characterization of complex neurological systems. The primary mission of the Molecular Profiling and
Characterization Core is to augment our understanding of addiction-associated processes using MS-based
analytics to provide qualitative, quantitative, and functional data on the molecular drivers involved in cell-cell
signaling. Positioned between the Sampling and Separation Core and Bioinformatics, Data Analytics and
Predictive Modeling Core, this core executes defined studies with maximal data quality and provides tailored MS
methods for enabling user-specific experiments that lie at or near current technological limits. We have the
outstanding analytical capabilities and well-documented expertise to effectively probe diverse signaling
components within tissues, individual cells, and their extracts and releasates with spatial and temporal resolution.
These measurements capitalize on the careful study design and rigorous execution by professional staff capable
of developing and implementing validated methods across the Center. Between the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and Northwestern University, we are well-equipped with an extensive suite of high-
resolution, tandem mass spectrometers and sampling capabilities that are suitable for imaging and molecular
analysis of neuropeptides, metabolites, proteins, proteoforms, and protein complexes across a wide molecular-
weight range. For targeted and omics-level investigations, defined study designs are categorized as “Bottom-
Up” shotgun approaches in which proteins are digested to various extents prior to MS analysis, and the “Top-
Down” approach in which the intact proteins or whole native protein complexes are introduced into the mass
spectrometer for structural characterization by tandem MS at proteoform-level resolution. We exploit the
complementarity of these approaches within the context of specific Center-supported research projects to
maximize the molecular specificity and coverage for identification and quantitation of proteins and their post-
translational modifications. Future studies will benefit from high-resolution information on relative and absolute
amounts of bioactive neuropeptide and metabolite levels obtained in either targeted or discovery modes of
operation. We also employ MS imaging approaches to illuminate the “hidden” peptidome, metabolome, and
proteoform landscape to elucidate key molecules and pathways involved in drug abuse and inform treatments
for associated conditions such as drug addiction and withdrawal."
10934862,"The Bioinformatics, Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling Core has two primary objectives: i) to assist the
Center users with bioinformatics, statistical, and programming needs, and ii) to develop and facilitate access to
insightful analytical and predictive resources that enable the mining of high-throughput transcriptomic, proteomic,
and metabolomic experiments. Working closely with the Sampling and Separation and Molecular Profiling and
Characterization Cores, our data analyses enhance the understanding of cell-cell signaling mechanisms
associated with drug abuse and pain perception. The Bioinformatics Core stands out as a global leader in
annotating neuropeptide genes and their corresponding peptide products, and developing web services that
support research on neuropeptide, proteoform, and protein complex identification, quantification, and annotation.
Core products include the development and continuous update of comprehensive catalogs of neuropeptide
genes and products, proteoforms, and metabolites. The Bioinformatics Core’s impact is profound, as evidenced
by the number of publication citations and active utilization of the core's web services, including NeuroPred,
neuroProSight, PepShop, TDPortal, and the Human and Mouse Brain Proteoform Atlases, demonstrating the
ongoing demand for our bioinformatic and analytical services. Moving forward, the primary mission of this core
remains the support of Center users in the design and analysis of data from high-throughput ‘omic experiments
planned to test hypotheses about molecular processes associated with cell-cell signaling, drug abuse, and pain
perception. To address existing gaps in high-throughput ‘omic research of the molecular processes underlying
cell-cell signaling, drug abuse, and pain perception, the Bioinformatics Core has outlined the following specific
aims: 1) advance the understanding of targeted molecules and biomarkers through multi-omics analysis at both
single-cell and aggregate level supported by user-friendly web services; 2) assist preclinical breakthroughs by
providing enriched annotation of key molecules, their isoforms, and networks; 3) precisely characterize
proteoforms and protein complexes; and 4) prepare and empower junior researchers to employ bioinformatics
resources through educational materials and training. The proposed activities address the surge in demand for
artificial intelligence-guided analysis of ‘omic data driven by advancements that yield vast amounts of
information, such as the transition from bulk to single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics,
and metabolomics. Our core excels in developing bioinformatics pipelines that integrate information across
platforms and employs Big Data to Knowledge approaches to capture multi-omic data signals and variability,
and sift through noise. The Bioinformatics Core’s innovation hinges on facilitating the exploration of transcript,
peptide, and metabolic isoforms that significantly impact drug abuse and pain perception. While the primary
focus is on unraveling the molecular mechanisms of drug abuse and pain, the core’s efforts are expected to
advance research in other physiological and behavioral disorders."
10934863,"The Pilot Research Project Core actively seeks, assesses, and supports novel and forward-thinking feasibility
(pilot) studies within the UIUC Neuroproteomics and Neurometabolomics Center on Cell-Cell Signaling. Our
Core and Center thrive when we facilitate the achievements of promising young investigators who are new to
our 'omics measurement capabilities or addiction research, while also encouraging experienced researchers to
extend their research to substance use/misuse and addiction. The selected pilot projects will have access to our
considerable Center resources available through our scientific cores—Sampling and Separation, Molecular
Profiling and Characterization, and Bioinformatics, Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling—to generate the data
required for continued research and potential for longer-term support. The Pilot Research Project Core ensures
that the NIDA / neuroscience research community continues to take advantage of the opportunities and expertise
offered by our Center. Applicants who propose feasibility studies, who want to explore how to incorporate ‘omics
data into their research, or what to start a new direction that fits the NIDA and Center research areas may qualify
for support from the Pilot Core. To improve overall Center capabilities that will benefit multiple users, the Pilot
Core will also support small technical, methodological, or conceptual developments from staff and users to
improve Center measurement and informatics capabilities. Toward those goals, we outline three exemplary initial
pilot projects targeting neuropeptides, transmitters, and proteins that are involved in multiple aspects of drug
use. The first project aims to identify substrates of a receptor linked to addiction and neural plasticity. The second
project focuses on characterizing neuropeptides to understand genetic factors contributing to oxycodone-related
phenotypes and their role in opioid use disorder development. The third project aims to perform single-cell
transcriptomics measurements for the project investigator, with the developed technology also benefiting other
Center projects. We will solicit new proposals each year, and support up to eight additional projects for
competitive review by the Core over the next five years. The Core has a rigorous process in place to solicit,
assess, and select Pilot projects. Overall, the Pilot Research Project Core, an important component of the Center
for Neuroproteomics and Neurometabolomics on Cell-Cell Signaling, encourages the use of cutting-edge
technology, fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, and accelerates progress in addiction research."
10920004,"Project Summary. Natural product-derived RNA splice modulators are being developed for the treatment of
acute myeloid leukemia as well as other cancers. As natural products with complex molecular architectures,
analogue synthesis, evaluation, and production scale up have proven challenging. Here we utilize the tools of
synthetic biology as a platform to synthesize complex polyketide splice modulators. The most established set of
splice modulators share a common mode of action targeting the SF3B multi-protein component within the U2-
snRNP of the spliceosome. They also share a common motif comprised of two functional moieties united through
a central diene. Combining the molecular diversity provided by medicinal chemistry with the flexibility and the
ability to scale metabolite production using synthetic biology, we will produce 17S-FD-895, a highly potent, in
vivo active lead for AML. This will overcome the chemical production bottleneck that is preventing this life saving
compound from reaching clinical trials. From this medicinal synthetic biology approach, we will identify a
promising production candidate that has the pre-clinical credentials to be further developed as a novel anticancer
therapeutic."
10920047,"Project Summary
Protein quality control is a fundamental system in the cell that is important for normal cellular
functions and defense against potential pathogenic insults. Protein misfolding and aggregation
are a central feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complexity of
neurodegeneration calls for large-scale unbiased screening studies. Over the past few years,
we have made breakthrough observations that have significant implications for the
understanding of cellular defense systems against proteotoxicity. Using a unique blend of
biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches, we discovered a novel pathway to
reprogram protein quality control, and with new genetic hits related to this pathway. Our work
has elucidated a previously unrecognized network in protein quality control. The studies on this
network could expand our understanding of proteotoxic-stress-responsive quality control
systems in the cell, beyond the well-established heat shock response or unfolded protein
response. The findings will suggest new strategies for harnessing the cellular defense system
to prevent and treat the relevant forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with
proteotoxicity. Our project will be focused on investigating novel molecular targets that are
identified through unbiased screens and testing new small molecule compounds that have
been designed to be specific inhibitors of this target. We predict that the advances gained
through our research efforts will eventually lead to new therapeutic interventions to address the
relevant neurodegenerative diseases."
10923871,"ABSTRACT
About 20-40% of breast cancer patients develop metastasis to the bone, years to even decades after surgical
removal of primary tumors. Little is known about the biology of the latent, microscopic bone metastases before
they outgrow to overt osteolytic macrometastases. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of
bone metastasis. Targeting cancer cells that have not fully adapted to the bone microenvironment might
provide therapeutic benefit and prevent the occurrence of overt metastases. Bone and bone marrow comprise
of several highly distinctive microenvironment niches. Dormant, single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) reside
in the perivascular niche, whereas proliferative, multi-cell bone micrometastases (BMMs) are found in the
osteogenic niche that exhibits features of active osteogenesis. Mechanisms through which the transition of
different niches occurs to switch fates of metastatic seeds remain elusive. The overall objectives of this project
are to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics, the molecular crosstalk, and the therapeutic targets underlying
the interaction between breast cancer cells and different microenvironment niches in bone. We will pursue
three specific aims. First, we will dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the perivascular and osteogenic
niches and the cancer-niche interactions in bone micrometastasis models. We will use high-resolution, whole-
bone, multi-photon microscopy and laser-captured microdissection (LCM) followed by transcriptome profiling
(LCM-seq) to obtain relative localization and mutual impacts between cancer cells and niche cells in situ.
Second, we will integrate transcriptomic and imaging data and develop computational models for discovery of
new mechanisms and therapies toward blockade of cancer-niche interactions. Established and new algorithms
will be used to uncover the microenvironment molecules, and autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways
mediating niche-tumor interactions. Drug-repurposing analyses will be carried out to identify potential therapies
that have already been used for other diseases. We will achieve a systematic understanding of early-stage
bone colonization and generate testable mechanistic and therapeutic hypotheses. Third, we will validate the
discovered mechanisms and predicted drug efficacies in animal models. The Zhang laboratory has adopted
and established a series of genetically engineered mouse models and bone metastasis assays, which will be
utilized to validate computational predictions generated by computational modeling by the Wong group. Both
metastatic burden and frequency/distribution of DTCs and BMMs will be examined as endpoints. This study will
unbiasedly profile the molecular process of early stage metastasis progression in the bone from DTCs to
BMMs at single-to-few cell resolutions. This knowledge is unprecedented and critical for the ultimate
understanding of metastasis latency, a long-standing clinical challenge. The modeling tool developed through
this study will likely be applicable to other biological contexts involving highly spatiotemporally specific cancer-
niche interaction. The computer-aided drug repurposing will likely lead to fast clinical translation."
10926902,"CORE B: Functional Annotation Core
ABSTRACT
The ultimate goal of the Program is to develop novel statistical methods to study cancer. One
important aspect of it is to understand the biology, or function, underlying the large amount of data
that will be analyzed. All four projects in this program will deal with large amount genetic and
protein data. Functional annotations to these datasets will be crucial for each project to properly
analyze the data and interpret the results. In the current funding period, the Core developed an
integrated annotation query system (AnnoQ, www.annoq.org) that incorporates existing external
annotation tools and resources, as well as in-house annotation infrastructure, including Peregrine
(www.peregrineproj.org), an enhancer to gene link database developed by this core. The system
allows researchers to quickly retrieve annotation data through either an interactive user interface
or a programmatic API. It is currently in beta release and is being used by many researchers
within USC.
We will continue to improve the system by focusing on data quality, system performance, and
user support. It will be our top priority to keep the annotation data up to date, and to maintain high
quality and accuracy of the data. Benchmarking studies will be designed to analyze and evaluate
the quality of the data. In additional, query software and packages using the AnnoQ system will
be developed and made available through Core C. With anticipated increase in data size and user
traffic, hardware upgrade and enhancement of internet security will become essential. Finally,
regular meetings with program members will allow us to provide proper training and ensure that
the system meets their needs."

inter-programmatic collaboration and translation to population research in the Cancer Control & Population 
Science Research (CCPS) Program and clinical-translational research in the Cancer Therapeutics Research
(CT) Program to address cancers that are prevalent in New Mexico’s catchment area and the nation. Our 
overarching goals are to conduct outstanding cancer-relevant research in order to discover the cellular and 
molecular mechanisms that govern tumor initiation and drive cancer progression. These goals are accomplished 
through thematic research encompassing three scientific aims: (1) Carcinogenic Mechanisms of Environmental 
Exposures: To discover the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which environmental carcinogens and 
behavioral risk factors relevant to our catchment area promote cancer; (2) Genome Regulation: To define the 
mechanisms and pathways by which genome stability, epigenetic alterations, and transcriptional regulation are 
disrupted in cancer cells; and (3) Cellular Signaling and the Tumor Microenvironment: To determine how cell 
signaling pathways, cellular activities, and cell-cell interactions are altered during cancer initiation and 
progression and within the tumor microenvironment. The Program is led by Steven Belinsky, PhD, Mary Ann 
Osley, PhD, and Michelle Ozbun, PhD (incoming program co-leader as of 2020), who bring complementary 
expertise in the areas of molecular and cellular biology. The 37 Full Members and 4 Associate Members are 
drawn from 6 Basic Science and 4 Clinical Departments and Divisions in the UNM School of Medicine, and the 
UNM College of Pharmacy. The Program also takes advantage of the expertise of investigators in 2 UNM main 
campus departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) and Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
as well as state-of-the-art technologies provided by CCSG-supported Shared Resources. Annual direct cost 
funding as of 9/1/2020 equaled $8.7M ($2M from the NCI and $8M peer-reviewed). The discoveries made in 
this Program resulted in 352 publications, of which 38% were intra-programmatic collaborations and 26% were 
inter-programmatic collaborations, with a total collaborative publication level of 53%. Going forward, CMO will 
promote the growth of our new Program through expansion of program expertise and enhancement of program 
collaborations. CMO will continue to grow its expertise in discovery of the basic cellular and molecular 
mechanisms driving cancer, and build on its unique technological capabilities in advanced cell and tissue 
imaging, computer modeling, and state-of-the-art genomics to drive fundamental research in cancer etiology and 
progression and translate results to the clinic, our population and beyond."

The overall goal of Core C is to provide researchers involved with the Program Project with
support and guidance for all their computational needs while developing their code, as well as
assistance with implementation of algorithms in the form of scientific software. As such, Core C
will play a central role in the success and impact of each of the research projects. We have
organized the Core activities into two main aims: High-Performance Computing [HPC] and
Scientific Code Development. In doing so, we are conscious of two key concepts: Reliability, and
Scalability.
Our first Specific Aim focuses on high-performance computing. The Core will be involved in
activities ranging from developing and allocating resources for computation, to actively reviewing
or developing new methods for dealing with data that may be both ‘big’ and complex. Specifically,
we will focus on the use of parallel computing, cloud computing technologies, and out-of-memory
data analysis techniques.
Our second Specific Aim focuses on scientific code development. Software tools are a corner-
stone component when it comes to the diffusion and wide-spread use of novel statistical methods.
The Core will assist members in developing the code for such software, with a special emphasis
on the efficient implementation of algorithms, based on two fundamental principles, reliability and
scalability. To this end, we will develop standards and guidelines on scientific software
development--including themes such as documentation, version control, continuous integration
and unit tests--to be followed by the project members. Furthermore, Core C will both advise and
actively participate in the implementation process of the methods developed by each project.
Ultimately, the Core will be involved throughout the process all the way from initial algorithmic
design and implementation of the methods, up to final software design, packaging and public
release.
Additionally, the Core will play a number of other key roles supporting the other Program Project
components. Examples of these include resource allocation, simulation of test data, and
development of computational-methods tutorials that can be distributed in partnership with the
educational efforts of Core D."

The annual “Principles of STI and HIV Research and Public Health Practice” course was launched by the
University of Washington in 1993 to provide an intensive overview of skills and foundational knowledge required
for research careers in the field of STI/HIV. Since then, it has evolved into a globally-recognized cornerstone of
STI/HIV research training with over 3,500 participants trained to date from over 25 countries and 6 continents.
The proposed R13 is for partial support of the course / training conference for the next five years. The course
objectives are to train early-stage STI/HIV investigators from diverse backgrounds to:
(1) Describe the biologic, clinical, epidemiological and social/behavioral aspects of STI of contemporary public
 health importance;
(2) Identify outstanding scientific questions and develop a research design or program evaluation to answer
 these scientific questions;
(3) Gain experience applying different strategies from research and/or public health program evaluation to
 answer emerging questions in the field of HIV/STI;
(4) Gain experience working on a multidisciplinary team of STI/HIV researchers and practitioners and provide
 opportunities for social interaction and networking;
(5) Discuss the different opportunities and career paths available in STI/HIV research and practice fields for US
 domestic and international public health; and
(6) Provide opportunities for professional networking with peers and course faculty
To meet these objectives, the course takes an interdisciplinary approach and provides early-stage investigators
with tools for continued learning, collaboration in multidisciplinary teams, and maintaining a broad scope of
investigative possibilities. This course offers a unique opportunity for state-of-the-art introductory training in
behavioral, clinical, epidemiologic, statistical, implementation, and basic science research on STI/HIV through a
practically-oriented overview of concepts and skills common to these broad disciplines. Course proceedings are

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are abundant components of human milk that hold extraordinary potential
as novel formula supplements and therapeutic agents to improve gut inflammatory disorders, autoimmune and
allergic diseases. Originally considered prebiotics that help shape the gut microbiome of breastfed infants, some
HMOs are increasingly becoming known for their beneficial immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.
HMOs prevent pathogen attachment to infant mucosal surfaces to lower the risk of infections, modulate epithelial
and immune cell responses, reduce excessive mucosal leukocyte infiltration and activation, and lower the risk of
necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the inability to source pure, structurally defined complex HMOs in sufficient
quantities has hindered their systematic study and efforts to leverage the extraordinary biomedical potential of
these commercially relevant human milk bioactives. In response to the critical need to significantly improve the
production efficiency of HMOs, Zymtronix is applying its proprietary multienzyme immobilization technology to
produce most HMO milk constituents via cell-free biomanufacturing, thereby removing a major barrier to their
investigation in the infant and adult therapeutic space—a mission aligned with the Glycoscience NIH Common
Fund. In Phase I, Zymtronix demonstrated successful production of multiple HMOs. In this Phase II project,
Zymtronix proposes to significantly improve the production efficiency of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs),
initially focusing on a sialylated HMO which has been demonstrated to be highly protective against necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) – a devastating inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder with a 10-50% mortality rate in
premature infants and total annual cost burdens upwards of $1B. To validate the quality and efficacy of this
compound in small and large animal models of NEC, Zymtronix is partnering with Drs. Lars Bode (UCSD) and
Doug Burrin (Baylor College of Medicine), world-class experts in HMOs, pediatric nutrition, and gastroenterology.
Phase II Aims are to optimize biocatalytic production (Aim 1), conduct a proof-of-concept study to replicate
efficacy study in rats (Aim 2), demonstrate a scalable production and purification method (Aim 3), and for the
first time, demonstrate the use of this sialylated HMO at multi-gram scale in piglets (Aim 4). The project will
establish a cost-effective and industrially scalable method of production that will put 100s grams quantities into
the hands of researchers and commercial partners who desire to systematically investigate its efficacy against
NEC with the long-term goal of substantially improving the outcome for neonates at risk of NEC. This HMO is
just one of several beneficial molecules that will be substantially more accessible as an outcome of the proposed
work, creating the ability to utilize these free glycans in a wide range of applications from nutrition to therapeutics."
10933010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sarya LLC (Sarya) is a nuclear medicine technology company formed to commercialize radiopharmaceuticals.
The goal of this Fast-Track STTR is to develop a new specific imaging agent for diagnosis, staging, and
treatment of the hematological cancer, multiple myeloma (MM). MM is the 2nd most common blood cancer with
an estimated 32,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths per year. Accurate detection is critical for enhancing
survival in MM patients. Traditional skeletal survey and bone scans have sensitivity limitations for osteolytic
lesions manifested in MM. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) performed with a PET radiopharmaceutical
(imaging agent) is a sensitive, quantitative and non-invasive clinical imaging technology to accurately detect,
localize and phenotype MM cells throughout the body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the only FDA-approved
PET imaging agent for MM. Unfortunately, MM cells express low levels of GLUT-1 transporter and hexokinase,
which are required for FDG uptake and retention. Additionally MM bone marrow harbors FDG-avid
inflammatory cells. There is an unmet need for molecularly targeted, sensitive and specific MM imaging agents
that can accurately stage and restage MM, identify high-risk MM patients, guide personalized MM treatment,
and evaluate clinical response to treatment. The product of this STTR will be a specific and sensitive PET
imaging agent (64Cu-LLP2A) for MM. Published data and ongoing first-in-human trial results have significantly
informed the Phase I and II aims of this proposal. The Phase I Segment consists of two specific aims: (1)
Perform dose escalation and single dose toxicity testing in mice. (2) Compile data for new dose and submit
amendment of eIND to FDA. Three milestones will be met in Phase I: (1) A new mass will be selected based
on no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), i.e. clinical signs of organ toxicity (vehicle vs experimental). (2)
Based on the new determined mass, and in vivo preclinical image quality data, a new specific activity (Ci/mol)
will be established. (3) Obtain FDA approval of Sarya sponsored amended eIND application. The Phase II
segment involves a clinical trial and has one specific aim: Quantify the efficacy of 64Cu-LLP2A-PET imaging for
detecting active MM in humans in a prospective imaging trial. Phase II milestones are: (1) Demonstrate high
detection rates (% of scans that are positive for a focal lesion, p<0.05) for 64Cu-LLP2A versus FDG in MM
patients. (2) Accuracy of 64Cu-LLP2A for active MM will be assessed using standard-of-care bone marrow
(BM) biopsies and serum biomarker M-protein levels as the standards of reference. A correlation coefficient of
0.7 will be considered reasonably strong. In summary, Phase I will prove feasibility that 64Cu-LLP2A is tolerable
with NOAEL resulting in a new eIND. Phase II will provide 64Cu-LLP2A-PET preliminary performance data to
support a New Drug Application for 64Cu-LLP2A as a New Molecular Entity (NME) for FDA approval of Phase 2
clinical trials."

While most patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) present with near normal functioning at the time of
diagnosis, a growing number of survivors suffer profound disability from delayed onset of lower cranial
neuropathy (LCNP) as a latent sequela of curative radiotherapy (RT). By 5 years’ survival, our group published
that at least 5% of patients cured of OPC develop LCNP with cumulative lifetime risk exceeding 10%. LCNP is
associated with excess symptom burden, disrupting critical functions of eating, breathing, and speaking.
Crippling swallowing dysfunction manifest by LCNP results in refractory aspiration of food and liquids into the
lungs. The investigators published that delayed, typically lifelong feeding tube insertion, tracheostomy, and
pneumonia years after cure of OPC occur almost exclusively in survivors who develop LCNP. Our publications
report functional loss over time after LCNP despite standard therapies. New therapy strategies are badly
needed. LCNP is clinically detected a median of 5 to 8 years after RT after a “quiet period” of functional recovery.
There is currently no early indicator for this injury. Delayed identification means that muscle atrophy and
symptomatic functional injury is typically present at the time of diagnosis, limiting therapeutic potential. Our long-
term goal is to improve lifelong function and health after OPC through mechanistically targeted and technically
nimble surveillance and mitigation of LCNP. Our central hypothesis is that subclinical cranial neuropathy is
prevalent early and increases over time after OPC RT as an untapped target for proactive mitigation strategies,
and novel patient reported outcome (PRO) and non-invasive objective measures with remote monitoring
potential are sensitive clinical markers of LCNP. The objective of the proposed study is to analyze gold-standard
needle EMG and non-invasive nerve function measures as correlative procedures in an ongoing large-scale
OPC cohort that captures robust longitudinal PRO and functional data to: Aim 1: estimate rates of hypoglossal
neuropathy (per gold standard EMG) over first 12 years post-RT; Aim 2: provide clinic ready symptom-based
and non-invasive objective clinical markers of LCNP by examining: a) a candidate multi-symptom nerve score
from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory – Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN), b) high-density surface EMG
(HDSEMG) as a rapid, non-invasive neurophysiologic measure of hypoglossal neuropathy, and c) mobile app-
based speech acoustic measures; Aim 3: conduct a 3-arm feasibility RCT for go/no go decision on high-dose
steroid and behavioral therapies for subclinical EMG detected XII neuropathy. Building upon the infrastructure
of the MD Anderson OPC cohort and investigators’ track record of non-invasive signal measurement in the
tongue and supportive care trials in OPC, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish these complementary aims.
We expect this Project integrated within the OPC-SURVIVOR P01 has potential for practice changing insights
regarding time to nerve injury, non-invasive measurement, and earlier evidence-based mitigation."
10923727,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) constitute a serious public health issue, impacting almost half of
adolescents and over 60% of adults in the United States. High ACEs exposure (i.e., four or more ACEs) may
result in self-dysregulation (i.e., challenges managing cognitions, emotions, and behaviors) and lead to early
initiation of alcohol and substance use (e.g., self-medication hypothesis) and other biopsychosocial responses,
such as cardiometabolic risks (e.g., lowered heart rate variability [HRV], increased weight and blood pressure,
and sleep disturbance), and emotional and/or cognitive dysregulation. Health inequities resulting from self-
dysregulation are highest among minoritized and impoverished populations, who experience disproportionately
higher exposure to ACEs, and early adolescence is a time in which experimentation with alcohol and drugs
occurs. Although not all adolescents who experiment with drugs are later diagnosed with a substance use
disorder, those who engage early (i.e., before the age of 14) and regularly are at greater risk. Youth with four or
more ACEs may experience a unique type of adversity characterized by chronic, unpredictable stress shaping
their perception of and responses to stress. However certain strategies, called Shift and Persist, can mitigate
these exposures where one shifts their attention from adverse experiences to future-directed behaviors (e.g.,
healthy habit adoption, stress management), resulting in improved self-regulation and lower cardiometabolic
risks. GRIT is a community health worker (CHW)-delivered psychoeducational health coaching intervention that
promotes coping with high exposure to ACEs to regulate the stress response using self-regulation techniques
and the development of healthy habits recommended by the California Surgeon General (e.g., supportive
relationships, quality sleep, physical activity). We propose conducting a 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial
(RCT) (GRIT vs an active control [i.e., digital citizenship]) with 210 adolescent-caregiver dyads to determine
GRIT’s impact on preventing the early initiation of regular use of alcohol and cannabis among adversity-impacted
adolescents ages 11-14 who do not regularly use alcohol or cannabis at baseline. The specific aims will: Aim
1. Examine the effect of GRIT on preventing the early initiation of regular alcohol and cannabis use over time.
H1: Adolescents enrolled in GRIT will have lower rates of regular alcohol and/or cannabis use at post-
intervention, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups compared to adolescents in the active control group. Aim 2. Examine
the role of youth and caregiver self-regulation in mediating the effect of GRIT on adolescent rates of alcohol and
cannabis use. H2: Youth and caregiver self-regulation will mediate youth initiation of regular alcohol and
cannabis use. This community-based study seeks to establish efficacy for a brief, accessible secondary
prevention program. Once efficacy is established and the mechanism of action is identified, larger confirmatory
efficacy studies and effectiveness trials using innovative in additional settings offer the opportunity to scale and
decrease the research-to-practice gap for adversity-impacted youth."

This proposal aims to investigate the impact of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in the pathophysiology,
biodosimetry, and treatment of radiation injury. Current research lacks exploration of sex differences, including
the influence of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes in hematopoietic (H-) and gastrointestinal (GI-) acute
radiation syndromes (ARS) and its long-term effects (DEARE). The study highlights the importance of
understanding these factors for gender-equitable medicine in radiation medical countermeasures. Initial data
shows increased male mortality in response to radiation, and metabolomic differences based on SABV. The
alarmin IL-33 has been shown in preliminary data and literature to exhibit sex-specific pleiotropic activation after
injury. To discern the roles of hormones and sex chromosomes, a four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model is
proposed, involving the deletion and relocation of the Sry gene. We hypothesize that SABV contributes to
radiation damage response and regeneration and sexual dimorphism in IL-33-mediated immune responses in
bone marrow and GI injury. This study will evaluate survival, histology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics in
male and female wild type mice, gonadectomized mice, FCG mice, and IL-33 modulated mice. This research will
provide insights into SABV in H-ARS and GI-ARS pathophysiology and inform potential novel therapies."
10921751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that has reached epidemic proportions globally. One of the
most important complications of diabetes is the major risk of the development of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in
approximately a quarter of diabetic patients at some point in their lives. DFUs are extremely debilitating and
difficult to treat. Current clinical DFU management modalities are limited in efficacy with a large proportion of
DFUs not responding to treatment and progressing further, leading to staggeringly high mortality rates of
16.7% at 12 months and 50% at 5 years – mortality rates that are comparable to those of colon cancer.
Consequently, 85% of all lower extremity amputations (LEA) in diabetic patients are a direct result of these
DFUs. DFUs cause tremendous financial burden on individual patients to the tune of ~$9K annually, and on
the entire healthcare system to the tune of $9 – 13B annually to manage these DFUs, in addition to the cost for
management of diabetes in just the USA alone. Thus, there is a dire need for more effective treatments for
DFU. Lynntech, Inc. in collaboration with Texas Tech University Health Science Center and in consultation
with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine proposes to develop a cutaneous gel to controllably
deliver a small molecule therapeutic with an intriguing mechanism of action in order to effectively address the
impaired healing in DFU. Controlled delivery of this therapeutic has the potential to improve wound healing
outcomes and significantly reduce mean time to DFU closure, mitigate the adverse risks associated with other
interventions, reduce the necessity for LEA, significantly reduce mortality and enable considerable cost savings
to DFU patients. In order to obtain proof-of-concept for this innovative new approach to address DFU, our
specific aims will be to (1) prepare, characterize and select to a preferred cutaneous gel formulation for
controlled delivery of the therapeutic, (2) further elucidate the intriguing mechanism of action whereby this gel
formulation can potentially improve the healing of DFU and (3) evaluate the potential of the gel formulation to
improve wound healing outcomes in an appropriate in vivo diabetic murine model. The successful completion
of these aims is expected to bolster the evidence for the potential clinical utility of this new approach to treat
DFU. This will set the stage for a comprehensive IND enabling SBIR Phase II thrust that will focus on
providing a solid estimate of in vivo biocompatibility, safety, and efficacy in accepted diabetic animal models of
wound healing. The SBIR Phase III effort will focus on human clinical trials, FDA regulatory clearance, CMS
reimbursement codes approval and commercialization of this innovative new product for treatment of DFU.
The overall impact could therefore be to sustain an effective new paradigm in the clinical management of DFU.
This product could provide significant clinical benefits to the millions of patients afflicted with DFU, including
improved wound healing outcomes, reduced risk of LEA and mortality and lowered treatment costs."
10920937,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Xylyx is developing a predictive multi-organ metastatic breast cancer cell-based assay platform to address the
lack of in-vitro models of organotropic metastatic breast cancer in the market and accelerate drug development.
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and most commonly metastasizes to bone,
liver, and lung. Metastasis causes ~90% of cancer deaths, and metastatic breast cancer remains the second
leading cause of death from cancer. Survival 5 years after diagnosis is 27%, and there is no cure. The
extracellular matrix (ECM) in bone, liver, and lung is known to play critical roles in metastatic invasion and
colonization. Animal models are poor predictors of metastasis in humans, and predictive in-vitro models of
metastatic breast cancer are not commercially available, leaving a significant unmet need and market gap/
opportunity for a physiologically-relevant in-vitro platform that enables high-fidelity cell-based phenotypic assays
in organotropic breast cancer metastases. This SBIR Fast Track will support development and validation studies
for commercialization of a multi-organ metastatic breast cancer cell-based assay platform containing engineered
organotropic metastases shown to be consistent with patient data. The technological innovation is the product’s
organotropic (bone, liver, lung) metastases stemming from proprietary methods for isolating and integrating
acellular human tissue ECMs with the tissue-specific properties of human tissues. Our approach integrates
breast cancer patient-derived organoids in standardized multi-organ tissue-specific primary human ECMs,
enabling predictive assays on organotropic metastases – a major competitive advantage over all existing assays,
which lack multi-organ human tissue-specificity. Our goal is to validate and commercialize a standard multi-organ
metastatic breast cancer cell-based assay platform for predictive in-vitro modeling of metastatic breast cancer
to reduce dependence on animal models and de-risk preclinical decision-making. Specific aims: (1) Perform
multi-omics and histomorphologic profiling of engineered human breast cancer bone/liver/lung organotropic
metastases; (2) Evaluate histologic, molecular, phenotypic effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on
engineered organotropic metastases; (3) Evaluate quality and consistency of engineered human bone/liver/lung
organotropic metastases assay platform; (4) Test stage IV breast cancer standard-of-care drugs in combination
with therapies targeting matrix components. After successful completion of the Fast Track project, Xylyx will
commercialize the metastatic breast cancer assay platform for scientists in pharma companies in need of
predictive metastatic disease models for drug screening, thus reducing the massive costs associated with late-
stage attrition due to poor efficacy, and facilitating development of better treatment options for the 270,000+
patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer every year. As the industry leader in ECM-based reagents and
assays, Xylyx will market the product worldwide in the rapidly growing cell-based assay market ($24.6B in 2022,
CAGR: 12.7%, projected $60.3B by 2030), advancing drug development in the $4.2B breast cancer drug market."
10921001,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The syndemic of alcohol use and HIV risk in pregnant and lactating people (PLP) threatens the health of
mother, fetus, children and families in South Africa. PLP living with HIV who use alcohol may access
antiretroviral therapy (ART) late or disengage with ART care, increasing the risk of vertical HIV transmission.
PLP not living with HIV who use alcohol are at increased risk of HIV and may require targeted interventions to
receive pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery and adherence counselling. Alcohol use also increases risk
of HIV acquisition and poor ART adherence. The “mentor mother” (MM) intervention model is an evidence-
based intervention (EBI) with demonstrated success in improving HIV and antenatal care outcomes. The
model utilizes a task-shifting approach; positive deviant peers (mothers) deliver interventions to PBFW within
and outside of the antenatal clinic. In the present study, we will collaborate with community partners to identify
facilitators of alcohol use among PLP in SA. We will then adapt the MM model to create MM+ for PLP who
use alcohol to evaluate the feasibility of an alcohol reduction intervention that includes HIV prevention and
treatment (serostatus neutral) in a high alcohol using and HIV burdened community. Specific aims include:
· Aim 1: Mixed methods assessment of perceptions of alcohol use in pregnancy and facilitators of
 alcohol reduction in pregnancy among multilevel stakeholders of PLP who use alcohol to identify
 clinic and community level facilitators that could be used to reduce the use of alcohol during
 pregnancy through in-depth interviews (IDIs) and brief surveys with drinking peers, intimate partners and
 focus group discussions with healthcare providers and community leaders.
· Aim 2: Adapt and refine enhanced MM intervention (MM+) with potential intervention beneficiaries,
 providers and community leaders. Use community based participatory approach research principles to
 iteratively adapt, test and refine the MM+ intervention to integrate alcohol reduction content in one
 collaborative workshop session.
· Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of MM+ on reduction of alcohol use (primary
 outcome) and PrEP use (in PLP without HIV) and ART adherence (in PLP living with HIV)
 (secondary outcomes) in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in n=100 pregnant women who currently
 use alcohol. Primary outcome: Reduced alcohol use following the intervention (at 6m via
phosphatidylethanol [PEth] levels). Secondary outcomes: PrEP and ART continued use at 6m via urine
tenofovir levels at 6m. Secondary implementation outcomes: feasibility (provider, organizational and
 participant feedback), acceptability and fidelity to the intervention SOPs.
Our study seeks to effectively reduce alcohol use and improve HIV care outcomes through community
engagement and a novel participant informed intervention adaptation and delivery process."
10921330,"ABSTRACT
Due to the vast number of potential drug combinations, “testing them all” in clinical trials is impossible, putting
pressure on preclinical research to find the most promising compounds to advance to human studies. While
certain drug combination effects can now be modeled in silico, this approach is generally limited to the best-
studied biological pathways and may not work for analyzing complex disease mechanisms that involve multiple
interconnected pathways.
Protein immunoassays detect activated biological pathways by analyzing site-specific phosphorylation of kinases
and/or their substrates, normalized against the abundance of unmodified proteins. Recently, an interest in
detecting and quantifying protein mutations has emerged, due to the development of novel therapeutic options
based on covalent binding of a drug to a mutant protein or targeted protein degradation. Currently, there are no
immunoassays for measuring multiple protein targets (total and phospho-) across multiple major cancer
pathways, which can resolve differentially phosphorylated kinases and kinase substrates.
While several platforms for building multiplexed protein-based assays exist they either a) have a limited ability
to detect phosphorylation (immunoassay-based technologies); or b) are low-throughput, expensive and often
difficult to standardize (LC-MS), making them suitable for discovery proteomics but not for routine screening of
tens, hundreds or thousands of samples. Importantly, none of these analytical technologies are ideal for
quantifying protein targets containing multiple phosphorylated sites within a specific protein region. Therefore,
the existing assays cannot accurately measure kinases that are activated by sequential phosphorylation events.
We propose to initiate development of Path10™ - a multiplexed, protein-based, multi-pathway profiling assay for
the Bead-Assisted Mass Spectrometry (BAMS™) platform - which will simultaneously measure protein targets
across 10 major cell signaling pathways: RAF-MEK-ERK, cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI3K/Akt, TGFβ,
p53 and β-catenin/Wnt. It will achieve broad, multi-pathway coverage by including targets unique to each
pathway and also common targets shared by different pathways, e.g. protein substrates of multiple kinases. By
selecting relevant proteins and modification sites, future assays can be configured to extend coverage within
selected pathways or to profile disease pathways other than cancer, such as diabetes.
In the proposed Phase I we will start the product development, focusing initially on the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway,
which has the highest frequency of genomic alterations. In the follow-up Phase II, we will rapidly expand assay
coverage to the remaining 9 pathways using the methods developed in this Phase I. Post-Phase II, we will focus
on assay automation and applying Path10™ to human tissue and animal models, e.g., patient-derived xenografts
(PDXs)."

While trans-catheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR) has revolutionized valve replacement, planning for this
procedure using CT imaging is a time-consuming manual process requiring hours of advanced cardiac imager’s
time. Furthermore, many centers in the United States turn over the job of measurements to in-experienced sales
reps who are more focused on the interests of the valve manufacturers they represent without any formal training
or knowledge in cardiac anatomy or physiology. DASI Simulations LLC has developed an innovative cloud-based
artificial intelligence (AI) platform that promises to automatically perform these complex measurements in a
matter of few minutes. The measurements are performed based on AI-predicted landmarks using a pipeline of
convolutional neural networks with advanced image sampling techniques. As preliminary work we have already
established the product feasibility and have our regulatory approach vetted through the FDA with a successful
presubmission completed. In this SBIR Phase 1, we propose a non-hypothesis driven approach with two specific
aims to execute on FDA recommendations to finish the verification and validation activities, namely: (1) Develop
and validate the DASI Dimensions measurement module to extract TAVR pre-planning procedural
measurements; and (2) prepare and submit document package for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510k
clearance. Because our technology differentiates itself from our competitors who use traditional expensive
manual measurement approaches, we are posed to make a significant positive and disruptive impact in how
structural heart therapy is planned in the clinic with potentially substantial clinical impact in terms of patient
outcomes and hospital efficiency."

Cancer will kill over 600,000 people in the US in 2023, causing $200B+ healthcare expenditure. This is
happening despite recent advancements in therapy and the emergence of an ever-expanding array of new
therapeutics for the over 1.9M new cancer patients every year. Indeed, because of the multitude and
redundancy of mechanisms contributing to cancer growth, therapies are often ineffective. Several components
should be targeted at the same time to maximize therapy outcome. However, this is particularly hard to attain
because of 1) the striking variability among cancers and the limited number of cancer specific targets 2) the
ability of cancer cells to orchestrate a microenvironment of healthy tissue and cells around them, that promote
cancer growth and therapy resistance.
Boston Immune Technologies and Therapeutics (BITT) is developing BITR2101, able to target both cancer
cells and their microenvironment. BITR2101 is an antagonist antibody against TNFR2 – a receptor highly
expressed in cancer tissue and immune suppressive cells in the microenvironment, where it mediates pro-
survival signaling. Thanks to BITT’s proprietary antibody design platform, BITR-2101 is the first and only
antibody able to dominantly shut down TNFR2 signaling. Due to selective expression and key role of TNFR2
for a variety of cancers and tumor microenvironment cells, BITR2101 is expected to find application in the
therapy of several cancers either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments. BITT has already
completed extensive pre-clinical validation for BITR-2101, demonstrating potent activity in several
malignancies in state-of-the-art animal models. As part of (R44CA265510) awarded by the NCI, BITT has
completed GLP toxicology assessment in NHPs and has confirmed the possibility to obtain cGMP grade
quality for BITR2101. This has allowed to obtain IND approval for use in NHL/CTCL. In the proposed PhaseIIb
project, BITT aims at accelerating the clinical use of BITR2101 by pursuing clinical validation in NHL/CTCL
as a keystone to demonstrate BITR2101 value in cancer therapy. This will boost the capability of BITT to
attract private funds from already contacted investors to a) complete early clinical testing (up to Phase II); b)
turn the already attracted interest of pharmaceutical companies towards our therapeutic into formal
partnerships to complete later stage clinical testing (Phase III) and launch BITR2101 into international
markets; c) explore early clinical application (Phase I-II) for additional malignancies, multiplying the impact
that our therapeutic can bring to a wide variety of cancer patients."
10913388,"Small, organic molecules that bind specific proteins represent one of the most effective ways
that physicians have to treat diseases and that researchers can use to probe living systems.
Such small molecules, also known as ligands, can act in many ways, such as by blocking a
protein from working, by activating a protein, or by causing the protein to be broken down by
normal cellular processes. In fact, most medications are ligands, and researchers in
universities, government labs, and pharmaceutical companies, are constantly at work seeking
new ones as drugs and biological probes. These ongoing efforts generate a continuous flow of
information about what small molecules bind what proteins, and how tightly.
This information is useful not only within the specific project that generated it, but also for many
other applications, such as helping researchers identify probe molecules to help with their
research, serving as benchmarks for computational chemists creating software designed to
predict ligand-protein binding, and training and testing machine-learning tools for drug design.
However, scientists generating this information typically release it in scientific articles or patents,
where it cannot easily be found or accessed by other researchers.
The core purpose of this project is to further develop the BindingDB Knowledgebase,
dramatically expanding the availability of protein-ligand binding information and connecting this
information to other areas of knowledge in order to make it as broadly useful as possible. This
will be accomplished by using a combination of automated and human methods to carry out
fast, accurate extraction of large volumes of data from scientific articles and patents. These data
will be rendered in machine readable format, linked with related data, such as information on
protein structure and function, and made publicly available in open source format via the
searchable BindingDB website, which also allows data to be downloaded in quantity for offline
use.
The information in BindingDB will be managed according to high community standards for
findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR), and the project will achieve the
high CoreTrustSeal standards and certification for reliability and long-term preservation. In
addition, steps will be taken to maximize usability and integration of this information, such as by
making it available as a public dataset in emerging cloud resources and creating links from on-
line journal articles and patents to the data extracted from them in BindingDB."
10913389,"Hyperphosphatemia, a condition that occurs when the phosphate concentration in serum exceeds 1.46 mM, is
common among patients with advanced chronic and acute kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure.
Maintenance hemodialysis does not remove phosphate from blood; thus, almost all patients on maintenance
hemodialysis have hyperphosphatemia. Current treatment relies primarily on dietary restrictions and the
administration of oral phosphate binders with food or drink which are often insufficient to manage
hyperphosphatemia for individuals on dialysis. This inability to manage the disorder increases morbidity, mostly
due to cardiovascular events related to vascular and soft tissue calcification. The overarching goal of this project
is to develop, optimize, and translate to the clinic novel affinity columns for normalizing the levels of inorganic
phosphate from blood quickly, safely, and selectively. Our central hypothesis is that we can achieve our goal
using lanthanide complexes conjugated to dendritic polypeptides. Strong preliminary results from our group
indicate that lanthanide complexes with open coordination sites can be designed to bind phosphate directly from
serum and blood with high affinity and selectively over other endogenous ions that are present in much higher
concentrations in serum. These lanthanide complexes are highly stable and do not leach metal in serum or when
bound to phosphate, working as effective `phosphate sponges'. Importantly, the affinity of these complexes for
phosphate can be tuned at will so as to achieve normal serum levels without risking hypophosphatemia. We will
further develop, optimize, and evaluate a prototype affinity column for the removal of phosphate from blood. The
overall objective of this application is to synthesize a new family of lanthanide complexes that have an
appropriate affinity for phosphate and high selectivity over endogenous ions and to conjugate them onto dendritic
polypeptides The rationale for the proposed research is that lanthanide complexes immobilized on affinity
columns will enable the efficient and rapid removal of excess phosphate from blood without affecting the balance
of other endogenous anions such as bicarbonate. Used in conjunction with dialysis, these phosphate affinity
hemodialysis columns will enable efficient management of hyperphosphatemia. We plan to accomplish our
objectives by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Develop novel metal complexes for the selective
sequestration of phosphate from serum; 2) Synthesize and characterize lanthanide receptors supported on
dendritic polypeptides and evaluate their ability to balance phosphate levels in serum; and 3) Evaluate the ability
of receptor-immobilized affinity columns to normalize blood phosphate levels ex vivo and in vivo during
hemodialysis. Our research is significant because it aims to develop a new technology to efficiently and safely
treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD and renal failure. This will improve dialysis patient outcome and
quality of life. Our research is innovative because it will develop the first affinity columns utilizing lanthanide
complexes grafted onto dendritic polypeptides for balancing phosphate levels in blood."
10913390,"Abstract
Long-term cognitive impairment affects more than 70% of sepsis survivors, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown. Though widely hypothesized, evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in septic
patients is limited by practical barriers to diagnostic studies in critically ill subjects. While BBB breakdown and
cognitive impairment are seen in animal models of sepsis, the complexity of sepsis in vivo and differences
between animal and human responses means that animal models cannot unambiguously identify the
circulating factors that cause brain injury in human sepsis. Therefore, we propose to develop the µSiM-hNVU
as an `on-chip' platform featuring a human iPSC-derived neurovascular unit (NVU; brain microvascular
endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes). The `blood side' will allow the flow-based introduction of blood-
borne cells and molecules with known or hypothesized roles in sepsis related brain injury, and the `brain side'
will feature iPSC-derived microglial cells serving as a reporter of the brain inflammatory status. The human
NVU will be built on a device platform – the µSiM – featuring ultrathin silicon nanomembranes that provide for
unhindered solute exchange between `blood' and `brain' compartments and glass-like optical quality for live cell
imaging and high-resolution microscopy. In the R61 phase, the device platform will be advanced for ease-of-
use including `plug-and-play' modules for flow and barrier measurements (TEER, diffusion), and compatibility
with a small-volume, digital-ELISA assay for secreted proteins. The µSiM-hNVU will be validated with
functional assays of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, protein expression studies, and transcriptional analysis.
We will also build a iPSC NVU in which each cellular component of the NVU carries the ApoE4 allele. The
expression of the ApoE4 lipoprotein drives BBB dysfunction by a known pathway and increases the risk of
cognitive impairment in humans and animals experiencing brain inflammation. We will use the ApoE4-NVU as
a `diseased BBB on a chip” which we hypothesize will show enhanced vulnerabilities to candidate mechanisms
of brain injury identified by our team and others. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that 1) pre-activated
monocytes invade the brain and drive microglial activation; 2) the damage associated molecular pattern
(DAMP) complex S100A8/A9 drive BBB breakdown to promote leukocyte infiltration and neuroinflammation;
and 3) circulating factors that degrade endothelial glycocaylx (e.g., heparinase) or contribute to systemic
inflammation (cell-free hemoglobin) promote CNS infiltration of leukocytes and subsequent neuroinflammation."

Radiation-Induced Cardiotoxicity (RIC) remains a concerning health issue, particularly in accidental radiation
exposure scenarios as evident in the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. However, the complex
interplay of factors contributing to the diverse presentations of RIC remains elusive. This project aims to shed
light on the critical roles of sex hormone “estrogen” and genetic variations in estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in
modulating RIC susceptibility and response. The research takes an innovative approach by combining state-of-
the-art techniques and multidisciplinary expertise. Firstly, a ""cell village"" strategy will be employed which leverage
pooling human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derivatives from a diverse cohort of 200 individuals. Pooled
iPSCs will be differentiated into 3D cardiac organoids (iPSC-COs) and treated with varying doses of estrogen
and radiation to simulate different physiological conditions and radiation exposure, respectively. Cutting-edge
single-cell genomics and computational technologies will be employed to scrutinize the resulting transcriptomic
and epigenomic changes in each individual. This will help us identify inter-individual variations and underlying
genetic mutations that contribute to differential molecular responses upon irradiation. Additionally, animal models
will be employed to simulate radiological incidences and corroborate multi-omics data to functional outcomes in
whole organisms. Collectively, these experiments will elucidate the genes responsible for sexual disparity in RIC
and its relation to estrogen signaling which can provide insights into personalized risk prediction and intervention
strategies, addressing a critical knowledge gap in the field of radiation biology and cardiovascular health."
10921846,"Abstract. The most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 39.0 million people are living
with HIV-1 infection worldwide, with 65.6% of them residing in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite an overall 38%
worldwide decline in newly acquired infections, we still faced a staggering number of 1.3 million new infection
and 630,000 deaths in 2022. A difference still exists between the east/southern and the west/central regions of
sub-Saharan Africa, with reductions in AIDS-related deaths in 2021 of 50% and 43% since 2010, respectively.
Clearly, much work remains in terms of training health care workers including local physicians and scientists in
the diagnosis, treatment, and management of individuals with HIV-1 infection; conducting implementation
science to determine the most cost-effective use of financial and human resources; and ensuring evidence-
informed public health policy and programming to reduce disparities in the AIDS response across Africa’s sub-
regions. Despite treatment likely having contributed to slowing HIV transmission, HIV prevention remains critical
to stem the tide of HIV. In fact, a second AIDS pandemic in the next 12 years is predicted due to 1) changing
demographics in Africa with increasing numbers of youth, 2) increasing transmitted viral drug resistance, and 3)
increased cost and limited availability of 2nd and 3rd line treatment regimens. These factors suggest that the total
number of people living with AIDS may increase by 2 million/year to reach a staggering 50 million worldwide by
2030.

1) To provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of diagnosis and treatment, pathogenesis and
prevention of HIV-1 for adults, adolescents and children living with HIV in Africa, in order to contribute
to achieving the 95-95-95 viral suppression goal and to preventing a second great HIV pandemic.

10922027,"Colon cancer causes over 50,000 deaths each year in the US (12% of total cancer deaths). Colonoscopy (over
16 million procedures/year) is the most effective procedure for diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer.
Screening age reduction and a shortage of gastroenterologists (GIs) have created a significant colonoscopy
backlog. Productivity improvements are needed as delayed screening leads to increased cancer mortality.
Looping during scope insertion causes significant challenges in colonoscopy. Mucosal stretching leads to
patient pain and the need for sedation, which adds to patient risk, recovery time and procedure cost. Scope
insertion exerts repetitive biomechanical loads on the staff, causing a very high prevalence of endoscopy-
related injuries (ERIs) in endoscopists (75%) and nurses (85%). Looping leads to prolonged and variable
insertion time (4-18 min) based on endoscopist skill. We are developing a low-cost robotic flexible overtube
(sleeve) capable of blind automated insertion and fixation in the colon. The overtube facilitates straightforward
scope insertion and thereby reduces patient pain and the need for sedation; prevents ERIs in endoscopists
and nurses; and enables faster insertion. Substantial productivity improvement can be achieved by faster
insertion time (3 min) and improved recovery room efficiency due to sedation reduction. Technical innovations
that enable the blind automated insertion include: (a) Efficient Origami-packaging of a 36” long overtube into a
2” envelope. (b) “Progressive actuation” for device propulsion via tip-growth. (c) Novel pneumatic steering
actuator and steering control strategy for automated insertion into a tortuous anatomy. (d) Proprietary in-house
manufacturing methods for Origami-packaging of long slender tubes. We have demonstrated blind automated
overtube insertion in a bench-top tortuous rigid colon model in under 1 min. In Phase I, we will show feasibility
in more clinically relevant flexible silicone colon model and ex-vivo porcine tissue model, which present a more
challenging terrain. In Aim 1, we will develop a controlled colon insufflation system to create a more favorable
terrain for automated insertion compared to a normally collapsed colon. Since the device advances into the
colon without visual feedback, in Aim 2, we will integrate an electromagnetic (EM) tracking system to provide
trajectory feedback to the endoscopist. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate automated overtube insertion in clinically
relevant colon models. In Phase II, we will complete product development and testing in preparation for 510(k)
submission. There is a strong market pull from endoscopists and nurses due to high prevalence of ERIs.
Endoscopists and administrators expressed willingness to buy such a device based on specific use cases: (a)
ERI reduction to alleviate staffing/attrition challenges; (b) Productivity improvement that drives procedure
volume, revenue and profits; (c) Sedation elimination to reduce patient risk, post-op recovery time and
procedure cost. Successful device operation can deliver significant benefits to all stakeholders and has the
potential for meaningful adoption in a high-volume procedure."
10921988,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project will use synthetic biology to engineer RNA-based sensors of viral infection for the high-throughput
discovery of new classes of antivirals—including novel, pan-variant antivirals that can maintain broad-spectrum
antiviral efficacy. State-of-the-art antiviral therapeutics can lose efficacy in just months, as viral protein targets
mutate and new viral variants evolve. For some viruses, the problem is even more acute: there are no approved
antivirals at all. High-throughput screening (HTS) is the clearest way to develop new classes of variant-proof
antivirals—by directly testing large-scale drug candidate libraries against panels of diverse viral variants.
Unfortunately, existing antiviral assays are often poorly suited for HTS, especially for viruses that lack known
drug targets (e.g. viruses that do not encode proteases). Here we propose to develop plug-and-play RNA sensors
that enable high-throughput, target-agnostic, and variant-agnostic screens of broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy—
for any RNA virus in any assay format. Termed encrypted RNAs (encRNAs), each single-molecule sensor will
provide specific and sensitive quantitation of antiviral efficacy against every variant of an RNA virus. The sensors
immediately quantify the level of replicating virus in a cell—by converting the level of viral replication in an
infected cell to an amplified protein output (e.g. a fluorescent or luminescent signal). In preliminary studies, we
have developed pan-variant encRNA prototypes with signal-to-noise ratios of >1,000 for 8 representative RNA
viral families. encRNAs have also been formulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The resulting encRNA-LNPs
remain shelf-stable for months at 4 °C (years at –80 °C) and enable RNA sensor delivery to virtually any cell type,
including primary cells and in vivo tissue. Further, modular encRNA-LNPs can be combined and multiplexed for
pan-viral antiviral development. This effort will leverage the plug-and-play capability of encRNA-LNPs to develop
optimized single-molecule sensors that translate multiple, orthogonal (i.e., structurally distinct) reporter proteins.
The coincident reporter proteins will minimize the incidence of false-positives and maximize encRNA sensitivity
and specificity in high-throughput screening. Optimized encRNA-LNPs will be developed and demonstrated
against 3 representative RNA viral families—and tested for accuracy and precision in 384-well plate assays and
for hit validation in difficult-to-assay primary cells. If successful in Phase I, the long-term goal is to develop off-
the-shelf encRNA-LNP sensors that replace laborious and expensive plaque and qPCR assays with
consumables for every RNA virus—to democratize broad-spectrum antiviral development using standard
equipment available to most companies and labs (e.g. low-cost plate readers). Beyond initial screening, encRNA-
LNPs would also enable accelerated preclinical testing in primary cells, organoids, and in vivo—and could be
used to spatially track viral infections and drug delivery (e.g. pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, PK/PD)
across tissues in preclinical animal models."
10907619,"Project Summary
The diverse range of sensory neurons that innervate the skin underlie our ability to perceive a remarkable range
of tactile stimuli and provide us with the capacity to manipulate objects, detect threats, and navigate our
environment. Despite the fundamental importance of our sense of touch, little is known about how recipient
neurons in the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) of the brainstem integrate primary sensory information, and how
processed information is then transmitted to the brain. Anatomical tracing studies have revealed multiple, non-
overlapping downstream targets of the DCN, the most prominent being the thalamus and inferior colliculus. As
the node between sensory information from the periphery and central somatosensory pathways, I hypothesize
that the DCN functions as a site of differential sensory integration to selectively tune output pathways to features
in the environment. My proposed experiments will address this hypothesis by characterizing the tuning properties
of DCN projection neurons that target the inferior colliculus and the thalamus, and by investigating how
responses are constructed by inputs from peripheral sensory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. This work will
overcome barriers in the field by combining novel brainstem recording methods with tools to manipulate the
activity of primary sensory neurons. In doing so, my proposal will yield insights into how the DCN processes
tactile information, and may also illuminate more general mechanisms by which the brain organizes sensory
information. Additionally, a fundamental understanding of early somatosensory processing will inform efforts to
develop neural prosthetics, as well as guide efforts to treat clinical cases where somatosensation is altered, such
as mechanical allodynia after peripheral nerve injury or hypersensitivity to light touch exhibited by individuals
with autism."
10907715,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin signaling provide essential guidance and stimulation to GnRH neurons.
Though the past decade has seen extraordinary advances in our understanding of this signaling network, this
grant employs novel assays and receptor agonist and antagonist administration in vivo to challenge several
dogmas in reproductive endocrinology. These complementary approaches, performed in rhesus monkeys,
healthy volunteers, and patients with reproductive disease, unite two investigators with experience in genetics,
physiology, and pharmacology. This interdisciplinary collaboration is well positioned to attack the complexities
of the hypothalamic architecture that regulates GnRH secretion. Thus, by translating fluidly between monkey
and man, between juvenile and adult, and between physiology and pathophysiology, this grant aims to generate
novel insights into sexual maturation and develop new treatments for patients with reproductive disorders."
10907443,"Project Summary
Our goal is to develop a fluorescence guided imaging solution to lung cancer. Each year, lung cancer
is the biggest cause of cancer related deaths in the US (>160,000 people) and the world (1.4 million
fatalities). The primary strategy in this Project is to develop, characterize and test a combination of four
targeted near-infrared contrast agents that will be used in humans to improve procedures for patients
with lung cancer. It is clear that using fluorescent targeted agents during cancer surgery can highlight
cancer cells for clinicians, thus several groups are testing molecular probes. Our research will
specifically focus on lung cancer. Lung cancer is a very heterogeneous tumor due to the wide range
of offending agents that can cause this disease. The proposed work will optimize four distinct types of
contrast agents in a combination or cocktail for a translational intraoperative imaging clinical trials. The
first cocktail agents are composed of folate and GCPII conjugated to a NIR dye. These two contrast
agents are fully functional and are in human trial. However, together, they still miss a significant
proportion of patients with lung cancer. Thus, we will be focusing our efforts on two more agents, CAIX
and FAP, in this proposal. The goal of this Aim is to integrate the NIR tracers that are ready for clinical
use. We will be utilizing both murine models and spontaneous lung cancer models in pet canines.
Integration of these four agents will require studying the changes in sensitivity and specificity. It will
also require examining the timing of these agents and the interactions of these tracers. If this cocktail
is successful, it will provide a complete solution for the number one cancer killer in the United States."

10927266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The design and development of new experimental equipment, from electrophysiology to imaging to other
prototyping, is critical for progress in vision research. This core will provide custom design and manufacturing
for devices to interface new research technologies with their particular experimental preparations, to enhance
collaborative sharing of device solutions, and thus to leverage new experimental techniques and speed progress
in vision research. This core will provide the primary source of critical device, design and development of custom
experimental equipment to NEl-funded vision research in the laboratories of numerous investigators, and serve
as a centralized resource to promote shared device designs to facilitate entry into vision research and
collaboration. The machine shop, which is housed within the Fairchild Building, will serve as one key node for
providing this service. The machine shop will provide not only frequent services to construct innovative new
equipment used in specific approaches in vision research, but will also be called upon to provide device design
and development. In addition, the Core will facilitate design of specialized equipment to be fabricated via Stanford
and, where indicated, outside 3-D printing services. Computer assisted design (CAD) programming and expert
staff will be leveraged towards device development goals. The Core Director and Assistant Director have
extensive experience with device development and the management of these resources. An explicit aim of this
Core is to foster and facilitate collaboration and rapid sharing of progress among investigators by prioritizing
innovative and collaborative vision research projects and communicating access and activity to all."

10935911,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION - ABSTRACT
The Cancer Research Training (CRT) Office within the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC)
coordinates research education, training activities, and educational opportunities for UHCC staff and trainees.
CRT offers cancer research education throughout the catchment area, which includes high school,
undergraduate, graduate, medical students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, clinicians, and healthcare
professionals. During the last five years, CRT has more than tripled its annual funding base through several
institutional training grants. More than 290 trainees (68% women and 32% men, 33% from under-
represented minority groups) were mentored in cancer biology, experimental therapeutics,
biostatistics/bioinformatics, nutrition, epidemiology, behavioral and community interventions. CRT also
supports faculty, staff, and trainee travel to scientific meetings, workshops, and related activities. Our overall
goal is to strengthen UHCC as the central cancer research education hub within Hawai‘i and the Pacific and to
provide innovative training and mentorship experiences focusing on diversity and health disparities at all career
levels. This is done in close collaboration with the two Programs, Cancer Biology (CB) and Population
Sciences in the Pacific (PSP), the Shared Resources, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), the Community
Outreach and Engagement (COE) Office, and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office (DEI). In service of this
goal, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop and implement innovative education initiatives to
train cancer disparity researchers from diverse backgrounds at all career stages in the catchment area of
UHCC. Aim 2. Increase skills in cancer research through programs appropriate to different career levels, from
introductory curricula for high school and undergraduate students, research experiences for graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows, programs for medical and clinical trainees, to mentoring for junior faculty. Aim 3.
Evaluate cancer research training activities through long-term tracking of participants using alumni surveys and
data collection from relevant databases to assess educational and career outcomes. From high school to junior
faculty, CRT offers opportunities to develop careers in cancer research with a focus on diversity, equity, and
integration across racial and ethnic groups, and on distinctive opportunities in the Pacific region. By engaging
and inspiring diverse cancer professionals, the CRT will enhance the diversity of the workforce and improve
the quality of cancer research in the catchment area. All activities are designed to achieve CRT Office’s vision
to educate and mentor the next generation of scientists and clinicians who will reduce cancer health disparities
in Hawai‘i and the Pacific through innovative basic, behavioral, clinical, translational, and population sciences-
related research."
10935912,"PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY - ABSTRACT
Multiple demographic groups of Hawaiʻi and the Pacific are under-represented in the cancer research
workforce. We recognize the need to enhance diversity, including gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
and family cultural background in order to optimize the depth and breadth of research, create a positive
research environment, increase inclusion and equity in our workforce, and facilitate positive relationships with
our cancer patients, cancer survivors, and our broader community. A key component of our Plan to Enhance
Diversity (PED) is the creation of a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Office with its own leadership that
reports to the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center (UHCC) Director, and making it an integral part of our
operations. Our long-term objective is to make the composition of UHCC’s workforce similar to that of its
catchment area, which includes the state of Hawaiʻi and the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). Our PED
has four specific aims: 1) Establish a DEI Office within the Cancer Center to coordinate strategic planning
and implementation of diversity enhancement initiatives; 2) Enhance representation and participation of
underrepresented groups in the cancer research workforce (URW) among UHCC’s staff, membership, advisory
boards, and leadership throughout CCSG components; 3) Establish targeted infrastructure to leverage
institutional resources to support career-enhancing opportunities for early and mid-level researchers;
4) Collect baseline and longitudinal metrics on DEI and evaluate progress in enhancing the diversity of the
leadership, faculty, staff, and students within UHCC. Specific activities will be undertaken to enhance the
pipeline of candidates for UHCC faculty positions and research support jobs, such as programs to provide
research support and career advancement training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and
educational programs for high school and college students. UHCC will coordinate these activities with internal
and external advisory groups (e.g., Native Hawaiian Community Advisory Board, External Advisory Committee)
so as to actively recruit promising candidates from diverse backgrounds. Institutional infrastructure in the form
of mentoring, grant writing workshops, pilot grants, research seminars, affinity groups, and leadership training
will be established to foster a culture of equity and inclusion and accelerate career advancement toward
leadership positions. Coordination with other UHCC offices (i.e., the Community Outreach and Engagement
Office and the Cancer Research Training Office) and across the university, and special opportunities involving
allied institutions in Hawaiʻi (e.g., healthcare partners), and Guam. The formal program for diversity
enhancement will operate across Research Programs [Cancer Biology (CB) and Population Sciences in the
Pacific PSP)] and foster a cross-disciplinary inclusive approach to research, community engagement,
prevention, and patient care. The expected outcomes include reducing disparities in cancer risk exposure and
treatment, and increasing survival for diverse groups in Hawaiʻi and the Pacific."
10935913,"CANCER BIOLOGY - ABSTRACT
Basic and translational cancer research is essential to advancing our understanding of cancer development
and progression. New mechanistic insights provide new tools and strategies for cancer prevention, diagnosis,
and therapy. The Cancer Biology Program (CB) studies fundamental cellular, molecular, genetic, biochemical,
and immunological mechanisms of cancer development and progression, with the goal of translating molecular
discoveries into diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. It is also the hub of clinical cancer research to translate
our discoveries to be tested in the clinic. The Program is responsible for the investigator-initiated therapeutic
clinical trials in our catchment area. The Program has 19 Full and 21 Associate Members from the University
of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Chemistry Department, Engineering Department, Kinesiology
Department, Pacific Biomedical Research Center, and College of Pharmacy. The CB Members currently
receive a combined $6.1M annually in direct cost, including $3.6M from the NCI and $1.78M from other
NIH institutes. Funding has increased significantly compared to the numbers during the previous cycle. Over
the past 6 years, Members have authored 437 cancer-related publications, of which 20% originated were
intra-programmatic, 26% were inter-programmatic, and 82% were inter-institutional collaborations. The
primary goal of CB is to conduct translational research through multi-disciplinary efforts, whereby discoveries
of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cancer development and progression lead to novel targets and
potential strategies for cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and drug discovery and treatment. This
goal is informed by the unique geography of our catchment area, which includes the Islands of Hawaiʻi and the
U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands, and the specific health disparities experienced by the populations we serve,
especially Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The 3 major scientific goals of the Program are: 1) to
generate novel mechanistic insight into the processes that drive tumor initiation, progression, and invasion and
to develop novel agents to target cancers; 2) to identify and validate biomarkers related to cancer early
detection, treatment, and prognosis; and 3) to translate local and national discoveries into more effective
preventive, early detection, and therapeutic modalities throughout our catchment area. To accomplish these
goals, we developed a strategic plan with focusing on 5 areas, immunotherapies, anti-cancer natural products,
small molecules, molecular mechanisms of health disparities, innovative clinical trials, as well as inter-
programmatic collaboration and fostering the growth of young cancer biologists. In summary, given our
geographical location and health disparities, we are uniquely positioned to conduct basic, translational, and
clinical research essential to the Hawaiian community and the larger Pacific region. The gain in our
mechanistic knowledge in cancers prevalent among the local populations, and the discovery of novel molecular
and immunological modalities provide opportunities for clinical applications in our catchment area."
10936234,"Overall Abstract
The Center for Dietary Supplements and Inflammation (CDSI) COBRE is located at the School of Medicine
(SOM), the University of South Carolina (USC), Columbia, SC. SOM is one of the smallest medical schools in
the nation located at the Veterans Administration (VA) campus. Thus, the CDSI attracts users from multiple
colleges across USC. The scientific mission of the CDSI is to investigate how compounds derived from
botanicals and natural products can attenuate inflammation as well as understand the mechanisms that trigger
chronic inflammatory diseases. Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of not only autoimmune
diseases but also a wide range of clinical disorders including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative
disorders, obesity, aging, and cancer. Thus, understanding the mode of action of botanicals or their constituents
on inflammation could lead to novel treatment modalities with far-ranging clinical implications. To accomplish
this goal, we will continue to build on the success of COBRE Phase-1 and Phase-2, further advance the research
infrastructure, grow the critical mass of researchers using diverse perspectives, and promote the sustainability
of the research cores. In Phases-1 and 2, we have made outstanding progress in the successful transition of 12
of our junior faculty Research Project Leaders (RPLs) into independent NIH/NSF-funded investigators as PIs.
Additionally, the CDSI funded 26 Pilot Project leaders (PPLs) who were also highly productive. Also, we were
successful in securing NIH Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Center (PPG/P01) for Epigenetic
Regulation of Inflammation, in which ‘graduated’ RPLs served as project leaders, thereby paving the path
towards sustainability of CDSI. The Specific Aims include: 1) To support innovative research using the latest
technologies and equipment such as Spectral Flow Cytometry, Single-cell RNA-seq and Single-cell Spatial
Transcriptomics, natural product library, and high-throughput data analysis, offered at our core facilities. 2) To
continue to grow the critical mass of researchers at CDSI by providing support through the Pilot Project Program
(PPP) and recruitment of new and early-stage as well as diverse investigators. 3) To sustain a multi-disciplinary,
collaborative research program and cores beyond Phase-3. The CDSI will offer two state-of-the-art research
core facilities that include a Flow Cytometry, and Cell Analysis (FCCA) Core, and a Bioanalytical Core, to study
epigenetic and microbiome regulation of inflammation. The program will be evaluated by an Administrative Core
(AC) consisting of nationally recognized scientists. Additionally, through institutional support, several new tenure-
track and diverse faculty will be recruited and mentored at USC to further increase the critical mass of users.
The long-term objective of the CDSI is to build a self-sustaining, nationally and internationally recognized multi-
disciplinary Center for dietary supplements and inflammation research."
10936235,"Administrative Core Abstract
 The Center for Dietary Supplements and Inflammation (CDSI) COBRE is located at the School of Medicine
(SOM) affiliated with the University of South Carolina (USC). Administrative Core has been highly successful in
increasing its user base in the past 10 years. Thus, this Core will continue to build on the overwhelming success
by continuing to provide oversight on all aspects of the Center. During the past two phases, the CDSI has
‘graduated’ 12 junior faculty Research Project Leaders (RPLs) successfully and supported 26 Pilot Project
Leaders (PPLs). Also, we were able to secure a P01/PPG Center involving 3 junior faculty (RPLs) who have
graduated from the COBRE. Thus, the Administrative Core has been instrumental in overseeing the success
of faculty, developing and supporting strong Research Cores, and ensuring the sustainability of the COBRE.
The specific aims of the Administrative Core during Phase-3 are as follows:
 To provide administrative leadership so that the Research Cores developed during Phases 1 and 2 can
transition into sustainable state-of-the-art core facilities that can support research in the areas of dietary
supplements and inflammation. We will continue our efforts to update the equipment and technology by applying
for new equipment grants supported by NIH and VA. To sustain the COBRE research cores, we will apply for
additional NIH P01-type grants.
1) To provide support and oversee the Pilot Project Program (PPP) with the goal of increasing the number of
 diverse faculty working. It will also help colleges recruit new faculty committed towards COBRE Phase-3.
 The Administrative Core will initiate two types of pilot projects: 1) Individual investigator-initiated 2)
 Collaborative project involving at least 3 projects to secure NIH PPG/P01 type funding. The Administrative
 Core will recruit diverse faculty and trainees in PPP.
2) To provide oversight and sustain a multi-disciplinary, collaborative research program in dietary supplements
 and inflammation: The Administrative Core will provide oversight in the day-to-day management of the
 Center. It will work with the Advisory Committee (AC) to help evaluate CDSI and ensure progress. It will
 also ensure that all research pursued at the COBRE will conform to the Federal guidelines including
 protection of human subjects and humane treatment of vertebrate animals, and data management and
 sharing plan. The Administrative Core will also oversee and implement the Plan for Enhancing Diverse
 Perspectives (PEDP) and the Data Management and Sharing Plan.
In summary, the overall objective of the Administrative Core is to further enhance the research infrastructure,
promote sustainability of CDSI, further increase the critical mass of diverse investigators by supporting pilot
projects, and provide oversight to all activities of the COBRE."

The Bioanalytical Core is a continuation of the shared resources offered in Phase-2 COBRE on Dietary
Supplements and Inflammation (CDSI). The purpose of this Core is to assist and provide Pilot Project Faculty
and other researchers associated or otherwise with the CDSI with cutting-edge and cost-effective methods of
epigenetic and microbiome analysis that would lead to innovative and high-quality research. This Core
specializes in designing and performing innovative –omics (scRNASeq and ATACSeq) research. Services
provided by the Core in this area will include 1) Use of microarray-based approaches and bioinformatics tools
for analysis of microRNA, mRNA and lncRNA expression data as well as performing pathway analysis 2)
Performance of next generation sequencing-based assays such as ChIPSeq, MeDIPSeq, and RNASeq as well
as 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to determine the effects of natural products on the genome, epigenome
and microbiome, followed by data validation. 3) Screening and identification of natural product library for anti-
inflammatory properties as well as analysis of receptor-ligand interactions. Thus, this Core will provide COBRE
investigators with in-depth and complex analyses using specialized bioinformatics tools and statistical
approaches to address the mechanistic effects of natural products on inflammation. With the advent of –omics
technology that has resulted in the acquisition of big data, specialized technology and expertise are required for
analyses that are usually not found in individual laboratories. The Core will also provide services in structural
determination and binding analysis of natural compounds of interest to the CDSI and in understanding how
botanicals promote the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and microbiome regulation of inflammation. The
Core will use an array of in silico analysis tools to determine natural compound structure and binding properties,
which will provide insights into not only the physical properties of these compounds but also significant
information pertaining to their functions as they bind and interact with various receptors. Results from these
studies will be validated with biochemical assays meant to determine how these compounds can modulate the
immune response. This Core is highly innovative and provides analytical tools that would lead to the identification
of novel modes of action of botanicals and targets of inflammation. This would aid CDSI to develop new
opportunities to pursue and advance inflammation research thereby promoting sustainability, a key component
of COBRE Phase-3. In summary, this Core will serve as a state-of-the-art hub for the pursuit of cutting-edge
research that should shed light on mechanisms of inflammation, including the identification of biomarkers for
diagnosis and prognosis as well as new drug discovery against inflammatory diseases."

The Flow Cytometry and Cell Analysis (FCCA) Core at the COBRE Center for Dietary Supplements and
Inflammation (CDSI) is a continuation of Phase-1 and Phase-2 research support facilities specifically in the areas
of Flow cytometry and cell sorting, Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and Single-Cell Spatial
Transcriptomics, and some in vivo studies such as endoscopy and colonoscopy. This Core has been highly
innovative and extensively used in the past including 18 Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and 26 Pilot Project
Leaders (PPLs) as well as numerous other investigators. One of the focuses of this Core is to provide multi-
parameter flow cytometry and sorting services for phenotyping and isolation of specific cell types, determination
of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis as well as expression of signaling molecules, transcription factors,
and cytokines at the protein level in inflammation and following treatment with botanicals. Flow cytometry is a
much-needed technology for all immunological studies to rapidly analyze single cells. In addition to the analysis
of cells, a major application of flow cytometry is sorting cells for further functional analysis or for adoptive transfer
to corroborate their properties and functions. The flow cytometry in this Core has been updated with recent
technologies and equipment such as BD FACS-Aria II, which is a high-performance cell sorter and flow
cytometer capable of sorting up to 70,000 events per second. In addition, this core has a Beckman Coulter
FC500 Flow Cytometer which complements the capabilities of the FACS ARIA II. We have also recently
procured, a BD Celesta Flow Cytometer that can run up to 14 colors, BD-Symphony Flow Cytometer (50
parameters capable), as well as a BD FACSymphony S6 sorter which has 5 lasers, 23 color detectors, and 6-
way sorting capability. This Core will also provide Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a technology that
allows transcriptomic analyses of individual cells. Additionally, the Core will also offer the latest technology,
Single-Cell Spatial Transcriptomics, which allows to capture the transcriptional activity within an intact tissue,
either for regions or single cells. By analyzing single cells within a complex population mix, these technologies
allow the delineation of how inflammation before or after treatment with botanicals may affect individual and rare
cell types within that organ or tissue. Additionally, this Core will support in vivo studies such as mouse endoscopy
to study inflammation in the colon during colitis and colon cancer, as well as plethysmography to study the
functions of the lungs during acute lung inflammation. The Core will continue to provide training to the faculty
and lab personnel for performing cutting-edge research, including experimental design, operation of equipment,
and training on instrumentation. In addition to individual interactions, didactic courses, seminars, and workshops
will be regularly sponsored. The Core has developed several innovative approaches to increase the critical mass
of users thereby providing sustainability to the Core facility."
10933097,"Project Summary
Basic and translational research in hematology has been at the cutting edge of recent advances in our
understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of disease for decades. This T32 grant, for which we request
renewal, was submitted 5 years ago to replace the former Harvard Medical School Training Program in
Molecular Hematology, which had a distinguished 25-year track record in training graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in the study of blood and its disorders, with many graduates of the program going on to
highly successful academic careers. The past 30 years have seen many changes in the landscape of
hematology-oncology in the Harvard Medical area, with the merging of the Hematology program at the
Brigham and Women’s Hospital with the oncology programs at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the
Dana-Farber to form a combined Hematology-Oncology fellowship. This has had many positive effects on the
opportunities for clinical and research training, complemented by a proliferation of training programs. At the
same time, an explosion of new technologies has ushered in an era in biomedical research that offers exciting
opportunities for major breakthroughs in our understanding of human disease, offering hope for new clinical
paradigms that can transform the treatment of many hematologic disorders. However, the loss of a dedicated
Hematology fellowship has made us acutely aware of the importance of nurturing physician scientists
dedicated to the study of hematology. Indeed, the disappearance of free-standing hematology fellowships
nationwide and the shrinking numbers of Hematology trainees signals an urgent need to encourage future
academic hematologists. This program places high priority on training physician-scientists focused on
hematology, and we have been gratified to see an increasing number of clinical fellows who choose to do
research as trainees on this grant. To date, we have accommodated all the MD and MD/PhD fellows with a
research focus on Hematology, although we have a selection process in place should we have to limit
availability because of an increase in interested fellows. This process has already been used in the first two
years of the grant to select PhD fellows to fill available slots, although all subsequent slots have been taken by
physician scientists. The primary site of training is the preceptor’s laboratory, but each trainee is expected to
participate in relevant seminars and courses within the HMS community. Each trainee also assembles a
training committee that monitors research progress with annual formal presentations. We strongly encourage
the investigation of benign hematologic disorders in the areas of red cell disorders, iron metabolism,
hemostasis and thrombosis, and neutrophil disorders, as well as hematologic malignancies such as leukemia,
myelodysplasia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This strict focus on Hematology distinguishes this grant
from other Harvard-related training grants, fulfilling a need that is not answered by any other training grant
within adult medicine. We request renewal of this application with its 8 current training positions."
10935792,"Project 4 will evaluate the benefits, harms, and costs of personalized screening using one of the CISNET
models of breast cancer. We will evaluate the current approaches to personalized screening in WISDOM and
optimize the risk thresholds for the new subtype-specific risk models developed in this grant (Projects 2, 3) at
the population level in the US. We will compare personalized screening to the screening recommendations of 3
guidelines widely used in the US (ACR, ACS, USPSTF). Given that the natural history of breast cancer is long,
it is not possible to perform randomized trials comparing multiple screening strategies to assess their impact on
breast cancer morbidity and mortality. The MISCAN-Fadia is one of six CISNET models of breast cancer in the
US refined over 20 years of NCI funding. It allows us to estimate and compare the impact of different
approaches to breast cancer screening on long-term breast cancer outcomes to complement the evidence
generated from randomized trials such as WISDOM. Modeling has the advantage of combining evidence from
multiple high-quality data sources and simulating the impact of screening strategies on both harms and
benefits in subgroups of women based on their age, breast density, comorbidity level, race, and risk factor
profile. The results of simulation modeling provide critical data that have been used to guide national screening
recommendations globally. Most recently, the MISCAN-Fadia model was one of the CISNET models used to
guide the 2023 draft United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer screening
guidelines.
The aims of the project will implement the personalized screening approaches used in WISDOM 1.0 and 2.0 in
the MISCAN model to project their impact on the benefits, harms and costs of breast cancer screening and
treatment and compare these outcomes to those from other screening strategies. We will then incorporate the
risk prediction tools for fast and slow growing cancers developed in the other projects in the grant into the
MISCAN model in order to identify the optimal risk thresholds to use for the updated risk prediction tools. For
example, we will systematically vary the risk thresholds for fast growing tumors used to recommend more
intensive screening (MRI alternating with mammography every 6 months) and the risk thresholds for slow
growing tumors used to recommend endocrine therapy and less frequent screening to estimate their impact on
breast cancer specific mortality and other outcomes. Scenarios that result in a gain of at least 5 quality
adjusted life years (approximately the gain from the move to tomosynthesis from digital mammography) with no
increase in total costs will be presented to a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to allow them to choose the
thresholds that will be implemented in the next iteration of risk-based personalized screening in the WISDOM
study."
10935793,"CORE B: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core’s primary goal is to collaborate with the P01 Investigators and other
Core resource scientists to ensure that research conducted within the framework of this P01 program adheres
to the highest standards of quality, rigor, and reproducibility. The overarching goal of this P01 is to develop a
precision medicine platform that enhances the personalization of breast cancer screening and prevention. This
will be achieved through the application of subtype-specific risk assessment, risk-based screening, and risk
reduction strategies. This ambitious initiative involves: Expanding the enrollment of the WISDOM 1.0 study to
an extended network and evaluating the performance of our subtype-specific risk predictors (WISDOM 2.0) in
Project 1; Updating risk models by incorporating polygenic risk scores (PRS’), mammographic AI, and clinical
factors to predict specific subtypes of breast cancers (fast vs. slow-growing) in Projects 2 and 3; Utilizing the
MISCAN (CISNET) model to estimate the long-term benefits, potential harms, and cost-effectiveness of both
WISDOM 1.0 and 2.0. The BBC will serve as a centralized resource for comprehensive analytic,
computational, and data management support to ensure the success of individual projects and the P01 as a
whole. It is committed to provide timely support tailored to the specific needs of each project and Core, using
best practices and innovations in biostatistics/ bioinformatics/ machine learning/ data science. Administrative
efficiency will be achieved through centralized task prioritization and milestone tracking. Cost effectiveness will
be achieved by leveraging existing expertise and infrastructure. Under Aim 2 (Providing Centralized Data
Management) in accordance with NIH’s data sharing and privacy requirements and reproducible research
principles, we will extend I-SPY 2’s cloud-based platform and incorporate WISDOM 1.0 data collection
infrastructure to establish a secure, integrated cloud-based platform for this P01. Comprehensive support will
be provided across all phases of research endeavors, encompassing everything from shaping research
inquiries to gathering, analyzing, interpreting data, and disseminating results. The specific nature of
collaboration will be fine-tuned to the unique scientific context and the distinct biostatistics, bioinformatics and
data management needs of each project. Throughout the development of P01, Core personnel have engaged
with project investigators individually, providing consultation on study design and analysis for proposed studies
in each program application."
10935794,"CORE C: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A polygenic risk score (PRS) combines risk information from many common genetic variants associated with a
disease to predict the risk of that disease. PRS’ for breast cancer are strong predictors of overall and subtype
specific breast cancer risk. The WISDOM Study relies on risk stratification of women, in part, based on genotype
data from PRS and from pathogenic variants in high and intermediate penetrance genes. To implement PRS in
the setting of a prospective clinical study and use it to make informed decisions about initiation and frequency of
screening, the WISDOM Study requires high quality genotype data, imputation and calculation. In addition, the
approach should be amenable to updates since improvements in PRS are expected in the next several years.
Core C, the Population Genomics Core Risk Assessment (PGRA) Core, will be responsible for ensuring high
quality genotype data and PRS integration occurs for each of the projects in the P01. To support Project 1, the
PGRA will oversee processing of low pass whole genome (LPWGS) data into genotypes and integrate these
into PRS for overall breast cancer and for breast cancer subtypes including PRS for fasting growing breast
cancer and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. The PGRA will also implement newer PRS for fast growing
breast cancer and update this as it is improved by Project 2. In addition, the PGRA will implement PRS as a
modifier of risk for carriers of pathogenic variants in intermediate susceptibility breast cancer genes to inform
screening and prevention by Project 1. The PGRA will support Project 2 by providing genotype data cleaning,
imputation of genotypes across all of the datasets that are used and by providing ancestry estimation. Project 3
will be supported by providing imputation and PRS calculation. For both Project 1 and Project 3, the PGRA will
provide updates for PRS’ for different ancestry populations as work in Project 2 demonstrates improved PRS
across diverse ancestry populations. In addition, the PRS will provide Project 4 with distributions of risk by
different thresholds of PRS, family history and pathogenic variant status across different ancestry and
race/ethnicity populations. The PGRA will collaborate closely with Core B on joint modeling of PRS and non-
genetic risk factors and with Core D to prepare materials for risk communication. Overall, the PGRA will support
all Projects and collaborate closely with other Cores to ensure that genetic risk information is optimally used
throughout the study."
10935914,"POPULATION SCIENCES IN THE PACIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAM - ABSTRACT
The Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) Program focuses on population-based research, with an
emphasis on cancer epidemiology and cancer prevention. The mission of the PSP Program is to conduct
epidemiological, behavioral, and translational research to understand patterns of cancer occurrence across our
catchment populations, with the goal of decreasing the overall cancer burden, as well as cancer disparities, in
our catchment area. The Program has 24 Full Members and 13 Associate Members. The majority of these
Members are located at UHCC and several at UH professional schools, with a few from research institutions in
the Pacific. Currently, PSP research is supported by $6.2M annually in direct cost, including $3M from the
NCI and $2.16M from other NIH institutes. Over the past six years, PSP Members published 778 cancer-
related research articles; of which 39% were intra-programmatic, 15% were inter-programmatic and 93%
were inter-institutional collaborations. To achieve the Program’s mission, PSP Members conduct cancer
research under three interconnected aims. Aim 1 is to understand environmental, lifestyle, biological and
social determinants of ethnic differences in cancer-related health behaviors, cancer risk, and patient survival.
Aim 2 is to identify novel biomarkers (e.g. radiomic, epigenomic, metabolic, genetic, and microbiomic) that
improve risk classification concerning cancer occurrence and survival. Aim 3 is to develop and test
interventions aimed at preventing and controlling cancer, and promoting cancer health equity, in our catchment
area and beyond. These Aims seek to alleviate the overall cancer burden in Hawaiʻi and the U.S. Affiliated
Pacific Islands (USAPI), and to reduce the disparities in cancer risk and outcomes across diverse populations
in our catchment area. PSP Members have a strong track record of investigating cancer risks and outcomes in
relation to diet, physical activity, obesity, ectopic fat, tobacco smoking, substance use, and other social and
behavioral factors. Their research is grounded in large-scale studies that employ innovations in epigenomics,
radiomics, biomarker identification, and social and clinical psychology. PSP Members have developed several
catchment-area-specific, culturally responsive interventions that seek to reduce cancer risk, promote cancer
control, and improve quality of life among cancer survivors. In the next period of CCSG support, PSP Members
will continue to conduct cutting-edge research under the stated three Aims. Through intensive strategic
planning, the Program has identified key emerging research areas for Program expansion, including, but not
limited to, populomics, climate change and environmental risk factors, cancer care delivery, and application of
data science to cancer prevention and control research. Supported by COE to identify the needs and priorities
of the communities that UHCC serves, and by CRTEC and PED to diversify our faculty and staff, the Program
will continue its exemplary etiologic and translational research towards addressing the goal of eliminating
cancer health disparities in Hawaiʻi and the USAPI."

Osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disorder, affects nearly 10% of the US population. Costs—including loss
of work, medications, hospitalization for joint replacement and/or repair surgery, and other types of therapy—are
high, and consume up to 0.5% of the gross domestic product of the United States.1 Aging, genetics, prior injury,
obesity, biomechanical abnormalities that accelerate joint deterioration, and inflammation play leading roles in
the pathogenesis of OA, which is characterized by changes to the joint and cartilage destruction, with
chondrocytes playing a central role in this process. To date, there are no therapies available that either prevent
progression of OA or reverse the loss of cartilage in OA joints, short of surgical joint replacement. Regenosine
is developing a first-in-class liposomal adenosine product in a proprietary, novel formulation for
regenerating cartilage in joints of patients with established OA. The goal is to offer patients a novel, disease-
modifying therapy with uncompromising efficacy relative to existing technologies. Through this therapy, the
company hopes to significantly improve clinical outcomes and patient quality of life and reduce the total health
care delivery costs associated with OA. The company demonstrated that intraarticular (IA) injections of
adenosine in a liposomal formulation reverses and reduces the severity of OA in a post-traumatic OA (PTOA)
model in rats and an obesity-related model in mice. Regenosine, after systematically formulating a series of
candidates has now further developed and optimized RgnA09M, a shelf stable formulation of liposomal
adenosine with a 15-day bioavailability. This is a significant improvement over adenosine’s half-life in whole
blood and other biological fluids of 1-4 seconds, and a similar short half-life in the joint. With the NIH-NIAMS
Phase II SBIR, Regenosine demonstrated the safety and efficacy of RgnA09M in pain, function, and cartilage
structural change in the medial meniscal release (MR) model in dogs, considered to be the closest to a gold
standard model for OA currently available in terms of anatomic similarity, disease progression, and translation
of outcomes. The company was able to show that intra-articular treatments of RgnA09M significantly improved
pain and function, and markedly slow the progression of OA until at least 6 months after treatment. Regenosine
has conducted a technology transfer to a 3rd party contract manufacturing organization who has the necessary
process, equipment, and environmental capabilities. Regenosine proposes to utilize the funds from the CRP to
pursue the following aims: 1) Validation of analytical methods and cGMP process for manufacturing RgnA09M
and 2) Manufacturing of a 1Liter sterile cGMP batch of RgnA09M for clinical Phase 1b/2a trial. The completion
of this work will allow the company to transition into clinical trials required by the FDA before commercialization
of RgnA09M."

The goal of the R25 Rare Disease Research (RDR) curriculum is to prepare a multidisciplinary and diverse group
of 50 Scholars per year to perform clinical and translational research in both genetic and non-genetic rare
disorders. This will be accomplished using a one-year 80 hr. blended teaching model. An objective of this
program is to create online modules, pod cast-style lectures, recorded didactic-style lectures and in person
experiences that enable learners from different disciplines and diverse backgrounds to actively participate in this
RDR curriculum. The field of RDR and care delivery recognizes that collaborative research and team science are
critical to improving therapeutic opportunities and wellbeing of the rare disease community. This concept serves
as the unifying theme of the curriculum. Furthermore, in addressing the issue of health equity and systemic
racism there is the need for training RDR leaders and practitioners from populations underrepresented in
medicine (UIM). As part of this objective, we will also prioritize the recruitment of Scholars from these
populations with the goal of having at least 20% of Scholars coming from populations UIM. Recruitment will
include the launching of a more expansive list of disciplines from which we will recruit scholars and creation of
an alumni participation program. We also will highlight how researchers and Scholars will “bring the table to the
participants” in RDR. By changing how the next generation of clinical researchers view recruitment and
engagement in the diverse family and patient rare disease communities, we expect to advance health equity."
10924063,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal addresses the significant, unmet need to develop and translate new therapies for children with
advanced, high-risk neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma (NB) is the third most common pediatric cancer and the
most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, accounting for 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths each
year despite an intensive, multimodal, and toxic treatment regimen. Immunotherapy offers the potential for
selective targeting and killing of cancer cells and represents an appealing alternative for eradicating recurrent,
metastatic disease and achieving durable cures with minimal toxicity. However, NB has proven poorly
responsive to most immunotherapeutic modalities, notably including immune checkpoint blockade and CAR T
cell therapy. Therefore, novel immunotherapies for NB must be developed. The objective of this proposal is to
advance and mature STING-activating nanoparticles (STANs), a promising experimental immunotherapeutic
nanomedicine for enhancing immunotherapy responses in NB, towards clinical translation. To accomplish this,
we will directly address potential barriers to the clinical advancement of STANs by further optimizing their
physiochemical and biological properties via a scalable manufacturing process, elucidating key
immunopharmacological parameters in rigorous NB mouse models, and establishing rationally-designed
immunotherapy regimens that generate robust and durable responses. We will accomplish this through the
following Specific Aims. First, we will employ an integrated polymer and materials science approach to
reproducibility fabricate STANs with optimized properties via a facile and scalable flash nanoprecipitation
nanofabrication strategy. Second, we will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, pharmacodynamics,
safety, and therapeutic efficacy of STANs in a rigorous immunocompetent NB that mimic human disease.
Third, we will evaluate and optimize rationally-designed immunotherapy regimens combining STANs with
immune checkpoint blockade and NB-targeted CAR T cells. We expect the proposed work to address several
critical preclinical gaps that, when filled, will accelerate STANs toward clinical translation. Therefore, this
research addresses a problem of high clinical urgency by advancing a next-generation nanotechnology for
enhancing immunotherapy responses in NB."

ABSTRACT
An overarching theme of this Program Project is to develop novel statistical methods that are
understandable and useable by outside investigators in the analysis of their data. In order to accomplish
this, two of the major goals of this Program are to demonstrate the application of new methods to real data,
and to make our methods accessible to a broad community of researchers. Core D will facilitate both of
these goals. First, the Core will generate ‘master’ databases for the benchmarking of new statistical
methods as well as publishing novel biological findings. The Core will synthesize essential variables
(specific outcomes, predictors, covariates, etc.) from public resources as well as ongoing research studies,
and work with Core B to merge data drawn from external data resources into the master databases.
Second, the Core will assist and advise on implementing best practices for data analysis with a focus on
reproducibility. To ensure reproducibility we will exploit embed technologies such as containers (e.g.,
Docker), version control software (e.g., Git), and data sharing tools (e.g., Zenodo). Finally, we will develop
educational material and run training boot camps and hack fests to teach outside investigators use of the
software tools and datasets generated from this program. Such forums will help 1) evaluate the packages,
2) accelerate scientific discoveries, and 3) promote the developed methods to the broader scientific
community."

A diverse faculty body enhances scientific discovery. Despite efforts to increase diversity, women, persons with
disabilities, and individuals from certain racial /ethnic groups remain underrepresented in the biomedical workforce.
Diversifying biomedicalresearch faculty is an ongoing challenge and a high-priority need. There are also barriers
to retention of underrepresented faculty and success which can include a lack of clarity around promotion criteria,
effective mentorship and formalfaculty development programs as well as perceptions of unwelcoming institutional
cultures and a lack of inclusivity. Thus, multiple evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance faculty
diversity, success and inclusion. Cluster hiring at academic institutions is an effective strategy for enhancing
faculty diversity. This strategy coupled with formal structured faculty mentorship, research and career
development programs improvefaculty competencies, enable success and can impact organizational culture.
Transforming institutional culture requires organized programs led by experienced faculty, administrators, staff,
and institutional leaders, with a shared vision of enhancing faculty diversity and inclusion. Such programs also
require institutional support and resources to ensure sustainability. The overall goal of the University of California,
San Diego (UCSD) Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Administrative Core
is to provide strategic leadership, management, and administrative oversight to support the UCSD FIRST Cohort
Program’s evidence-based strategies to recruit twelve new faculty, enhance FIRST participants’ academic
advancement, research success, and inclusive institutional excellence. We hypothesize that cluster hires within
four areas of institutionalresearch strength, neurosciences, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease
and immunology, will provide affinity groups as the nidus of inclusive excellence. Immersion in structured
programs organized by theFaculty Development Core will provide direction in academic promotion resulting in
enhanced retention and academic success. We propose four specific aims: Aim 1. Provide management and
coordination to support theadministrative, communication, and fiscal components of the FIRST Cohort Program,
Aim 2. Establish and implement protocols for search, recruitment, and hiring of FIRST Cohort, Aim 3. Promote
FIRST cohort faculty impactful research productivity to meet retention expectations and Aim 4. Implement
strategic plan to foster institutional inclusive excellence and culture transformation. Working with the Evaluation
Core, the AdministrativeCore will leverage existing data on faculty perceptions of the research environment and
faculty development to establish metrics for the “baseline” and successful cultural transformation. These aims
will promote UCSD culture change towards inclusive excellence by using evidence-based strategies to enhance
underrepresented faculty academic advancement, research and career development, integration and
implementation of system-wide structured faculty development programs to enhance inclusivity."

A diverse biomedical workforce is critical for enhancing scientific innovation, health equity, and inclusive
excellence. However, the number of historically underrepresented racial/ethnic (UR) scientists and women,
especially UR women remain disproportionately low in the biomedical workforce, particularly as faculty at
research institutions. UR and women biomedical researchers are also less likely to be awarded NIH funding and
are underrepresented in leadership positions. Key barriers to faculty retention and success include a lack of
clarity regarding promotion criteria, effective mentorship and formal structured faculty development programs. In
addition, the gap in representation is caused in large part by institutional cultures that lack critical elements of
inclusion and equity. Thus, multiple evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance faculty diversity, success
and inclusion. Cluster hiring at academic institutions is an effective strategy for enhancing faculty diversity.
Formal structured faculty mentorship, research and career development programs improve faculty competencies
and success and can impact organizational culture. The goal of the University of California San Diego (UCSD)
Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Faculty Development Core is to use
evidence-based strategies to enhance FIRST participants’ academic advancement, research success, and
inclusive institutional excellence. The objective of the Faculty Development Core is to develop institutional
strategies to establish effective mentorship, enhance research and career development and promote
interventions that will reduce isolation and increase community building for all UCSD FIRST participants. We
hypothesize that UCSD FIRST cohort participants engaging in the Faculty Development Core program
components will obtain direction in academic promotion, strong mentorship in research and career development,
access to networks of colleagues, integration into their units and inclusion in robust communities of diverse
scholars comprised of peers, near-peers and senior faculty across UCSD. We propose three specific aims. Aim
1. Strategy and Methodology. To improve UCSD FIRST faculty training for promotion, tenure and advancement
and enhance integration into the department/division and institution. Aim 2. Professional Development and
Progression. To improve and support faculty research and career development using evidence-based strategies.
Aim 3. Culture and Environment. To reduce isolation, promote community building, support new faculty timely
academic advancement and to enhance institutional inclusive excellence. Together, these aims will promote
UCSD culture change towards inclusive excellence by using evidence-based strategies to enhance UR faculty
academic advancement, research and career development, integration and implementation of system-wide
structured faculty development programs to enhance inclusivity."

with catchment area needs, and the launch of a new Translational Sciences Initiative to support the development 
of innovative investigator-initiated clinical trials based on research at UNMCCC. The CT translational pipeline 
currently includes: i) unique small molecule discovery, ii) innovative drug delivery and cancer vaccine design, iii) 
translation of new agents and drug combinations to clinical and community interventional trials at UNMCCC and 
nationally, and iv) development of a clinical trials menu to meet the needs of patients in our catchment area,
supported by a renewed Minority/Underserved NCI NCORP grant. CT collaborates with the Cellular and
Molecular Oncology (CMO) research program to identify and prioritize molecular targets for therapeutic 
interventions; with the Cancer Control and Population Science (CCPS) Program to implement new strategies for 
cancer prevention; and with UNMCCC disease-focused Clinical Working Groups (CWG) and CPDM to develop 
innovative clinical trials based on center science. Major paradigm-shifting and practice-changing

 To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in
eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and
their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in
a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati
(MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning
at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of
results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues
raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents
regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate
Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We
will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates
(GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate
developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the
harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been
achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
(OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV
genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.)
We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return
of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable
PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART
on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks
framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and
GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA
samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and
mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC.
To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide
services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine
headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance
toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families."
10925144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy is a promising approach for treating patients with advanced breast cancer. However,
immunosuppressive microenvironments induced by regulatory T cells (Treg) present a major barrier to
successful anti-tumor immunotherapy. Defining the suppressive mechanisms used by different types of tumor-
infiltrating Treg cells is essential for the development of novel strategies to treat human breast cancer. We
recently discovered high percentages of γδ Treg cells existing among the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
of breast tumor patients, which are strongly negatively correlated with clinical outcomes. We further identified a
novel suppressive mechanism whereby γδ Treg cells induce senescence in T cells and dendritic cells (DCs)
that then also develop potent suppressive activity. Therefore, it is critical to further identify the molecular
mechanisms responsible for γδ Treg-induced senescence in immune cells, and then to develop strategies to
reverse senescence induction mediated by γδ Treg cells. Increasing evidence indicates that the ability of a
lymphocyte to perform functional immune responses is controlled by pathways of energy metabolism.
However, little is known about the regulation of energy metabolism in tolerogenic DCs and Treg cells. We
recently found that γδ Treg cells dramatically reprogram DC lipid metabolism. In addition, we observed that
TLR8 signaling significantly suppresses glucose metabolism in human γδ Treg cells via inhibition of both
glucose transporters and glycolysis-related enzymes. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that: 1)
breast cancer-derived γδ Treg cells rewrite lipid metabolism in DCs, resulting in DC senescence with
tolerogenic phenotypes and functions; 2) reprogramming of metabolism in Treg cells and DCs can serve as a
novel strategy to synergistically enhance anti-tumor immunity for tumor immunotherapy. Specific Aim 1 seeks
to identify what lipid species are changed in γδ Treg-induced senescent DCs and whether the altered lipid
components are causatively related to the DC senescence and impaired functions. We will then investigate the
importance of transcription factor STAT and PD1-PDL1 signaling in controlling lipid metabolism disorder,
senescence induction and impaired functions occurred in γδ Treg-treated DCs. Specific Aim 2 will identify the
key glucose metabolites that involve γδ Treg-mediated immune suppression and are regulated by TLR8
signaling for functional reversal in human γδ Treg cells. We will then test the novel concept that TLR8
activation in γδ Treg cells combined with checkpoint blockade of PD-L1 in DCs can serve as novel strategies to
reprogram their metabolism and synergistically enhance anti-tumor immunity for breast cancer immunotherapy.
A positive outcome from these studies should lead to novel strategies to reprogram innate and adaptive
immune cell metabolism for future breast cancer immunotherapy."

related quality of life, cause decision regret and require additional treatment. A new surgical technique, pelvic
fascia-sparing RP (PFS-RP), preserves fascial support structures, arterial supply to the penis, and nerves that
are severed and resected during conventional RP. Several retrospective series have shown significaly reduced
urinary and erectile dysfunction after PFS-RP. However, these studies have been small and had limited follow-
up for oncologic endpoints. A multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with longer follow-up is clearly
indicated. However, adequately powered surgical RCTs face significant challenges: 1) a traditional RCT of this
new technique would cost ~$10 million; and 2) typically, such RCTs accrue only about six patients per center
per year and often close prematurely due to low accrual. Indeed, there is almost a complete absence of
sufficiently powered RCTs in oncologic surgery. After considering these challenges, we developed two innovative
methodological approaches that have strong published, preliminary data. The first is to use a two-stage RCT
consent that lowers information overload, decisional burden, and anxiety. Making consent easier for patients
also reduces the burden on surgeon investigators making them more willing to accrue. Preliminary data suggest
that two-stage consent dramatically improves accrual – in one recent study, 98% of eligible patients were accrued
- while maintaining patient understanding of consent as assessed by a standard questionnaire. The second
innovation employs a web-based portal to incentivize self-entry of patient-reported outcomes by giving patients
feedback and advice in response to their answers. This portal has already been used by ~15,000 patients and
captured the endpoint for two RCTs. We propose a RCT using these two novel methodologic approaches. This
will randomized 600 patients to PFS-RP or traditional RP conducted at four centers that receive NCI SPORE
awards for prostate cancer. We will test whether PFS-RP is able to reduce urinary and erectile function, as well
as immediate surgical complications, while being non-inferior for cancer control. The study will include a rigorous
surgeon quality assurance approach, involving surgical videos uploaded to a central site and quantitative scoring
of discrete surgical steps. Successful completion of the study would not only provide evidence on the best
practice for one of the most common cancer operations but provide a novel methodological approach that could
facilitate future studies in surgical oncology."

The overarching goal of the University of Kentucky SuRE Resource Center (UK-SuRE), supported by an
NIGMS U24 grant, is to assist faculty and Office of Sponsored Project (OSP) staff at SuRE-eligible
institutions (<$6 million in NIH funding, >25% PELL eligible students) prepare and submit competitive NIH
grants applications, with an emphasis on SuRE and SuRE-First awards. To accomplish this goal, UK faculty
and research support staff with experience in all aspects of NIH grant applications will share their
knowledge with those at SuRE-eligible institutions through a series of webinars, workshops, and direct
consultation. Three regional coordinators will provide vital links between faculty and OSP staff at SuRE-
eligible institutions and faculty and research support staff at UK-SuRE. This center will also coordinate
biennial SuRE Conferences and oversee a competitive seed grant program that will provide funds for
SuRE-eligible institutions to establish or grow OSPs. Specifically, four aims are proposed: (1) Assist SuRE-
eligible faculty write grants and manage research programs, with success being measured by number of
grants submitted, scored, and funded; number of publications, seminars; and meeting presentations; and
tenure and promotion outcomes; (2) Assist SuRE-eligible institutions to establish and grow OSPs and
research infrastructure, with success being measured by growth/establishment of OSPs in SuRE-eligible
institutions, number of research grants received and overall research funding at these institutions, and
questionnaires for SuRE faculty regarding the quality of in-house OSP services; (3) Grow the number of
institutions that participate in the SuRE Program and establish an interactive community of SuRE-eligible
institutions, with success being measured by the number of institutions that participate in webinars, attend
the biennial conference, and submit NIH grants (with an emphasis on SuRE applications), as well as the
amount of peer-to-peer faculty mentoring and social media engagement; and (4) Enhance the research
experience for students who are working in NIH-funded labs in SuRE-eligible institutions, with success
being measured by student conference presentations, authorship on publications, degrees earned, and
post-graduate employment. Taken together, these activities will enhance the research capacity at SuRE-
eligible institutions and promote high-quality, student-centric biomedical research. In the process, these
outcomes will contribute to diversifying and strengthening the nation’s research enterprise."

 Patient-reported Outcomes (PROs) have been integrated into routine care at the UAB HIV Clinic to
monitor depression and substance use disorders (SUD) that, when untreated, threaten progress along the HIV
care continuum. PROs more accurately identify these comorbid conditions relative to provider documentation.
Thus, PROs enable clinics to allocate scarce mental health (MH) and SUD services to those in greatest need.
Additional treatment barriers remain even for patients with prompt diagnoses, especially in rural and Southern
states with limited access to MH and addiction treatment providers. Telemedicine has been effectively used to
expand medical care to rural and impoverished areas. Yet, there remains a knowledge gap about optimal
implementation strategies for and effectiveness of innovative technologies (PROs, telemedicine) in real-world
settings. To address this gap, investigators will leverage the Alabama Quality Management Group (AQMG), a
consortium of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP)-funded clinics in Alabama, founded in 2006. We
propose a multicomponent intervention, HIV+ Service delivery and Telemedicine through Effective PROs
(+STEP), to increase screening and treatment of depression and SUD in AQMG sites. According to Gelberg’s
Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, health outcomes are optimized by addressing (1) predisposing
factors like MH and substance use disorders; (2) enabling factors such as personal and community resources;
and (3) health behaviors like use of medical services. The +STEP intervention will address these domains using
PROs to more accurately diagnose depression and SUD (predisposing), targeted knowledge to frontline
clinicians (enabling), and use of telemedicine to expand MH and SUD resources (health behavior). We propose
a hybrid type 1-design study to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of this multicomponent
intervention (PROs, training, and telemedicine). We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR) to identify implementation strategies and guide implementation, scale up, and maintenance of
+STEP. Our principle objectives are to characterize patient and clinic uptake; create an implementation blueprint
of barriers, facilitators and implementation strategies; and evaluate effectiveness through the following aims:
Aim 1. Conduct a needs assessment and implement +STEP to improve diagnosis and treatment of MH and SUD
at 6 RWHAP clinics in Alabama.
Aim 2. Describe implementation strategies addressing barriers to uptake of +STEP in six RWHAP clinics using
CFIR.
AIM 3. Measure the impact of implementing +STEP on diagnoses, referrals, and healthcare utilization related to
depression, SUD, and HIV by comparing clinical outcomes from patients receiving +STEP with historical controls.
The expected outcomes are an implementation blueprint and real-world outcomes to inform broad
implementation of +STEP to accelerate progress along the HIV continuum towards ending the HIV Epidemic."

This research will utilize spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanostructures to develop effective, structure-informed
vaccines for advanced melanoma. Traditional treatments (i.e. chemotherapy or radiation) are less successful for
melanoma because of difficulties in discerning melanoma cells phenotypically. Immunotherapeutics must ensure
that melanoma—with a high mutational burden—cannot easily evade the immune system. SNAs can function
as robust cancer vaccines through the precise control over the presentation of multiple melanoma-associated
targets to immune cells which lowers its potential for immune evasion. SNAs are composed of a nanoparticle
core with a dense radial shell of nucleic acids. When synthesized using immunostimulatory “adjuvant”
oligonucleotides, SNAs induce immune responses. Indeed, this adjuvant only structure demonstrates the
enhanced responses generated from a 3D structure compared to linear adjuvant and forms the basis of an
ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. We have exploited the ease of chemical synthesis and modular architecture of
SNAs, and synthesized them to include both adjuvant and a single tumor-associated peptide (“antigen”). These
structures enhance antitumor responses and provide long-term protective immunity in model systems, and in
particular, there is a strong relationship between vaccine structure and efficacy. In our proposed work, we aim
to develop SNA vaccines against melanoma by precisely incorporating and presenting multiple
immunostimulatory cues to the immune system. SNAs will be synthesized with multiple clinically-relevant
melanoma antigens (MHC-I and -II restricted, tumor-associated, neoantigens), with structural variations in how
the adjuvant and antigen are presented. Control over structure, combined with in vitro and in vivo evaluations of
immunostimulation, will elucidate structure-activity relationships that will inform the future of cancer vaccine
design. Using structure to control the presentation of multiple immune system cues has the power to elevate
immune responses to melanoma and improve clinical outcomes. In Aim 1, we will synthesize SNAs containing
multiple antigens and varied stabilities to enhance antigen-specific T cell responses. We will analyze their uptake
by immune cells, subcellular trafficking of the SNA components, and kinetics of activation of multiple pathways
(e.g. antigen presentation, co-stimulatory marker expression). In Aim 2, we will compare different administration
routes and analyze in vivo biodistribution and uptake kinetics, as well as the antigen-specific immune responses
raised by SNAs in immunocompetent mice. We will assess raised responses after delivery of SNAs containing
human antigens to humanized mice and patient specimens. In Aim 3, we will evaluate SNA antitumor efficacy in
vivo alone and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade, and identify SNAs as candidates for further
preclinical studies and clinical translation. Significantly, this approach will generate a structure-based
understanding of SNA performance as vaccines, and improve immunotherapy by generating a breadth of T cell
responses with superior efficacies."

End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) impacts 4.3M patients worldwide and accounts for 7% of all
Medicare and Medicaid costs. The most prevalent modality of renal replacement, hemodialysis,
requires access to the circulation through which dialysis machinery is connected. The preferred
method of access is an arteriovenous (AV) fistula as it confers lower rates of mortality, infection
and interventions, however they are the most challenging for dialysis technicians to cannulate.
Cannulation damage is one of the primary causes of AV fistula complications and failure.
Cannulation failures and injury occur in 91% of patients within 6 months. These injuries can lead
to serious complications, such as hematoma, infection, and aneurysm formation including death
from hemorrhage, with a secondary impact on morbidity, hospitalization, access revision, and loss
of access. The annual rate of major infiltration is 5.2%, with each incident leading to an extra 97
days of catheter dependency and a mean of 2.4 diagnostic tests, surgery appointments, or
interventions. When factoring in the additional catheter time and secondary interventions, the
financial impact is $24,302 per major infiltration.
Ultrasound has been demonstrated to dramatically improve outcomes by reducing CVC time by
>30% (50 days) and infections by 37%. However, this was in the hands of nephrology physicians
in a study setting and current ultrasound options are too challenging for dialysis technicians and
are therefore not used.
We have developed an automated 3D ultrasound-based guidance solution, EchoGuide, that is
purpose-built for dialysis technicians to improve cannulation without specialized training.
In this Phase IIB proposal, we will conduct a clinical trial of EchoGuide to demonstrate a reduction
in cannulation injuries and an improvement on patient quality of life. We will also perform requisite
Verification & Validation testing and prepare a 510(k) submission for marketing authorization.
OVERALL IMPACT: EchoGuide will allow rapid and successful cannulation of AV fistulae. This will
reduce both the morbidity and costs associated with major infiltration and the associated catheter
time and additional interventions."

 Police violence against black males, in the United States (U.S.), is a public health disparity [37]. Physical &
psychological violence that is structurally mediated by systems of law enforcement, results in deaths, injuries,
trauma, and stress that disproportionately affect blacks in the U.S. According to a 2019 study, published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Americans’ risk of being killed by police is highest for black
men, who face ~1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over their lifetime. White men have ~1 in 2,500
chance of being killed by police over their lifetime, and Latino men a ~1 in 1,900 chance. Women less likely than
men to be killed by police. Their lifetime risk is ~1 in 33,000, compared to 1 in 2,000 for men. Moreover, black
men, in the U.S., are up to 3.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by law enforcement; and 1 in every
1,000 black men will die at the hands of police. In Baltimore, Maryland (MD), The Department of Justice (DOJ)
revealed, in a 163 page report, that African Americans were targeted and abused by Baltimore police indicating
a conspiracy against black citizens. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the overall
cost of fatal and nonfatal injuries, by law enforcement, is ~$1.8 billion including medical costs and work lost.
 Public health policy experts suggest that mandatory training shall be implemented to reduce implicit bias of
law enforcement officers against communities of color. However, little is known about effects of implicit biases
on behavior, and no experimental studies have been conducted to measure the impact of implicit bias reduction
interventions among law enforcement officers. Likewise, officers receive limited de-escalation training;
w/training efforts met w/ resistance from police chiefs & national Fraternal Order of Police.
 During the NIH SBIR Phase 1 effort, Juxtopia team will address aforementioned public health disparities to
help mitigate police violence endemic against black males by investigating the technical/commercial feasibility
of engineering Juxtopia® CAMMRAD Police De-escalate Virtual Reality (VR) simulation to distribute an
artificial intelligent (AI) police e-trainer & e-evaluator, “BES” built on the Juxtopia® Context-Aware Mobile
Mixed Reality Assistive Device (CAMMRAD) platform to achieve the following SBIR Phase I Specific Aims.
A. Prototype CAMMRAD Police De-Escalate VR e-train/e-evaluate police on de-escalation skills in VR.
B. Evaluate CAMMRAD Police De-Escalate VR w/ police in VR scenarios known to lead to escalation."
10923547,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Preterm infants are at a heightened risk for developing neuromotor, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders that
persist through adulthood. Infants born very preterm (<32 weeks gestational age) are three times more likely to
develop psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, ADHD, and autism compared to term infants. Critically, the
consequences of prematurity disproportionately impact Black and low SES families. The overall high
prevalence of prematurity, coupled with Black and low SES families’ increased risk, is a serious public
health concern. However, the mechanisms contributing to these disparities are largely unexplored. Identifying
modifiable mechanisms will help inform policies and practices that promote healthy neurodevelopment for
preterm infants and their caregivers. Parenting premature infants is challenging due to the physical parent-infant
separation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Extensive research has emphasized the important role of
parents and parental involvement in the NICU to promote infant neurodevelopment. Yet we know little about the
external contextual factors that impact and impede parent involvement, especially in diverse populations. A
significant barrier to NICU involvement may be conflicting work and family demands. >62% of families with
children include two working parents. Further, low-income families in particular return to paid work as soon as
four weeks after childbirth which can have implications for their ability to visit the NICU. Regrettably there is
virtually no research on NICU parents transition to parenthood from a work-family lens. The proposed
study will use a unique method, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), to monitor parents’ daily mental
health, NICU involvement, and work/family demands during their infants’ NICU hospitalization in a racially and
ethnically diverse sample of 250 families (defined as a mother, a secondary caregiver, and their infant). We aim
to 1) examine stable and dynamic associations between work factors, NICU involvement, and caregiver
mental health utilizing a longitudinal EMA burst design; and 2) examine how work, NICU involvement,
and caregiver mental health are related to infant neurodevelopment. We hypothesize that caregivers with
ideal work policies and conditions (e.g., shorter work hours, more job flexibility, more job autonomy, more paid
leave) will have better mental health and more NICU involvement, which, in turn, will be associated with better
infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at NICU discharge and 1-year follow-up. Additionally, given the differential
NICU experience for Black and low SES families, we hypothesize that the associations between work, mental
health, NICU involvement, and infant neurodevelopment will be exacerbated for Black and low SES families.
Results from this study will address the important public health concern of prematurity in diverse families from a
unique work-family lens that may help identify family-level and state/federal policy-level intervention targets to
support parent NICU involvement and mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of prematurity."
10921186,"Diabetes affects nearly 1 in 4 Veterans receiving care from the VA. Reduced b-cell mass and increased b-cell
apoptosis are key to the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, identifying factors that
can protect from b-cell apoptosis will meet a critical therapeutic need in the prevention and treatment of diabetes
in Veterans. Compensatory responses in b-cells allow adaptation to the stress of obesity, insulin resistance and
inflammation and can help preserve b-cell mass and prevent progression to diabetes. Our laboratory has dis-
covered that the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is produced in the pancreatic islet in response to metabolic
stress and can promote b-cell survival. Further, we find that CCK receptor (CCKR) agonist treatment of human
islets can significantly improve b-cell survival, supporting substantial translational relevance. The long-term goal
of my research program is to identify novel pathways critical in the preservation of b-cell mass. The overall
objective of this application is to determine how CCK expression and CCK receptor signaling impact islet home-
ostasis and b-cell survival. The central hypothesis is that CCK promotes functional b-cell survival. CCK-express-
ing islet cells may have reduced b-cell maturity, yet are critical to promote survival of neighboring b-cells through
paracrine signaling. To achieve the objective, three interconnected Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will
identify the regulators of b-cell CCK expression in mouse and human islets under conditions of hyperglycemia
and cellular stress using both targeted and untargeted approaches. Preliminary evidence support the hypothesis
that GLP-1, cAMP, and glucose all contribute to CCK expression. In Aim 2, we will determine how CCK expres-
sion impacts islet cell identity, function and survival. We will use innovative experimental techniques, including
lineage-tracing mouse models, droplet-assisted RNA targeting single cell sequencing, and live cell imaging to
characterize and determine the impact of CCK-expressing cells in the islet. In Aim 3 we will investigate how
short-term incubation of human islets with CCKR agonists alters gene transcription and signaling pathways to
promote sustained b-cell survival. Additionally, we will determine the impact of CCK pretreatment on early human
islet graft survival after transplantation. Taken together our work supports the innovative concept of an intra-islet
signaling network whereby the non-classic hormone CCK promotes b-cell survival. As human islets have very
different characteristics than mouse islet, examining the role of CCK specifically in human islets is of critical
importance to translation of our findings to diabetes therapies. These studies will contribute to our fundamental
understanding of how b-cells respond to metabolic stress, as we propose that “de-differentiation” of a subpopu-
lation of b-cells will in fact allow production of non-canonical hormones that promote b-cell survival. This contri-
bution is significant as it will advance knowledge of both adaptive and therapeutic mechanisms of functional b-
cell survival, allowing development of targeted therapies with maximal efficacy and minimal side effects."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a hidden public health problem, due to ineffective
disease testing and surveillance strategies. Testing for HCV is two-step, with patients initially
screened for HCV antibodies, followed with an RNA viral load (VL) test at a subsequent visit.
However, follow up rates are low due to the time it takes to obtain results and the need for multiple
visits for treatment. Point of care (POC) testing is vital for disease surveillance of chronic infections
like HCV, as these tests can be performed in a single visit and decrease treatment initiation time.
Current HCV POC VL testing platforms do not meet the global stakeholder-generated target
product profile to identify active HCV infection. An additional barrier to HCV testing is sample
preparation, which is laborious, time consuming, prone to human error, and expensive. Thus, we
believe the correct strategy for HCV POC VL testing is a low-cost, automated platform that
performs HCV isolation utilizing gold-standard magnetic bead-based protocols, for shorter time to
results, greater sensitivity, and a lower limit of detection. This strategy will allow for more
widespread and accurate HCV community testing and surveillance, reducing hands-on time and
operator burden, as well as the global healthcare burden of HCV infection.
This Phase II project will implement sample-to-answer HCV POC VL testing by building on our
automated sample preparation platform and successful Phase I development of an RPA
isothermal assay for HCV detection."

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) contributes considerably to the global burden of dementia. As vascular
diseases can be both prevented and safely treated, there is a great potential for interventions to reduce the
burden of dementia. However, more research is needed to develop suitable biomarkers of cerebral small
vessel contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has supported the MarkVCID initiative to advance the identification and
validation of biomarkers for VCID across seven sites and a coordinating center. As one contributing site, our
team has led the development of two candidate biomarkers, helped define and harmonize all protocols, and
joined multisite validation with the recruitment of the largest Hispanic sample from a single site. In this
proposal, we seek to include a more diverse population across South Texas, including Hispanic and African
Americans, from Houston and San Antonio, from stroke and dementia clinics, primary care, and population
studies. We further propose additional validation of candidate biomarkers in the rich datasets of four cohorts in
the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium that have legacy
data (MRI, dementia) and biospecimens (plasma, serum, brain autopsy).
As a MarkVCID site, we aim to perform a comprehensive, longitudinal validation of candidate biomarkers of
CSVD in a diverse sample. We aim to recruit 400 participants over age 55 years with subjective cognitive
complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or early dementia of presumed vascular etiology and retain at least 320
of them over the 5-year follow-up; ~60 will be persons seen in the UH3 phase and will have 7 years of follow-
up. We will perform a comprehensive examination to collect medical history, biospecimens (blood, CSF),
imaging (MRI with cerebrovascular reactivity, optical coherence tomography angiography), and
neuropsychological data (cognition, CDR) following the protocols developed during the UH2/UH3 phases of the
MarkVCID consortium. We will perform a follow-up examination with interim phone screenings for cognitive
status and continuous dementia surveillance via consensus conferences. Further, we will offer brain autopsy to
consenting participants for the assessment of clinicopathological correlates of VCID biomarkers. We will
measure selected fluid and imaging biomarkers following established kit protocols, and perform longitudinal
clinical validation of biomarkers according to their pre-specified hypotheses. Finally, we will perform additional
validation in four cohorts of the CHARGE consortium. Data, biospecimens, and results will be shared with the
consortium and external qualified investigators through the designated MarkVCID coordinating center. Our
team will have strong leadership with the PIs of the UH3 Seshadri, Fornage (multiple PI), Tracy (Co-I), a
proven, young Co-I now taking over as Contact PI (Satizabal), and the addition of an exceptional stroke trials
leader (Savitz)."
10922110,"KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) submits this proposal to expand and fully evaluate the
Intervention to Help Orient Men to Excel (IN-HOME). IN-HOME is a culturally competent, online professional
development course to prepare community health workers (CHWs) to conduct outreach to reduce informal
caregiver burden, with a specific focus on supporting Black and Latino male caregivers of older adults (aged
65+) who are aging in place. The IN-HOME model has two stages. In stage one, the training course increases
CHWs’ knowledge, skills, and perceived self-efficacy to conduct outreach to Black and Latino male caregivers.
In stage two, IN-HOME-trained CHWs support Black and Latino male caregivers, and through their
interactions, build caregivers’ knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions around self-care, their
health, and caregiving topics.
 Our Phase I efforts resulted in a dynamic prototype CHW training course that significantly increased
CHWs’ abilities to conduct successful outreach. KDHRC enters the Phase II proposal with a solid prototype,
strong feasibility results, pending publications, and an outstanding team of collaborators, consultants,
contractors, and expert advisors. Phase II IN-HOME CHW training finalizations plans include adding training
lessons, developing additional interactive content, and filming video vignettes. A toolbox app will create a
technology that facilitates private synchronous and asynchronous communication between the CHW and
caregiver, which KDHRC hypothesizes will build trust and overcome hesitancy to ask for support. Once
complete, KDHRC will conduct a well-powered and methodologically strong two-arm randomized controlled
trial to explore stage 2 of the model – the impact of receiving outreach from IN-HOME trained CHWs on
caregiver outcomes.
 The need for IN-HOME is substantial. As the population of older adults continues to increase, there is a
growing need for informal caregiver support for the 90 percent of the older adults who prefer to stay in their
own homes instead of receiving institutionalized care. Almost 40 percent of all informal caregivers are male,
and minorities are more likely to be long-time caregivers and are at higher risk for caregiver burden, stress, and
burnout. But while there are millions of minority male caregivers, current resources, and even the national
discourse, have neglected this important segment of the caregiver population. CHWs are in a strategic position
to empower male caregivers, and IN-HOME will be a powerful addition to the public health arsenal to address
this challenge."

Our goal is to advance a novel, hand-sized hemostasis profiler, iCoagLAB as a companion diagnostic during
mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to predict potentially lethal bleeding in patients. MCS involves a broad
group of technologies that provide hemodynamic support to manage a range of complex cardiac conditions,
including advanced heart failure, cardiogenic shock, high-risk coronary interventions, severe cardiac or lung
dysfunction, or to facilitate cardiac surgery. Although MCS technologies have expanded treatment options for
high-risk patients, between 15-40% of patients experience life-threatening bleeding. Multiple factors including
underlying coagulopathies, clotting factor consumption, shear stresses created by mechanical pumping, platelet
impairments and fibrinolytic activation increase bleeding risk, exacerbated by heparin administered to prevent
clotting in the MCS circuit. Therefore, to assess bleeding risk, frequent coagulation testing is essential.
Unfortunately, conventional laboratory tests take too long, are ineffective in the context of rapidly changing
coagulation in critical patients, and are poorly correlated with bleeding events, resulting in hemostasis
management that is often imprecise with devastating consequences. The ability to treat rapidly evolving
coagulation impairments in those at risk is therefore restricted by the absence of tools to assess coagulation
comprehensively and swiftly at the point-of-care. As a consequence, major bleeding resulting from impaired
coagulation, remains the leading cause of death during MCS.
 Coalesenz Inc., a Boston-based start-up, is developing a novel hemostasis profiler (iCoagLAB) to rapidly
quantify several relevant coagulation and platelet parameters concurrently during MCS and provide a decisive
risk score to identify the likelihood of major bleeding. In iCoagLAB, a laser source illuminates the blood sample
and a camera images laser speckle patterns reflected from the sample over time. By analyzing laser speckle
intensity fluctuations during coagulation, we can quantify multiple coagulation metrics including prothrombin time,
activated clotting time, fibrin polymerization, fibrinolysis, platelet function, and hemoglobin and hematocrit. With
1/10th the weight and footprint of competing technologies, Coalesenz’s new hand-sized iCoagLAB instrument
lends itself for comprehensive coagulation and platelet profiling at the poc.
 Although iCoagLAB opens the opportunity to assess bleeding at the poc, the existing technology currently
is not tailored for use in patients during MCS. A key limitation is that current reagents are not suitable for testing
the wide range of heparin doses typical in MCS patients. Moreover, our existing single-channel disposables
permit only one assay at a time using blood that is pre-mixed with liquid reagents, increasing the test duration
and complexity of workflow. Therefore, in this Phase 1 proposal our objectives are to develop and test novel
milli-fluidic cartridges that permit precise metering and mixing of blood with novel lyophilized reagent beads and
enable multiplexed measurement of two assays at the same time. Thus, using just 50µL of blood, each milli-
fluidic cartridge will comprehensively profile intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function.
The studies in this Phase 1 project will constitute the basis for future Phase 2 studies that will focus on advancing
iCoagLAB towards regulatory approval as the first companion diagnostic during MCS to identify patients at high
risk of bleeding."

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), the second most common form of
dementia, comprise a spectrum of fatal neurodegenerative diseases. An intronic GGGGCC (G4C2)
hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene, have been linked to ALS and FTD, although
clinically two distinct diseases. The C9orf72 HRE is the most common cause of both familial and sporadic ALS
accounting for ~40% and ~8% of patients respectively. Overall, about 10% of ALS cases are familial with the
remaining 90% being sporadic. The molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain poorly
understood. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) have recently
emerged as a prominent pathomechanism underlying multiple neurodegenerative diseases including C9orf72
ALS/FTD, subsets of sporadic ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Huntington’s Disease. However, little is known
about the nature of the injury to the NPC and its individual nucleoporin components themselves. Using induced
pluripotent stem cell derived spinal neurons (iPSNs) and postmortem human tissue, we have amassed data
that loss of the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 from NPCs initiates a pathological cascade impacting
NPC composition, function and downstream cellular survival. Notably, loss of POM121 is mediated by
pathologic G4C2 repeat RNA and not dipeptide repeat poly peptides or loss of C9ORF72 protein. Given that
POM121 protein is not mislocalized and POM121 RNA metabolism is unaltered, we hypothesized that
POM121 and subsequently altered nucleoporin proteins are aberrantly degraded in the early stages of C9orf72
ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recent work in yeast and non-neuronal mammalian cells has shown that nuclear
CHMP7 “activates” ESCRT-III mediated degradation of nuclear pore complexes and nuclear envelope
components during nuclear pore surveillance and homeostasis. Our new preliminary data suggests that the
loss of POM121 from the nucleoplasm and NPCs is initiated by nuclear accumulation of CHMP7.
Mechanistically, increased nuclear CHMP7 appears to be the result of G4C2 repeat RNA mediated impaired
nuclear export. Thus, our data strongly implicate a CHMP7 degradative pathway in disease pathogenesis.
Intriguingly, knockdown of CHMP7 mitigates NPC injury in C9orf72 iPSNs making CHMP7 an attractive
therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. In this proposal we will comprehensively investigate this new pathway
including studies to 1) Determine the degradative pathway by which CHMP7 mediates nucleoporin removal
from NPCs in iPSNs, 2) Investigate the mechanism by which pathologic G4C2 repeat RNA initiates CHMP7
mediated NPC injury. And finally, 3) using a large battery of individual patient iPSN spinal neuron cell lines,
evaluate the ability of CHMP7 antisense oligonucleotides to mitigate C9orf72 ALS/FTD and sporadic ALS
mediated alterations in the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport and downstream sensitivity
to stressors in iPSNs."

 Human metapneumovirus (MPV) is the second leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections
(LRTI) in infants and young children, and a major cause of respiratory illness among the immunocompromised
and the elderly. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective therapy or vaccine for MPV. A pathogen-specific,
safe and effective antiviral would undoubtedly address the current gap in pharmacological interventions.
 MPV, like many common respiratory viruses, spreads in the respiratory tract by shedding progeny (i.e.
daughter) virions back into airway mucus (AM); viruses must then diffuse through AM to reach and infect the
next cell. Thus, the infection remains restricted to the apical side of the airways as it spreads from the upper
respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract, making it difficult to target by systemically dosed antivirals.
Indeed, while neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a safe and likely effective antiviral
intervention, their use is greatly limited by inconvenient dosing and limited distribution into the respiratory tract.
 Inhalon has been advancing a platform of inhaled mAb treatments capable of achieving very high
concentrations of mAb directly in the respiratory tract (i.e. the site of infection) nearly instantly. Specifically, we
have developed methods that enable stable and efficient delivery of mAbs via handheld vibrating mesh
nebulizers, with dosing completed within minutes per day in the comfort of a patient’s own home. Inhalon has
also developed a platform of muco-trapping mAbs, based on tuning sugars on the Fc domain of mAbs that
enable effective crosslinking of virion/mAb complexes to mucins. Muco-trapping mAbs can directly block
progeny viruses from diffusing through AM, and can quickly remove them from the airways by harnessing
natural mucus clearance mechanisms. We have validated our topical mAb therapy approach in hamsters
infected with MPV, as well as in lambs infected with RSV (another virus that, like MPV, propagates exclusively
by apical shedding). Recently, we completed a Phase 1 human clinical study of the safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics of an inhaled mAb against SARS-CoV-2, and found excellent safety and high concentrations
of drug in the airways in humans, despite using a far lower dose compared to typical IV doses.
 Inhalon is advancing IN-003, comprised of a pair of potent neutralizing mAbs against MPV F protein, as
an inhaled mAb therapy against hMPV. By delivering IN-003 directly to the airways, we expect to enable
efficacious and cost-effective treatment for MPV, with limited risk of adverse side effects. In this project, we
seek to produce a GLP tox lot batch of IN-003, and conduct the key GLP IND-enabling studies required by the
FDA before advancing to the clinic. The proposed work, based on our recent regulatory experience advancing
inhaled mAbs for SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, represents the critical path to advance IN-003 into the clinic.
Successful completion of this work will put us in a position to quickly file an IND following GMP manufacturing
of clinical trial materials, leading to the first clinical study of an inhaled mAb therapy for MPV."
10922132,"The population of Americans age 65 years or older will increase from 58 million in 2021 to 88 million by 2050.
By 2050, nearly 14 million older adults are expected to have AD/ADRD. For these individuals, significant care is
required, and that care is often provided by family members. A 2022 study estimated that 11 million American
family members are providing 16 billion hours of care valued at more than $272 billion. Senior care facilities are
another option. The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected senior care facility residents. Despite representing
only about 1% of the total population in the U.S., COVID-19 deaths in senior care facilities have made up nearly
40% of total COVID-19 deaths. Senior care facilities often face staffing shortages during and after the pandemic.
Currently, 3 in 5 assisted living facilities are concerned that they may have to close due to staffing shortages.
The situation with these two caregiving options is alarming; increasing demand for caregivers coupled with short
supply has led to higher costs, unfilled needs, and fierce competition for resources. While computer technologies,
such as wearable devices, are beginning to partially alleviate the shortage of caregivers, more powerful and
personalized tools are needed. To address this urgent need, DreamFace Technologies, LLC invented Ryan®
CompanionBot, a novel humanoid socially-assistive robot expertly tailored to the specific needs of older adults
with early-stage AD/ADRD. The development of Ryan®, with the support of one NSF and two NIA/NIH SBIR
grants, has been informed by 100 customer interviews and several subsequent field tests and clinical trials
involving more than 50 older adults with early-stage AD/ADRD. In these tests, Ryan® has effectively delivered
companionship, engaging conversations, physical and mental stimulation, daily activity reminders, and valuable
assistance to the AD/ADRD-afflicted seniors powered by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies such
as facial expression recognition and synthesis, brain games, and empathic conversations while we also learned
about several additional capabilities required for commercial success. Furthermore, in the pre-launch phase of
the initial version of Ryan®, it has been deployed on a subscription basis at the esteemed senior care facility,
Morningstar, which has served as a valuable beta site. In this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) program,
we plan to complete the preparation of Ryan® for full commercialization. Specifically, we will: (1) refine and
enhance Ryan®'s software and hardware, making mass manufacturing more efficient and cost-effective while
making Ryan®'s operation more robust and easier to adopt by family members, staff, administrators, and
caregivers in senior care facilities, (2) develop robust, integrated marketing and sales strategies, (3) develop an
Intellectual Property strategy and required privacy policy and legal documents and (4) develop a financing and
fundraising strategy for the successful commercialization of Ryan®. Upon the completion of the CRP project, we
will have all the essential elements in place for the full commercialization of Ryan® as a transformative solution
for senior care, benefiting both individuals diagnosed with early-stage AD/ADRD and caregivers alike."

 Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are all too common in today’s hospital
environment. More than 1.7 million cases of transmission occur annually and often the
implicated infectious organisms are transferred from inanimate objects capable of
sustaining their viability. The disinfection methods that are used routinely in hospitals
today are imperfect and the only available and accepted methods for minimizing patient-
to-patient transmission include: 1. improved cleaning and disinfection of room surfaces,
2. implementation of 'no touch' methods for terminal room disinfection, e.g., ultraviolet
light or hydrogen peroxide vapor, and 3. use of 'self-disinfecting' surfaces to reduce the
bioburden on hospital surfaces.
 Current 'self-disinfecting' clinical surfaces with the antibacterial label are limited to
painted surfaces incorporating quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs, Sherwin
Williams Paint Shield®) and more recently a PPG paint (Copper Armor®) comprising
ceramic encapsulated copper oxide Guardiant®, Corning).
 In the proposed effort, a novel organometallic copper additive is scaled and its
manufacturing validated and liquid and powder paint formulations created, validated, and
tested for effectiveness against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These data will be used to
support an EPA filing for products incorporating the novel additive. The major elements
of the specific aims of the proposed research involves: 1. The scaling and manufacturing
(synthesis) validation and characterization of ion exchange biocides, 2. Subsequent
formulation into two distinct coating forms, and 3. The evaluation of the time-dependent
biological performance of the modified composites under ISO 17025 and GLPs so as to
support an application to the EPA."

10907973,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall: Human Pangenome Coordination Center)
The human reference genome has been the cornerstone of human genetics and genomics research for over
twenty years. However, there is a broad consensus that no single reference sequence can fully represent the
spectrum of genomic diversity across global populations. Advances in sequencing technologies and a greater
appreciation for the importance of genetic diversity make improving the human reference sequence both timely
and practical. With advances in long-read sequencing technologies and computational methods, it is now
feasible to construct a human pangenome reference that captures and represents the full compendium of genetic
variation from a large collection of diverse genomes. We will extend the successful infrastructure developed by
the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Coordination Center. In the next phase, we will significantly
improve the human pangenome reference by representing as much human genetic variation as needed to meet
disparate scientific and clinical applications, while engaging with international partners and the global research
community to provide a widely accessible and user friendly pangenomic resource and tool ecosystem. During
the second phase of the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, our Coordination Center will: i) Continue
to maintain and improve the pangenome reference, including supporting the generation of additional diverse,
reference quality sequence assemblies; ii) Facilitate adoption of the pangenome reference by the broad research
and clinical genetics and genomics communities; iii) Foster the development and deployment of user-friendly
informatics tools for the pangenome; iv) Facilitate embedded ELSI research; and, v) Develop international
partnerships to ensure that the human pangenome reference engages with the populations it seeks to represent."
10906890,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Postnatal development of the human visual system is dependent on visual experience. Abnormal visual
experience during infancy and childhood can lead to strabismic misalignment of the eyes and
amblyopia. The goal of the proposed research is to understand how the visual system uses its available
natural experience to coordinate eye alignment and focus during infancy and early childhood, in the
context of prevention of these clinical conditions. There are two interrelated projects:
i) To understand how depth information across the visual field can be used to coordinate eye alignment
and focus during early postnatal development, and how common clinical disorders during early
childhood can disrupt that coordination.
ii) To understand which image structure across the visual field is capable of driving a conjugate
orienting eye movement during early postnatal development, and how the binocular aspects of that
movement can be disrupted by common clinical disorders.
These projects will test hypotheses and build models to determine the amounts of conditions such as
anisometropia that can disrupt ocular motor control as a function of human postnatal age. Previous
studies of the development of focusing accommodation responses and aligning vergence responses
have concentrated on 2D stimuli in the central visual field, while the brain needs to function in the full
field, dynamic, three-dimensional natural environment in order for a patient to develop typical vision. It
is the interaction between this visual environment and the quality of retinal visual experience that motor
control can provide that defines a patient’s experience-dependent development. The results will
provide i) evidence-based clinical guidelines for the prevention of amblyopia and strabismus ii)
constraints for biologically-inspired simulations of the development of vision."

10930339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The parent grant for this supplement explores variation in quality of care for transition age adults
with opioid use disorder. TA adulthood—between ages 18 to 25—is a distinct and critical
developmental period where unique biological, psychological, and social changes are occurring.
SUD and mental health conditions are more prevalent in this age group than at other ages.
Effective treatment at this age has the potential for large long-term payoffs. Over the past
decade, there has been a large rise in the prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUD) among TA
adults. Yet, the treatment system for OUD performs poorly for TA adults: they are less likely to
obtain scientifically supported treatment and more likely to leave treatment early. The parent
study combines data from multiple sources, including Medicaid and a state registry of SUD
treatment episodes, to examine three aspects of OUD treatment quality for approximately
65,000 TA adults entering treatment for OUD between 2012 and 2025: 1) MOUD use; 2)
adherence to pharmacotherapy and retention in treatment; and 3) adverse events (e.g.,
overdoses). To guide our study, we employ a conceptual model that draws from the
Donabedian quality of care framework (Organizational Structure>Clinical Process>Outcome)
and from social ecology to examine program quality of OUD treatment for TA adults while
accounting for individual and community level factors associated with the ability of these
programs to deliver care. An important feature of this project is the close partnership between
the academic research team and leadership for the agency that regulates addiction treatment in
New York. Mr. Rentería’s professional development will be enhanced by participating in this
partnership between health services researchers and policy makers to bring scientific methods
to practice change.
Current progress. The parent award is in its first year of a five-year project. The multidisciplinary
and cross-institutional project team has formed, the analytical dataset is being developed, and
outreach has begun to develop and convene a stakeholder council to advise on the conduct of
the research. One emerging question stemming from early meetings of the investigative team is
about variation in beliefs, values, and practices of prescribers of MOUD for TA adults. The
decisions regarding medication administration among these prescribers may have significant
impact on the response to treatment among TA adults."
10930345,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rates of poor cardiovascular health (CVH) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for women are greatest
among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low-income, and residents of the southeastern U.S. Women’s
cardiovascular risk factors relate to risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and affect the CVH of their children.
Effective and scalable interventions that improve or preserve CVH of vulnerable mothers and children are
urgently needed, and home visiting programs provide a unique and efficient platform to intervene during these
critical life periods. As part of the “Early Intervention to Promote Cardiovascular Health of Mothers and Children
(ENRICH)” program, this application proposes an ENRICH clinical center in Alabama (AL), a state with some
of the nation’s poorest CVH and highest CVD mortality. This project builds upon and expands our ongoing
work to evaluate an obesity prevention intervention integrated into home visiting services in AL. In collaboration
with our home visiting program partners and the national ENRICH consortium, we propose to design and
implement ENRICH-AL, a novel behavioral intervention promoting maternal and child CVH among families
enrolled in five large home visiting programs that provide services in 39 AL counties. We will conduct a type 1
hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (N=500-600 dyads, including high-risk mothers and their child aged 0-
4 years). During an average follow-up of 3 years, the trial will compare CVH indicators in mothers and children
receiving ENRICH-AL versus standard home visiting services. In preparation for this trial, a 2-year UG3
planning phase includes 2 aims – UG3 Aim 1: Develop intervention content/delivery and a common protocol;
and UG3 Aim 2: Conduct pilot studies to refine the intervention and common protocol, and train home visiting
and research staff in the final protocol. Following successful attainment of UG3 milestones, the 5-year UH3
implementation phase will include the following aims – UH3 Aim 1: Evaluate effectiveness of the intervention
based on a composite measure of CVH in women and standardized BMI-for-age (z-score) in children (primary
outcomes); UH3 Aim 2: Evaluate effectiveness of the intervention for other CVH risk factors, psychosocial
outcomes, and contextual factors (secondary outcomes); UH3 Aim 3: Evaluate ENRICH-AL implementation
outcomes guided by the RE-AIM framework; and UH3 exploratory aim: Examine treatment moderators,
including demographics, social determinants of health, and pregnancy-related factors. Given 1) our existing
research collaborations with home visiting programs, 2) expertise in conducting CVH interventions, 3)
participation in other large, multi-site collaborative projects, and 4) the disproportionate CVD burden
experienced in AL, we are uniquely-positioned to contribute to this important initiative to identify effective and
scalable solutions to improve CVH among women and children."

Development Award (K12), Doctors as Valued Learning Partners (DEVELOP), is to train clinicians and
scientists with doctoral degrees to become independent investigators pursuing cutting-edge clinical and
translational sciences (CTS) research. Serving the diverse needs of early career investigators from a variety of
backgrounds (including PhD, MD, DDS, DMD, DO and PharmD), the DEVELOP program will provide a tailored
approach for each Scholar that fosters development of the key skills required of translational scientists. In
our first 4 years and despite a pandemic, the KL2 program was highly successful and its Scholars highly
productive. In response to the PAR, we now have re-imagined the KL2 program as the K12 DEVELOP program.
The DEVELOP program is comprised of intensive research experiences, a core curriculum, elective courses,
professional development training, and multi-disciplinary mentoring. The result will be a cadre of translational
Scholars with a strong understanding of mechanistic approaches to study disease processes and healthcare
delivery, the tools and methodologies used to translate important basic science discoveries to clinical and
community settings, and an understanding of how public policy should inform basic science research. NJ ACTS,
an Alliance consisting of Rutgers University, Princeton University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and
RWJBarnabas Health system, provides an environment with substantial research resources and experienced
faculty mentors, who have a strong track record of and commitment to fostering career development of future
clinical and translational scientists. DEVELOP Scholars will be early career faculty from Alliance partners or
f a c u l t y b e i n g recruited externally. Selection of DEVELOP Scholars will be based on qualifications and
interests as well as research potential and commitment to developing a career in the translational sciences.
DEVELOP Scholars will engage in two years of individualized and intensive research under the direction of highly
qualified and productive mentors who are members of the Academy of Mentors. The mentoring program is
structured to provide the Scholar with a strong, broad, and fundamental knowledge base individually tailored
for translational science. Scholars will additionally participate in an innovative didactic curriculum consisting of
research seminars, journal clubs, and formal courses, including in the ethical conduct of research and rigor and
responsibility. Individual development plans, well-defined milestones, and regular meetings with mentors and
NJ ACTS leadership will ensure the Scholars’ successful progress towards becoming independent
translational scientists. The ample resources to enrich Scholar development as faculty underscore the continued
institutional commitment to translational science. Anticipated outcomes include excellence in career
development, increased awareness of and interest in translational sciences, and in the long-term
advancement of clinical translational sciences to improve health."

10932869,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of Project 3 of this U54 application is the organoid-based definition of mechanisms of acquired
resistance (AR) to targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The treatment of NSCLC employs
numerous therapies directed against the EGFR, ALK, KRAS G12C, ROS1 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. However,
despite initial responses, these molecularly-targeted therapies are not curative, and virtually all patients
eventually succumb to progressive disease. Acquired resistance features prominently in relapse, such as with
EGFR T790M or C797S mutations following gefitinib or osimertinib treatment; however, known AR mechanisms
cannot be identified for a significant proportion of patients receiving targeted therapy. Further compounding this
dilemma are the distinct contributions of tumor-intrinsic versus tumor microenvironmental (TME) influences. The
TME in particular contains extracellular matrix (ECM), fibroblast, vascular and immune components that can
vitally impact the development and manifestations of AR. The study of TME-dependent and -independent
mechanisms of AR have been further hindered by a distinct lack of in vitro human experimental systems allowing
holistic recapitulation of the TME in patient biopsies.
 Our application leverages the synergistic strengths of the Sourav Bandyopadhyay and Calvin Kuo groups
in organoid and proteomics technology to address mechanisms of EGFR and KRAS G12C AR in NSCLC. We
conduct advanced proteomic approaches and organoid culture both from primary tumor biopsies at acquired
resistance (from Project 1) as well as from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors grown in human immune
reconstituted mice (from Project 2). Our organoids are either “epithelial-only” or novel air-liquid interface (ALI)
organoid cultures that co-preserve tumor epithelium en bloc with tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts and immune
subsets (T, B, NK, myeloid). Aim 1 leverages the results of a NSCLC organoid CRISPR screen to determine if
osimertinib-sensitizing loci can overcome, delay or alter acquired resistance in clinical biopsy/PDX AR organoids,
emphasizing hits with TME mechanisms. Aim 2 uses our mass spectrometry platforms to characterize total
proteome and phospho-proteomic changes in treatment-naive, residual and acquired resistance organoids and
PDX, while pursuing lead candidate TROP2 and new target nominations by genetic, mechanistic and
pharmacologic studies. Lastly, Project 1 has identified MIF/CD74/CD44 and CD47/SIRPa tumor-fibroblast-
macrophage pathways upregulated during AR which are then functionally explored in Aim 3 using ALI organoids
from AR clinical biopsies and PDX tumors. Overall, we propose a comprehensive, translational approach that
exploits complementary organoid and proteomics expertise to directly study biopsies and PDX from NSCLC
patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapy, towards development of improved therapeutic approaches."

10935915,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT - ABSTRACT
The purpose of the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) component of the UH Cancer Center
(UHCC) is to lead or facilitate activities across UHCC programs and with community stakeholders, and address
cancers of particular priority for our catchment populations. We have selected these priority cancers through
bidirectional community interactions, and targeted them for outreach and health education as well as
innovative population, basic, clinical, and translational research. UHCC’s catchment area includes the
Hawaiian archipelago and a vast expanse inclusive of the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). Hawai‘i, which
has a population of 1.46 million people and has no racial/ethnic majority. Approximately 20-24% of its
population are of Native Hawaiian (NH) ancestry; the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) have an
additional 600,000 residents and vary in economic development across different jurisdictions. These unique
demographics, economic disparities, and geographic expanse inform the strategies through which UHCC
strives to accomplish its mission. UHCC’s exceptional research has long considered our population’s rich racial
and ethnic diversity and investigates the biological, social-behavioral and environmental differences affecting
cancer risk and outcomes while also defining culturally appropriate interventions to reduce the burden from
cancer. We particularly emphasize Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) who experience
significant cancer disparities compared to other US racial and ethnic groups. Extensive community-facing
programs in cancer prevention and in clinical trials through the NCI-sponsored Minority Underserved
Community Oncology Research Program (MU-NCORP) have been extremely successful in enrolling high
percentages of racial/ethnic minorities to intervention trials. In those parts of the USAPI that have limited
access to oncology care, efforts are focused on cancer prevention. The previous review noted that “the value
added by the COE component is clear and evidenced by the unmatched need for cancer care that challenges
the diverse and remote population the UHCC serves.” In the past five years, the UHCC has strengthened its
COE infrastructure to more robustly engage community partners, further assess its catchment area’s cancer
burden, actively identify community-driven priorities, and effectively communicate community needs to its
research programs. It has also developed new initiatives to disseminate innovative evidence-based
interventions in the community. These efforts at education, outreach, and engagement, plus our involvement in
the State of Hawai‘i Ten-Year Cancer Plan 2030, have had a substantial impact in reducing ethnic disparities,
improving clinical trial participation, and guiding beneficial cancer policy. Our COE-facilitated research has also
influenced changes in lung cancer screening guidelines and diet recommendations nationally. Future plans will
expand COE activities to optimize the benefits of outreach and research among all populations and ultimately
have a profound impact on reducing the cancer burden and disparities in our catchment area and beyond."

environmental characteristics of Hawai`i and the Pacific”. This mission encompasses research on the
underlying biological, social and behavioral causes of cancer incidence, mortality and disparities, and on the
strategies and treatments to address them. Availability of and access to resources for laboratory analysis, data
acquisition, study design, and data analysis are essential for this undertaking. However, few of these services
are readily available in Hawai`i due to its small size and geographic isolation. Therefore, it is crucial that UHCC
provides these essential services locally. Shared Resources (SRs) were established at the UHCC to address
this mission by providing the necessary expertise, equipment, and services. Specifically, the SRs meet the
needs of the research endeavors of the Cancer Biology and Population Sciences in the Pacific Programs.
The Shared Resources proposed for support from the CCSG include 4 existing SRs, namely, Analytical
Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, and Nutrition Support, and one developing
SR, the Body Composition Lab. The goal of the Shared Resource Management is to ensure that the UHCC
Shared Resources align with the institution's mission by meeting the needs of the researchers, providing equal
access to all UHCC researchers, running cost-effectively, and offering quality state-of-the-art products. The
Shared Resource Management is administered through the Associate Director for Shared Resources and
implemented through the Shared Resource Directors. The SR Directors meet regularly to share updates and
solicit feedback. The Shared Resources are additionally guided and reviewed by an Oversight Committee of
UH faculty members. The SR directors and staff participate in community outreach and engagement (COE),
cancer research training (CRT), and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The Specific Aims of the
Shared Resources are:
1) Provide research support through scientific expertise and technology to the UH Cancer Center Members,
2) Evaluate the usage, satisfaction levels, and need for current and potential new services offered through the
 UHCC Shared Resources, and
3) Contribute to the training of investigators, staff, and students in research tools and technologies that will
 enhance their research endeavors."
10935918,"LEADERSHIP PLANNING AND EVALUATION - ABSTRACT
University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center’s (UHCC) Senior Leadership, led by Director Ueno, is structured to
facilitate collaborative and translational science and includes a Chief Scientific Officer, Associate Directors
[Shared Resources, Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), Cancer Research Training (CRT),
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), Translational and Clinical Research (TCR), Population Sciences, and
Administration], and co-Program Leaders for Cancer Biology, and Population Sciences in the Pacific. The
UHCC Director also receives input from Principal Investigators of major infrastructure grants, the Medical
Director for the Clinical Trials Office, Cancer Center Support Grant Coordinator, and leaders of the UHCC-
based academic senate. This team of exceptional individuals is charged with actualizing the mission of the
UHCC, which is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community
outreach, with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the
Pacific. The UHCC’s robust Planning and Evaluation process is designed to periodically revise and
strengthen our ongoing strategic plan and to identify and establish new long-term strategic goals. Essential
elements of this process are that it is responsive to needs of our faculty and staff and to the needs of our
catchment area, while also including regular review of the overall strategic plans of UHCC by the Senior
Leadership. Once new goals are identified, these are vetted by our External Advisory Committee (EAC) on a
yearly basis. Strategic goals are prioritized based on several criteria including: 1) how well they contribute to
furthering our institutional mission to reduce the burden of cancer in Hawai‘i and the Pacific; 2) how well they
build on UHCC research strengths centered on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of
Hawai‘i and the Pacific; 3) how well they expand our research and clinical efforts into new areas in response to
catchment area needs and advances in cancer research; and 4) availability of funds for the specific goal. We
have various internal advisory committees, each dedicated to specific areas such as patient-related matters,
education, community engagement, faculty concerns, pilot funding, membership, and UHCC space. These
committees offer valuable input to the Director and Senior Leadership team. Our EAC is structured to include
members with diverse expertise appropriate to our Center. It includes current and previous NCI cancer center
directors, a cancer center administrator, a shared resource director and four members with expertise related to
our Cancer Biology Program (basic laboratory and clinical) and four members with expertise related to our
Population Sciences in the Pacific Program (prevention, cancer control and population sciences). Three of
these members also have extensive clinical trials experience. This Leadership, Planning and Evaluation
process has enabled the UHCC to put in place a vigorous and robust process of vision setting, fostering
discovery and advancing scientific discoveries, evaluating progress, and planning for the future."
10935919,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT - ABSTRACT
 The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) function at the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center
(UHCC) is situated within the Clinical Trials Office (CTO). CPDM supplies the infrastructure and access to
state-of-the-art clinical trials for Hawaiʻi’s community-based providers and their patients. Led by Medical
Director Jonathan K. Cho, MD, IIT & Regulatory Director Toshiaki Iwase MD, PhD, and Administrative Director
Anna Quinn, MPH, the CPDM oversees central management functions for coordinating, facilitating, and
reporting on cancer clinical for our Center. These trials encompass national group, externally peer-reviewed,
industry-sponsored, and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Other vital components of CPDM include regulatory
affairs, protocol administration and management, protocol information technology management via OnCore our
Clinical Trials Management System, staff training, and investigator education and training activities. Disease
Site Working Groups (DSWGs) function to curate research portfolios supported by CPDM that cater to our
catchment area's needs, and our Patient Advocacy Council focuses on educating the community about clinical
trials, facilitating community and patient engagement, and promoting enrollment in cancer trials.
 Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) is complementary to CPDM. It provides the framework for the review
of data and safety monitoring plans for all protocols and ensures ongoing monitoring of patient safety and data
quality. The UHCC Compliance Office steers the quality assurance and audit functions of DSM. This office
serves as the responsible entity for quality assurance for all clinical research activities across the entire UHCC-
supported network, conducting internal audits and overseeing reports of external audits from NCORP
Research Bases (National Groups) and industry sponsors.
 Lastly, UHCC heavily emphasizes the inclusion of women, minorities, and children in clinical trials and
includes participants across the lifespan in clinical research, mainly focusing on populations with significant
cancer health disparities in Hawaiʻi and the Pacific, such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Almost
80% of all accruals to interventional therapeutic trials are represented by non-white minority groups, including
23% Native Hawaiian. Other interventional non-therapeutic trials, including prevention and screening studies,
are specifically targeted toward Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations and have an even
higher rate of minority enrollment. UHCC has successfully enrolled pediatric cancer patients in its clinical trials.
While less than 1% of Hawai‘i’s cancer patients are under 20 years old, 4.2% of all interventional clinical trial
enrollees at UHCC were children in 2022."
10935920,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM - ABSTRACT
 The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) serves a critical role in ensuring the execution of
high-quality cancer-related clinical research within the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) and its
extensive network of community-based hospitals, health systems, and oncology providers, all operating within
the UHCC-led clinical trials infrastructure. The PRMS review process has been designed in compliance with
Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) guidelines to ensure all studies undergo rigorous review and monitoring.
 The PRMS review process consists of two distinct stages. The first-stage review is now done by Disease
Site Working Groups (DSWGs) and before March 2023 by the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) Operations
Committee. They conduct a comprehensive assessment of studies, focusing on scientific merit and alignment
with UHCC’s portfolio requirements and priorities. Before the initiation of DSWGs, the CTO Operations
Committee conducted the initial review and prioritization of studies. This committee then forwarded their
recommendation to the PRMC for second-stage review. Between January 2018 and March 2023, the CTO
Operations Committee reviewed 279 new studies, with 164 receiving recommendations for a second-stage
review. The DSWG, initiated in March 2023, consists of ten discipline groups. They conduct the initial review
and prioritize studies. Priority is assigned first to funded Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs), followed by national
and industrial studies. Studies recommended for approval are subsequently routed for PRMC review. Since the
introduction of DSWGs in March 2023 and through August 2023, 57 new protocols have been reviewed, with
20 already receiving recommendations for second-stage review. Some of the others are in progress. The CTO
acts as the crucial communication channel between DSWGs and the PRMC. Additionally, it provides essential
administrative support and logistical expertise.
 The Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), chaired by Jeffrey Berenberg, MD (reports to
Naoto Ueno, MD, PhD, UHCC Director), conducts the second-stage review. The PRMC is responsible for an
independent scientific evaluation and holds the exclusive authority to approve studies for activation. The
PRMC serves as an independent scientific review committee with the ultimate authority to approve trials for
activation and terminate studies that fail to demonstrate scientific progress. They conduct annual reviews of
active protocols to monitor scientific progress and accruals, terminating studies when necessary. The PRMC’s
functions are distinct from those of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and do not duplicate their
responsibilities. Between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, the PRMC reviewed 164 new studies,
approving 155 for activation. In addition, the PRMC conducted 305 annual reviews, resulting in the termination
of 41 studies due to slow accrual. All PRMS activities are meticulously tracked using the Advarra OnCore
Clinical Trials Management Systems (CTMS) software."
10934713,"GENETIC AND POLICY DATA CORE SUMMARY
TIME-AD will be supported by a specialized Genetics and Policy Data (GPD) Core focusing on causal
identification based on quasi-experimental sources of variation, including genotypes, and state and Kaiser
Permanente (KP) systems policies. The GPD Core addresses the unique data access and statistical modeling
issues for quasi-experimental methods, whereas the Analytics Core focuses on methods that rely on control of
confounders. We will use genetic and policy data primarily as instrumental variables (IVs). The GPD Core will
identify genetic and policy data needed for IV analyses in each Project, develop code to create genetic and
policy IVs and estimate effects, implement over-identification and other tests to evaluate the validity of each
instrument, and provide documentation on the construction, motivation, and quality of each instrument. The
quality metrics will include strength of the association between each instrument and the relevant endogenous
variables, evidence regarding potential violations of the exclusion restriction assumption, and methods for
over-identification tests. The GPD Core will work closely with each of the projects and with the Analytics Core.
This specialized expertise in IV methods will facilitate comparing evidence on exclusion restriction violations
and help construct the IVs in a way that avoids weak IV bias or uses weak-IV robust methods, are valid for
diverse populations, and address the social context which may modify the effects of the IVs on each exposure.
The Core will handle IVs using genetic variants associated with alcohol use, depression, and sensory
impairment; policy IVs based on state excise taxes and minimum legal drinking age; and health systems-based
IVs leveraging changes in the KP antidepressant formulary and the introduction of Screening, Brief Intervention
and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocols in adult primary care. We will also develop polygenic scores for
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) for diverse ancestry groups, which will be used in bias-detecting or “reverse”
Mendelian Randomization. Bias-detecting Mendelian Randomization will be used to evaluate and quantify
reverse causation bias from incipient AD to each of the four exposure groups in TIME-AD (alcohol use,
depression, sensory impairments, social isolation). The GPD Core will provide each project with code to
construct multiple IVs to use for over-identification tests and evaluation of non-linear dose response effects.
The GPD Core team includes experts on genetic and policy data, quasi-experimental methods, and health
equity; staff will be responsible for ensuring cross-project compatibility, documentation, and resource sharing.
Our team is familiar with interdisciplinary traditions for IV methods, drawing from economics, causal inference,
and the more recent Mendelian Randomization literature. The specialized GPD Core will foster cross-
fertilization between genetic and policy IV approaches, and adoption of the most rigorous approaches for
implementation and validation of IV analyses to evaluate strategies to prevent AD/ADRD."
10934714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The effects of alcohol use on Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Disorders (AD/ADRD)
remain uncertain. Long hypothesized to have a J-shaped relationship, with the best cognitive outcomes among
light drinkers, growing evidence suggests that benefits of even ”low-risk” drinking are unlikely. Yet, there is not
clear quantification of how low-risk or moderate alcohol consumption (considered unhealthy but not constituting
alcohol use disorder) affects AD/ADRD risk. Drinking is extremely common and modifiable via clinical and
policy interventions. Estimates of the adverse effects of heavy drinking on AD/ADRD also vary widely. The
recent Lancet Review estimation of the population attributable fraction (PAF) for AD/ADRD associated with
alcohol use was based on a small number of studies that may not be generalizable. The population impact of
alcohol use may be substantially underestimated. Individual studies of alcohol use are potentially biased due to
confounding, reverse causation, or measurement error. We propose coordinated analyses across ten diverse
clinical and population cohorts. Working with the TIME-AD Cores, we will triangulate evidence from doubly-
robust g-methods, genetic instrumental variables (IVs), and policy IV analyses to derive the best possible
estimates on the effects of alcohol use on AD/ADRD risk. Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic
health record (EHR) data for over a million older adults are augmented with embedded surveys and
genotyping. We additionally use data from the UK Biobank, All of US, and multiple cohorts with detailed,
repeated assessments of alcohol use, confounders, and cognition. We adopt a systematic approach to
interrogating potential biases by comparing patterns across populations, study designs, and identification
approaches. Uncertainty in estimates will be characterized using quantitative bias analysis. We propose four
aims: Aim 1. Assess how low-risk alcohol use, unhealthy alcohol use, and alcohol use disorder, compared to
no alcohol use, affect AD/ADRD risk, triangulating across study designs and data sources. Aim 2. Evaluate
heterogeneity in the effects of different quantities and patterns of drinking on AD/ADRD risk, evaluating type
(e.g., beer, red wine, white wine, spirits), frequency-quantity pattern (e.g., drinks per month, binge drinking
episodes), problem-drinking (e.g., ”blackout drinking”), and duration (e.g., years of consumption). Aim 3.
Evaluate how the effects of alcohol use on AD/ADRD risk vary in relation to other risk factors for AD/ADRD
risk, i.e., heterogeneity across characteristics of the person using alcohol, such as genetic risk, cardiometabolic
comorbidities, gender, race/ethnicity, education, social isolation, cannabis use, or medication use. Aim 4:
Evaluate the extent to which disparities in dementia incidence across social strata are attributable to
differences in alcohol consumption or could be ameliorated by changes in drinking. Using PAFs or flexible
transport estimators, we will estimate reductions in AD/ADRD and racial/ethnic, gender, or socioeconomic
disparities in AD/ADRD that could be achieved through changes in alcohol use."
10934715,"Summary/Abstract
Depression is a highly prevalent and modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease
Related Disorders (AD/ADRD). Severe and untreated depression is associated with substantially higher risk of
AD/ADRD. Older individuals with comorbidities and individuals from marginalized populations are more likely to
be undertreated for depression, possibly increasing disparities in AD/ADRD risk in these groups. Yet the long-
term effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of depression on AD/ADRD risk are
currently unknown. Chronic pain is extremely prevalent and commonly co-occurs and exacerbates depression.
Evidence suggests chronic pain is a risk factor for AD/ADRD highlighting the need for a rigorous assessment
of independent and joint effects of depression and chronic pain on AD/ADRD risk. We propose a systematic
approach to interrogating potential biases by comparing patterns across populations, study designs, and
analytic approaches to derive the best possible estimates of the effects of depression, treatment of depression,
and chronic pain on AD/ADRD risk. We will leverage complementary sources of data including large, diverse
cohorts with electronic health record (EHR) databases enriched with survey and genetic information, as well as
diverse, national cohorts with repeated measures of cognition and depressive symptoms. We propose three
aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the effect of depression on AD/ADRD and cognitive decline accounting for
cerebrovascular and other comorbidities, as well as severity, recurrence, and duration of depression and the
effects of treatment. Aim 2. Examine the direct effect and modifying role of chronic pain on AD/ADRD and
cognitive decline in the context of depression. Aim 3: Examine heterogeneity in the distribution and effects of
depression and depression treatment by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and educational
attainment as possible drivers of health disparities in AD/ADRD and evaluate the extent to which these
inequalities could be reduced through improvements in treatment. Working closely with the TIME-AD Cores to
field novel and rigorous science in large, diverse data sets, we will provide more compelling and actionable
evidence than previously achievable on the independent and joint effects of depression and chronic pain on
AD/ADRD and on whether treatment of depression can reduce AD/ADRD risk and AD/ADRD inequities."
10935608,"Project Summary
The primary objective of the Glioma SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to attract talented
new investigators to translational glioma research. Potential CEP awardees include junior faculty beginning
their careers or established faculty members in other fields who wish to redirect their interests and efforts to
glioma research. We will maintain a comprehensive, system-wide process for solicitation of CEP
applications and an expert-based review process to select the most meritorious applicants. The CEP
program faculty consists of a multidisciplinary cohort of experienced, senior mentors for CEP awardees.
The CEP provides limited-duration funding for promising, junior translational investigators who are focused
on glioma research. The program will provide support, mentoring, and monitoring for CEP awardees. We
will maintain a monitoring process to measure progress and outcomes of CEP awardees and the CEP
program. We carefully monitor the progress of awardees through clearly enumerated metrics. The CEP is
assessed on an annual basis by the internal and external advisory boards. The CEP leverages institutional
resources to support and enhance the success of the program."
10935709,"BIOSPECIMEN AND PATHOLOGY CORE C – PROJECT SUMMARY
The Biospecimen and Pathology Core (Core C) collects and annotates biospecimens with clinical data to meet
the needs of the three Translational Research Projects, Developmental Research and Career Enhancement
Programs, and investigators engaged in hepatobiliary cancer research globally. Core C incorporates the Core
HB SPORE Registry and Biorepository, and additional biorepositories at Mayo Clinic and other institutions,
including the Genetics of Cholestatic Liver Diseases Registry (Dr. Konstantinos Lazaridis), Liver Transplant
Registry (Dr. Timucin Taner), and the Hepatobiliary Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) program (Dr. Mark
Truty). Core C coordinates with The Fibrolamellar Carcinoma Biorepository at Rockefeller University (Dr. Sanford
Simon). Core C provides sample accessioning and pathology support for early phase clinical trials as needed in
SPORE projects, coordinates with the Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing (BAP) Shared
Resource to process blood samples to genomic DNA and serum and plasma aliquots, and with the Pathology
Research Core (PRC) to provide tissue-based services, including frozen and paraffin sections,
immunohistochemistry (IHC), FISH, tissue microarray (TMA), and digital imaging. The Department of Surgical
Pathology facilitates acquisition of fresh tissue for research at the time of surgery. We have initiated a major
focus on diversity. The aims are:
Specific Aim 1. Provide clinically annotated blood-derived, bile, stool, and urine specimens.
Specific Aim 2. Provide clinically annotated frozen and formalin-fixed tissue specimens, histopathologic
characterization, and histology-related laboratory services.
Specific Aim 3. Provide clinically annotated fresh tissues, PDXs, organoids, cell lines and animal models.

10935710,"The goal of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the NCI-supported Mayo Clinic SPORE in
Hepatobiliary Cancers is to support innovative, scientifically sound research projects from which findings can be
translated into clinically relevant interventions that reduce the burden of liver and biliary cancers, which are a
leading cause of cancer related deaths that continues to grow. The success of this ongoing program in years 1-
4 of funding is evident from 11 new DRP projects, with 1 advancing to a full translational project in the renewal
period. Building upon this successful track record, the DRP will continue to provide up to $50k per year ($25k
from NCI SPORE funds plus $25k from matching institutional funds) to each of 2 projects per year, with the
potential of a second year of support based on progress and promise. At least one of these awards will be to an
investigator from an underrepresented racial/ethnic group. Potential high risk/high payoff innovative concepts
are encouraged that utilize the extensive shared resources cores of the SPORE. A rigorous peer review process
utilizing the expertise of the External Advisory Board and other experienced investigators, with additional input
from the patient advocates and Community Engagement and Diversity Council, evaluates all applications based
upon the following criteria: scientific merit, originality, qualifications of the applicant/co-investigator(s), and
translational potential. Whereas the translational trajectory of all applications needs to be readily apparent, the
priority is on potentially high payoff proposals investigating all aspects pertaining to the morbidity and mortality
of hepatobiliary cancer from the bench to the population. This is accomplished through the following Specific
Aims: 1) Solicit and support the most innovative and interdisciplinary translationally relevant laboratory,
population science, and clinical studies in hepatobiliary cancer, 2) Encourage and seek out the recruitment of
qualified minorities, women, and persons with disabilities, 3) Provide critical evaluation of all DRP applications
and awardee progress, 4) Foster extensive scientific collaborations and facilitate the development of DRP funded
proposals into independent extramural applications and/or future Hepatobiliary Cancer SPORE translational
projects, and 5) Develop awardees as leaders of future SPORE projects, and as SPORE and Cancer Center
leadership. Continued support from the SPORE is expected to lead to the generation of new hypotheses that
will be tested in SPORE-sponsored research or other peer reviewed external grants. The long-term goal of the
SPORE is to translate the findings generated by these developmental projects into a reduction in the incidence
and mortality rates of liver and biliary cancers."
10919715,"Summary
 An estimated 225,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are reported annually in the US, equating to
~$7B in medical costs. Tears of the ACL lead to instability of the knee and reduce mobility, if left untreated, it
can lead to chronic knee issues. Tears are typically treated by ACL reconstruction (ACLR) using either an
autograft or an allograft. Allografts only account for 22-44% of ACLR in the U.S. because autografts have a low
failure rate (5%). Harvesting an autograft causes donor-site morbidity (DSM) which leads to muscle weakness
of the ipsilateral leg, risk of infection, longer recovery time (9-12 months), chronic knee pain, and higher risk of
contralateral ACL tears. Use of allografts prevents DSM. Unfortunately, allografts have an ~14% failure rate and
are usually recommended for older and less active patients. Specifically, soft tissue allografts (STA) have poor
ligamentization and fail to form a true boney junction between the bone-graft interface. There is a need to improve
the biological integration of STAs to increase graft biomechanics, which will lead to lower failure rates. Therefore,
CollaMedix Inc. has developed AlloBrace to increase the biological integration of the allograft by stimulating and
guiding ligamentization throughout the STA and inducing true bony growth at the bone-graft interface. CollaMedix
is in the business of developing medical grade biotextiles using high-strength pure-collagen type I threads
produced by its patented high-throughput electrochemical compaction process. The collagen molecules in the
thread are unidirectionally aligned within threads, mimicking the native topography of ligaments and tendons,
which we have found makes the implant regenerative. Extensive in vivo research has found that new host
collagen is templated parallel to these threads, resulting in an ordered tissue deposition. Collagen threads also
impart a tenoinductive effect on stem cells topographically. The crosslinking agent genipin, which is used to
stabilize threads, polarizes macrophages to the pro-regenerative phenotype. A hydroxyapatite (HA) coating can
be added to impregnant the threads to be osteoconductive. Therefore, we have braided spooled collagen thread
with industrial braiding machines and coated each end with HA to create AlloBrace, a pure collagen sheath with
tenoinductive and osteoinductive potential. AlloBrace is simply deployed by sliding over the allograft and
prepared with traditional ACLR techniques and equipment. To validate AlloBrace, CollaMedix aims to confirm
the feasibility of AlloBrace as an enhancement for STA used in ACLR using a porcine model. We hypothesize
that AlloBrace will 1) guide cellular infiltration and tissue production throughout the allograft, and 2) stimulate
bone growth at the bone-graft interface within the bone tunnels. Specific Aim 1. Refine AlloBrace design to
improve graft conformity and to ease surgical deployment. Fabricate AlloBrace with varying diameters (6,
8, 10mm) and layer amounts (2, 3, 4) and determine which configuration conforms best to the STA. Specific
Aim 2. Show AlloBrace improves allograft healing biology and knee biomechanics. Compare
AlloBrace+STA vs. STA in an 8-week ACLR porcine study. Study assessment will be done by quantitative
histology analyzing immune response, wound healing, and tissue integration within the graft and bone-graft
interface, as well as biomechanical knee laxity tests. Phase I data will be used to justify future Phase II work to
test AlloBrace’s load sharing capacity and compare our device to predicate devices in a larger and longer in vivo
study (6 & 9 months). AlloBrace is poised to reduce allograft failure rates which would increase potential use in
ACLR and prevent autograft DSM."
10918936,"Project Summary
 Over the last few decades, there has been a paradigm shift in the pharmaceutical industry with compa-
nies transitioning from developing small molecule drugs to biologics. Biologic drugs have several advantages,
the primary one being that biologic drugs are better suited to high target speciﬁcity (traditional small molecule
drugs often exhibit non-target side effects). Some biologics show great promise as a personalized medicine, e.g.
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- T cell therapies. CAR-T cell therapies are a type of biologic falling under the
cell based medicinal product (CBMP) category, where a patient's own T cells can be modiﬁed and used as a
drug. In 2017, the ﬁrst CAR-T cell based therapy was approved by the U.S. FDA; so far CAR-T therapies have
demonstrated success in treating lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myelomas, but active research will expand
the scope of CAR-T therapies greatly within in the next few years.
 Despite their many beneﬁts and common use, biologic drugs can still elicit serious adverse side-effects. Many
of these side-effects are believed to be caused by small particle aggregates inherent in multiple biologic drugs.
For CBMPs, the regulation issue is even more complex since the drugs (often human cells) are comparable
in size to particle impurities historically monitored to mitigate adverse side-effects. Furthermore, modern CBMP
therapies are currently very expensive, 500K-1M USD per treatment, and face nontrivial quality control challenges
in both autologous and allogeneic formulations.
 Pharmaceutical companies are currently required to record and catalog vast volumes of particle data of biolog-
ics, but are only mandated under FDA regulations (i.e., USP 788 ) to control the number of particles exceeding
10 and 25m in delivered products. Historically, particle size and counts have been used to analyze subvisible
particles (those 100m in size) in biologics, but the many images of the particles inherent in biologics contain a
rich amount of “morphological information” which can be extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in
combination with computational statistics as we have shown in our previous work in collaboration with academia,
industry, and government agencies (FDA and NIST).
 This proposal will expand our previous supervised CNN algorithms to include unsupervised machine learn-
ing algorithms for analyzing particle images measured in biologics using label-free high-throughput microscopy.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms show promise in situations where multiple biologic drug formulations
exhibit highly heterogeneous particle populations that may change over time. This particular situation is com-
monly encountered in batch biologic drug production. In Phase I, we will develop new algorithms and apply these
algorithms to characterize T cells modiﬁed by lentivirus transduction under good manufacturing practice (GMP)
conditions with the intent to optimize process parameters improving yield of viable CAR-T cells. Finding process
parameters producing a large quantity of consistent viable CAR-T cells will aid in driving down production cost."
10918937,"Project Summary
 The goal of this Phase I STTR is to continue development of Oncurie’s novel ovarian cancer targeting
compound, which binds to the folate receptor and delivers radionuclides suitable for targeted imaging and
therapy with a proprietary moiety. The disease is difficult to detect in early stages with an estimated 75% of
women presenting with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. The mortality rate of ovarian cancer is one of
the least improved in recent years, with 5-year survival rates for stage III and stage IV disease estimated at 42%
and 26%, respectively. These factors highlight the urgently unmet need for new diagnostic tools and therapeutic
strategies for this devastating disease which impacts over 20,000 women per year in the US, resulting in
approximately 14,000 deaths. Oncurie has developed a targeted radiopharmaceutical platform enabling
precision imaging of ovarian cancer with future developments towards therapy. The compound includes two key
features: 1) a folate receptor (FR) binding moiety to exploit the receptor’s well-documented overexpression in
ovarian cancer; and 2) Oncurie’s proprietary radionuclide-binding domain which binds radioisotopes with high
affinity preventing in vivo dissociation from the core compound resulting in improved safety and targeting efficacy.
In collaboration with Suzanne Lapi, PhD of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the company has shown
that the compound (O5) binds ovarian cancer cells with sub-nanomolar affinity and is internalized to the nucleus.
In vivo, O5 has been shown to specifically target the folate receptor present on ovarian cancer tumors in
xenograft models. During Phase I, we will refine the molecular structure and formulation of the compound to
improve synthetic scalability, ease of handling and ensure radiolabeling chemistries remain reliable and efficient.
In vitro testing will be undertaken to confirm the compound’s FR-targeting properties in a range of ovarian cancer
cell lines. Finally, the compound will be evaluated in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of ovarian cancer,
which more closely resembles human disease pathogenesis compared to the xenograft model used for initial
proof-of-concept studies presented in the Preliminary Data section. Pending successful completion of these
Phase I Aims, a subsequent Phase II program will advance the compound through critical safety, toxicology, and
efficacy testing required for submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA to enable
clinical studies. It should also be noted that, while Oncurie’s current strategy is to evaluate this compound for
radiographic imaging and disease diagnosis, the same compound is intended to be used as a therapeutic when
paired with a cytotoxic radionuclide as part of a theranostic strategy. Currently marketed radiotherapeutics such
as Lutathera and Pluvicto employed a similar strategy, developing a diagnostic imaging agent first, followed by
the development of a therapeutic with effectively the same core molecule. Oncurie’s product is estimated to
have similar revenue potential compared to these products, reportedly ranging from $500 million to $1 billion."
10919070,"Project Summary:
The regeneration of blood and immune cells relies on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that
reside in the bone marrow. HSPCs not only sustain homeostasis of the blood pool by constantly producing the
precise amounts and types of blood cells as needed, but they also respond rapidly to injuries such as bleeding
or infection. During these processes, HSPCs constantly sense and react to signals from various bone marrow
cell types. Their spatial proximity to the sources of these signals change as they migrate during differentiation
and proliferation within the tightly packed bone marrow. The spatial organization of individual HSPCs forms a
dynamic landscape that modulates their intercellular communication. In the proposed project, we will study the
dynamic spatial configuration of HSPCs during hematopoiesis and its impact on intercellular signaling,
proliferation, differentiation, and injury response. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cell fate
transitions during hematopoiesis are associated with the migration of HSPCs through distinct bone marrow
micro-environments where they are exposed to signals that promote their expansion and differentiation. We
propose to use MEMOIR and seqFISH technologies to (1) map the spatial organization of HSPCs in the bone
marrow, (2) investigate the dynamic changes of HSPCs’ spatial positioning during hematopoiesis and upon the

Outcome data for underrepresented (UR) faculty development programs related to research productivity,
retention, promotion, skill competencies, and program satisfaction exist but there is a lack of rigorous
evaluation, especially assessment of mentoring effectiveness and impact on institutional climate and UR
faculty morale. The goal of the Evaluation Core is to develop and implement an evaluation plan to assess the
impact of the FIRST Cohort program on our institution and to assist the CEC in evaluating the overall
combined FIRST Cohort program. The analysis plan will test the overarching hypothesis that a cohort and
cluster design model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentoring, and professional development,
embedded within an institution implementing evidence-based practices to create academic cultures of inclusive
excellence, will achieve significant improvements in metrics of institutional culture and scientific discovery.
Four specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Theoretical Model. To develop a plan of analysis based on
theoretical models and conceptual framework in collaboration with CEC and other FIRST Cohort Awardees.
Aim 2. Common Data Elements. To collaborate with the CEC and other FIRST Cohort Awardees to develop
common data elements (including program activities, participant outcomes, and institutional outcomes) to
evaluate the success of the program. Aim 3. Database. To adapt current Office of Faculty Affairs database to
track program activities, collect participant data, and collect institutional data. Aim 4. Evaluation. To share
common data elements with the FIRST CEC as requested, to collaborate on evaluation of FIRST Cohort
impact across all awardees, and to assess local institutional impact of FIRST Cohort activities. These aims will
be accomplished through adapting the current UCSD Office of Faculty Affairs database to include tracking
FIRST program activities, FIRST participant data, and institutional data. Participant data will include
evaluations of self-efficacy, skills and behaviors, supplemented by interviews/focus groups. Institutional data
will be obtained through institutional demographic databases, two climate surveys of health sciences and
campus-based faculty, as well as interviews/focus groups. Participant impact will be analyzed by examining
recruitment and retention, career success (grants, publications, leadership, promotion) and improved skills and
knowledge (self-efficacy and behaviors). Institutional impact of the FIRST program will be analyzed by
examining changes in demographics and climate, including morale and environment. Interviews and focus
groups will explore components of the FIRST program that contribute to improved climate and culture.
Together, these analyses efforts will demonstrate that using evidence-based strategies to enhance UR faculty
academic advancement, research and career development and integration, and the implementation of system-
wide structured faculty development programs, will lead to inclusive excellence and improve the academic
climate."

Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgery in the nation with more than 7
million Americans currently living with artificial joints. Despite the high surgery volume, the evidence base for
TJA procedures, technologies and associated interventions are limited. Many surgical approaches, implants or
surgical technologies (computer navigation, robotic surgery) are adopted based on theoretical grounds with
limited clinical evidence of effectiveness and safety. The wider TJA research community needs access to
large, high quality and rich data sources, state-of-the-art clinical research standards and information
technologies to overcome methodological and practical challenges in studies of surgical and nonsurgical
interventions in TJA. American Joint Replacement Research-Collaborative (AJRR-C) is a Core Center for
Clinical Research exclusively focused on TJA. The overarching goal of AJRR-C is to facilitate innovative,
methodologically rigorous and interdisciplinary clinical research that will directly improve TJA care and the
outcomes. AJRR-C is a disease (TJA) and theme-focused Center providing shared methodological expertise,
education, data and infrastructure resources. AJRR-C leverages big data resources for TJA research,
provides customized methodology resources in epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research and
medical informatics, and has established synergistic interactions around an integrated Resource Core
(American Joint Replacement Registry – AJRR).
The Specific Aims of AJRR-C are: (1) To provide administrative and scientific oversight of AJRR-C activities
(Administrative Core), (2) To provide integrated and customized services, access to large databases and novel
analytical methods for clinical research in TJA (Methodology Core); and (3) To meet the unique data and
infrastructure needs of the TJA research community and to strengthen the national capacity for large-scale
observational and interventional studies in TJA (Resource Core). AJRR-C is integrated within the long-
standing and highly centralized clinical research environment of Mayo Clinic, thereby leveraging existing
expertise and infrastructure resources. AJRR-C activities are evaluated using robust metrics to ensure
continuous evaluation, flexibility and improvement in response to the most pressing needs of the TJA research
community."

Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no
measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are
very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In
humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my
early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is
associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the
Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the
Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice
aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that frailty
clocks that include a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures
(blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger,
female mice and different strains. To test this hypothesis I will use previously collected
longitudinal health and molecular data from C57BL/6 mice, as well as collect lifelong health
data, plus blood and stool samples, from UM-HET3 mice. I will use regression modelling of all
measured outcomes to develop optimized ‘bAFRAID clocks’ that predict time to death in mice
of both strains, and both sexes. For Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that epigenetic
dysregulation underlies the development of frailty in mice. I will use longitudinal assessments,
and cutting-edge epigenetic tools (including TIMEseq for DNA methylation and CUT&Tag for
histone modifications) to investigate the relationship between epigenetic changes and the
bAFRAID clocks. Completion of this project will provide important tools for the field, and allow
us to understand whether epigenetic changes precede the development of frailty in mice."

The proposed Program for Oncology Workforce Education and Research at Dartmouth (POWERED), will
identify, recruit and train underrepresented minority undergraduates for independent careers in cancer
research with specific attention to related scientific and life/career skills. Qualified students will be from groups
underrepresented in biomedical research. They will receive a holistic multi-modal two-year intensive training
experience spanning the summer following sophomore year through their senior year. We propose building on
the foundation we have developed with three years of an NCI-funded P30 “CURE” supplement that introduced
undergrads from underrepresented minorities to oncology research at Dartmouth. POWERED is a two-year
program including two 8-week summers (16 weeks total) of full-time mentored research at Dartmouth's Norris
Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) boosted by 4 semesters (16 weeks each) of part-time coordinated scientific
research at their home institutions. Considerable effort will be made to customize each participant's program
according to their scientific interests in cancer. Each student will have a mentor at their home laboratory and at
NCCC. Together, with the PI, they will form Individual Mentoring Team(s) to track the progress of each student.
Faculty from colleges and universities throughout New Hampshire that make up New Hampshire INBRE, (NH-
INBRE Idea Network of Biomedical Research Excellence), will recruit and nominate promising
underrepresented minority students to apply and subsequently arranged for mentoring the selected students
as research trainees at the home institution. A specific emphasis in the senior year is securing post-graduation

10921429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the population ages, knee replacement surgery has become one of the most common elective surgical
procedures. By 2030, over 3 million people per year are expected to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA). 90%
of individuals experience postoperative pain, and 80% of those affected control the pain using prescribed opioids.
Unfortunately, long-term postoperative pain after TKA often leads to opioid use disorders, increases the risk of
complications, extends the length of hospital stay, and increases overall medical cost. There is currently an
unmet need for the development of alternative non-opioid therapies for postoperative pain management
associated with TKA.
nCAP Medical in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh seeks to address the unmet need for better
postoperative pain management tools by developing a patented, state-of-the-art, easy-to-use,
nonpharmacological pain relief device (NEUROCUPLE™) for patients undergoing TKA. Preliminary data from a
pilot study with 60 patients undergoing TKA demonstrated that the NEUROCUPLE device reduced opioid refills
in the first 30 postoperative days by 47% in the NEUROCUPLE group (29%) versus standard of care group
(55%).
The goal of this Phase I project is to evaluate the use of NEUROCUPLE as a non-pharmacological postoperative
pain relief treatment following TKA in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. For this study, 120 patients
will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to the NEUROCUPLE group or placebo group before surgery. TKA will be
performed using approved enhanced recovery protocol for pain management (standardized at UPMC). After
surgery, an active NEUROCUPLE device (intervention group) or an identical placebo device (placebo group) will
be applied over the knee for 2 weeks. All patients will receive standard of perioperative care including multimodal
pain management. Primary endpoints are pain at rest and prescribed opioid refills in the first 6 weeks. Secondary
endpoints are pain while walking, time to discharge, functional recovery (i.e., range of motion, ability to walk),
and total postoperative opioid consumption.
Successful completion of this Phase I program will demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the
NEUROCUPLE device vs placebo as a non-invasive, non-pharmacological alternative to opioids for the
treatment of postoperative pain following TKA. This will support the FDA device approval for the indication of
postoperative pain relief following TKA and payor reimbursements. In our Phase II STTR, we will explore other
indications using a larger patient population, patients with mood disorders, and a placebo control design for other
procedures such as hip replacement and spine surgeries."
10921667,"Project Summary/Abstract
Acute patellar dislocation and chronic patellar maltracking and subluxation disproportionately affects active
young people, impairing functional ability, causing swelling and anterior knee pain, and predisposing patients
to early onset osteoarthritis. Surgical interventions to treat patellar instability have success rates of
approximately 50% — half of patients who undergo an initial surgery require subsequent surgeries or continue
to suffer from patellar instability, swelling, anterior knee pain, subluxation, and/or dislocation. Poor surgical
outcomes are typically the result of failure to account for patient-specific pathoanatomy during
treatment. The standard surgical protocol for treating these patients is reconstruction or repair of the medial
patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), which is usually ruptured during an initial dislocation event. However, isolated
MPFL reconstruction may not be sufficient to correct for predisposing anatomic risk factors (including trochlear
dysplasia, patella alta, increased tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance and increased quadriceps angle) that
are almost always present in these patients. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on a standard protocol to
determine the most appropriate surgical treatment plan, especially for patients with multiple abnormal anatomic
risk factors. As a result, surgical outcomes are highly variable; patients may undergo multiple surgeries that
fail to treat underlying anatomic risk factors that contribute to patellar instability and dislocation.
Our long-term goal is to develop pre-operative planning software that will use patient-specific medical
imaging to quantify stability of an individual’s patellofemoral joint and provide guidance to the clinician by
generating a patient-specific and surgery-specific prediction of post-operative patellar stability. This will allow
the clinician to compare stability outcomes between potential treatment options. Such a pre-operative planning
tool to guide treatment of patellar instability does not currently exist, so our software will be the first-to-market
product.
Our objectives for this Phase I project are to generate the data required to develop our proposed surgical
planning platform, to perform preliminary validation of our computational models through cadaveric and human
subjects testing, and to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of our computational approach. On completion of
Phase I, we will have developed a stability classification algorithm which can differentiate between healthy and
pathological anatomy and quantify the effect of a specific surgical intervention in altering an individual’s stability
classification (Aim 1), we will have validated our computational model predictions against in vivo pre- and post-
operative kinematics (Aim 2), and validated our model as a comparative assessment tool to compare joint
stability across surgeries for the same subject (Aim 3). This will position us to translate this work into a
comprehensive pre-operative planning software tool in Phase II of this project."

The mission of the Rat Resource and Research Center (RRRC) is to provide biomedical investigators with the
rat models, embryonic stem cells, related reagents, protocols, information, support and services that will facilitate
their research. The RRRC serves as a unique repository by importing, storing and distributing a large number of
rat strains/stocks. It assures that valuable models are preserved and made available to interested investigators,
allows researchers to satisfy NIH requirements for resource sharing, relieves individual investigators from the
burden of animal distribution and ensures that models are maintained with rigorous genetic quality control and
health monitoring to promote experimental rigor and reproducibility. As the outward facing presence of the RRRC
to the biomedical community, the RRRC website plays a critical role as does the on-line ordering system.
Curation of the data that exists for all RRRC holdings is a major and important task. To facilitate RRRC internal
operations, numerous custom data management systems are in place. The proposed RRRC Curation and
Informatics Section seeks to build a team of qualified individuals who will be dedicated to overseeing and
improving the website, the on-line ordering system, and the internal data management systems as well as
providing high quality data curation. Creation of this new component of the RRRC will expand our abilities to
provide additional information to users, continually upgrade and improve our website and on-line ordering system
and in general, provide an enhanced experience for our users. Importantly, it will allow prioritization of important
tasks such as website upgrades and prompt data curation of incoming strains/stocks and allow the RRRC to
better explore potential collaborations to share and link data with other Resources. Overall, addition of a Curation

10921896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Schistosome parasites infect 200 million people, resulting in significant morbidity and more than 200,000 deaths
annually. Schistosomiasis control strategies rely almost exclusively on chemotherapy, and tens of millions of
people are treated with the only available drug, praziquantel (PZQ). There are no new drugs in the clinical
pipeline. With projected levels of PZQ use, it is inevitable that PZQ-resistant parasites will evolve. Therefore, it
is imperative to find new drug targets and drugs for schistosomiasis treatment, our long-term objective. We
identified a highly promising drug target: the worm selenocysteine-containing enzyme thioredoxin glutathione
reductase (TGR). We established that TGR is a central and essential mediator of antioxidant defenses in the
worm. The antioxidant defenses of vertebrates are diversified to three enzymes, glutathione reductase,
thioredoxin reductase, and glutaredoxin, whereas schistosomes rely solely on TGR. TGR is a chokepoint and its
inhibition leads to rapid worm death in all developmental stages. In contrast, PZQ has poor activity against
juvenile worms, often resulting in partial cures. TGR is a defined molecular target, active as a recombinant
protein, and we have established biochemical assays amenable to rapid compound screening, SAR, and
optimization. We initiated several HTS of large compound libraries, which identified TGR inhibitors that have
been used to obtain both liganded and ligand-free crystal structures of TGR, allowing a structure-based approach
to hit optimization. These studies have elucidated an inhibitory mechanism that is completely novel for this family
of proteins, allowing the development of non-covalent inhibitors. Although very successful, this initial study was
focused largely on aspects other than optimization of oral bioavailability of TGR inhibitors, impeding their further
development. We hypothesize that it will be possible to optimize our novel TGR inhibitors for oral administration
while maintaining efficacy comparable to that for compound 2 administered IP, an objective for this feasibility
study. To achieve this objective, we propose: to optimize novel TGR inhibitors using cutting-edge structure- and
ligand-based computer-aided design, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacokinetics approaches for oral availability
while also improving potency, selectivity, solubility, and safety. Select compounds will be assessed for efficacy
against schistosome infections in mice. To accomplish these aims, we assembled a team of experts in
schistosome biochemistry and drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, computer-aided molecular design, chemical
and structural biology of TGR. The varied and synergistic expertise of the team will facilitate overcoming critical
barriers to development of schistosomicidal therapeutics. While additional preclinical studies would be needed,
discovery of novel orally bioavailable TGR inhibitors with demonstrated activity in animal models is the first step
in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of schistosomiasis."
10921054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of several AIDS/HIV-associated
human neoplasms, including the B cell malignancy primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). During PEL
pathogenesis, KSHV remains predominantly latent, expressing few proteins and approximately 25 mature
microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite their identification nearly two decades ago, the roles of the KSHV miRNAs in
PEL remain poorly understood, partially due to challenges in achieving lasting miRNA loss-of-function.
Specifically, the high copy number of KSHV genomes in PEL precludes CRISPR-based KSHV genome editing
and transfectable antisense inhibitors only achieve transient inhibition. My goal is therefore to leverage novel
insights into the endogenous miRNA turnover mechanism to define the essentiality of KSHV miRNAs in PEL
cell lines. In my preliminary work, I have already improved upon lentivirally-deliverable miRNA inhibitors to
achieve stable miRNA inhibition in cultured PEL cells. My preliminary data suggests that at least one KSHV
miRNA, miR-K11, a highly expressed KSHV mimic of the oncogenic human miRNA miR-155, is essential for
PEL cell viability. My proposal seeks to broaden our understanding of KSHV-encoded miRNAs. My overall
hypothesis is that individual KSHV miRNAs promote the survival or proliferation of PEL cells. I further
hypothesize that miR-K11 plays a central role in PEL oncogenesis, by repressing specific uncharacterized
target mRNAs. To investigate these hypotheses, I propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, I will design,
validate, and employ lentiviral miRNA inhibitors to determine the importance of each KSHV miRNA for the
viability or proliferation of a set of PEL cell lines. For miRNAs with significant essentiality, I will assess their
effects on the cellular and viral transcriptomes, KSHV lytic reactivation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression.
In Specific Aim 2, I propose to define the essential role of miR-K11 in PEL. I will first extend my finding that
miR-K11 is required for the viability of PEL cells to an extended set of PEL cell lines. I will then use genome-
wide and custom CRISPR rescue screens to identify which miR-K11 targets underlie miR-K11 essentiality. I will
mine hits from these screens, new RNA-seq experiments, and published KSHV miRNA targetome data sets, to
prioritize and validate functionally essential targets of miR-K11. Collectively, my research plan will define the
importance of KSHV encoded miRNAs and identify the functionally essential targets of miR-K11 in PEL. Since
miR-K11 mimics a cellular miRNA that contributes to human lymphomas, my results will also be broadly
relevant to mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, potentially paving the way for new therapeutic strategies. My
research plan will finally allow me to gain invaluable skills in molecular biology, bioinformatics, mentoring, and
written and oral presentations, helping me reach my goal of running an independent research laboratory at an
academic institution."
10921336,"Project summary
 Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) is the major cause of typhoid fever which causes 9.2 million cases of the
disease and 110 thousand deaths as reported in 2019. Vaccines against S. typhi have been developed,
including Vi polysaccharide vaccine and more recently, Vi conjugate vaccines. They are based on the Vi
polysaccharide of S. typhi which is a linear alpha 1–4 linked polygalacturonic acid (PGA) that is N-acetylated at
C2 and O-acetylated at C3 of the galacturonic acid (Gal UA) residue. The O-acetyl group at C3 is the dominant
determinant of immunogenicity and potency. The Vi conjugate vaccines, overcoming the T-independence of Vi
polysaccharide vaccine, are T-dependent and effective in protection against typhoid fever in people > 6
months. However, because of the high molecular weight of Vi polysaccharide, these conjugate vaccines could
potentially still induce a partial T-independent response and hyporesponsiveness after booster immunization in
people under 2 years. Thus, conjugate vaccines with fragmented or low molecular weight Vi (~50 kDa) are
being developed as the potential fully T-dependent and more effective vaccines.
 Production of Vi vaccines are complex and challenging due to reliance on bacterial fermentation and
processing difficulties and low yield of the Vi polysaccharide. Thus, synthetic Vi polysaccharides have been
generated and evaluated through an extensive series of studies initiated by scientists of NICHD (National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development). It is produced by O-acetylation of plant polygalacturonic
acid (PGA) which shares the same backbone as the Vi polysaccharide and are readily and abundantly
available. The resulting O-acetylated PGA (AcPGA) thus carries the dominant O-acetyl group epitope of Vi
polysaccharide. A phase I clinical trial with a synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine has been successfully conducted
by the NICHD team which showed that it is safe and immunogenic, thus providing a critical clinical proof-of-
concept for the synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine. Such a synthetic vaccine could provide significant advantages
over current Vi conjugate vaccine by eliminating the complex and challenging bacteria-based production
system. However, development of the synthetic Vi vaccines does face a significant challenge of potential
variation of plant PGA raw materials, especially in molecular weight, which in turn could lead to variation in
AcPGA or the synthetic Vi antigen. To overcome this challenge and also produce a more effective T-
dependent synthetic Vi polysaccharide, we have developed a simple and efficient process to generate low
molecular weight (LMW) AcPGA through controlled hydrolysis of AcPGA. The resulting LMW AcPGA has a low
molecular weight of 30-60 kDa and a high degree of O-acetylation (DOAc) which exceeds its specification for
Vi polysaccharide. We have further generated a LMW AcPGA conjugate with a novel nanoparticle carrier
protein (Dps, DNA-binding protein from starved cells) of Salmonella bacteria and showed that it is capable of
generating high titers of anti-Vi polysaccharide antibodies in rabbits, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this
LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine. Based on these promising results, we propose to continue development
of this LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine through two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will focus on generation
and characterization of LMW AcPGA while Specific aim 2 will focus on generation, characterization, and
immunogenicity evaluation of LMW AcPGA-Dps conjugates. The primary goals are to establish the optimal
processes and assays for production and characterization of LWM AcPGA and demonstrate the fully T-
dependent induction of anti-Vi polysaccharide antibodies by the LWM AcPGA-Dps conjugates.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will demonstrate production of the synthetic Vi antigen
(LMW AcPGA) from plant PGA raw materials and establish the LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine candidate
(LMW AcPGA-Dps). They will form the basis for further development toward cGMP manufacturing
development and clinical studies. Successful development of this LMW synthetic Vi conjugate vaccine could
potentially provide a drastically improved Vi conjugate vaccine which will not only be produced more efficiently
with a higher capacity but could also be more effective by being fully T-dependent with its LMW synthetic Vi
polysaccharide."
10909800,"Despite improvements in non-invasive medical imaging to aid in the diagnosis of internal malignancy,
improvements in imaging the skin non-invasively have been slower. The dermatoscope, a device that gives a
magnified and polarized view of the skin, is the only ancillary tool commonly used for clinical assessment by
dermatologists to assist in diagnosis. Keratinocyte carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma, are by far the most common cancers diagnosed in the United States. Due to sun exposure during
military deployment, our nation’s Veterans have an increased likelihood of developing these and other skin
cancers compared to the general population. Early keratinocyte carcinomas are often difficult to distinguish
clinically from irritated/inflamed precancerous or benign skin lesions (actinic or seborrheic keratoses). A non-
invasive technology that can assist dermatologists obtain a diagnosis of skin lesions may prevent unnecessary
biopsy, resulting in fewer scars, as well as allow diagnosis and definitive treatment of skin malignancies in the
same clinic visit, improving clinical workflow and patient access to dermatology clinics. A recently approved
skin imaging technology, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), provides state-of-the-art cellular level
resolution of the skin without biopsy, but still has many limitations, limiting its utility to only the most skilled
users. We recently began using software-based digital enhancements to autofluorescence of unstained frozen
tissue sections of microscopic slides to virtually stain unfixed tissue and provide rapid histology quality images
without requiring the laborious tissue processing required of actual processing. Our overarching hypothesis is
that we can apply our digital technology to overcome many of the technical limitations of RCM, and improve
the dermatologists’ or pathologist’s ability to obtain more accurate diagnosis of skin lesion by RCM without
requiring skin biopsy. Our preliminary data demonstrates that our software algorithms can digitally enhance
RCM images of normal skin and basal cell carcinoma, resulting in histologic quality images. In Aim 1, we will
use methodological and computational approaches to refine tissue processing and data acquisition to provide
optimal registration of skin images to obtain the highest quality data sets to train the machine learning
algorithm. In Aim 2, we will incorporate inflamed and uninflamed seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratoses, and
squamous cell carcinoma skin lesions to incorporate features of these lesions into our algorithms originally
developed for normal skin and basal cell carcinoma. In Aim 3, we will perform a pilot study to test the optimized
virtual histology algorithm by prospectively collecting images of consecutive skin lesions on a variety of patient
samples. We will compare how novice and expert RCM dermatology and pathology users perform in obtaining
diagnosis using RCM with and without the virtual histology algorithm. If successful, these studies will provide
an initial step towards noninvasive diagnosis of skin cancer for Veterans and civilians."

little focus has been paid to the examination of infectious agents through bulk wastewater detection and
epidemiological data that is particularly well-suited for disease surveillance in remote, frontier settings
such as the CRST Reservation.
 The goal of this application is to develop and implement a 15-community wastewater testing
program for viral contaminants, including SARS-CoV-2, to better understand the utility of wastewater
testing and COVID-19 or other viral outbreaks in this remote, low-resourced, and relatively low-density
Tribal community.
 We will use our highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team of Native investigators to develop and
implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a viral wastewater sequencing testing program in a very
rural and remote Northern Plains Lakota Reservation.
 Therefore, we propose to leverage our 20-year, long-running partnership with CRST to address the
following Specific Aims:
 1. Use a highly participatory approach to design, garner approval for, and implement a wastewater
 testing system in a large Tribal reservation community. This community surveillance approach will
 screen for viral isolates, including SARS-CoV-2, in coordination with CRST’s preexisting COVID-19
 surveillance system; and
 2. Deploy qualitative methods to examine 16 key Tribal stakeholders’ and Tribal members’
 attitudes towards this new community wastewater testing approach and, ultimately, how this
 new environmental testing effort affects Tribal members socially, ethically, and behaviorally; and
 3. Seek to codify this new resource into the Tribe’s public health emergency response program,
 thereby enhancing the Tribe’s capacity for future viral and other likely epidemic and pandemic
outbreaks."
10930819,"CLINICAL CORE Abstract
The overarching goal of this REVEAL Project (Research Evaluating Vagal Excitation and Anatomical Linkages) is to distinguish the contributing roles of efferent versus afferent VNS modulation of multiple peripheral organs and their dependence on stimulation parameters such as frequency, current output, and duty cycle. We propose a Common Study Protocol (CSP) that is strategically designed to reveal specific VNS parameter settings that modulate the autonomic nervous system control of three physiological systems (cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic). The CSP is complemented with three ancillary projects: 1) in vivo human electrical stimulation and recordings of the vagus nerve; 2) measurements of gastric emptying and accommodation; and 3) unique assessment of high frequency stimulation settings on these four different systems with the IDE-regulated Microburst (LivaNova) that is not possible with the standard LivaNova VNS devices used in the CSP. We will conduct assessments on 144 mostly newly implanted VNS patients (newly implanted=96, previously implanted=48; evenly distributed across epilepsy or depression patients) with either a standard LivaNova clinical device (Sentiva for epilepsy and Symmetry for depression) or a novel LivaNova Microburst device. We will examine the acute and chronic effects of various VNS stimulus parameters by measuring the following: 1) Autonomic: MSNA, baroreflex sensitivity, cardiac sympathovagal tone, autonomic reflexes, autonomic stressors;
2) Cardiovascular: heart rate (time & amp; frequency analyses), blood pressure (time & amp; frequency analyses), ECG (time, frequency, features, nonlinear analyses), ECG electrical burden, cardiac mechanics (Echocardiography), respiratory sinus arrythmia; 3) Immune: cytokines, C reactive protein, cell counts, CyTOF;
4) Metabolic: routine clinical biomarkers (e.g., glucose, lipids, HbA1c), hormones (gut and adipose derived, e.g., insulin, glucagon), serum LC-MS/MS metabolomics, PBMC LC-MS/MS metabolomics. Through a rigorous and sophisticated study design with both newly and previously implanted VNS patients, a comprehensive battery of standard and leading-edge outcome measures, and the highest caliber of quality control and regulatory oversight, we will produce a first-of-its-kind data set to share rapidly and broadly to the neuroscience and autonomic clinical and research communities. These data will provide a multi-system view of the vagus nerve’s functional connectivity in humans, filling a critical knowledge gap and leading to new therapies and research."
10930820,"DATA AND ANALYSIS CORE Abstract
There is a significant opportunity to leverage cutting-edge statistical and modeling techniques to refine our understanding of how vagus nerve recruitment at the cervical level affects metabolomics, cytokine and inflammation markers, cardiovascular function, and other systems innervated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Our overarching goal for the Data and Analysis Core (DAC) is to (1) develop a multi-center “big data ecosystem” to collect human VNS data across our clinical site partners; (2) create models, simulations, and visualization tools that enable users to explore and analyze how specific parameters of VNS affect metabolic, cytokine and inflammatory, and cardiovascular function in humans, and (3) disseminate the data and results through the SPARC Portal. We propose to utilize a multi-tiered data collection, analysis, and modeling research framework that will provide a novel set of retrospective analyses and prospective optimization models to support the proposed Common Study Protocol (CSP) and 3 Ancillary Projects.
The University of Minnesota (UMN) will partner with the Mayo Clinic, Washington University in St. Louis, Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, Stanford University, and the Baker Institute/Monash University (Australia). Data will be collected across a battery of assessments on 144 VNS patients across clinical sites, consisting of previously implanted (p-VNS; N=48) and newly implanted (n-VNS, N=96) groups. The n-VNS patients will be implanted with a standard clinical device by LivaNova or an IDE- regulated novel LivaNova device called Microburst, which enables a wider range of stimulation parameters than what is clinically available. We will investigate the effects of acute and chronic VNS on the physiology of the peripheral systems as described in the Clinical Core research strategy.
The Coordinating Centers for Biometric Research at UMN and BRIGHT, an experienced contract research organization with a special expertise in device studies, will handle the overarching coordination including regulatory and data auditing. Additionally, BIOS Health, which has significant experience with data visualization through an existing SPARC award, will be responsible for assisting with the development and integration of visualization and data workflow tools into the SPARC DRC Portal. DAC Leads will hold monthly meetings with all site PIs, investigators, and relevant staff to ensure timely execution of data collection, coordination, analysis, simulations, visualizations, and dissemination for the REVEAL Project. These data will provide a multi-system view of the vagus nerve’s functional connectivity in humans, filling a critical knowledge gap and providing a foundation for the development of existing and new VNS-based therapies."
10930826,"ANCILLARY PROJECT 3 Abstract: The effects of high frequency microburst VNS on peripheral organ systems
LivaNova recently introduced an IDE-regulated novel VNS device called Microburst which enables a wider range of stimulation parameters than what is clinically available. It is thought to have more robust electrophysiological effects on the brain and possibly the cardiovascular system. We propose to expand REVEAL and the Common Study Protocol’s (CSP) scope and low frequency VNS modulation (1 to 30 Hz) of multiple peripheral organs and their unique responses to higher frequency (100 to 350 Hz), pulse set and interburst intervals. Newly implanted Microburst VNS patient (m-VNS; N=30) will complete the CSP with standard parameters. Once they exit the main protocol, they will undergo a 3-week washout period (VNS OFF) and repeat the CSP with Microburst settings. We will test participants on multi-organ measured physiological outcomes twice: immediately after a 3- week washout period (Early Microburst Effects - Visit 3; Visit 1 and 2 being the main CSP) and 12 weeks after (Late Microburst Effects - Visit 4). Three different stimulation settings (100, 200 and 350 Hz) per patient will be evaluated within and between each of these 2 visits. Outcome measures include: arterial pressure, cardiac sympatho-vagal tone, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), autonomic reflex function, cardiac mechanics, glucose and lipid metabolism, and immune function. Results will also be compared to those from the CSP and standard stimulation parameters. m-VNS patients will be followed for up to one year on clinical outcomes for regulatory purposes and to ensure patient safety. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of highly qualified investigators. Through a rigorous study design with newly implanted high frequency m-VNS and a comprehensive battery of relevant and leading-edge outcome measures, we will complement REVEAL’s multi- system view of the vagus nerve’s functional connectivity in humans and lay the groundwork for new VNS-based research and therapies."
10934716,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sensory impairments, including hearing and vision loss, affect up to 40% of older adults and have been linked
to higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). Identification and
treatment (or corrections) of hearing and vision impairment could be a high-impact strategy for AD/ADRD
prevention, yet uncertainty remains about whether these strategies are likely to deliver true benefits. Large and
diverse longitudinal studies offer advantages over intervention trials to understanding the long-term impacts of
sensory impairment and their treatments on population-level AD/ADRD burden. However, estimating causal
effects of sensory impairment and treatments using observational data requires sophisticated methods to
address potential bias from confounding, reverse causation, selection bias, and measurement error.
Furthermore, the effect of sensory impairment on AD/ADRD may be modified by other risk factors including
sex/gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, genetic risk, and cardiovascular comorbidities. Understanding
heterogeneity by social strata is essential to anticipate the potential impacts of interventions of sensory
impairment on reducing AD/ADRD inequities. Few prior studies have implemented such methods or
comprehensively evaluated heterogeneity by population subgroups. Our overarching goal is to rigorously
evaluate the influence of sensory impairment and treatment of sensory impairments on AD/ADRD risk using
modern causal inference methods and a data triangulation framework, which is a process of integrating evidence
from multiple study designs and settings. Our secondary objective is to leverage multiple data sources to
evaluate heterogeneity of effects in diverse populations and whether sensory impairments contribute to social
inequities in AD/ADRD incidence. We will leverage 3 diverse longitudinal cohort studies complemented by other
large-scale samples with integrated health care and genetic information to conduct our specific aims. Following
our data triangulation framework, we will estimate whether hearing impairments and vision impairments increase
risk of AD/ADRD (Aim 1) and whether treatment of impairments in hearing (hearing aid use) or vision (cataract
surgery) reduces risk of AD/ADRD (Aim 2). Under Aim 3, we will examine heterogeneity (effect modification by
other AD/ADRD risk factors (social factors, genetic risk, cardiovascular risk factors) in the estimated effects
obtained in Aim 1 and 2. Finally, we will quantify reductions in AD/ADRD social inequities that could be achieved
through prevention or treatment of hearing or vision impairments. The integration of this project within the TIME-
AD program, our team’s expertise in cognitive aging, sensory impairment epidemiology, and the use of the
proposed methods and data sources will uniquely enable us to accomplish our aims. This study’s findings will
provide critical insight into whether prevention or treatment of hearing and vision impairment should be high
priorities in efforts to reduce AD/ADRD incidence and inequities."

10919106,"Project Summary Abstract
This Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize Video Rater Photothermal Infrared (VR-PTIR)
imaging and spectroscopy. The proposed VR-PTIR will provide 10-30X better spatial resolution than
conventional IR spectroscopy and will operate up to 1000X faster than previous photothermal infrared
microscope systems. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can provide rich analysis of molecular bonds and has been
used in life sciences research to study tissue classification, drug/tissue interaction, neurodegenerative
diseases, cancer, and other areas. Conventional IR spectroscopy, however, has a fundamental spatial
resolution limit (i.e., roughly how small an object it can analyze) of around 10 micrometers, similar to the
size of an average biological cell. Thus, conventional IR spectroscopy has been extremely limited for many
biomedical applications where the structures of interest are smaller than a cell. Optical photothermal
infrared (O-PTIR) is a rapidly emerging field that uses a tightly focused visible probe beam to detect
infrared absorption in samples with <500 nm spatial resolution, far below the conventional optical
diffraction limit for mid-infrared wavelengths. Current commercial O-PTIR instruments, however, have
relatively slow measurement speeds requiring up to several minutes for a single image, and 10+ hours for
a hyperspectral measurement at high spatial and spectral resolution. This project aims to develop and
commercialize a breakthrough spectroscopic instrument that will enable super-resolution photothermal
infrared spectroscopy at video rates enabling label-free chemical imaging of cells and tissue and high-
resolution hyperspectral analysis in minutes. This project will leverage two recent breakthroughs from
project partner Prof. Ji-Xin Cheng’s group at Boston University, specifically the development of
synchronized laser scanning and single pulse photothermal demodulation.
Preliminary research has already demonstrated following key advances: (1) imaging of live cells at up to
10 frames per second including tracking of lipid dynamics in cells; (2) compositional/structural analysis of
tissue relevant to neurodegenerative disease, (3) hyperspectral arrays in minutes; (4) metabolic imaging
with IR tags; (5) complementary confocal laser fluorescence. This project is well aligned with NIH goals as
it incorporates several key thrusts of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering,
including optical imaging and spectroscopy, IR imaging, confocal microscopy, and multimodal imaging.
VR-PTIR is anticipated to enable breakthroughs in two main application areas: (1) high throughput spectral
analysis; and (2) cellular dynamic analysis. Completion of this project will lead to the commercialization of
a new multimodal microscope that will offer profound benefits for biomedical research including cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic studies, and many other areas."

10927488,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studying cancer across a diverse array of species provides a unique opportunity to interrogate factors
underpinning cancer initiation and progression and facilitating the modeling of new therapeutic targets in the
setting of spontaneous tumors complicated by comorbidities and metastases. While there is extensive reporting
of the frequency and diversity of tumors in animals from zoos, it has not been systematically linked to the plethora
of genomic resources available. To facilitate the transition of comparative oncology studies from human plus one
or two other species, to pan-mammalian analyses, we propose building a pan-mammalian tumor compendium
and portal to easily disseminate our resource. We will develop and apply machine learning tools to detect
patterns of cancer emergence and cancer resistance in human and non-human mammalian tumors. Our
approach provides opportunities to leverage the largely understudied mammalian tumor data jointly with human
data to identify reciprocal links between evolution and cancer resistance. This will allow us to make new human
cancer discoveries through integrative analysis of high-throughput biological data in the context of mammalian
species. We offer a powerful approach combining high-quality reference genomes and genomic data from
hundreds of mammalian species with machine learning, that has the promise to unearth the evolutionary genetic
underpinnings that are cornerstones of cancer initiation and progression. We will develop and apply models to
identify mammalian tumors that effectively mimic rare human cancers, work with collaborators to acquire tumor
samples from strongest identified mammalian models, then sequence and analyze these samples to validate
their effectiveness as models of human cancers."

 Globally, central nervous system (CNS) infections have one of the largest burdens of death and disability,
particularly among persons with weaken immune systems due to the extremes of age, immunosuppressive
medicines, or HIV. Cryptococcal meningitis causes 15-19% of AIDS-related deaths, and TB-meningitis is the
deadliest form of tuberculosis (TB). These CNS infections are neglected diseases.
 This K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research proposal seeks to continue a
successful clinical and translational research portfolio in humans with CNS infections to impact the
international guidelines for what is the standard of medical care in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.
The research portfolio includes leading and mentoring clinical cohorts and randomized clinical trials on: 1)
FDA-field trials for meningitis diagnostics; 2) meningitis treatment; 3) optimizing supportive care for CNS
infections; 4) preventing cryptococcosis; 5) exploring immunopathogenesis in humans relative to survival and
6) neurocognitive outcomes; as well as 7) using health economics to inform international and US policy.
 This proposal is submitted by a mid-career investigator focused on improving the diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of neuro-infections. In 16 years as a faculty, the candidate has mentored >60 students, trainees,
and junior faculty. Current mentees include: 6 K-awardees, 1 Wellcome Trust PhD fellow, 1 MD/PhD student,
12 under-represented minorities, as well as MD and MPH students. The candidate serves as program director
for a T32 training award for infectious diseases fellows. Since 2019, the K24 candidate has published 163
manuscripts (NIH iCite RCR mean = 3.47, ~85th percentile), reflective of effective leadership of a highly
productive interdisciplinary meningitis research team conducting relevant research. The K24 seeks to continue
a productive research platform for HIV-related neuro-infections, which are neglected diseases. There is a track
record of creativity, innovation, and pursuit of clinically relevant research which impacts clinical care in the U.S.
and abroad to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and survival of those persons living with HIV.
 Specific Aims are: 1) Enroll a prospective cohort of HIV+ persons with meningitis to enable diagnostic field
trials and mentee substudies; 2) Develop new clinical trial protocols to investigate new agents for cryptococcal
meningitis and TB meningitis; 3) Develop immunologic framework to characterize distinct subsets of AIDS-
related neuro-infections in the setting of HIV therapy with a focus on future host directed therapy.
 Training objectives of this K24 include 1) further refinement of leadership skills to lead a multi-disciplinary
team; 2) developing further mentoring skills through formal training and workshops; 3) developing proficiency in
single-cell RNA-sequencing to better characterize CSF immune responses."

10924743,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cocaine use disorders (CUDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are persistent public health concerns
worldwide. Psychostimulants such as cocaine can facilitate viral replication and neuroinvasion into the central
nervous system, which can exacerbate HIV-associated neurocognitive dysfunction that is observed even among
those virally suppressed under antiretroviral therapy (ART). Unlike other addictive substances, cocaine does not
have effective FDA-approved medications for helping individuals reduce their cocaine use or maintain long-term
abstinence. Moreover, it is possible that comorbidities such as HIV may impair the efficacy of medications that
may be otherwise effective at treating CUDs (e.g., Namba et al., 2023, Addiction Neuro.). Taken together,
identifying the unique cellular- and circuit-specific mechanisms underlying drug seeking and relapse-like
behavior in the context of HIV is imperative for developing targeted and effective treatments for vulnerable
subpopulations of individuals, such as PLWH suffering from CUDs. This proposal aims to elucidate corticostriatal
and neuroimmune mechanisms underlying HIV-induced dysregulation of reward seeking, with the ultimate goal
of identifying novel CUD treatment targets for PLWH. My preliminary work has revealed that mice infected with
the chimeric HIV construct, EcoHIV, display potentiated cocaine-seeking behavior, impaired extinction learning,
as well as dysregulated peripheral and corticolimbic neuroimmune function. A wide breadth of studies
demonstrate that activity of neuronal projections from the infralimbic cortex (IL) region of the prefrontal cortex
(PFC) to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) are necessary for both the acquisition and expression of
extinction learning and facilitate refraining from drug seeking. As well, PFC dysfunction is also heavily implicated
in HIV at both the clinical and preclinical level. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will use circuit-specific, closed-loop
optogenetics to stimulate the IL→NAcSh circuit to rescue EcoHIV-induced deficits in extinction learning in male
and female mice. Given the putative role of microglia in HIV-associated neuropathology, I will also explore
EcoHIV- and cocaine-induced plasticity of NAcSh microglia in Aim 2. Here, I will employ a combination of
designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) expressed specifically in microglia with
quantitative microglial morphometry to 1) characterize how microglial morphology changes due to cocaine and
EcoHIV infection and 2) determine whether Gi-coupled DREADD stimulation on microglia suppresses EcoHIV-
induced potentiation of cocaine seeking. This research has the potential to reveal novel corticolimbic circuit and
neuroimmune mechanisms underlying HIV-induced dysregulation of reward-seeking behavior, which will
advance our understanding of, and identification of treatment targets for, comorbid HIV and CUDs. Throughout
the proposed training period, I will be trained in techniques such as mouse stereotaxic surgery, closed-loop
optogenetics, chemogenetics, and quantitative imaging and analysis of microglial morphology."

Chronic pain is a significant burden to United States Veterans and is a particular concern for Veterans with
diabetes. Diabetic Veterans have a higher risk of chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathy (CDNP) than civilians
with diabetes, and CDNP is more disabling for Veterans than it is for civilians. Frontline treatment for CDNP,
including enhanced glycemic control, exercise, and pharmacotherapies, show inconsistent outcomes for
individuals with CDNP due to poor adherence and side effects. The ongoing opioid crisis has led to significant
interest in safe and effective alternatives for pain control, and there is a significant need for research on
desirable options for pain control that are likely to improve treatment adherence and outcomes. Veterans
groups and Veterans Affairs clinicians have expressed significant interest in cannabis and its principal
constituents (delta-9-tetrathydrocannabinol, THC; cannabidiol, CBD) for pain management, but the extant
research describing the potential risks and benefits of cannabis for pain is weak. The present study represents
the first significant effort to examine the potential benefits and risks of cannabinoids for Veterans with CDNP
through a collaboration between a nationally-recognized cannabis research expert (Dr. D’Souza), a Veteran
chronic pain research expert (Dr. McGeary), the Hines Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center, and
the Albuquerque Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center. This
research collaboration was developed to meaningfully expand on the extant research using a 4-arm,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. This randomized trial was developed as a
proof of concept study to determine if cannabis constituents (THC, CBD) or their combination (THC+CBD) are
superior to placebo in reducing pain in Veterans with CDNP. Additionally, this will weigh the safety and
tolerability of the interventions against the identified efficacy. The investigators will work with 5 VAMCs to
recruit a sample of 320 adult Veterans who meet diagnostic criteria for high-impact CDNP, are on stable
treatment(s) for CDNP, are not current cannabis users and who do not meet diagnostic criteria for Cannabis
Use Disorder. Enrolled Veterans will be randomly assigned to one of four study arms: 1) 5 mg THC P.O BID; 2)
400 mg CBD P.O BID; 3) 5mg THC + 5 mg CBD P.O BID; or 4) placebo P.O BID. Participants will complete a
2-week titration phase (to minimize side effects and improve tolerability) followed by 4 weeks on the target
treatment dose and a subsequent 2-week down titration (to minimize cannabis withdrawal symptoms). The
primary outcome of this research is mean change in Numeric Rating Scale of pain (NRS) based on a
standardized pain diary completed three times daily producing an average daily pain score. Secondary
outcomes include measures of pain quality, functioning/disability, health-related quality of life, perceived
improvement and treatment satisfaction, emotional functioning, and safety. The investigators will assess
treatment adherence using urinary biomarkers, weekly pill counts, and daily cell phone assisted remote
outcomes adherence (CAROMA) contacts that will also assess medication adherence and pain diary entries.
Data will be analyzed using a 3-level hierarchical mixed-effects linear regression model. If successful, the
proposed study will offer the highest quality proof of concept data for the use of cannabis to treat CDNP in U.S.
Veterans. These data will provide meaningful guidance on additional studies of cannabis for Veterans with pain
and have a high likelihood of also benefiting civilians with CDNP."

participating sites of the above-mentioned RFA, hereafter referred to as MarkVCID I study, our team at JHU
has made significant contributions to the Consortium: 1) In the UH2 phase, we developed CVR MRI candidate
biomarker and collected data to support its selection by the NINDS to become one of the eleven biomarkers
that transited into the UH3 phase; 2) In the UH2 phase, we worked with other sites to standardize MRI, biofluid,
clinical, and neuropsychological measures and implemented candidate biomarkers proposed by other sites
locally at our site; 3) In the UH3 phase, we participated in the multi-site instrumental and biological validation of
biomarkers approved by the NINDS; 4) In the UH3 phase, we led the multi-site instrumental and biological
validation of the CVR candidate biomarker. Importantly, our site has the scientific expertise and equipment that
are necessary to perform any of the 11 biomarkers currently under consideration; 5) We participated in all
Consortium-wide activities such as annual conferences, committee meetings, and calls.
 In the present application, we propose four Specific Aims. Aim 1 will enroll 220 participants of diverse all-
comers that are typical in clinical settings in the United States during the first two years of the project and
collect the NINDS-approved biomarker measures. Aim 2 will conduct longitudinal follow-up in a minimum of
200 participants in the latter three years of the project. Aim 3 will provide inputs and participate in the
Consortium-wide activities such as serving on committees, discussing protocols, attending and presenting in
the annual conferences, participating in multi-site data processing and validation, and sharing of data and
biospecimens with researchers within and outside the Consortium. In Aim 4 we will lead multi-site clinical
validation of a cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) biomarker, if CVR is selected to move on to the next phase.
 Impact: Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed a set of VCID biomarkers that are
ready for future clinical trials, including large phase III trials, of VCID."

This K23 proposal details a comprehensive 5-year training program that will support the candidate’s transition toward an
independent clinical research career focused on the development and rigorous testing of mind-body interventions with an
emphasis on prevention of transition from acute to chronic symptoms following illness or injury. In this application the
candidate proposes a significant and innovative proposal that is directly tied with his proposed training and career
development goals. Background: College-age individuals have particularly high rates of concussions (also known as mTBIs)
and anxiety. When these co-occur, there is an increased risk for transition to chronic mTBI symptoms, which are costly and
challenging to treat. To date, there are no evidence-based interventions focused on preventing chronic mTBI. The Toolkit
for Optimal Recovery (TOR) is a brief, live video mind-body program aimed at preventing chronic pain in patients with
acute injuries, which is amenable for adaptations for the needs of college-age individuals with mTBI and anxiety. Specific
aims and research design: The proposed study aims to 1) identify treatment needs and preferences among college-age
individuals with acute mTBI and anxiety via live video qualitative interviews (N = 20) to inform adaptation of the TOR and
study procedures; 2) explore, via an open pilot (N=5) with exit interviews and pre- and post- self-report assessments, initial
feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of the live video TOR-Concussions (TOR-C) and study procedures, and to further
refine the intervention, as needed; and 3) establish, via a pilot feasibility RCT of the TOR-C versus a matched dose, time
and attention control (N = 50 enrolled), the feasibility, acceptability and credibility of both programs following pre-
determined benchmarks. Findings will inform an efficacy trial through the UG3/UH3 o mechanisms, as well as future studies
aimed at generalizing this work to other patient populations. Training and mentoring: Study aims are supported by 3 main
training goals aimed at developing expertise in: 1) qualitative methods for mind- body intervention adaptation; 2) mHealth
and technology-based approaches, and 3) conduct of rigorous clinical trials, and advanced statistics for clinical trials. These
training goals are supported by 1) a team of expert mentors (Vranceanu & Yeh), collaborators (Giacino, Iverson & Macklin),
and contributors (Silverberg) that will oversee the progress of the project, 2) a rich institutional environment, and 3) targeted
coursework, scientific meetings, seminars and planned publications. Relevance to the NCCIH mission. This K23 proposal
is in line with NCCIH’s funding priorities to develop feasible and acceptable mind-body interventions for difficult problems
focused on prevention. Impact: Collectively, the experience gained during this award will serve as the foundation for the
applicant’s independent career in mind-body preventative interventions, and will start a line of research focused on the
development and testing of brief, feasible and scalable mind-body interventions with a focus on prevention of chronic illness."

date. This slows the progress of research positively impacting biological, health, regulatory, and
medical challenges. The Massive Analysis Quality Control Society (MAQC Society) seeks to
enhance reproducibility and rigorousness specifically of high throughput data. The objective of
the MAQC Society is to discuss, study, and encourage reproducible science and quality control
for analysis of large datasets originating from emerging technologies. To foster discussions,
present research, and train the next generation of reproducible scientists, the MAQC Society
has an annual meeting. The past three have been very successful, attracting 150-200 domestic
and international attendees split roughly equally between academia, government, and the
private sector. All attendees are exposed to a range of research important to FDA and NCTR.
Due to our diversity of attendance, our annual meeting helps attendees network, discuss across
sectors, and set up cross-functional projects to interrogate and advance reproducible science.
This society is highly focused on training up and coming scientists. The MAQC Society is proud
to see that many students and postdoctoral fellows attend. Every year, the agenda features a
poster session as well as a “lightning round” of abstract selected presentations. In addition to
the next generation, MAQC Society meetings attract reproducibility key opinion leaders. Owing
to the small conference of the annual conference, newer scientists have the opportunity to
mingle with these senior leaders. To continue with our mission of creating a community forum
for presentation and discussion, the MAQC Society is applying for funding for the next 5 annual
conferences. This funding will support travel and accommodation expenses for keynote
speakers, student poster and presentation awards, student travel grants, and student-related
conference activities, and workshops around topics important to reproducible science."
10928270,"ABSTRACT
 Formerly incarcerated people with serious mental illnesses (SMI) experience the criminal legal system
unequally and have elevated rates of recidivism, homelessness, general medical problems, and substance use
disorders. Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is a housing intervention often used during reentry, but it has
limited resources for addressing community integration, a key component of reentry. PSH are often located in
high-poverty environments with increased criminogenic risk. The geography of PSH also includes public spaces,
which are associated with greater self-esteem, life satisfaction, a positive orientation toward recovery,
independent employment, and access to tangible and social resources. The risk environment framework
provides a structure for understanding the geography of PSH through its focus on the physical, social, economic,
and policy influences on both the micro and macro environments. During reentry, individual, interpersonal, and
environmental factors can interact with these environments to produce or reduce risk. If addressed, these factors
can contribute to reentry wellbeing, through improved community participation and treatment engagement and
reduced psychiatric distress and substance use, ultimately supporting more targeted interventions.
 The proposed study uses a rigorous nontraditional QUAL + QUAN (spatial) concurrent mixed-methods design
to examine how individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors situated in the risk environments of PSH
interact with public and private spaces to inform reentry wellbeing. Eighty multi-method interviews (i.e.,
qualitative, quantitative, and participatory mapping methods) that look at individual, interpersonal, and
environmental reentry factors will be conducted with formerly incarcerated clients with SMI. Data collected will
be triangulated with go-along interviews with up to 20 of the participants. Participatory mapping will then be
geocoded and sites identified as places of importance, frequent participation, and belonging will be evaluated in
relation to objective features of spaces like resource and treatment availability or accessibility using GIS methods
in order to develop a community resilience index model. A cluster analysis will additionally be conducted to
identify and map areas of increased and decreased drug overdose and arrest and overlaid with the community
resilience index model to examine the relationship between community resilience and the risk environments. I
will then partner with a community advisory board of 2 providers and 6 formerly incarcerated PSH residents to
integrate the findings for the purpose of co-designing a targeted multilevel intervention aimed at improving
reentry wellbeing through public space engagement. My proposed research plan integrates activities, formal
training, and mentorship from experts (Drs. Michael McDonell, Benjamin Henwood, Ofer Amram, Chyrell
Bellamy, Susan Collins, and Mark Salzer) in supportive housing, the risk environment framework, spatial
analysis, intervention development, community-based participatory research, and the mental health and criminal
legal systems. The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will build on my previous training
and research to allow me to pursue my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator focused
on the use and interaction of public and private spaces in supporting reentry from prisons and jails for people
with SMI."
10928279,"Project Summary
The complement system controls the balance between homeostatic and inflammatory processes. Although
abnormal complement activity is strongly associated with macular degenerations, inhibiting this pathway has
been unsuccessful in halting vision loss. To date, therapeutic approaches have focused on complete
inhibition of extracellular complement activity, with limited insight into how complement proteins modulate
retinal health and disease. This is particularly evident in approaches targeting the complement protein C3,
the core effector molecule of the complement system, which plays context-dependent roles in the retina.
Countering the conventional view of C3 acting solely in the extracellular space, recent studies from our
group have identified intracellular C3 activation as a novel mechanism that modulates health of the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE), a primary site of injury in macular degenerations. In stressed or diseased RPE,
increased uptake and proteolysis of C3 generates biologically active C3a (“intracellular C3 activation”). C3a
in turn activates mTOR, a master regulator of cell health. Chronic mTOR activation is detrimental to cell
health because it can reprogram cellular metabolism and cell fate decisions. Based on these exciting
studies, we hypothesize that abnormal intracellular complement activation could drive disease pathology by
compromising RPE homeostasis. We propose to molecularly dissect the machinery, mechanisms, and
consequences of dysregulated intracellular C3a activity in the RPE, and identify potential points of
therapeutic intervention to halt this cascade. We will identify the cellular machinery responsible for increased
intracellular C3a generation in diseased RPE (Aim 1); investigate the dynamics of C3a signaling via its
cognate receptor C3aR (Aim 2); and determine how persistent C3a-C3aR signaling disrupts RPE
homeostasis and retinal function (Aim 3). We will use our expertise in innovative high- speed and super-
resolution live-cell imaging and mouse models of disease to gain unprecedented spatial and temporal
information about intracellular C3 activation and its consequences for retinal health. These studies will aid the
development of a unified model that links multiple features of AMD, including cholesterol accumulation,
complement activation, metabolic deficits and RPE dedifferentiation. Identifying molecular mechanisms that
underlie increased intracellular C3 activation will aid the design of precision therapeutics to safeguard RPE
health and retinal function over a lifetime."
10933037,"Project Summary/Abstract
In 2019, nearly 14 of every 100 U.S. adults aged 18 years or older (14.0%) currently smoked cigarettes. Current
strategies of tobacco use risk communication include using quantitative information to explain the likelihood that
a consequenceof using aproduct will occur (to prevent initiation/encourage cessation) or to explain the reduction
of risk when switching products or quitting. Although increasing numeracy (the ability to comprehend numerical
information) can increase healthy behaviors, there is a critical barrier in research regarding how numeracy is
related to risk understanding and decision-making around tobacco use. There is also a gap regarding how this
relationship differs by demographic factors. My overall project goal is to examine the interrelationships among
numeracy, risk perception, tobacco product use, cessation, and product switching. These findings will provide
evidence for tailored risk communications for individuals with differing numeracy levels. In the F99 phase, we
will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data to determine whether or not there are associations among
numeracy, risk comprehension, and tobacco use behaviors, and if these associations differ by demographic
factors. We will use these findings to determine who should be targeted with public health campaigns and how
risk should be communicated. In the K00 phase, we aim to find, defend, implement, evaluate, and modify public
health campaign strategies to disseminate risk information. Risk communication will be tailored for
subpopulations with differing numeracy levels. Numeracy, risk perception, and tobacco-related behaviors
are expected to be associated, providing evidence for tailored risk communication for subpopulations
with differing numeracy. By identifying which segments of the population have low numeracy (F99 phase),
these specific subgroups can be targeted with tailored educational campaigns that communicate risk in a
numeracy-level appropriate manner (K00 phase). This project will use both objective and subjective numeracy
measures, different types of risk perceptionmeasures, and will look at familiar (e.g., lung cancer) and less familiar
(e.g., bladder cancer) tobacco-related health risks. We will analyze data from nationally representative data sets
(The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH), the Health information National Trends Survey
(HINTS), and the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)) which contain
demographic, tobacco use, risk perception, and numeracy measures. The proposed studies will explore
numeracy and risk perception of tobacco-related diseases and will add to current literature in this area by
focusing on its relationship with specific tobacco-related health behaviors: use, cessation, and product switching.
This research will advance the field of cancer prevention by exploring how tobacco product risk can best be
communicated to groups that need it. These communications will encourage healthy behaviors and decrease
tobacco-related disease outcomes (such as cancer). The findings will help to inform who should be targeted with
public health campaigns, how risk should be communicated, and whether these campaigns are efficient."
10915806,"Background: There is a pressing need to develop effective methods to enhance walking balance in people with
chronic stroke (PwCS). Interventions that amplify self-generated movements may accelerate motor learning by
enhancing a person's perception of movement errors. This method could potentially be applied to help PwCS
improve walking balance. To this end, we have developed a cable-driven robot to create a Movement
Amplification Environment (MAE) during treadmill walking. The MAE challenges walking balance by applying
lateral forces to the pelvis that are proportional in magnitude to real-time lateral center of mass (COM) velocity.
Unlike a popular form of balance training that uses unpredictable perturbations to enhance reactive balance,
training in a MAE targets anticipatory balance by developing predictive control mechanisms that are likely to
persist when the training environment is removed (after-effects). We believe that supplementing high-intensity
gait training (the recommended practice to improve walking speed and distance) with a MAE will substantially
enhance walking balance. Thus, our purpose is to evaluate the unique effects of MAE training on walking balance
in PwCS and determine feasibility of conducting high-intensity gait training in a MAE.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate gait patterns PwCS adapt during and immediately following walking practiced
in two balance-challenging training environments: MAE and unpredictable lateral perturbations. Aim 2: To
establish feasibility of high intensity gait training in MAE we will evaluate cardiovascular intensity during gait
training interventions performed in either a natural unmodified environment or a MAE.
Approach: Aims 1: 15 PwCS will participate in a single-day experiment evaluating gait biomechanics (COM
dynamics and stepping patterns) during and immediately following treadmill walking performed in a MAE or while
receiving frequent unpredictable lateral perturbations. Outcomes will assess if changes in gait patterns to
maintain stability persist immediately following exposure to either of the balance-challenging environments. Aim
2: 15 PwCS will participate in two high-intensity gait training sessions. One session will be performed in a natural
unmodified environment, the other in a MAE. We will quantify differences in mean heart rate (HR) between the
two sessions and whether mean HR is in the target high-intensity range of 70-85% of maximum HR.
Impact: This project will identify if and how PwCS uniquely adapt locomotor strategies following exposure to
balance challenging environments and evaluate feasibility of administering high-intensity gait training in a MAE.
Training walking balance of PwCS in a MAE by amplifying their own self-generated movements is a radical
departure from current practice and could substantially enhance walking balance. Successful outcomes will
motivate a future randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of MAE training to enhance walking balance
in PwCS."
10917952,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 During development, specific synaptic partners connect in order to ensure proper neural circuit function,
but how these connections are disassembled during neurodegeneration is less well understood. In rodent
experimental glaucoma (EG) models, synapse loss occurs early, preceding retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite
retraction and cell death. Converging evidence in rodents suggests that specific RGC types are more susceptible
to elevated intraocular pressure, but little is known about retinal circuit disassembly in glaucomatous primate
retina. Indeed, significant differences in mice, which lack a lamina cribrosa and macula and have dissimilar RGC
types, limit the translation and generalizability of findings to humans. It is critically important to address this
knowledge gap in order to advance successful development of clinically relevant diagnostics and novel treatment
approaches, such as neuroprotection, gene therapy, and cell-based vision restoration strategies. Here we
assemble a highly collaborative team of investigators with complementary expertise well-matched to our goal
of systematically determining the connectivity, function, and transcriptomes of RGCs undergoing circuit
and synapse disassembly in glaucomatous primate retina. Our approach builds on a well-established rhesus
macaque non-human primate (NHP) model of experimental glaucoma that closely recapitulates structural and
functional changes observed in human glaucoma, and permits detailed and precise staging of disease. Based
on our studies in mice and preliminary data in NHP, we hypothesize that specific microcircuits in the injured
adult NHP retina may exhibit susceptibility in connectivity and function, which is reflected in differential
gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we apply rigorous quantitative electrophysiological, anatomical, and
molecular assessments focusing on the four main RGC types in NHP retina: ON and OFF midget and parasol
ganglion cells. Aim 1 will use high-density multielectrode arrays, single cell recordings, and Patch-seq to identify
the functional RGC types that are vulnerable in NHP EG and probe their transcriptomes to reveal mechanistic
insights and novel therapeutic targets. Aim 2 will determine the specificity and patterns of circuit and synapse
disassembly in NHP EG from both lamina-specific and cell type-specific perspectives using detailed circuit and
synapse mapping. The proposal is innovative because it brings together multi-modal function, morphologic, and
molecular analyses, and is significant because it focuses on the four main RGC types in primate that account for
the majority of human vision and are affected in glaucoma. We will generate significant resources for the scientific
community and reveal insights into retinal circuit disassembly and the potential for circuit repair in a highly
clinically relevant model of glaucoma."

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant primary brain cancer in adults, has an average survival of one
year. Treatment includes maximal safe resection, followed by chemoradiation and adjuvant temozolomide
(TMZ), the latter only increasing median survival by 2.5 months. Moreover, most targeted therapy trials have
been unsuccessful due to activation of tyrosine kinase receptors and relative blood-brain barrier (BBB)
impermeability. Thus, a pressing need remains to find a more effective therapy. This study builds on preliminary
data generated using Connectivity Map (CMap), developed by the BROAD institute to identify drugs for
repurposing based on cancer’s genetic profile. By analyzing 99 GBM and 38 adjacent normal samples from 4
datasets, CMap identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as top candidates. Database analysis using
GEPIA identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 as the most upregulated and HDAC11 as the most downregulated HDACs.
Thus, we selected the BBB permeant PCI-24781/abexinostat due to its specificity for GBM gene signature-
specific HDACs (inhibiting HDAC1 and HDAC2, but not HDAC11, or class IIa HDACs) to evaluate. In preliminary
studies, as compared to other pan HDAC inhibitors, PCI-24781 induced significantly greater apoptosis and
downregulated DNA repair machinery (CHK1, RAD51, and MGMT) in GBM cell lines in vitro. Further, PCI-24781
efficiently decreased the tumor burden in orthotopic murine models in combination with TMZ compared to
vorinostat with TMZ and enhanced survival. From this, we hypothesize that inhibiting class 1 HDACs with PCI-
24781 will enhance the efficacy of TMZ in GBM by targeting DNA repair machinery. To test this hypothesis, we
propose two specific aims: In Aim 1, we will evaluate the efficacy of PCI-24781 with TMZ in in vivo GBM models.
Murine GBM organoids, genetically engineered GBM mouse models, and patient-derived xenografts will be used
to evaluate BBB permeability and to measure toxicity. Therapeutic efficacy and survival will be recorded for each
group of mice treated with PCI-24781 and TMZ singly and in combination. We will analyze the effect of
combination therapy on DNA repair machinery proteins by IHC in resected tumors and will also perform RNA-
seq and Omni-ATAC-seq analyses to identify additional pathways and chromatin accessibility, respectively,
impacted by PCI-24781. In Aim 2, a phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate toxicity and determine the MTD of PCI-
24781 with TMZ in recurrent high-grade glioma patients. We will analyze patient exosomes to demonstrate
protein acetylation and BBB permeability. Together, these aims will elucidate mechanisms for synergy between
and tolerance of PCI-24781 with TMZ in GBM. Combining PCI-24781 with TMZ will successfully overcome TMZ
resistance, negatively impacting tumor growth and recurrence and effectively improving the survival of GBM
patients."

Teenage pregnancy (TP) is largely unintended and can lead to adverse health, educational, and economic
outcomes for both the mother and the child. Although TP rates have declined in the U.S. over several decades,
disparities persist. Birth rates among Latinx teens in the U.S. are 1.5 times higher than the national average
and more than 2 times higher in rural areas compared to rural White teens. Latinx immigrants settling in rural
areas represent the largest and fastest growing minority group in rural America. Best practices for
implementing evidence-based TP prevention programs in these unique communities remain largely unknown.
Thus, a critical need exists to develop and evaluate a set of responsive interventions tailored specifically to
these vulnerable teens. The transcreation implementation science framework has been used to address other
health disparities among Latinx rural communities. Based on our previous work demonstrating the need for TP
prevention interventions tailored to meet needs in this unique population, we will use this framework to build
upon Cuídate (Take Care), an evidence-based, culturally responsive intervention that has been shown to
decrease sexual risk behaviors among urban Latinx youth. Dr. Barral, an adolescent medicine physician and
candidate for this career development award, is committed to a patient-oriented clinical research career
targeting interventions to reduce reproductive health disparities. Her five-year career development plan
includes structured mentoring and formal didactics to address critical gaps in her training through acquisition of
expertise in theories of behavior change, clinical trials for adolescent behavioral research, and community
engaged research. The proposed study complements other training activities by enabling hands-on experience
in intervention co-development and feasibility trial. Following identification of key factors needed for the
development of an acceptable TP prevention intervention for rural Latinx teens, Dr Barral will use the
transcreation framework to co-develop an intervention that best fits the community’s unique needs and context.
Dr. Barral will conduct a one arm feasibility trail to evaluate acceptability and practicality of the co-created
intervention. The proposed investigation will improve scientific knowledge in disparities in TP prevention by
addressing the intersectionality and context of TP occurring among emerging immigrant Latinx populations
embedded in rural communities. She will comprehensively incorporate community and stakeholder guidance
into a co-created and novel intervention that optimally fits local needs of these unique new immigrant
populations. Study findings will inform the development of a larger hybrid efficacy implementation study,
supported by an R01 submission during the K23 award period. This training and research plan are consistent
with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities."
10910110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is widespread excitement about chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which causes complete
disease response in 40%-54% of adults with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), compared to a
response rate of 7% to chemotherapy prior to the advent of CAR T-cell therapy. For the first time, long-term
disease-free survival is possible for patients with advanced LBCL. CAR T-cell therapy causes a unique profile
of adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events, which may be risk factors
for cancer-associated cognitive decline (CACD). However, little is known about neurocognition and patient-
reported outcomes (PROs; e.g., symptoms, quality of life or QOL) in CAR T-cell therapy patients. The goal of
the current study is to investigate longitudinal changes in PROs and CACD, outcomes that are highly relevant to
survivorship, in the first year after CAR T-cell therapy. We will recruit 204 LBCL patients treated with CAR T-cell
therapy and 102 age-, sex-, and education-matched individuals without cancer. Participants will be assessed at
pre-CAR T-cell therapy baseline and 3 and 12 months later to capture acute and longer-term outcomes. At each
time point, participants will complete internet-based neuropsychological testing, validated PRO questionnaires,
and 7-day smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of cognition and self-reported risk
factors for CACD (i.e., fatigue, depression, pain, stress). Actigraphy during EMA periods will be used to
objectively measure sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behavior as behavioral factors for QOL and CACD.
Blood will be collected and banked at each assessment for future examination of biological mechanisms (e.g.,
inflammation, accelerated cellular aging). Data will be used to address the following aims: 1) to examine baseline
differences and longitudinal changes in patient-reported outcomes and cognition in CAR T-cell therapy recipients
and controls, 2) to identify demographic, contextual, and clinical risk factors that are associated with worse
cognition in CAR T-cell therapy recipients compared to controls, and 3) to determine behavioral protective factors
associated with better cognition among CAR T-cell therapy recipients and controls. This research will be highly
impactful, providing the data needed to educate patients and their families about CAR T-cell therapy in
collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Analyses focused on risk and protective factors will
provide insights into potential targets of intervention to improve QOL and CACD in this novel cancer survivor
population."

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is one of the leading causes of intellectual disability in the United States. The
CDC estimates that 0.2-1.5 per 1000 live births are children with FASD, a syndrome characterized by disrupted
fetal brain development and postnatal intellectual disability (ID). Disrupted connectivity including altered
dendritic structure, axonal pathfinding and white matter tracts are common findings in FAS and are thought to
be major contributors to ID. However, the cellular and biological targets of alcohol are diverse and it is not clear
whether there are common underlying molecular mechanisms producing these disruptions. Identification of
common molecular mechanism(s) would enable a deeper understanding of this disorder, inform studies of
genetic susceptibilities and provide molecular targets for neuroprotective strategies. This proposal pursues our
finding that acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure disrupts Src kinase activity in embryonic cortical neurons. Src is a
critical non-receptor tyrosine kinase that sits at central positions in multiple signaling pathways including the
Reelin-Dab1 signaling pathway which controls brain layer formation and dendritogenesis. We found that acute
EtOH exposure activates Src and induces phosphorylation of many proteins including Dab1, an essential
adaptor protein in the Reelin-signaling pathway. Remarkably, this dramatic increase in phosphorylation is
followed by a sustained dephosphorylation response in which the phosphorylation of Reelin effectors including
Dab1, Src itself and the actin severing protein n-cofilin return to baseline levels, or below. During the extended
dephosphorylation phase, the Reelin-signaling pathway can no longer be activated by in vitro application of its
ligand, Reelin. In AIM 1 of this proposal, we will determine whether Reelin-Dab1 silencing occurs in vivo after
maternal dosing with EtOH. We will then determine whether genetic deficiency in Src prevents the
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation responses. Genetically establishing the critical kinase that initiates the
EtOH response in vivo will be essential for future neuroprotective efforts. We and others have shown that
Reelin-Dab1 signaling controls Golgi-deployment in the forming dendrite. In AIM 2 we will examine whether Src
activation and inactivation disrupts Golgi location and function. Disrupted Golgi function would be expected to
impact membrane addition, glycosylation, secretion and appropriate expression of many proteins, with
potential long term negative consequences on neuritogenesis and neuronal function. In AIM 3 we will
determine whether the EphA3 signaling pathway is similarly disrupted by Src dysregulation. EphA3 is a
receptor tyrosine kinase that is required for axonal and white matter tract development. We identified the
activation site of EphA3 as a target of EtOH-induced Src dysregulation raising the possibility that EphA3
activation and then silencing may contribute to FASD-related white matter disruptions. Collectively, these
studies will determine the contribution of EtOH-dependent Src dysregulation to altered developmental signaling
in pathways critical for brain development."

Despite the use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (NCI)
continues to be prevalent among people living with HIV. For more than 20 years, our investigation of HIV-
associated comorbidities among African Americans (AAs) has demonstrated that while comorbidities are
prevalent among AAs living with HIV, other factors, such as cocaine use, may trigger or accelerate their
impact. We have shown that although HIV increases the risk of coronary plaque, the detrimental effect of
HIV/ART predominantly affects cocaine users rather than non-users. Likewise, our preliminary work showed
that while HIV was associated with NCI, the adverse effect of HIV primarily impacted cocaine users.
Furthermore, our ongoing HEART study showed that a contingency management (CM) intervention is effective
in achieving a sustained reduction in cocaine use among AA cocaine users with subclinical heart disease and
was associated with a concurrent decrease in coronary plaque burden. Cocaine use and NCI continue to
disproportionately affect AAs, especially those living with HIV. As of now, there are no FDA-approved medications
for cocaine addiction. We propose to investigate whether CM can be employed to decrease cocaine use and
slow cognitive decline among AA cocaine users. There is no single definitive biomarker that can measure
cognitive decline; however, brain MRI may detect early structural changes in the brain that signify cognitive
decline, prior to the onset of symptoms. Our latest brain MRI study revealed an independent association
between cocaine use and the length of its use with an increased severity of white matter hyperintensities
(WMH) and a decrease in hippocampal (HP) volume among AAs. WMH are recognized as one of the most
promising brain MRI markers of cognitive decline along with HP volume. Thus, we propose a 5-year study to
evaluate the effects of a 12-month CM intervention on the brain MRI biomarkers and cognitive performance
assessed with NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) among AA cocaine users. We will recruit 180 AA
cocaine users, ≥40 years of age, including an equal number of men and women with and without HIV, drawn
from our ongoing study (U01DA040325). Participants will undergo a 12-month CM to reinforce cocaine
abstinence with an escalating cash incentive approach. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effects of a 12-month CM
on MRI measures of brain structure and function (WMH, HP volume, resting state fMRI and other measures)
and cognitive performance (NIHTB-CB). In Aim 2, we will evaluate the net effect of HIV on brain MRI measures
and cognitive performance. In Aim 3, we will study whether changes in brain MRI measures during the 12-
month CM period are associated with changes in cognitive performance. This study will establish the
effectiveness of a targeted intervention in reducing cocaine use and improving cognitive outcomes in AA
cocaine users living with HIV, thereby addressing a recognized health disparity in the AA population."
10909955,"Many youth who sell sex and adolescent men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk for
HIV and other adverse health outcomes. However, these youth are often excluded from studies conducted with
key populations in the region due to legal and ethical challenges. For example, the requirement to obtain
parental consent for the participation of minors in research is often not safe or practical for youth whose sexual
behaviors are stigmatized. This exclusion from research hinders the development and testing of interventions
tailored for underage key populations. This project's long-term objective is to identify legal and ethical barriers
to conducting HIV research with underage key populations in sub-Saharan Africa in order to inform strategies
for overcoming these barriers to implement such research where it is feasible and warranted. The specific aims
of this study are: (1) To examine the relationship between legal restrictions related to the participation of
minors under the age of 18 in research and the implementation of studies including underage key populations

each country's ethical and regulatory guidance on research with minors will be analyzed, and a systematic
review of the literature on key populations in Africa will be conducted to determine where and what types of
research (e.g., observational or therapeutic) have been conducted with underage key populations. (2) To
assess through surveys the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of research ethics committee members and
institutional review board members (n=419) in sub-Saharan Africa regarding the review of studies that include
underage key populations as participants. We will analyze the country-level, committee-level, and individual-
level characteristics associated with willingness to consider approving research with underage key populations.
(3) To identify perceived obstacles to conducting research with underage key populations in Africa through
surveys of two groups of researchers who have conducted studies with key populations in Africa: those who
have a) included underage participants (n=50) and b) excluded underage participants (n=125). Deliberative
focus group discussions will also be conducted with researchers and research ethics committee members.
Findings will be disseminated to researchers, ethics committee members, and organizations representing
youth and key populations in Africa."

Immune cells protect us from disease by detecting and responding to foreign molecules. Understanding the
molecular basis of this response is critical if we are to generate new therapies for treatment or prevention of
diseases involving immune cells. The objective of our research is to characterize a newly discovered antigen
detecting protein (butyrophilin 3, BTN3) which influences the immune response mediated by gamma delta T
cells. Gamma delta T cells are cytotoxic T cells that respond quickly to foreign threats and serve a variety of
roles, including direct lysis of infected or malignant cells, and as such, their activation holds great promise for
therapeutic manipulation. In contrast to T cells that express the more prevalent alpha beta T cell receptor and
respond to peptide antigens, T cells that express the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell receptor respond to small
phosphorous-containing compounds known as phosphoantigens. Butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN3A1) is the receptor for
phosphoantigens and mediates their activation of T cells through unclear mechanisms. We developed a library
of novel synthetic phosphoantigens, as well as a library of butyrophilin constructs and point mutations, both of
which are valuable tools for understanding the underlying biology of butyrophilins. Here, we propose aims that
test the underlying hypothesis that ligand binding to the intracellular domain of BTN3A1 produces conformational
and organizational changes that are required for interaction with counter receptors on T cells. Understanding
how BTN3A1 and the related 3A2, 3A3, and 2A1 isoforms function at the molecular level is important because it
1) will help optimize past and present clinical trials that have examined phosphoantigens and phosphoantigen-
expanded cells as immunotherapies, and 2) will identify new molecular targets or strategies within this complex
for therapeutic manipulation. Our studies in Aim 1 will show a structural basis for how phosphoantigens affect
the full length endogenous BTN3A1 using multiple biophysical and molecular biological approaches. In Aim 2,
we will investigate the function of BTN3A1 in phosphoantigen-induced Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell lysis of
phosphoantigen containing cells and associated cytokine production. Together, this will allow us to build a
structure-function model of BTN3 with regards to how its domain organization, oligomerization status, protein-
protein interactions, and relationship to BTN2A1 influence its function. This will largely be done in the context of
biological membranes through use of a novel in vitro membrane nanodisc/cryo-EM model system. Our ultimate
goal is to present a clear structural model that demonstrates how phosphoantigen-induced conformational and/or
compositional changes in the BTN3 complex promote effector functions of T cells. This will enable clinical
development of therapies that modulate butyrophilin function to overcome immune checkpoints. These findings
will come at a point when the biological understanding of antigen detection is far from complete, and thus have
the potential to impact the field."
10911330,"One resounding success of modern public health and medicine is the fact that most of us can now expect to live a long life and die in old age. There is a growing consensus that the medical education system is unable to meet the health care needs of the population in an appropriate way; this reform is overdue. One of the ways to prepare the future generation is by developing their interests in aging research early on. Research is a valuable part of medical education. Even at a rudimentary level, engaging in research implicates medical students in the creation of knowledge. They need to understand that knowledge is not an inert substance they passively receive, but is continually created, debated, and reformulated—and they have a role to play in that process. The proposed training program in aging research builds upon the strong and successful existing foundation of clinical, education and research training at the Mount Sinai Health System and the highly successful Medical Student Training in Aging Research (MSTAR) Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The overall aim of the proposed 8- to 12-week training program called Training Future Leaders in Aging Research is to provide 15 promising medical student trainees per summer with the basic knowledge and skills in aging and palliative medicine research and to stimulate and nurture their beginning interest in geriatrics and palliative medicine. We propose to accomplish these goals by developing a highly structured program in aging and palliative medicine research for medical student trainees that will include: 1) Participation in aging and palliative medicine research initiatives with established and successful research investigators with proven track records in student mentoring; 2) Development of formal mentoring relationships with these leading research faculty and partnering with prior student trainees who will serve as near-peer mentors for additional support; 3) Development of individual learning and research contracts for goal settings; 4) Participation in structured activities on basic research methodology and leadership topics; 5) Clinical exposures in geriatric and palliative medicine nested and aligned with their research project goals and; 6) Guided mentorship for research presentation and dissemination. We expect that these mentee-mentor relationships will endure beyond the training period or even the research project and develop into a lifelong mentorship. We hypothesize that a positive introduction to aging and palliative medicine research and to clinical care of older adults will lead many program trainees to pursue careers in geriatrics and/or palliative medicine, assume academic leadership roles, and become relentless advocates of older adult health."
10911886,"Project Summary:
A detailed understanding of human disease at the single cell level constitutes an important
frontier of biomedical science. Cell-to-cell heterogeneities exist within tissues, and
understanding the nature of these differences in terms of metabolite profile has vast implications
regardless the type of disease. Beautiful experiments using fluorescent sensors have been
developed to quantify small molecule metabolites within cells; however, the act of shining light
on a cell has been shown to have deleterious effects. Further, these sensors are not easily
generalizable. We endeavor to make the most accurate measurements of cellular metabolites
with minimal perturbation to cellular homeostasis using nanoelectrochemical measurements.
These measurements have the potential to open the door to unrealized sensitivity in sub-cellular
metabolite quantification. Electrochemistry at nanoelectrodes has been used to interrogate
cellular processes and quantify reactive species within cells. However, the time it takes for a
nanoelectrode to deliver enough charge to convert a cell's contents during amperometric and
voltammetric experiments is on the order of 100 ms. Therefore, novel techniques must be
developed to minimize the perturbation to cellular homeostasis to ensure accurate
measurements of natural cellular processes. Our group has recently investigated open circuit
potentiometry, which was chosen because the measurement is carried out with negligible
current. We have discovered that this technique is independent of electrode size. This finding
indicates the sensitivity of the measurement will not change with time appreciably, and
longitudinal experiments within single cells can be carried out. We propose to develop
metabolite-specific nanoelectrodes that operate under open circuit conditions. We will draw from
our experience fabricating nanoelectrodes and studying oxygen content within single cells and
experience developing sensors to create a generalized platform for single cell metabolomics
measurements. Specificity is gained via oxidoreductase enzymes that are trapped on top of an
electrode surface by a hydrogel. Metabolite concentration is obtained by the enzymatic turnover
rate, which is dependent on substrate concentration. Methodology developed through this grant
period has the potential to forge a foundation for generalized metabolomics studies with
nanoelectrode sensors, where the library of metabolite of interest depends only on the
availability of an associated oxidoreductase enzyme."
10911890,"Abstract
College students’ risky drinking and cannabis use are major public health problems. Almost 80% of college
students report consuming alcohol in the past year and more than 1 in 3 report heavy episodic drinking in the
past month. Reports also show that college is a high-risk window for cannabis use. This is highly concerning
considering that the potency of present-day cannabis has markedly increased, cannabis use and
consequences have also risen, and availability continues to grow due to increased legalization across the U.S.
Further, a number of studies have shown an increase in co-use of alcohol and cannabis (use of both
substances in the same day), which results in significantly more problems compared to either alcohol-only or
cannabis-only use. Our brief parent-based intervention for college students has shown efficacy in reducing
risky drinking, but it does not currently have content to address cannabis use or co-use of alcohol and
cannabis. Our review of the literature and research in progress reveals there are no studies examining the
efficacy of parent interventions to reduce cannabis use in this age group. The proposed research will address
this omission, curb the problematic trends noted above, and move the field forward by testing a modified
version of our parent-intervention that includes content for parents to have broader discussions about alcohol
and cannabis use (referred to as e-PBI+). To assess interest in the college-level cannabis parent-intervention
materials, we conducted a pilot survey of 40 college health administrators and all 40 indicated that they have a
need for and would implement a parent-intervention that included content on cannabis (see letters of support).
We then conducted a pilot RCT study on the e-PBI+ (versus a control condition) and observed preliminary
evidence that parents found the e-PBI+’s additional cannabis content interesting and useful, conversations with
their students were well received, and more importantly, students were less likely to engage in cannabis use
post-intervention. Taken together, these data provide support for further examination of the e-PBI+. Our
proposed study will use a rigorous RCT design to examine: 1) The efficacy of the e-PBI+ at 3, 6, 9, and 12
months post-baseline relative to an active comparison condition (our evidence-based parent intervention, the
e-PBI), and an attention-matched-control condition (e-AC), on reducing alcohol and cannabis use and
consequences (efficacy; Aim 1); 2) Examine the process by which the e-PBI+ influences parents’ and college
students’ behaviors (mediation; Aim 2); and 3) Examine subgroups for whom the e-PBI+ is more versus less
effective (moderation; Aim 3). To the extent that the research is successful, it will provide an easy to implement
and low-cost parent-intervention that provides new cannabis content for parents to have discussions with their
college-bound teens about alcohol and cannabis."

Former smokers remain at high risk for lung cancer for years after quitting smoking, with at least 3-fold relative
risk compared to never smokers, even 25 years after quitting. More lung cancer cases in the U.S. (50.8%) now
occur in former smokers than in current smokers (36.7%), yet we know little about the relevant biochemical
mechanisms and related potential biomarkers that could ultimately be used to identify those at high risk. This
project proposes to investigate chemical and metabolic biomarkers in former smokers.
The Specific Aims are to:
 1) Perform a clinical study of inhaled [D10]phenanthrene ([D10]Phe) to determine the ratio of urinary
 [D10]phenanthrene tetraol ([D10]PheT) to [D9]phenanthrene phenols ([D9]PhOH) as an indicator of
 increased metabolic activation of PAH in the lungs of former smokers compared to never smokers,
 possibly due to pleural anthracosis (the accumulation of black particles in the lungs of smokers which
 persist in former smokers;
 2) Perform a clinical study of inhaled [13C18]linoleic acid to determine levels of [13C]mercapturic acids of
 acrolein, 4-hydroxynonenal and related α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the urine of former
 smokers compared to never smokers to investigate the hypothesis that pulmonary inflammation leads to
 production of these urinary metabolites;
 3) Quantify the inflammation and oxidative damage-related adducts 1,N6-etheno-dA, 3,N4-etheno-dC, ɣ-OH-
 propano-dG, and 8-oxo-dG in DNA from oral cells and leukocytes of former smokers compared to never
 smokers; and
 4) Working together with Core B, quantify biomarkers of potential harm - myeloperoxidase activity in
 plasma, IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein levels in serum, and urinary levels of 8-epi-PGF2α and
 prostaglandin E metabolite (PGEM) in former and never smokers. Serum levels of α-tocopherol,
 protective against lung cancer, will also be quantified.
Collaborative studies with Projects 1 and 3 are also proposed. These innovative studies are expected to
provide important new insights on lung cancer mechanisms in former smokers and potentially identify new
biomarkers of lung cancer susceptibility."

10919076,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Aspero Medical is developing an innovative, highly flexible balloon overtube access
device (BOAD) to increase the adoption and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and improve
endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Clinically, ESD is a rapidly emerging
approach that is preferred over EMR for the removal of cancerous and precancerous lesions in the upper GI
(i.e., esophagus and stomach) because it offers a higher en bloc resection rate (91.7% vs. 46.7%), a higher R0
resection rate (80.3% vs. 42.3%), and a much lower recurrence rate (0.9% vs. 12.2%). Despite these
advantages, longer procedure time, higher risk of perforation, and technical challenges of using the required
tools leads many interventional endoscopists to choose the easier EMR technique over the superior ESD
technique. This disconnect between clinical benefit and clinical practice presents an opportunity to dramatically
improve patient care by increasing the adoption of a well-established, evidence-based technique through a new
enabling device. In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, Aspero proposes to design and test the BOAD to increase the
adoption of ESD, completing development through preclinical testing and design freeze, in preparation for
verification and validation and ultimately submission of a 510(k) application for FDA clearance. This project builds
on Aspero’s prior work, which demonstrated an innovative Pillar textured balloon overtube reduces slippage
during endoscopy procedures in the small bowel, increasing endoscope stability. The project also builds on
Aspero’s innovative C-Tube device, which is the first colonoscopy tool to incorporate an additional working
channel with rotational and positional control for the use of a second tool. Adapting these innovations for use in
the upper GI and combining them with integrated handle controls is expected to deliver a device that mitigates
the disadvantages of ESD and increases adoption of the procedure to improve patient outcomes. AIM 1. Produce
an integrated balloon and overtube shaft design with independent working channel and user-defined handle
controls for upper GI use. Milestone: Deliver a device with integrated handle controls that accommodates multiple
endoscope sizes, stabilizes the surgical field, incorporates a second working channel for concurrent tool use,
allows for independent rotation of the overtube and endoscope, and incorporates micro-positional controls for a
tool in the second working channel. AIM 2. Advance BOAD to design freeze in preparation for verification,
validation, and FDA submission. Milestones: Confirm user acceptance and clinical utility of the device in an in
vivo simulated use analysis. IMPACT—At completion of this project, Aspero will be positioned to then complete
verification and validation testing of the BOAD through Phase IIb and/or external support, which will facilitate
510(k) submission. Real-world use is expected to reduce ESD procedure time, reduce the risk of perforations,
and increase adoption by interventional endoscopists. Increased adoption of ESD is expected to reduce the
recurrence rate for lesions in the upper GI, resulting in increased overall and progression-free survival."
10919079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an urgent need for the development of new approaches to treat patients suffering from cystic fibrosis
(CF). CF results in a poor quality of life and a median life expectancy in the U.S. of only ~46 years of age, despite
a number of available drugs. In CF, persisting chronic lung infections with severe acute pulmonary exacerbations
and non-resolving airway hyper-inflammation driven by lung neutrophilia result in tissue damage and the
irreversible decline of lung function. We have recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of low dose
exogenous carbon monoxide (CO) in preclinical CF models, by reducing inflammation without compromising
immune function.
To date, inhaled CO gas (iCO) and CO bound to carrier molecules (CORMs) have been the modalities of choice
in the majority of animal and clinical studies, and the safety and tolerability of low dose CO has been
demonstrated in 22 successful Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, including in patients with pulmonary conditions
such as ARDS and COPD. However, iCO and CORMS are not expected to be pharmaceutically acceptable and
viable therapeutic options in CF patients due to, for iCO, the risk of accidental inhalation exposure from the
presence of compressed CO gas cylinders and imprecise dosing, especially in CF patients that have limited and
variable respiratory function, and, for CORMs, problematic release kinetics and toxicological concerns with
carrier molecules. The objective of the proposed project is to investigate HBI-002, a novel oral low dose CO drug
product that enables the use of low dose CO in CF.
HBI-002 is an oral liquid drug product containing CO. Dosing and follow up in a Phase 1 clinical study under IND
in healthy adult subjects with HBI-002 have been completed demonstrating safety and appropriate
pharmacokinetics as measured by Cmax, though final data analysis is ongoing. The next step in development is
to demonstrate that HBI-002 is effective in clinically relevant animal models of CF as has been shown with other
forms of CO and to better understand the potential mechanism(s) of action. Based upon the substantial literature
of CO in chronic inflammatory conditions and our findings in CF models, our central hypothesis that will be tested
in this project is: HBI-002 will reduce neutrophilic pathological inflammation in the CF lung without
compromising the immune response to infection in experimental mouse models of CF."

Stroke is a global health crisis, ranking as the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke is
estimated to cause over 6.5 million deaths and 143 million lost years of healthy life per annum. Occurring every 3
seconds on average, stroke is urgent and debilitating. It is a key contributor to long-term disability and ranks fifth
in US mortality. Stroke arises from blocked or bleeding blood vessels in the brain, with about 87% being ischemic
strokes. Building on successful Phase I and II STTR projects, this research explores a groundbreaking approach
to stroke treatment. It involves intermittent administration of Xenon-Liposome (XKS07) for acute ischemic stroke
(AIS). This strategy, inducing natural brain protection and extending reperfusion therapy's window, demonstrates
multifaceted benefits including epigenetic-influences on long-term recovery. Zymo Research Corporation will
partner with UTHealth as well as consultants at RTI and Contract Research Organization WuXi AppTec to carry
out the research. The goal is to develop this formulation and strategy through IND-enabling studies for FDA pre-
IND discussion and proceed to the IND application. Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1 is to finish the validation of
lead product in clinical translational models through SA 1a: Dose range finding (DRF) study; SA 1b: Identify and
validate the Maximum effective dose (MaxED) in two clinically relevant stroke models; SA 1c: Develop and validate
a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for Xe dose allometric scaling. Once the lead product is
validated, we will partner with the RTI Drug Development and Regulatory group for Specific Aim 2 to complete the
FDA pre-IND briefing document and have a pre-IND meeting through SA 2a: Draft toxicology study protocol. SA
2b: Draft Phase 1 Clinical Trial protocol; and SA 2c: FDA pre-IND meeting to review and obtain feedback on the
design of toxicology, product manufacture, and quality controls needed to initiate human studies. Once the pre-
IND meeting is completed, we will conduct Specific Aim 3 for IND enabling, preparation, and filing through SA 3a:
implement a quality management system for pharmaceutical cGMP production of XKS07; SA 3b: Complete GLP
toxicology studies; we will work with RTI and WuXi AppTec on SA 3c: Prepare and file the IND with the FDA. Once
the IND is approved, we will proceed to Phase I and II clinical trials. This project signifies a crucial step in
addressing stroke management gaps and advancing cerebroprotection in acute stroke therapy."
10919324,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) driven by oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
including mutant EGFR and ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion proteins represent ~25% of LUAD and exhibit
impressive responses to precision targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, significant heterogeneity
in response to TKI therapy exists between patients as manifested by variation in depth of response (DepOR),
characterized as “residual disease” burden, as well as the duration of the therapeutic response (i.e., time to
progression (TTP) or progression-free survival (PFS)). A deep cellular and molecular understanding of the
variation in TKI responsiveness among oncogene-driven LUAD subsets is predicted to inform novel pathways
that may be manipulated for therapeutic gain in these cancers. Inhibitors of the PD1/PD-L1-axis are now integral
to lung cancer treatment, but are ineffective in subsets of LUAD driven by oncogenic RTKs, even when PD-L1
positive. Based on their lack of response to immunotherapies and lower mutation burden, it is tempting to
consider host immunity as irrelevant to RTK-driven LUAD subsets and the therapeutic actions of TKIs. However,
our published and preliminary findings and an emerging literature demonstrate that host immune cells are
significant contributors to the therapeutic benefit of precision oncology agents. We reported that EGFR-targeted
TKIs induce an interferon gamma (IFN) transcriptional response program as well as increased T cell signatures,
both of which positively associate with longer TTP in EGFR-mutant LUAD patients. Moreover, studies with
pretreatment biopsies from ALK+ lung tumors reveal an association of myeloid cell-neutrophil content and
shortened PFS. Finally, using novel murine orthotopic models of EGFR and ALK+ LUAD, we demonstrate that
the durability of TKI therapeutic responses requires adaptive immunity. The precise role of adaptive and innate
immune cells in oncogene-targeted drug action represents a significant knowledge gap.
 The proposed studies will use pretreatment and on-treatment lung cancer patient specimens and innovative
orthotopic immunocompetent models driven by oncogenic EGFR, ALK and RET to explore how TKIs alter the
immune microenvironment to regulate therapeutic response. Findings from syngeneic immunocompetent
C57BL/6 hosts reveal pronounced and durable tumor shrinkage responses to TKIs, but reduced DepOR and
rapid progression on continuous treatment when propagated in immune-deficient mice, revealing a critical role
for adaptive immunity. Our proposed studies will address two major knowledge gaps: 1) How does the
composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME), both before and on-treatment, influence the DepOR and
TTP? 2) What are the specific chemokine pathways and immune cell types that positively and negatively
contribute to therapeutic responsiveness? We hypothesize that the observed TKI responses in RTK-driven lung
tumors represent integration of direct TKI growth inhibitory inputs plus varying participation of anti-cancer T cells
and immune-suppressive neutrophils dictated by CXCL9/10 and CXCL1/2 chemokine pathways. To test this
hypothesis, these specific aims will be completed. Aim 1. Define immune cell content in EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and
RET+ patient specimens and test the association with clinical response (TTP, DepOR). Aim 2. Use orthotopic
murine EGFR, ALK and RET+ tumor models to define specific immune cell types that positively and negatively
contribute to the overall TKI therapeutic response. Aim 3. Specific chemokine pathways as mediators of the
baseline and TKI-regulated immune microenvironment will be defined."

The Gene Expression and Manipulation Module is focused on providing support, and assisting and facilitating
specific studies relating to gene expression and manipulation. Most of the types of studies we support fall within
the range of ocular molecular biology, biochemistry and cell biology. This includes evaluating, quantitatively, the
temporal effects of treatments, conditions or disease states on the expression levels, mRNA and protein, of
genes in ocular tissues. We also support studies focused on determining the effects of individual gene
manipulation on ocular processes and cells. This includes knockdown of specific gene expression levels in cells
or tissues by RNAi silencing, increases in specific gene expression by overexpression, and modulation of activity
or function of specific genes by expressing modified forms, e.g. by transfecting or infecting genetic mutant,
dominant negative, constitutively active or alternatively spliced gene constructs. Manipulation methods include
construct transfection and viral gene or RNAi delivery via infection with recombinant viral constructs. Expression
studies using PCR Arrays and cis element promoter studies are also facilitated. We have recently been assisting
investigators with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing studies aimed at disease modeling with the intention of future
disease related modifications and stem cell manipulation. We have and maintain instrumentation that supports
these types of studies. We have experience with all of these methods and will facilitate and assist core users
with any that they deem of value to their investigations. In addition to providing this service to NEI-funded

10903653,"Project Summary:
Pain is the most common clinical complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) from infancy through adulthood.
Individuals with SCD experience severe, recurrent acute pain during a vaso-occlusive episode (VOE) that can
last for days. Patients also develop lifelong chronic pain at steady state that occurs in addition to ongoing acute
pain episodes. The acute and chronic pain in SCD is currently treated almost entirely with opioids, which have
serious adverse side effects, addiction risk, and in some cases fail to completely alleviate pain or even
exacerbate it further. The mechanistic causes of the intense, episodic pain that drives patients to seek
emergency health care have been minimally investigated and present a major gap in understanding and
treating acute SCD pain. Moreover, the causes of chronic SCD pain at steady state are insufficiently
understood. Our proposal will tackle these critical gaps by using data derived from patients with SCD to drive
our hypotheses that will be directly tested in a preclinical SCD mouse model. Metabolomic analysis of patient
plasma showed that free heme was elevated in patients with SCD at steady state compared to healthy
controls. Consistent with this, our preliminary data in SCD mice showed that scavenging heme with the heme
binding protein haptoglobin alleviated steady state hypersensitivity. Furthermore, plasma taken from patients
with SCD seeking acute pain care showed that TNFα gene transcription was highly increased in a reporter cell
line. Consistent with this, our preliminary data in SCD mice showed that inhibition of TNFα using the FDA-
approved TNFα antibody infliximab completely alleviated VOE-associated mechanical hypersensitivity. Taken
together, these compelling data support our hypotheses that free heme instigates chronic, steady state pain in
SCD through direct access to the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), while TNFα drives acute VOE-associated SCD
pain. Furthermore, we hypothesize that both free heme and TNFα also mediate persistent and acute pain,
respectively, by initiating immune cell infiltration into DRG sensory neurons that contribute to their sensitization.
By exploring these mechanisms in the context of SCD pain, we may uncover novel therapeutic targets that
provide more effective analgesia and avoid the harmful effects of prominently prescribed opioid therapy used
for SCD pain. These studies may also reveal more about pain mechanisms present in other pain conditions
where heme and TNFα are also dysregulated, including fibromyalgia, spinal disc herniation, arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis."
10921230,"One in four older persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) report at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime,
and the risk of death by suicide is 100 times higher in PLWHA than in the general population. In the United
States, there are approximately 1.2 million PLWHA, and 35% are adults aged 55 and over. Older PLWHA
experience unique combinations of stressors including externalized and internalized stigma from advanced age
and disease status. Despite the increased risk and unique risk factors older PLWHA have for suicide mortality,
there have been no interventions developed specifically for this population to address suicide risk. Dialectical
Behavioral Therapy (DBT) shows significant impact at reducing suicidal behaviors by improving one’s self-
efficacy to manage negative emotions. To our knowledge, DBT has never been evaluated with PLWHA for
suicide prevention, representing a critical gap in the science. Innovative solutions to mental health care, such
as AI-powered chatbots, have also not been studied extensively in older PLWHA. The objective of this R34
Intervention Development and Pilot grant proposal is to adapt DBT Skills and Coaching for suicide prevention
in older PLWHA to be delivered via brief videos and Angel. Angel is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered
conversational agent developed by CareAngel, a company that leverages cutting edge AI and natural language
processing technology. We plan to adapt existing evidence-based DBT skills videos and add coaching support
from Angel in a 6-week intervention with older PLWHA. This proposal has the following specific aims: Phase 1:
Adaptation: Aim 1) To adapt DBT Skills and Coaching for PLWHA seeking care in infectious disease practices
to be delivered via Angel. Phase 2: Pilot feasibility and preliminary efficacy RCT with n=50 PLWHA: Aim 2) To
establish the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the adapted DBT Skills and Coaching intervention
through key metrics of use, survey item responses, and qualitative interviews surrounding barriers and
facilitators to use with patients enrolled in the intervention. Aim 3) To explore the preliminary efficacy, relative
to usual care control, of DBT skills videos and Angel-delivered DBT Coaching on the target mechanism, self-
efficacy to manage negative emotions, as well as exploratory clinical outcomes including suicide outcomes,
mood, and medical treatment adherence. This proposed work is of high scientific and public health significance
for numerous reasons: 1.) older PLWHA have elevated suicide risk. 2.) there is a paucity of suicide prevention
intervention research for PLWHA. 3.) while Dialectical Behavioral Therapy has been studied in over 30
randomized controlled trials with demonstrated efficacy to improve psychological outcomes in diverse
populations, to our knowledge, this intervention has never been piloted with older PLWHA. 4.) Innovative
solutions to mental health care, such as AI-powered chatbots + videos, have not been studied in older
PLWHA, thus this proposal represents an exciting opportunity to fill critical gaps in the literature on potentially
scalable, implementable, and effective approaches to suicide prevention in PLWHA."
10927179,"Background: Lithium (LI) and clozapine (CLOZ) are the most evidence-based medications for preventing fatal

serious side effects (SSEs). The VA is conducting a large randomized trial of LI for SB, and VA program
offices are considering encouraging greater LI and CLOZ use. This study features a comprehensive database
analysis and national survey to gather data to maximize the success of any effort to expand LI and CLOZ use.
Specific Aims: 1) Rapidly Assess the Current Safety of LI & CLOZ & Identify Opportunities for Expanded Use;
2) Refine Knowledge about the Timing of SSE Risks and the Implications for Clinical Care; 3) Examine Use
Across Providers & Identify Perceived Barriers / Facilitators to LI and CLOZ use; and 4) Integrate Results &
Develop Policy Recommendations, Provider Guide, & Communication Tool.
Significance: This study will markedly advance knowledge about how to safely use LI and CLOZ. These
advances will include identifying the safest populations to target for expanded use, and how to best manage
patients once LI and CLOZ are started. Understanding will be obtained about barriers besides SSEs that may
impede wider LI and CLOZ use, and input will be obtained from providers on how to surmount these barriers.
Findings will be integrated in several ways, including synthesis into a useful guide and communication tool.
Priority Area(s): Suicide Prevention, Mental & Behavioral Health, and Predictive Analytics.
Uniqueness: No prior study has examined the SSEs of LI or CLOZ as comprehensively, evaluated prevention
and treatment strategies as thoroughly, or condensed its findings into tools for providers and patients.
Methodology: Aim 1: Cox Regressions with Propensity Scores stratification will be used to facilitate the rapid
estimation of risks associated in patient groups possessing plausible SSE risks factors (e.g., particular medical,
psychiatric, or substance use diagnoses). Aim 2: Cox regression with marginal structural models will evaluate
the emergence and development of risks over time, seeking to identify clinically-useful “Decision Points”, and
incidence rates will be derived to promote patient-provider communication regarding SSEs. Survey: A brief
nationwide mental health prescriber survey focused on Barriers and Facilitators to Lithium use. Open
response survey components will help ensure that any unanticipated barriers or facilitators to LI or CLOZ use
will likely be identified. An all-cause mortality analysis and an example Predictive Model will help integrate
results, as will an Advisory Board. A user-friendly Provider Guide and Patient-Provider Communication Tool
will be developed.
Expected Results: For LI and CLOZ, we expect to find some patient groups at lower risk than others for SSEs
(e.g., male patients may be at lower risk for renal effects). We also expect immediate release LI to be
associated with less renal risk. For CLOZ, we expect treatment of weight or metabolic risks at initiation to be
beneficial. We also expect to find a “trial window” during which risks of SSEs are fairly negligible, which may
increase the willingness of patients to try LI or CLOZ. We expect the survey to find that SSEs are perceived as
barriers to use, but also other barriers (e.g. a preference for medications without monitoring requirements).
Next Steps: The study is expected to yield immediate policy recommendations (e.g., patient groups to target or
not in any prescribing initiative) and valuable tools, since results are so directly transferable to patient care.
Next steps might include immediate efforts by program offices to expand Li or CLOZ use. Alternatively, an
implementation trial or staggered implementation could be initiated. Pilot testing of real-time risk calculators or
qualitative studies of patient, provider or other key informant attitudes towards LI and CLOZ could also occur.
Other Areas: This study will also support the safe use of these uniquely-valuable medications in non-suicidal
patients. The survey findings will provide data that may inform future Provider Behavior interventions."
11031350,"Background: Lithium (LI) and clozapine (CLOZ) are the most evidence-based medications for preventing fatal
and nonfatal suicidal behavior (SB). Unfortunately, both medications also can cause numerous medically
serious side effects (SSEs). The VA is conducting a large randomized trial of LI for SB, and VA program
offices are considering encouraging greater LI and CLOZ use. This study features a comprehensive database
analysis and national survey to gather data to maximize the success of any effort to expand LI and CLOZ use.
Specific Aims: 1) Rapidly Assess the Current Safety of LI & CLOZ & Identify Opportunities for Expanded Use;
2) Refine Knowledge about the Timing of SSE Risks and the Implications for Clinical Care; 3) Examine Use
Across Providers & Identify Perceived Barriers / Facilitators to LI and CLOZ use; and 4) Integrate Results &
Develop Policy Recommendations, Provider Guide, & Communication Tool.
Significance: This study will markedly advance knowledge about how to safely use LI and CLOZ. These
advances will include identifying the safest populations to target for expanded use, and how to best manage
patients once LI and CLOZ are started. Understanding will be obtained about barriers besides SSEs that may

10927180,"Background: Suicide is an urgent public health crisis, and transitioning Veterans (those who have recently
separated from the military) are a high-risk group for suicide. A key component to advancing suicide prevention
efforts among at-risk Veterans is to address low levels of help-seeking and engagement in treatment, including
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. Veterans are most likely to disclose suicidal thoughts to their close
supports—family members, friends, and their peers. However, Veterans and their close supports rarely receive
training in how to help a peer at risk of suicide, despite strong interest in such training. Gatekeeper training is a
key strategy with potential to help address these challenges. Gatekeeper training teaches “gatekeepers” skills
in how to identify a Veteran with suicide risk, inquire about suicidal thoughts, and help make a connection to
professional treatment; it may benefit the trainee’s own mental health too. PsychArmor S.A.V.E. is a brief,
novel online gatekeeper training that was created in partnership with VA and is designed for Veterans and their
close supports.
Significance/Impact: This project focuses on VA’s topic clinical priority, suicide prevention. The 2019 VA and
Department of Defense Clinical Practice Guidelines also identified gatekeeper training as an important
research gap and priority for future research. Finally, our research design addresses three separate goals and
objectives contained in VA’s National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide, including involvement of
Veterans’ close supports.
Innovation: This proposal employs the novel approach of recruiting Veterans and their close supports through
online social media advertisements, allowing for broad outreach, suicide prevention targeting Veterans outside
the VA network, and the potential to test the effectiveness of gatekeeper training on a large scale. Online
gatekeeper trainings are highly scalable public health strategies with the potential to diffuse through online
social networks.
Specific Aims: Our primary objective is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of the online gatekeeper training PsychArmor S.A.V.E. To reach this objective we
will achieve these aims: 1) Determine the feasibility of recruiting participants via social media, engaging them
to participate in an online gatekeeper training program, and retaining them in an online intervention study; and
2) Determine the acceptability of PsychArmor S.A.V.E. in a pilot RCT, and evaluate measures for use in a
future larger-scale RCT.
Methodology: This is a two-arm pilot randomized clinical trial involving 200 participants. We will recruit
participants through social media advertisements targeting transitioning Veterans and their close supports
(family and friends). Participants will be randomized to take the PsychArmor S.A.V.E. gatekeeper training or a
“sham” control training and followed for 6 months. Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to
assess outcomes on feasibility and acceptability. Additional data collection and analysis of measures related to
suicide prevention, such as gatekeeper behaviors, knowledge, stigma, self-efficacy, and social norms
measures will help prepare for a larger-scale RCT.
Implementation/Next Steps: By using an extremely scalable intervention and building off existing VA
practices and partnerships, this project will be very well-positioned for further evaluation and implementation
into VA practice if found to be effective. It is freely available online, making it highly amenable to being rapidly
taken to scale. Results of this project will inform future efforts to disseminate and/or revise PsychArmor
S.A.V.E."
10927181,"Background: Despite accessible and effective suicide prevention strategies offered by the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), Veteran suicide remains elevated compared to the general US population, indicating a
continued need to identify Veterans at risk for suicide and provide interventions to prevent suicide. Suicide
prevention can be enhanced when health care systems integrate dynamic social determinants of health (SDH),
such as housing instability, justice involvement, and unemployment.
Significance/Impact: The goal of this HSR&D Veteran Suicide Prevention project is to address prevention
activities that occur “upstream” by examining how services addressing SDH may also prevent suicide among
Veterans, key objectives in the VA’s National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide 2018–2028.
Innovation: This study will integrate a public health perspective to suicide prevention through a lens of SDH.
Rather than focusing specifically on medical intervention, this study will explore—based both on a natural
experimental design using existing administrative data and on gathering the perspectives of key informants
and Veterans—how addressing SDH can decrease suicide risk, taking into account the complex needs of
Veterans who may be at risk for suicide.
Specific Aims: This study aims to determine whether VHA services tailored to address SDH may also have an
added benefit of preventing suicide mortality; identify organizational assets and opportunities to improve how
SDH-focused services address suicide risk among Veterans; and engage Veterans in identifying ways to
integrate suicide prevention into VHA programs that respond to SDH.
Methodology: The proposed research is a concurrent mixed methods design. Retrospective quantitative
analyses will examine how VHA services tailored to Veterans’ SDH (i.e., housing instability, justice
involvement, unemployment) may protect against suicide mortality and morbidity. A mixed methods
environmental scan will include a questionnaire of staff/key informants and qualitative interviews. Qualitative
interviews with Veterans with a history of suicide risk will explore how services to address SDH respond to
those needs.
Implementation/Next Steps: This project will lead to actionable implementation projects: increased linkages
to services for SDH among Veterans with histories of suicidal crisis as well as enhanced training for providers
to integrate suicide prevention into services addressing SDH, and vice versa. We have convened an array of
VA operations partners—Social Work, VHA Homeless and Justice Programs, employment programs, and VA
Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention—to facilitate removing siloes around SDH and suicide
prevention in VA, amplifying VA’s current infrastructure to bolster suicide prevention."

10927183,"Background: Serious mental illnesses are common, disabling, challenging to treat, and require years
of monitoring with adjustments in treatments. Stress or reduced medication adherence can lead to rapid
worsening in symptoms and functioning with consequences that include relapse, job loss, homelessness,
incarceration, hospitalization and suicide. In usual care, clinician visits are infrequent, with intervals ranging
from monthly to yearly. Communication between patients and clinicians between visits is challenging and often
nonexistent. Patient illness exacerbations and relapses generally occur with little or no clinician awareness in
real time, leaving little opportunity to adjust treatments.
 Significance/Impact: For the large population of Veterans with serious mental illness, tools are
needed that passively monitor their mental health status, allowing them to self-track their behaviors, quickly
detect worsening of mental health, and support prompt assessment and intervention. At least 60% of Veterans
with serious mental illness use a smart phone. These generate data that characterize sociability, activity, and
sleep. Changes in these behaviors are warning signs of relapse. Passive self-tracking could be used to identify
and predict worsening of illness in real time.
 Innovation: Passive mobile sensing is a novel approach to illness self-tracking and monitoring. There
has been relatively little research on passive self-tracking in serious mental illness, with limited analytics
development in this area, and none in VA.
 Specific Aims: This project studies passive mobile sensing with Veterans in treatment for serious
mental illness. Data are used for self-tracking of behaviors and symptoms. While passive mobile sensing has
been feasible, acceptable and safe in patients with serious mental illness, these are studied for the first time in
VA. Analytics are developed that use passive data to predict behaviors and symptoms. This project responds to
the HSR&D priority areas of Mental Health and Healthcare Informatics. The project has these objectives:
 1. Conduct user-centered design of passive mobile self-tracking to support Veterans’ management of
their mental health.
 2. Study the feasibility, acceptability and safety of passive self-tracking of mental health that includes
feedback of mental health status to the Veteran.
 3. Use mobile sensor and phone utilization data to develop individualized estimates of sociability,
activities, and sleep as measured by weekly interviews.
 4. Study the predictive value of using data on sociability, activities, and sleep to identify exacerbations
of psychiatric symptoms.
 Methodology: Activities can be assessed with data on movement, location, and habits. Sociability can
be assessed with data on communication and public interactions. Sleep can be assessed using data on light,
sound, movement, and phone use. Investigators on this project developed “mWellness,” a functional mobile
app that monitors and transmits mobile sensor and utilization data. Focus groups and in-lab usability testing
will inform further app and intervention development. Mixed methods research will study deployment in
Veterans who passively self-track their behaviors and psychiatric symptoms. If this project meets intended
goals, the VA will have a mobile analytics platform that continuously monitors the behaviors and symptoms of
patients with serious mental illness.
 Next Steps/Implementation: Results inform development of a study of the effectiveness and
implementation of these methods to improve Veteran assessment, treatment and outcomes. Results are also
applicable to other populations with mental health risk and to the use of similar methods in usual care."

Mayo Clinic is one of the largest not-for-profit, academic health systems, top-ranked for quality more often than
any other health care organization. It has integrated operations in 5 U.S. states, and more than 1 million people
came to Mayo Clinic for care last year. Clinical and translational science (CTS) is a fundamental and highly
valued element of Mayo Clinic; indeed, all research at Mayo Clinic is directed towards translation of scientific
knowledge to improve patient care, with almost 60% of our NIH funding base classified as clinical research or
trials. In recognition of the importance of continued advances in CTS to the Mayo Clinic mission, our institutional
leadership has entrusted the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCaTS) to be the engine
of translational innovation and the institutional advocate for CTS and translational research. CCaTS has served
as a CTS innovation incubator for numerous efforts that were created with CCaTS funding and are now
supported by the institution. The overall vision of CCaTS is to enable high-quality, team-based multidisciplinary
research that accelerates clinical trial innovation, facilitates digital health transformation, and partners with our
stakeholders and communities to improve patient care and health for all people. Our team-based culture has
been described as one of “boundarylessness,” wherein organizational barriers are removed to enable talent,
innovation, and knowledge to converge where needed. In this context and that of our longstanding commitment
to patient-focused research, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we
will simplify and accelerate the work of translation to improve health for all by advancing clinical trial innovations
and digital health transformations, streamlining methods and processes, and developing novel informatics
solutions that increase efficiency and drive implementation of discoveries that improve health and promote health
equity. In Aim 2, we will enhance our education programs through the expanded reach of competency-based,
learner-focused solutions, training a diverse, inclusive, multidisciplinary CTS workforce to be prepared to address
the urgent health care needs of all communities in a rapidly changing environment. In Aim 3, we will engage
local community members and patients to be active partners in translational teams, expanding research
capabilities of underserved communities, including rural populations. Our goal is to improve health and reduce
health inequities by helping these communities realize the benefits of CTS. In Aim 4, we will expand national
and regional partnerships and strengthen collaborative CTS networks in all aspects of CTS and education,
focusing on sharing innovative approaches and prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, with the goal of
improving human health and advancing health equity. In summary, sustained investment in CCaTS will enable
us to continue to meet ongoing and emergent challenges in health care for all, as exemplified by our response
to support communities through the COVID-19 crisis.
Evolving Strategies for PD: Investigating STN DBS as a Neuroprotective Intervention
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severely debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 10 million
people worldwide with approximately $52 billion spent yearly in the United States. Presently, there is no cure for
PD and potential neuroprotective strategies failed to properly delay the evolution of the disease. For this reason,
the prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years and it is estimated that the number of PD cases will
surpass 13 million in 2040 unless more effective neuroprotective therapeutics are brought to clinical use. Deep
brain stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN DBS), a surgical intervention in mid- to advanced-stage PD,
may represent a safe and effective neuroprotective strategy for PD based on encouraging results from animal
research. Establishment of STN DBS as an approved neuroprotective strategy requires rigorous translational
research that builds on basic science research of the neuroprotective mechanism of DBS to allow therapy
optimization in the clinical scenario. Here, we adopt a translational approach to characterize the mechanisms
whereby STN DBS promotes neuroprotection and delays the progression of the disease while identifying
conditions that can maximize its neuroprotective effects. In Aim 1 we will use a rat model of PD to determine the
molecular and network-wide targets of STN DBS and their relative contribution to delay neurodegeneration. In
Aim 2 we will deliver electrical stimulation directly to cells that overexpress α-synuclein, a toxic protein that
aggregates and can lead to neuronal loss in PD to determine effective stimulation parameters that successfully
enhance key neuroprotective mechanisms. In summary, these aims will move the neuromodulation and
neurodegeneration fields forward by characterizing intricate molecular, cellular, and network-wide
neuroprotective mechanisms of STN DBS while providing a novel translational framework to allow further therapy
optimization for clinical application."

Quantifying when antiviral activity of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or novel broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs) wane in people with HIV during treatment interruption is critical to develop therapies to cure HIV.
Further, in curative therapeutic trials, determining effects of bnAbs against virus as opposed to a potential
immune-driven “vaccinal” effect, is essential to evaluating long-lasting post treatment efficacy. Here we
propose to leverage existing data and technologies to quantify ART in plasma, cells in circulating blood, and
tissue from an observation ART interruption study, to quantify how waning levels of ART alone are related to
viral rebound and changes in reservoirs in the same samples (Aim 1). Then, we will quantify antiviral activity of
bnAbs in human tonsil tissue cells and use this to inform the relative contribution of antiviral activity as
opposed to another immune-mediated effect during a clinical intervention study using the same bnAb (Aim 2).
These aims will provide essential knowledge surrounding viral rebound during ART interruption including
optimal timing to assess therapeutic efficacy and determine if the postulated “vaccinal” effects of bnAbs exist.
This work with inform design of future clinical trials for HIV cure but will also have broad implications for HIV
treatment and prevention."
10916813,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of this PPG is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate local calcium (Ca2+)
signaling in normal and failing hearts with unprecedented precision. There are three goals shared by the four
projects: 1) explore the precise role of adrenergic signaling in modulating calcium in normal and failing hearts;
2) define novel mechanisms of interactions between T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium channels;
3) develop new understandings of genetic based mechanisms of inherited forms of CV disease involving calcium.
Project four provides the essential link to SR calcium release by studying the structure-function relationships of
the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium release channel present on the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic
reticula (SR/ER) of many cell types in the context of heart failure (chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction,
HFrEF). RyR2 channels are required for Ca2+ release from intracellular stores that triggers excitation-contraction
(EC) coupling in the cardiac muscle. Inherited RyR2 mutations can cause arrhythmias including exercise-induced
sudden death or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and stress-induced post-
translational modifications of RyR2 contribute to heart failure (HF) progression. In both cases RyR2 channels
are leaky either due to inherited mutations (CPVT) or acquired post-translational modifications (HF). Unanswered
questions include: 1) can (and if so how) RyR2 mutations can cause HF; 2) what is the precise mechanism by
which PKA phosphorylation activates RyR2 and plays a role in HF? Preliminary data using cryo-EM to solve the
structure of human RyR2 at ~2.4 Å show that a human CPVT mutation RyR2-R2474S puts the channel into a
“primed state” from which it can be readily and pathologically activated at low, normally non-activating [Ca2+]cyt
explaining why these channels are leaky and cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias during exercise or stress. The
Rycal drug ARM210 binds to RyR2 and restores the mutant channel back to a stable closed state preventing
leak and arrhythmias. The applicant hypothesizes that RyR2 missense mutations, 14 of which are found in
patients with a ClinVar prediction of cardiomyopathy in patients from the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR), a
unique cohort of individuals with extensive phenotype data and high rates of consanguinity, (Core A), may be
gain of function (GoF) mutations that also put the channel into a primed state which is even more sensitive to
activation compared to the CPVT mutations. Thus, these patients have leaky RyR2 channels and develop HF
due to depletion of SR Ca2+ resulting in impaired cardiac contractility. These questions will be addressed using
functional and structural assays and using a novel drug, Rycal (ARM210), that fixes the RyR2 mediated SR
Ca2+ leak via a well-defined mechanism. Three aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate changes in the function and
structure of RyR2 GoF missense variants linked to heart failure (HFrEF); 2) Evaluate the effect of Rycal on the
structure/function of human RyR2 and disease related variants; and 3) Examine the molecular mechanism by
which adrenergic signaling regulates RyR2 function in normal and failing hearts."
10916626,"ABSTRACT
We propose a treatment to overcome infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) via a new
mechanism of action: “quorum sensing inhibition”. MRSA is the most prevalent opportunistic pathogen implicated
in burn wounds and once a sufficient number of bacteria colonize a wound (i.e., a “quorum”), they communicate
via the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) pathway to upregulate virulence factor production and invasion via cell-
cell signaling. Halting this communication (i.e., quorum sensing inhibition) is a powerful means of hamstringing
MRSA virulence, and thereby augmenting host immune response, that does not rely on traditional antibiotics. w-
Hydroxyemodin is a new natural product (fungal secondary metabolite) that we have recently demonstrated
provides robust quorum sensing inhibition when administered topically. To deliver w-hydroxyemodin topically,
we propose to use a novel, sprayable hydrogel-based burn wound dressing: the HydrAid Wound Dressing. This
dressing is sprayed-on easily and quickly, gelling in situ to form a soft, elastic and mechanically robust hydrogel
dressing significantly faster than commercial hydrogel sheets (or other Advanced Dressings) can be applied
(especially over complex surfaces, e.g., hands, feet, elbows). To change the dressing, a dissolution solution is
applied that dissolves the gel within minutes thereby alleviating or averting altogether the mechanical peeling
and unintentional debridement that cause intractable pain and trauma for patients and caregivers alike. Thus,
the w-hydroxyemodin-loaded HydrAid dressing overcomes the dual challenges of bacterial infection and patient
pain common to the majority of 2nd degree burn wounds. Importantly, this combination product is intended as an
adjuvant to current antibiotic regimens. While future clinical success may warrant investigation as a monother-
apy, until such time, due to the polymicrobial nature of wound infections and the fact that not all pathogens utilize
the Agr pathway, combination with traditional antibiotics will be a clinical necessity. As part of an ongoing Phase
II SBIR (R44 GM125412) we have already established large-scale production of HydrAid dressing material com-
ponents, demonstrated utility (of the unloaded version) in vivo and are manufacturing prototypes and evaluating
pain metrics in a large-animal burn model. For the present application, in which w-hydroxyemodin is loaded in
the HydrAid dressing, we have demonstrated the ability to load and release therapeutically relevant levels of w-
hydroxyemodin and to combat MRSA infections in vivo in mice by augmenting the immune system and reducing
MRSA virulence. This project addresses three key inflection points on the critical path for further development of
this technology, including: Aim 1: Optimize the w-hydroxyemodin-loaded HydrAid wound dressing formulation to
provide sustained release of therapeutic concentrations of w-hydroxyemodin for three days. Aim 2: Determine
the efficacy of the w-hydroxyemodin-loaded HydrAid wound dressing in treating a second-degree burn wound
infected with MRSA in rats. Aim 3: Demonstrate multi-gram scale production of w-hydroxyemodin."

Patients affected by opioid use disorder (OUD) face numerous challenges, ranging from stigma
to policy barriers that impede their access to care. Even after engaging OUD patients in
treatment, retention rates are disappointingly low due to a multitude of factors. Despite the
widespread adoption of virtual counseling and treatment solutions, such as telemedicine
programs using medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), during the COVID-19 pandemic,
addiction treatment still requires in-person visits for regular drug testing. However, this
requirement can lead to non-compliance and being dropped from what is often their only
therapeutic option available. Innovative and FDA-cleared opioid use testing methods that can be
performed outside of laboratory environments address these issues and hold the promise of
increasing retention rates and improving clinical outcomes.
Tenvos’ product will be integrated into a smartphone app, enabling patients to test for opioid use
from the comfort of their home and send instant results to the clinician without the need for an
in-person visit. The proposed solution will not only improve clinical outcomes in the outpatient
OUD treatment setting but can be adopted in many other settings due to its convenience and
can, potentially, unlock new workflows that were not feasible before. The FDA-regulated SaMD
itself, which is a ML-based solution, will be exposed through an API enabling its integration into
a large number of systems and applications. The API can be integrated into virtual health
solutions and provide opioid use assessment real-time during an appointment. It can be
integrated into a wearable device and serve as a remote patient monitoring device that notifies
the treating physician in case of a relapse. It can also be used for population health and risk
stratification by integrating into case management calls at managed care organizations to
identify individuals who may benefit from OUD treatment. The specific aims for the Phase I set
of activities include: Aim 1: Collecting clinical data with gold standard test results and patient
voice samples to study the correlation between them. Aim 2: Validating and fine-tuning the
machine learning models with the collected clinical data. Aim 3: Engaging with the FDA Center
of Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) through a pre-submission process to obtain
feedback on the most appropriate pathway, such as PMA, De Novo, or 510(k)."
10925178,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate. Dr. Gunisha Kaur is an anesthesiologist and medical anthropologist with a background in basic
neuroscience research, two decades of fieldwork with torture survivors, and clinical expertise in pain
management, an anesthesia sub-specialty. She has spent the past five years conducting research on pain
after torture. She has demonstrated that evaluators using only the United Nations Istanbul Protocol (UNIP,
global standard for medical assessment of torture survivors) detected and treated pain 16% of the time as
compared to a pain specialist (gold standard) who identified pain in 85% of subjects. Her use of a validated
pain screen accurately captured all of the pain diagnoses when employed. Dr. Kaur hypothesizes that the
novel application in this population of a validated pain screen, similar to those used for posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MD), can augment the UNIP and improve its sensitivity for pain from
approximately 15% to 90%, as compared to the gold standard. She further proposes an evidence-based
somatic pain treatment model, adapted to feedback from torture survivors on acceptability and practicality.
Career Development Plan. Dr. Kaur's career goals are to become an independent physician-scientist focused
on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain in refugee torture survivors. For this training she will: 1. Acquire
instruction in quantitative methods of pain research, 2. Gain skills in the conduct of complex, mixed-methods

Research. An estimated 87% of torture survivors (27 million people) worldwide suffer chronic somatic pain
related to trauma mechanism, such as brachial plexopathy from suspension by upper extremities or
lumbosacral plexus injury from leg hyperextension. However, a vast majority of this pain is likely undiagnosed
by providers who use only the standard evaluation protocol of torture survivors, the United Nations Istanbul
Protocol. Without evidence-based diagnostic tools and treatment guidelines for use by general providers, the
complex clinical presentation of torture survivors results in somatic pain being confounded by concurrent
psychiatric illness such as PTSD or MD. Rehabilitation from complex trauma is possible, but it requires
considering somatic pain a substantial component of pathology. In Aim 1, a blind comparison to gold standard
study with 100 torture survivors will compare the diagnosis of pain using the standard UNIP versus the UNIP
with the novel application of a validated pain screen. Aim 2 will evaluate the acceptability of somatic pain
treatment using qualitative interviews with 30 torture survivors. Aim 3 will assess the feasibility of recruiting
and retaining subjects in somatic pain treatment, to inform the design of a subsequent clinical trial."
10922631,"Abstract: Understanding molecular mechanisms of diseases and manipulating them to achieve cure
constitutes one of the ""holy Grail"" of biomedical science. Infectious (and parasitic) diseases are responsible
for ~30% of premature deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Studies of the pathogenic agents
require high-resolution and high-sensitivity microscopy and spectroscopy equipment, ideally capable of
detecting single molecules of interest (i.e., DNA bases, proteins on viral capsids, etc.). Scanning near-field
optical microscopy (SNOM) combined with near-field nano-spectroscopy- Tip-Enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(TERS) is the best technology for visualization of such nanoscale details. However, the spatial resolution and
chemical sensitivity levels are currently insufficient to detect and identify single molecules in an ambient
environment (air or liquid). Current methods for the identification of infectious agents rely on traditional
methods that include growing of bacteria and fungi, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and then identification of
the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically (which require the availability of specific antibodies for
ELISA tests and specific DNA primers for PCR). These methods make the identification of newly emerging
pathogens particularly difficult. New approaches to diagnostics are overdue. Actoprobe LLC proposes such an
approach: to develop, validate, and commercialize a novel class of probes for Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM)
based on silicon nitride photonics with a diode laser, a pulse compressor, and a detector, all inside the SPM
probe. The ultimate goal is to dramatically (>10X) increase SNOM's sensitivity and spatial resolution for
rapid identification of infectious agents. With its strong research experience and expertise in TERS and SNOM,
Actoprobe is in an ideal position to address this technical challenge. This new TERS tool's capabilities will allow
studying the biochemical components, morphology, and nanomechanical structures of viruses, bacteria,
and fungi at the single-molecule level, substantially improving early infectious disease detection and
identification. We expect the proposed technology will enable substantially improved early pathogenic disease
agent detection and lead to a marketable, cost-effective diagnostic/identification tool. Our primary customers
will be medical laboratories and clinical research institutions. Phase I will prove the technical feasibility of
developing the ultrasensitive optical SPM probes and testing these probes on several non-pathogenic viruses."
10923275,"Project Summary:
 The Flavivirus genus (referred to as flaviviruses) consists of numerous emerging and re-emerging
global pathogens of critical human significance. Endemic and emerging flaviviruses like dengue virus (DENV),
Powassan virus (POWV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus and Yellow fever
virus continue to spread and cause significant human disease. We have used RNA structural data from a
conserved 3’ untranslated region (UTR) pseudoknot called xrRNA1 to develop an attenuation approach in a
highly conserved structural region of the flavivirus 3’UTR for vaccine development. This approach allows us to
1) swap out flavivirus structural genes in our clone to rapidly develop chimeric, attenuated flavivirus vaccines
for mosquito-borne flaviviruses and 2) provides a conserved site for attenuation for tick-borne flaviviruses like
POWV.
 Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that xrRNA1-mutant, attenuated flavivirus vaccines will
be safe, immunogenic, and provide protection from challenge in murine models of flavivirus disease. The
objective of the proposed studies is to complete pre-clinical development of the attenuated flavivirus vaccine
approaches. We will complete our proposed work in three aims that will evaluate immunologic and virologic
outcomes following virus challenge after vaccination with candidate ZIKV vaccine (Aim 1), DENV vaccine (Aim
2), and POWV vaccine (Aim 3).
 We have recently published our data showing attenuation and immunogenicity of mutant xrRNA1 ZIKV
(X1) in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. In this proposal, we will first evaluate the efficacy of ZIKV X1 vaccine
in pregnant and non-pregnant mice challenged with ZIKV and DENV. These studies will allow us to evaluate
ZIKV vaccine efficacy during pregnancy and evaluate the role of ZIKV vaccination in DENV disease
enhancement. Next, we will use the attenuated, ZIKV vaccine platform developed in our laboratory using
xrRNA1 structural data, insert chimeric pre-membrane and envelope structural genes from DENV1-4 and
evaluate the attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of monovalent and quadrivalent DENV1-4 vaccine
candidates. Given the complexity of DENV infection, we will evaluate disease enhancement and
immunodominance in our quadrivalent vaccines along with efficacy. Third, we will expand our attenuation
strategy in the X1 structure to tick-borne flaviviruses by utilizing our recently defined secondary structure of the
POWV 3’UTR. Using POWV mutant vaccine candidates with targeted mutations in the X1 structure, we will
characterize attenuation, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a POWV vaccine approach in a murine model of
disease. The proposed studies will begin to translate our structural understanding of xrRNAs in the flavivirus
3’UTR into potential vaccine candidates. Moreover, this project will initiate studies focused on developing a
platform for vaccine development for emerging flavivirus infections."

According to the American Diabetes Association, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects at least 30 million
Americans and is a major unmet public health concern with an annual cost in the United States of over $300
billion dollars. Additionally, nearly 25% of the U.S. population is already considered prediabetic, or at high risk of
developing T2D. These individuals are characterized by poor glycemic control as a result of insulin resistance
combined with reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. At the prediabetic or early diabetic
stages, insulin insufficiency is frequently managed by medications that stimulate pancreatic secretion, which is
accompanied by increased levels of human islet amyloid polypeptide, hIAPP (amylin). Native hIAPP in its
monomeric form is a hormone that inhibits glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, and acts as a satiety
agent. However, when hIAPP misfolds, which is common at elevated production, it results in structures called
protofibrils. These protofibrils are soluble, highly toxic, and capable of inducing cell death. The stimulated co-
secretion of hIAPP with insulin leads to a pathologic cycle of increased hIAPP, including misfolded hIAPP, that
leads to β cell toxicity in prediabetics and diabetics. The ensuing deficits in β cell function drive an increased
need for insulin secretion, which is accompanied by further hIAPP secretion. In this sense, T2D is an amyloid-
induced disease as evidenced by the presence of hIAPP plaque deposits in the pancreata of more than 90% of
T2D patients. Developing new therapeutic strategies that target toxic hIAPP protofibrils, inhibit their deposition
as toxic amylin fibrils, and ultimately preserve β cell health is a priority for addressing this major unmet need in
T2D.
Current standard-of-care in T2D is able to provide some control of blood glucose levels, but it fails to address
the  cell decline and its contribution to T2D progression. In this application we propose to advance a novel
therapeutic platform and our lead product from that platform, CM-TS1. CM-TS1 is a monoclonal antibody that
specifically targets protofibrils, soluble conformations of hIAPP for rapid clearance prior to plaque deposition and
 cell destruction. We have already demonstrated that CM-TS1 is capable of binding to these soluble protofibrils
in peripheral blood and in the pancreata of a T2D murine model. We will continue therapeutic development by
first validating our initial finding by demonstrating that CM-TS1 can clear hIAPP in an industry standard preclinical
model leading to a reduction of T2D pathology. Following this in vivo proof-of-concept, we will then advance CM-
TS1 through humanization and into early preclinical development including manufacturability, stable cell line
construction, and non-GLP pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies ultimately culminating in a pre-IND Type B
meeting with the FDA. The milestone of ultimate success will be launching this promising product into future
IND-enabling studies in order to successfully reach the patients that need it the most."
10925237,"Project Summary/Abstract
PTEN is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes across all cancer types. The loss of
PTEN activates PI3K/AKT, which inhibits GSK3β, thereby stabilizing Myc and contributing to oncogenesis. Myc
recruits histone acetyltransferases to increase chromatin accessibility of target genes involved in both cell
proliferation and apoptosis. Among these histone acetyltransferases, the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase
(SAGA) complex preferentially acetylates histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H4 lysine 16 to activate gene
expression. A pan-cancer analysis of mutually exclusive gene inactivation patterns identified a previously
uncharacterized long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as synthetic essential in the context of PTEN deficient cancer.
Preliminary studies suggest that this lncRNA inhibits SAGA-mediated histone acetylation, thereby inhibiting Myc
transactivation of target genes. PTEN and lncRNA double-knockout SF-763 glioma cells showed Myc pathway
enrichment, impaired cell viability, and pronounced aneuploidy, which was not observed in wild-type or single
knockout cell lines. We hypothesize that inhibition of SAGA-mediated acetylation by this lncRNA inhibits Myc
transactivation of pro-apoptotic target genes and Myc-driven endoreduplication, thereby promoting cancer
survival. This proposal will investigate the potential of targeting the poorly studied non-coding genome for cancer
treatment, advance our knowledge of the role of histone acetylation on cancer genomic stability (widely targeted
using genotoxic drugs and radiotherapy), and describe a novel mechanism for the regulation of Myc's dual
functions in proliferation and apoptosis. We will verify lncRNA expression in cell lines from various cancer types
and in clinical samples to validate the pan-cancer relevance and translational potential of this study, respectively.
Annexin V and caspase 3/7 assays will be used to assess the hypothesis of Myc-driven apoptosis.
Endoreduplication will also be probed using BrdU incorporation into colcemid-arrested cells. Chromatin isolation
by RNA purification and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing will be used to demonstrate how the lncRNA
inhibits histone acetylation by SAGA. To assess the role of the lncRNA in vivo, we will functionally validate its
putative mouse homolog and generate a genetically engineered mouse model to characterize its effects on tumor
development. The lncRNA knockout allele will be bred into a Qki;Pten;Trp53 glioblastoma mouse model to
assess the effects of lncRNA suppression in the context of Pten deletion. The training plan will address gaps in
the applicant's research and clinical abilities, ensuring that he can successfully complete the proposed work and
preparing him for the next stage of his career. The training will be completed in Dr. Ronald DePinho's lab at MD
Anderson, where the applicant will have access to the resources, facilities, and, most importantly, colleagues
that will nurture his continuing development and growth into a physician-scientist."
10921744,"ABSTRACT
Codomax has developed the Epi-MAX platform, an integrated mass spectrometry omics and computational
technology for enhanced protein synthesis. Current protein manufacturing processes typically employ
expression vectors inserted into heterologous host cells, where gene, regulatory and cell features limit protein
production; some proteins are difficult to express in high yields due to inefficiently translated or sub-optimally
transcribed mRNA. Codomax's innovation hinges on the discovery that cells regulate translation in response to
stress by altering the tRNA pools to enhance translation of mRNAs with distinct codon usage patterns. The Epi-
MAX platform has leveraged this tRNA codon-based mechanism to increase recombinant protein expression in
cells by matching codon usage in the target gene to the stress-reprogrammed tRNAs. Previously, Codomax
demonstrated stress-induced tRNA reprogramming in mammalian systems and propose to extend the platform
to antibody production in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Underlying antibody production in CHO cells is
the stress of high protein expression, evidenced by Codomax's observed changes in the levels of mRNAs and
proteins specific to stress response, protein folding and metabolic genes when comparing high to low expressing
clones. High antibody expression reprograms protein expression machinery with dramatic changes in ribosome
components and translation factors. Codomax has shown that available levels of the CREB1 transcription factor,
which drives target antibody expression, decrease in high expressing clones. Thus, the specific aims for
Codomax's project include application of the Epi-MAX platform to analyze high and low productivity CHO clones
for the model therapeutic antibody to identify tRNA systems that limit heavy chain production, and then identify
tRNAs that when over-expressed, boost antibody expression (Aim 1). Codomax will then increase target heavy
and light chain mRNA transcription 200%, by re-engineering the CMV-regulating CREB1 transcription factor to
have increased stress-induced translation (Aim 2). Codon optimized CREB1 will be used to enhance mRNA
translation during the stress of antibody expression, with maximized CREB1 transcription factor levels driving
increased mRNA transcription from the CMV promoter. The CREB1 gene will be re-engineered using Epi-MAX
data from Aim 1. Then CRISPR-Cas9 approaches will be used to replace the native CREB1 gene with the
CREB1-codon optimized sequence and mRNA expression will be evaluated for the heavy and light chains under
high expression conditions. Aim 2 will result in the generation of gene sequences, plasmids and CRISPR
reagents for CMV-based transcription in several CHO lines. The successful completion of Codomax's Phase I
project will demonstrate proof-of-concept that the Epi-MAX platform can be used to increase antibody yield from
CHO cells and generate designer reagents that promote boosted antibody production."

Strokes are the second leading cause of death worldwide. In the US they are the leading cause of disability,
and cost the healthcare industry over $50 billion annually. Globally, almost 90% of strokes are ischemic in
nature. Since 2015, the standard of care for large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke has been mechanical
thrombectomy (MT). The improvements seen with MT have been so dramatic that urgent MT is now the
recommended by the American Stroke Association Guidelines for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
Over the years MT approaches have evolved from stent retrievers, to aspiration catheters, to a combination of
the two devices. Yet despite these advances, revascularization of occluded vessels is still not achieved in up to
33% of cases, and only ~50% of cases have good clinical outcomes.
Aspiration pumps have much wider applications than just aspiration-first approaches; over 96% of
neurointerventionalists we interviewed report using an aspiration pump during thrombectomies, regardless of
whether they are using an aspiration catheter or stent retriever. Almost 70% of clinicians interviewed said that
they believed a better aspiration pump is needed. Despite dramatic evolution in catheters and stent retrievers
in the last 5 years, currently the market is dominated by a single device with minimal updates. We are
addressing this clinical need with our innovative ALGO aspiration pump.
Our pump has several prominent innovations that improve its usability and revascularization potential. These
include a novel and unique aspiration system that operates through a mechanism unlike any other system on
the market. Early testing of this system demonstrates incredibly high success rates for total revascularization
after the first pass, as well as significantly improved rates of revascularization compared to a leading
competitor. Our system is also compatible with any standard catheter on the market; this avoids the need for
the purchase of proprietary accessories and allows neurointerventionalists to use the devices they are most
comfortable with. Additionally, the ALGO offers real-time, nuanced feedback on procedure status. We expect
this system will improve procedural success rates by notifying neurointerventionalists if the catheter tip is
occluded due to sidewall contact and the position must be adjusted, or if the catheter is corked with a clot and
can be withdrawn. Finally, the ALGO is designed to be recyclable. This was an important innovation that
neurointerventionalists indicated was desired.
Together these innovations will result in an aspiration pump that improves first-pass efficacy rates while
lowering costs and reducing medical waste. Based on our market analysis, these are highly desired
innovations and we expect rapid acceptance and utilization of this technology. This Phase I effort is designed
to further refine and validate our paradigm-shifting technology using physiologically relevant soft and hard clots
to optimize our approach for the full spectrum of conditions neurointerventionalists encounter in the clinic."
10915894,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe cardiopulmonary disease characterized by pulmonary
endothelial proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) expansion, and interstitial fibrosis that affects distal
pulmonary arterioles. Despite the importance of vascular remodeling to morbidity and early mortality in PAH
patients, approved pharmacotherapies targeting the molecular events that regulate ECM expansion or
angioproliferation do not exist currently. Focal adhesions are multimeric transmembrane complexes that
interface endothelial cells with ECM integrins. Focal adhesions drive cellular proliferation and ECM expansion
in a process that is initiated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Global inhibition of FAK mitigates vascular
remodeling and improves PAH in vivo; however, FAK inhibitors are tailored for cancers and associated with off-
tissue effects considered particularly high-risk for PAH patients. Thus, developing drugs that prevent focal
adhesion assembly in affected tissue selectively is a promising approach to treat PAH.
 Our laboratory identified Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 9
(NEDD9) as a scaffolding protein that regulates vascular fibrosis in PAH. The SH3 domain of NEDD9 is a
principal binding target of FAK: formation of the FAK-NEDD9 protein-protein complex regulates focal adhesion
signal transduction in numerous cell lines. In the current proposal, we present for the first time the NEDD9-SH3
crystal structure. We synthesized several FAK peptidomimetics (NEDDtides) and demonstrate binding of the
NEDDtides to NEDD9 using numerous chemical methods. From the protein structure and novel experimental
data, we also identified a reactive thiol residue at Cys18 near the FAK binding groove that is unique to NEDD9.
We further show that pulmonary endothelial NEDD9 interacts with the ECM integrin ITGA5 and regulates a key
pathway involving the angioproliferation protein VEGF. These observations establish the central hypothesis
of the current project: In pulmonary artery endothelial cells, NEDDtide (or analog) inhibits FAK-NEDD9
complex formation to impair focal adhesion assembly. We postulate further that NEDD9-SH3 is a
modifiable target by which to inhibit focal adhesion-dependent ECM expansion, VEGF signaling, and, thus,
vascular remodeling in PAH. Aim 1 is: Use a structure-guided approach to synthesis and chemical optimization
of NEDDtide(s) modified with covalent probe(s) to leverage Cys18 for targeting NEDD9 selectively. We will test
binding affinity, potency, and selectivity of NEDDtide(s) using intact mass-spectrometry, fluorescent-based
assays and other methods to demonstrate inhibition of focal adhesion by NEDDtide(s) in vitro and in cellulo.
Aim 2 is: Use gain- and loss-of-function assays involving mutant NEDD9 constructs and NEDDtide(s) to show
that NEDD9-SH3 modulates ITG5A-VEGF signaling at focal adhesions and is a modifiable target by which to
inhibit ECM remodeling and angioproliferation in PAH-HPAECs in vitro and experimental PAH in vivo."
10916636,"SUMMARY
Our laboratory has recently reported sex-differences in morbidity during gastrointestinal acute radiation
syndrome (GI-ARS) with adult male rats having increased susceptibility to GI-ARS than age-matched female
rats. This finding is in line with a growing body of evidence from multiple labs which demonstrate GI radiation
sensitivity and response to candidate GI mitigators is sex dependent. Together, these data emphasize the
need for understanding how biological sex regulates normal tissue response to radiation and the consideration
of sex-based differences in MCM development.
In this application to RFA-AI-23-024 (Sex Differences in Radiation Research), we propose to evaluate whether
sex-differences in the regulation of the enzyme ACE2 may be an underlying driver of the observed sex-
difference in radiation sensitivity. Ace2 is an X-linked gene that may escape X-chromosome inactivation to
provide a “double-dosage” of ACE2 mRNA. Additionally, ACE2 mRNA transcription is known to be regulated
by the female estrogen hormone. We hypothesize elevated ACE2 expression and activity in the GI system of
female rats relative to age-matched males may confer a survival advantage during GI-ARS.
ACE2 enzyme activation promotes production of the peptide Ang(1-7) which mediates downstream signaling
via the GPCR Mas receptor (MasR). Ang(1-7) treatment following myelosuppressive radiation injury has been
shown to accelerate hematopoietic recovery and improves survival during ARS. Consistent with these studies,
our lab demonstrated pharmacologic ACE2 agonism with the small molecule diminazene aceturate (DIZE)
promotes survival in rodent models of GI-ARS, H-ARS and the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure
(DEARE). However, we have recently observed that DIZE-mediated mitigation effects during GI-ARS are
more pronounced in male rats than female rats.
Based on these data, we propose three Aims to comprehensively characterize the connection between
biological sex and ACE2 in the pathogenesis of the GI injury. Aim 1 will evaluate whether agonism of the
ACE2/Ang(1-7)/MasR pathway promotes similar GI protection in male and female rats. Aim 2 will determine if
loss of estrogen via ovariectomy alters ACE2 activation and impacts the established sex-differences in GI-
ARS. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the tissue-specific necessity for ACE2 in the gut using inducible
Cre-loxP mouse models. This work will be conducted using dual approaches of pharmacologic and genetic
loss of function studies in well-validated, in vivo animal models of acute radiation injury.
This work will advance our understanding of the mechanisms which contribute to sex-differences in
radiosensitivity. Additionally, as there are currently no FDA-approved medical countermeasures (MCM) for
GI-ARS, our proposed development of ACE2 agonist DIZE as a MCM for GI-ARS has high translational
relevance."
10918036,"Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is a common compressive neuropathy that if left untreated can lead to
disability and job loss. Conservative treatment fails in 60% of cases and most patients require surgery. The two
most common surgical procedures are in-situ (simple) decompression and subcutaneous anterior
transposition. Several studies comparing the two procedures, including underpowered randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, have been unable to detect a difference in outcomes. Determining the best
surgery for individual patients is imperative because revision surgery for failed UNE release is often ineffective.
Currently, the choice of procedure type is often based on physician training and preferences owing to the lack
of evidence-based guidelines for UNE surgery.
This proposed study is a double-blind RCT with 10 clinical sites. Subjects diagnosed with UNE will be
randomized to in-situ decompression or subcutaneous anterior transposition and followed for one year. This
trial is novel because subjects will be blinded regarding their surgery and the researchers performing the
functional assessments will also be blinded to yield the most objective assessment of outcomes. The specific
aims of the study are to compare outcomes between the two procedures using functional and validated patient-
reported outcomes, recovery trends, and complications. Our ultimate goal is to develop an evidence-based
treatment algorithm to determine the best procedure for individual patients with unique disease severity."
10918131,"Project Summary
My long-term goal is to identify how individuals can mitigate exposures to the deleterious health effects of air
pollution through practical lifestyle adjustments. My primary project objective is to investigate how an
individual's choices influence personal exposures to traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) and the corresponding
acute health effects. It has been reported that traffic pollutants may cause up to half of all air pollution related
mortalities. Despite the burden from such widespread, involuntary exposures, few studies have examined the
magnitude of personal exposures due to commuting exposures. A commuter's exposure is dependent on the
mode of transport, time of day, route, and fuel type. Public transportation, bicycling, and walking have been
promoted as ways to reduce air pollution by reducing the vehicle fleet, yet few studies have examined how
exposures would be modified due to a change in the mode of transportation or the subsequent health effects.
 In this study, 65 participants will be asked to utilize two modes of transportation (car and either bicycle,
rail, or bus) during their typical commute over 4 days (two days per mode). During each 24-hr period, the
participants will be examined for changes in oxidative stress biomarkers and acute cardiovascular and
respiratory endpoints and 7+ pollutants and noise levels will be quantified in real-time. I hypothesize that there
will be a significant association between exposure levels and acute health endpoints. An examination will be
conducted into whether this association is modified by mode of transport. I will also examine the influence of
the time of day an individual chooses to commute to work and exercise outdoors in a second cohort of 75
participants. Since TRAP tends to be most concentrated during two relatively short periods of time (morning
and evening rush hours), I hypothesize that altering the time of exposure will notably change personal
exposures.
 This project will bring in a key components of the personal exposure paradigm, an individual's decision-
induced reductions in exposure. We will identify modifiable factors/personal choices that can reduce exposures
with the objective of identifying which reductions in exposure can lead to meaningful health benefits. This
knowledge will enable individuals to make lifestyle choices that can reduce their exposure independent of the
ambient air quality or regulatory changes. This will be particularly beneficial in the study location (Baltimore),
where the combustion-related mortality rate is highest in the U.S. It is expected that the information obtained in
this K99/R00 will be applicable to other metropolitan areas with similar infrastructure. Through this research,
my didactic coursework, and the guidance of my mentoring team (comprised of a pulmonologist, a
biostatistician, an environmental epidemiologist, and an exposure scientist), I will acquire critical skills required
to be a successful, independent researcher in environmental health sciences."
10910065,"ABSTRACT:
Quantitative relaxometry is a promising method for quantifying brain changes with early
development and brain tissue differences as a function of genetics, environment or
pathology. Relaxometry may be useful for assessing abnormal white matter damage in
infants at risk for cerebral palsy, which is the leading movement disorder in children.
Head motion is a significant challenge for MRI studies in young children, resulting in
image artifacts and errors in quantitative imaging measures. Long and loud scans also
adversely affect imaging compliance in young children. Consequently, there is a critical
need to develop imaging methods that are robust to motion, faster, and quieter. This
project will develop, optimize and evaluate novel 3D radial imaging technologies for
multimodal structural imaging and quantitative relaxometry for studies in sleeping
infants and toddlers. The outcome will be a fast, ultra-quiet imaging technique capable
of providing imaging maps of quantitative relaxation times that are robust to nearly all
motions. These optimized, motion-corrected, quantitative relaxometry technologies will
be applied to a cohort of infants and toddlers without sedation to generate
developmental relaxometry templates for normative studies from 0 to 2 years of age.
The normative relaxometry framework will be applied to lesions and abnormal brain
development of infants at risk for or diagnosed with cerebral palsy, The normative
framework will also be used to investigate individual differences in brain and
sensorimotor development in both typical development and cerebral palsy. Ultimately,
this project will provide a set of robust, reliable and accurate image acquisition methods,
software tools, and strategies for investigating healthy and abnormal brain development
in both clinical and research pediatric populations without sedation."
10910070,"Around the world, women of African ancestry and throughout the African Diaspora, continue to perish from breast
cancer at significantly higher rates than any other racial/ethnic group. Although much of these disparate
outcomes have been attributed to inequities in access to healthcare, socioeconomic disadvantage, and other
crippling exposures linked to institutional racism, most studies also indicate a prominent role in tumor biology.
Causal factors include i) higher frequencies of aggressive breast cancer subtypes associated with genetic
ancestry; ii) more aggressive biological behavior of low-risk breast cancers based-on race/ethnicity and ancestry,
and iii) decreased predictive value of prognostic gene signatures when applied to women of African heritage.
Recently we have shown the subcellular localization of the breast cancer biomarker Kaiso (ZBTB33) in both the
nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells were each more associated with biologically aggressive cancers
and independent predictors of poor breast cancer survival and response to neoadjuvant therapy, revealing that
cytoplasmic Kaiso was highly correlated with an “immune-evasive” or “immune-suppressed” tumor
microenvironment. Mechanistically cytoplasmic Kaiso was shown to be very highly correlated with the machinery
involved in extracellular vesicle (EV) loading and secretion, a process known to have a dramatic influence on
the micro-environment of the tumor bed and metastatic niche. In this study, we will validate and extend these
observations of the subcellular localization of Kaiso as an independent predictive biomarker of breast cancer
survival and the tumor micro-environment using two diverse breast cancer cohorts from Africa and across the
African diaspora. One from the Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (N=487) and
the other from the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya (N=237) (Specific Aim 1). Using a multi-omic
approach that will integrate the analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs), quantitative multiplex
immunofluorescence (qMIF), gene expression (RNA-seq), tumor mutational signatures and frequency (whole-
exome sequencing), deep annotation of patient clinicopathological features, environmental exposures, and
genetic ancestry, we will define prognostic models that will demonstrate the role of Kaiso in predicting breast
cancer survival, response to therapy and the role of genetic ancestry in breast cancer evolution and outcome
(Specific Aim 1). We will also define how Kaiso modulates the influence of EV secretion on breast cancer growth,
invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion in murine xenograft models using cells engineered for depleted or
enhanced Kaiso expression (Specific Aim 2). These goals will be accomplished through a transatlantic
collaboration of a highly-specialized multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, tumor biologists,
molecular biologists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, genome researchers, and cancer health
disparities investigators."

clinical and research expertise in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) interest
areas and established collaborations with the clinical site to facilitate clinical trial access for rural children.
Collaboration with the Northern New England Clinical Translational Research Network (NNE-CTR), families,
and community groups aids rural outreach. In collaboration with other ECHO IDeA States Pediatric Clinical
Trials Network (ISPCTN) sites, the DCOC, and the NIH, the UVM site (UVM) works to improve clinical trials
access, develop and implement clinical trials pertinent to rural and underserved children, and train pediatric
investigators committed to clinical trials research for this population. A significant discrepancy exists between
the burden of disease in the pediatric population and opportunities to participate in clinical research, and rural,
underserved, and minority children are particularly underrepresented. UVM's objective is to continue to
collaborate with other ISPCTN sites in the development and conduct of multicenter clinical trials with a focus
on access for children in rural and underserved communities and to leverage the site's prior successes as an
ISPCTN site to further expand the pediatric research capacity at UVM. UVM is committed to remaining an
integral part of the ISPCTN, and will advance the goals of the network through the following specific aims: 1.
UVM will collaborate in the development and conduct of ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials and provide
leadership in the clinical trial development pipeline. UVM will build on the site's previous work, expand the
site team, support new investigators, and share resources to develop and conduct clinical trials. 2. Through
training, mentoring, and participation in ECHO ISPCTN trials, UVM will expand local expertise in
pediatric clinical trial conduct and collaborate with other sites to share this expertise. UVM will expand
their Pediatric Clinical Trials Learning Collaborative program that provides clinical research training and
American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification (MOC) credit for QI activities, to improve clinical
trials access and monitor regulatory requirement adherence. UVM will leverage resources including the DCOC,
ISPCTN site collaborations, IRB, NNE-CTR, and outside research network programs. 3. UVM will enhance
access to pediatric clinical trials for rural and underserved children, with the goal of improving the
health of all children. The UVM outreach program will leverage existing relationships and collaborations (e.g.
rural networks of health providers, NNE-CTR, and community stakeholders) to both offer participation in and
collaborate in the development of pediatric clinical trials. UVM will encourage participation through MOC
incentives and by reducing barriers to participation."
10911016,"PepT1, which is a member of the proton oligopeptide transporter (POT) superfamily, is well known to
transport di/tripeptides. Our group and others have shown that PepT1 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of
the small intestine, but present at low or undetectable levels in such cells of the normal large intestine. In
addition, we have demonstrated that colonic PepT1 expression is up-regulated in colitis and colitis-associated
cancer (CAC). By generating gain- and loss-of-function mouse models with PepT1 expression specifically in
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), we explored the role of PepT1 in intestinal homeostasis, inflammation, and
colitis-associated tumorigenesis. We also examined the expression and transport activities of PepT1, using
mouse models of colitis and CAC, and further revealed that the function of this membrane transporter is not
restricted to its classical function as a transporter of di-tripeptides. For example, we demonstrated that PepT1
expression helps maintain intestinal homeostasis by mediating intestinal miRNA expression/secretion.
Importantly we demonstrated during the last funding cycle that the PepT1-/- microbiota/metabolome is sufficient
to protect against colitis and CAC. The overall goal of the current proposal is to develop a drug delivery
platform to treat colitis. The initial aim of this proposal will be to investigate whether oral delivery of alginate
hydrogel-loaded PepT1-/- microbiota will enhance the engraftment dynamics/diversity of the donor microbiota
and consequently enhance the prevention/treatment of colitis. In the second aim, we will explore the cellular
targets of PepT1-/- microbiota and assess the subsequent intestinal cellular responses that decrease colitis.
Finally, we will characterize and assess the in vivo colitis-preventing effects of oral administration of specific
anti-inflammatory metabolites from PepT1-/- microbiota loaded into nanoparticles. The proposed research will
facilitate the development of therapeutic solutions targeting intestinal inflammatory and colitis associated
cancer conditions."
10911123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The open availability of authenticated, well-documented research materials is essential for scientific progress.
Plasmids have become essential research tools to address almost any question in biology, and together with
other forms of engineered DNA molecules, are essential for clinical research applications including gene therapy,
vaccine development, and the production of recombinant drugs. Currently, the two common links between a
plasmid and its documentation are the plasmid names and the plasmid sequence. Despite the central role that
plasmids play in biomedical research and development, there is no guaranteed way to connect a physical
plasmid in a tube to its documentation. A pipetting error, a labelling error, a spontaneous mutation, or an
undocumented modification of the plasmid are some of the events that could result in a tube containing a different
plasmid than what is indicated on the label. In addition, there is no standardized, secure approach to
documenting the sequence, function, and lineage of a plasmid. As a result, there are widespread discrepancies
between the physical sequences of the plasmids in circulation in the life science community and their supposed
reference sequence. This situation creates reproducibility issues, slows down R&D efforts and raises significant
security and safety issues for biotechnology applications.
We are proposing to develop a new digital certificate technology, enabled by a web-based resource called
MyPlasmid.org, that will provide a robust, physical link between engineered DNA molecules, their electronic
documentation, and their authors. This technology will produce unique DNA sequences generated by
cryptographic algorithms that can be inserted into an engineered DNA molecule. MyPlasmid.org will allow users
to document their genetic designs by aggregating the documentation of individual genetic elements as well as
combinations of elements. In addition, it will link the computer records of the engineered DNA sequence directly
to the molecule itself and provide a method to retrieve documentation without a priori knowledge of the plasmid's
identity. Short unique DNA sequences called certificates will be inserted between the functional blocks of
engineered sequences. Unlike DNA barcodes, certificates will be computed by cryptographic algorithms using
the DNA sequence itself and the author's identity as input so that users of engineered DNA molecules can verify
the origin and integrity of certified DNA molecules. The technology described in this proposal is expected to
foster a transition similar what has been observed in the semi-conductor industry where different stakeholders
invest in the development of circuits that can be easily combined in larger designs that can then be manufactured
by foundries not involved in the chip design. By ensuring that the sequence, origin, function, and lineage of
engineered DNA molecules is accurately tracked and conveyed to all users, the proposed technology will
improve the reproducibility, utility, and potential application of engineered DNA molecules in the life sciences."
10911126,"Project Abstract
 Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is one of the most common life-threatening airway disorders in infants and
children. Current treatment methods are based on airway endoscopy, which provides only qualitative
information. Surgical treatment failures for the most severe grades of SGS range toward 50%, often due to
post-operative airway collapse in new, unpredicted locations. Treatment planning could be improved if
evidence-based, quantitative, physiologic or anatomic metrics were available.
 To address this need, we propose to advance anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) for high-
resolution, high-speed imaging of the airway. Endoscopic aOCT and intraluminal pressure catheters will be
used simultaneously to inform models of airway wall viscoelasticity (VE). In combination with simulated surgery
and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this constitutes a powerful new clinical tool to predict airway collapse
and airflow resistance in children with SGS. Our ultimate goal is to develop an aOCT-informed pipeline to
model tissue VE, perform simulated surgery, predict outcomes from a variety of surgical plans and, ultimately,
reduce treatment failures. This will leverage existing infrastructure at UNC, including the Virtual Pediatric
Airways Workbench for simulated surgery, the Pediatric Airway Atlas of normal airways, and fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) modeling of the dynamic interplay between airway wall VE, airway deformation, and
intraluminal pressure to accurately model and predict airway collapse.
 Our first Aim is to verify that geometric and pressure-related metrics that correlate with whether children
receive surgery for SGS, previously established using CT, can be obtained from endoscopic aOCT, thereby
avoiding ionizing radiation exposure. Our second Aim is technical development of dynamic (4 dimensional, 4D)
aOCT imaging to quantify airway wall VE, validated against CINE CT in pigs. Our final Aim is to create 4D
models of the airway in children with SGS including VE properties using aOCT, perform simulated surgery to
predict patient-specific post-surgical outcomes, and compare these to post-surgical aOCT models created from
routine post-operative surveillance endoscopies. In addition to the development of a new tool, these
experiments will also provide new data on longitudinal changes in VE wall properties before and after surgery.
Achievement of these goals will provide improved metrics for decision-making and enable evaluation of the
dynamic airway without radiation exposure. Our long-term goals are to: 1) validate this approach clinically at
multiple institutions; 2) evaluate the ability of these methods to improve outcomes; and 3) use the tool to study
other airway diseases, such as obstructive sleep apnea (~10% of the population), in children and adults."
10911132,"ABSTRACT
Myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most severe form of spina bifida (SB) and the most common congenital cause
of lifelong paralysis in the United States, where approximately four children are born daily with this devastating
disease. MMC results from the incomplete closure of the neural tube and absent overlying spine leaving the
spinal cord exposed to intrauterine mechanical and chemical trauma. This trauma results in lifelong paralysis,
bowel and bladder dysfunction, musculoskeletal deformities, and cognitive disabilities due to hindbrain
herniation. In utero surgical repair improves morbidity, but functional recovery is incomplete and the majority of
children are still unable to walk independently. We developed a treatment for MMC that augments the standard
of care, in utero MMC surgical repair, with placental mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (PMSCs). We found that
treatment with PMSCs, during in utero repair, prevents hind limb paralysis in the well-established fetal ovine
model of MMC, due to PMSC paracrine secretion of neuroprotective factors. However, we confirmed that PMSCs
did not engraft long-term and treated lambs developed severe kyphosis causing spinal cord compression and
tethering due to the lack of bone and adjacent paraspinal muscles, which is consistent with human MMC
musculoskeletal deformities. To meet this need for a long-lasting therapy for MMC, we explored the use of
bioengineered multifunctional combination scaffolds. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that play significant
roles in cell-to cell communication. We confirmed that exosomes secreted by PMSCs (PMSC-exosomes) exert
significant neuroprotective functions, similar in magnitude to the live PMSCs from which they are derived. In this
study, we propose to develop an engineered hydrogel system that will allow for both local and sustained release
of PMSC-exosomes to the spinal cord, which in turn will provide sustained neuroprotection to treat MMC before
birth. In addition, we aim to increase the longevity of the in utero treatment by covering the defect with a
biomaterial-based bony scaffold to provide structural and functional support. We plan to optimize the
neuroprotective and regenerative functions of the bioscaffold using our well-established fetal rodent and rabbit
models of MMC. We will evaluate the final combination multifunctional bioscaffold product in our gold-standard
fetal ovine model of MMC. This therapeutic will be cell-free, off-the-shelf, and easy-to-use. If successful, this
novel approach will be used to treat MMC before birth, and due to its regenerative qualities, the treatment will
improve the quality of life of these patients, as well as significantly lower the healthcare costs associated with
the current treatment."
10911893,"The effect of alcohol consumption on drug metabolism and interactions of alcohol with drugs constitute a
significant health problem. The mechanisms of these effects are tightly related to the influence of alcohol on drug-
metabolizing system, and on cytochrome P450 ensemble in particular. Functional versatility of the cytochrome
P450 system is achieved through the presence of over a dozen of P450 species differing in their substrate
specificity. The composition of this ensemble is known to be largely affected by alcohol consumption. It is
generally presumed that the integral properties of this ensemble represent a simple aggregate of the properties
of the constituting P450 enzymes. Although this premise remains to be a foundation of rational analysis of the
routes of drug metabolism, its validity became essentially compromised. The body of evidence of system-wide
integration in the properties of the P450 ensemble continues to grow. The current project is prompted by
recognition of a far-reaching physiological significance and pharmacological importance of inter-species crosstalk
in the P450 ensemble and its thorough relevance to the effects of alcohol on drug metabolism and P450-
dependent cellular signaling.
 Our central hypothesis is that the results of the alcohol-induced changes in the composition of the cytochrome
P450 pool are not limited to direct consequences of the activity of the alcohol-induced enzymes. They also
involve alterations of the metabolism of a broad range of exogenous and endogenous substrates of various P450
enzymes due to their interactions with alcohol-inducible P450 species. These indirect effects are deeply involved
in clinically-important cases of alcohol interactions with drugs and alcohol-induced alteration of cellular
signaling through eicosanoids, retinoic acid and other P450-dependent messengers.
 This proposal is aimed to explore the alcohol-induced changes in P450 expression and their effects of on the
network of protein-protein interaction in the ER membranes and, consequently, on the system-wide properties
of the P450 ensemble. Our long-term goal is to obtain a complete picture of functional interactions between
human cytochromes P450, and the alcohol-inducible P450 species in particular, and characterize their role in
dictating the integral properties of the drug-metabolizing ensemble and their changes by alcohol consumption.
 Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To refine our knowledge on alcohol-induced changes in the composition of
the cytochrome P450 ensemble in liver cells; (2) To identify the principal intermolecular interactions of alcohol-
induced P450 species in HLM; (3) To identify the major functional interactions of alcohol-inducible P450
enzymes with other P450 species and explore their effect on the metabolism of drugs and endogenous substrates
by the P450 ensemble. Fulfilling these aims will allow in-depth characterization of alcohol-induced changes in
drug-metabolism and P450-dependent cellular signaling and understand their role in deleterious alcohol-drug
interactions and other adverse effects of alcohol consumption."
10911895,"Poor diet is a leading cause of preventable death and diseases, as well as preventable healthcare costs in
the United States. Despite the importance of following a healthy dietary pattern, most U.S. adults do not
meet national dietary guidelines and are either overweight or obese. There is a critical need for
""just-in-time"" (JIT) interventions to improve diet and eating behaviors as they occur. To maximize impact,
JIT interventions should only be delivered when an individual is receptive, particularly when dietary quality
is poor. However, which aspects of the food environment and dietary behavior have influence on dietary
intake and quality are unknown, and how they relate to JIT intervention receptivity is unexplored. This
would require collecting and analyzing near-continuous data about one's diet in the context of daily life,
where behavior actually occurs, which is very challenging for researchers and burdensome for
participants. Advances in wearable sensor technologies, equipped with novel computational methods
could provide a pathway to capture and analyze the various exposures and patterns in the eating
environment to fill this gap. The overall objective of this proposal is to create an integrated system of
wearable sensor and computational methods to discover food environment exposures related to dietary
quality that influence JIT intervention receptivity. Motivated by this vision, the objectives of this research
include: 1) develop novel edge computing hardware and software for privacy-preserving compressive
image capture and transmission, 2) develop new collaborative compression and analytics together with
unsupervised continual learning to understand eating behavior, 3) determine whether sensed aspects of
the environmental context during eating relate to dietary quality and receptivity to JIT interventions,
particularly when the dietary quality is poor. The project is a collaborative effort combining expertise in
wearable electronics, image processing, dietary patterns, and behavioral science."
10912001,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Children with Down syndrome (DS) are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, presenting a
prevention challenge that is currently unmet. Despite improved life expectancies, people with DS experience
poor health.10 Children and adults with DS have significantly higher rates of overweight/obesity (OW/OB) than
those with intellectual disability from other causes11 or the general population.12 These risks are rooted in
childhood, with rapid increases in OW/OB observed between ages 2 and 6 years in children with DS2–4 and
childhood OW/OB conferring a higher risk for OW/OB in adulthood.2,3 However, research examining young
children with DS+OW/OB has primarily focused on prevalence rates using retrospective clinical data, with
minimal attention to modifiable prevention targets.2,11,13 Consequently, critical questions regarding how DS
phenotypic factors such as co-occurring conditions, motor delays, and feeding challenges contribute to OW/OB
risk remain unanswered. Despite being a specific, high-risk population for obesity, no prospective,
longitudinal DS research has comprehensively characterized OW/OB predictors to guide effective
prevention in early childhood when such efforts may enhance downstream health outcomes. Bridging
this knowledge gap recently highlighted by prominent DS researchers,18 our team representing expertise in early
development in DS, nutrition, and obesity in DS, physical activity (PA), and sleep, will use a longitudinal design
to identify early OW/OB prevention targets for young children with DS. Using a staggered wave approach, we
will enroll and assess 1/3 of the sample in Wave 1/Y1, with annual follow-up visits (+ 1 month) in Y2&3, using
the same approach for Wave 2 (Y2-4) and Wave 3 (Y3-5), thus reducing recruitment demands over time and
sites (total project n=160). At T1-3, we will collect data on (a) child factors—objectively measured PA, motor
abilities (gross, fine, motor planning), sleep, and weight/height, plus caregiver-reported child dietary intake
(energy, macronutrients, and dietary quality), child developmental and medical history, and feeding abilities; and
(b) caregiving factors—caregiver feeding and PA practices, family dynamics, caregiver weight/height, and SES.
At T1, we will recruit caregivers and their child with DS chronological ages 18-40 months, who walk 15+ feet
independently. The age range ensures participant ages align with: (1) the full range of developmental variability
expected in children with DS given that 95% of children with DS reach this walking milestone between 18-40
months (median = 24 months),5 and (2) observed weight gain increases between 2 to 6 years of age in DS,2–4
with 4-6 year-olds 61% more likely to have OB than those aged 2-3 years.2 The overarching project goal is to
understand variability in risks for OW/OB in DS and identify prevention targets in young children with DS. Our
long-term goal is to develop and deliver obesity prevention in early childhood to reduce risks for OW/OB and
associated medical sequelae across the lifespan for individuals with DS."

Volumetric muscle loss (VML), which refers to an en bloc deficit of skeletal muscle mass, commonly occurs
following traumatic injury or tumor extirpation and results in substantial morbidity, pain, and disability. When
VML occurs in the lower extremities, as is most common, it particularly limits mobility and autonomy. Recovery
from VML is uniformly poor, with muscle strength and motion never returning to normal. Although free muscle
transfer and rehabilitation may improve outcomes, most limbs remain severely deficient functionally. Free
muscle transfer itself is also associated with risks, including donor site deficits and muscle atrophy following
transfer. Thus, a new paradigm for the treatment of VML injury is needed to provide an effective, long-term
restoration of function in patients. Tissue engineering approaches, including placement of 3D printed scaffolds
and growth factor delivery, promote muscle recovery following VML in pre-clinical models, but are hindered by
poor incorporation. In addition, translation to patient treatment remains difficult as the printing process takes
significant time, is prohibitively expensive, and requires specialized facilities. To address these issues, Inprint
Bio has developed MuscleInk, a multiscale porous gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA)-based scaffolds that is
crosslinked in situ. MuscleInk is impregnated with long arginine 3- insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1-LR3) to
generate MuscleInk+ to improve remnant skeletal muscle hypertrophy following VML and promote
myogenesis. The porous materials are delivered using a specialized applicator and photocrosslinked in situ,
leading to excellent adhesion to surrounding tissue without the use of sutures. In Aim 1, the physical and
mechanical properties of MuscleInk will be characterized before and after sterilization and the optimal condition
will be determined. In Aim 2, the effectiveness of stable IGF1-LR3 will be verified and the benefit of MuscleInk+
for inducing myogenesis will be verified in vitro and in vivo using murine models of VML injuries. The
completion of this work will demonstrate the feasibility of the technology, lead to testing in a translational pig
model of VML, prepare us to identify the regulatory pathway for the target product de novo for MuscleInk vs
PMA for MuscleInk+, and initiate the regulatory process. MuscleInk or MuscleInk+ will address an unmet
clinical need for treatment of patients with VML injury. The final product will be sold as a one-time filler/scaffold
to plastic surgery and surgery departments of large hospitals."
10921027,"Project Summary/Abstract
Significant advancements in pharmacotherapy for obesity have recently been realized, as exemplified by GLP-
1 receptor agonists, which reduce appetite and function as incretin mimetics by promoting pancreatic insulin
release. It may be possible to further improve metabolic health using agents that target distinct molecular
mechanisms that impinge on adipose tissue (AT) to promote energy expenditure and ameliorate fat dysfunction,
hallmarks of which are insulin resistance, inflammation and fibrosis. In this regard, there is interest in developing
drugs that directly augment brown AT (BAT) function and/or stimulate white AT (WAT) ‘beiging’ as a means of
treating metabolic disease. A key feature of BAT/WAT activation is elevated expression of uncoupling protein-1
(UCP1), which uncouples electron transport from ATP synthesis, resulting in non-shivering thermogenesis and
energy expenditure.
 We found that global or adipocyte-specific deletion of the zinc-dependent enzyme, histone deacetylase
11 (HDAC11), in mice prevents weight gain and improves overall metabolic health (e.g., enhanced glucose
tolerance and reduced liver steatosis) in the face of chronic high-fat feeding. The salutary effects of HDAC11
knockout (KO) are linked to increased abundance and function of BAT and beiging of WAT, as evidenced by
dramatic augmentation of UCP1 expression in KO mice. Despite its name, HDAC11 functions as a lysine
demyristoylase as opposed to a deacetylase, with a catalytic efficiency >10,000-fold higher for myristoyl-lysine
versus acetyl-lysine. FT895, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of HDAC11 demyristoylase activity, also
stimulates UCP1 expression in mouse AT in vivo, and in human AT ex vivo, validating the potential of HDAC11
inhibitors to alter AT phenotype to improve metabolic health. However, despite its utility as a ‘tool compound’,
FT895 lacks the pharmaceutical properties required for development of a drug to treat human disease, in part
due to the fact that it is a hydroxamic acid-containing HDAC inhibitor. To circumvent this issue, with prior NIH
funding (DK119594), we completed a high throughput screening campaign to discover non-hydroxamic acid
HDAC11 inhibitors. Using commercially purchased compounds, our hit expansion efforts revealed compelling
structure-activity-relationships that validate these inhibitors. We have six series of compounds to potentially
pursue in the hit-to-lead/lead discovery phase of the project.
 Myracle Therapeutics was founded in 2023 with the goal of developing HDAC11 inhibitors to treat obesity
and obesity-related diseases. Myracle is in-licensing the aforementioned portfolio of non-hydroxamic acid
HDAC11 inhibitor hit compounds. In work outlined in two specific aims, up to two series of Myracle HDAC11
inhibitors will be advanced into a hit-to-lead campaign to discover lead compounds and set the stage for
subsequent lead optimization and Investigation New Drug filing."

Chronic wounds have become a `silent epidemic' with health complications ranging from serious
infections to limb amputations to death. In the U.S. alone, annual health care costs for treating
chronic wounds are conservatively estimated at $32 billion. Treatment approaches for chronic
wounds include surgical debridement, moist dressings, engineered skin substitutes, compression
therapy, negative pressure therapy, skin grafts, and recombinant growth factors. Yet, none of
these approaches has proven to be an efficient and effective therapy. Tissue repair occurs
through a series of events mediated through interactions between various cell types and
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Fibronectin fibrils are a principal component of the wound
ECM and play a key role in tissue formation. The Hocking lab has developed a series of soluble,
recombinant fragments of fibronectin, termed “fibronectin matrix mimetics”, that “mimic” the
structural and functional properties of insoluble fibronectin fibrils. Fibronectin matrix mimetics
promote cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and contractility, modulate extracellular matrix
composition, and induce local vasodilation - all of which contribute to effective tissue regeneration.
Topical application of fibronectin matrix mimetics to full-thickness dermal wounds in diabetic mice
accelerates epithelial maturation, and promotes granulation tissue deposition, remodeling, and
re-vascularization. Thus, a primary target of the fibronectin matrix mimetics is chronic diabetic
wounds. The goals of this project are to (i) fully characterize tissue responses to one of the
fibronectin matrix mimetics, FNIII1H,8,10 (“Chimectin”) in genetically diabetic male and female
mice, and (ii) test Chimectin's efficacy in a diabetic porcine dermal wound model. Results from
these studies will lay the groundwork to advance Chimectin to clinical trials to test its ability to
stimulate wound healing in diabetic patients."
10930968,"Despite decades of efforts to reduce racial pain disparities, the pain of Black patients is still undertreated. As
persistent pain experience robustly predicts poorer quality of life overall, racial pain care disparities represent a
central factor fueling larger social inequalities. While previous work has identified a host of patient and provider
factors that contribute to racial disparities in healthcare in general and thus also likely contributing to disparities
in pain care, there has been limited clinically-meaningful progress in eliminating these disparities. Thus, there is
an urgent need to address this decades-old inequity by taking an innovative approach. We argue that this lack
of progress is due to the fact that prior research has investigated the influence of patient and provider factors in
isolation, rather than examining their interaction. Successful pain care requires constructive patient-provider
communication, and constructive communication is both dyadic and dynamic. This proposed research will
establish the dyadic and dynamic processes underlying patient-provider communication as the key
mechanism through which patient and provider factors contribute to racial disparities in both patient-
centered and clinical pain outcomes. One well-accepted operationalization of such dyadic processes is
behavioral coordination (i.e., spatial/temporal matching in the rhythms or patterns of behaviors between
individuals engaged in an interaction, such as synchrony, leader-and-follower dynamics, and turn-taking). We
hypothesize that the pain of Black patients continues to be undertreated because Black (vs. White) patients are
more likely to participate in racially discordant medical interactions (i.e., seeing other-race providers) and as a
result, are more likely to experience disruptions in behavioral coordination. These hypotheses will be tested
within the context of preoperative consultations because racial disparities in surgical pain outcomes are well-
documented across procedures, and further, the quality of preoperative consultations is linked to post-surgical
pain management. We will use a convergent mixed methods research design to assess behavioral coordination
quantitatively (e.g., levels, duration, patterns) and qualitatively (e.g., valence, discussion themes). This work will:
Aim 1) compare the levels, duration, patterns, and context of behavioral coordination in preoperative
consultations (both overall and during pain discussion specifically) between Black and White patients; Aim 2)
elucidate links between patient/provider factors and coordination in preoperative consultations; and Aim 3)
identify specific aspects of behavioral coordination in preoperative consultations that contribute to racial
disparities in post-surgical patient-centered outcomes (e.g., pain management self-efficacy, quality of life) and
clinical outcomes (e.g., pain level, prescriptions). Since this research focuses on pain management self-efficacy
and quality of life as primary outcomes, findings will be generalizable beyond surgical pain. The proposed work
will lay the foundation for developing interventions that target modifiable factors (the dyadic processes underlying
patient-provider communication) that can be addressed by leveraging existing infrastructure (medical training)."
10930978,"This proposal entitled Neuroscience Research Opportunities to Increase Diversity (NeuroID) from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Rio Piedras Campus aims to increase the opportunities available for undergraduate students in the area of Neurosciences. This proposal builds upon the experiences gathered during two funding period to enhance and strengthen the mentoring and training activities of Underrepresented Minority students to make them competitive for graduate school and beyond. NeuroID takes advantage of the strong Neuroscience expertise among UPR investigators and fortifies the underlying neuroscience network that joins undergraduate students, island investigators and their collaborators. This renewal also expands the impact of the program to students from five mainly undergraduate private institutions in the metropolitan area. The main goal of the NeuroID program is to increase diversity in the neurosciences by establishing a cohort of interested students that will receive academic and professional training in neuroscience-related research. The program will benefit a student population over 95% Hispanics of different gender, race, social status and physical needs. The core of the program is a comprehensive research experience for undergraduate students and a series of activities that reinforce student’s identity as neuroscientists. The training program consists of three major components: (1) Research Experience - An intense research experience during the academic year and two research summer experiences: one at the UPR and the other in a laboratory at an institution in the mainland USA that have active T32 training grants in neuroscience and/or excellent track record in recruiting and training underrepresented minorities. (2) Academic training – an academic program based on active learning activities, seminars, workshops and selected courses to enhance their knowledge in neurobiology, quantitative biology and understanding of a research career. (3) Student development activities - Participants will enter a mentoring program that includes community outreach activities, writing in science, oral presentations and career counseling to enhance their professional capabilities. The proposed activities will serve to increase the student competitiveness and enhance their interest in continuing a research career in neuroscience. The NeuroID program will extend the impact of other successful programs at the University of Puerto Rico, not only by focusing on the neuroscience field but also by greatly expanding the program to students from primarily-undergraduate institutions in the San Juan metropolitan areas, which increases the pool of available applicants as well as providing an inclusive and broader training program."

collagen type VIIa (COL7A1) gene mutations. RDEB is characterized by absent/defective COL7A1 (C7) protein
deposition causing severe blistering, mucosal tissue damage, and aggressive squamous cell carcinoma.
Palliative care is non-curative and cellular therapy options include autologous or allogeneic local and/or
systemic infusion of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), or hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). None of these currently employed treatment options resolve the full pathological
spectrum of RDEB. Active wound areas persist, and mucosal disease remains highly refractory to intervention
contributing to significant morbidity. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts, the primary C7 producing cells, show limited
migration and persistence following localized injection. MSC and HSPC have broad circulatory potential,
however, they produce comparatively low levels of C7 and residence in the skin or mucosa is not well
established. Thus, it is essential to develop more efficacious cellular therapies capable of accessing skin and
mucocutaneous tissues. γδ T cells are abundant within skin and mucosa, and due to their MHC-unrestricted
nature are compatible with allogeneic transfer, however they do not naturally produce C7. Our approach will
employ a highly efficient and clinical stage non-viral transposon platform to engineer γδ T cells to produce high
levels of endogenous C7. We hypothesize that the tissue migratory properties of γδ T cells—particularly to the
skin and mucosa—as well as their demonstrated allo-compatibility, make them uniquely suited for therapeutic
delivery of C7 protein. In Aim 1 we will define a genome engineering strategy to confer high C7 expression in
human γδ T cells, and test critical safety parameters and commercial feasibility. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the
ability of engineered allogeneic γδ T cells to home to skin and mucosa, deposit C7, and ameliorate pathology
in an immunodeficient mouse model of RDEB, amenable for testing of these engineered human cells. Further,
we will test the effect of zoledronate induced in vivo expansion of the engineered Vγ9Vδ2 T cell subset on
therapeutic efficacy. Our approach is a highly novel and innovative allogeneic strategy designed to address key
limitations of current cellular therapies for RDEB. The application of engineered γδ T cells represents an
attractive protein delivery strategy with high translational potential for RDEB, other inherited mucocutaneous
disorders, and a multitude of diverse disorders treated by cell/stem cell transplant."
10919093,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Treatments for plaque psoriasis vary substantially in effectiveness and side effects. It is often difficult to
determine the optimal treatment during a patient-centric, shared decision-making process between the
clinician and patient. The NIH and other stakeholders consider patient-reported outcomes (PROs) crucial for
the support of patient-centered care because PROs reflect the patients’ perspective and offer important
information to improve clinical decision-making and care delivery.
Treatment satisfaction is a key PRO that represents the patient’s experience with the process and outcome
of the treatment. Patient satisfaction with their treatment is critical because it affects patients’ treatment-
related behaviors, such as the likelihood of continuing to use their medication, to use the medication
correctly, and to adhere to prescribed treatment regimens. These treatment-related behaviors, in turn,
substantially impact the success of treatment outcomes.
The overarching goal of this study is to validate a patient-reported, dermatology-specific treatment
satisfaction instrument (DermSat). In this study, we plan to achieve two aims. In Aim 1, we will validate
DermSat for longitudinal assessment of patient satisfaction with psoriasis treatments during stable psoriasis
and flares. We will also determine if DermSat will confer good reliability. We will study this aim in a
prospective, observational cohort and recruit from a diverse psoriasis patient population in southern
California.
In Aim 2, we will determine whether DermSat predicts medication adherence and treatment changes.
Specifically, we will evaluate the predictive validity of DermSat by examining the relationship between
DermSat and subsequent assessment of adherence and treatment changes. A measure with excellent
predictive validity will enable clinicians to identify treatment dissatisfaction and intervene earlier to minimize
the long-term impact of psoriasis.
The successful completion of this research will lead to the first valid and reliable dermatology-specific
treatment satisfaction instrument. The study findings will have a marked impact on future clinical trial
design. DermSat will address the critical need to capture patients’ treatment experience in studies for both
approved and investigative dermatological therapies. Valid assessment of patients’ treatment satisfaction
will also help inform shared decision-making between clinicians and patients in clinical practice, predict
treatment adherence, and improve the likelihood of long-term treatment success."

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in perinatally infected infants diagnosed with HIV helps to reduce
morbidity and mortality, but it is not sufficient to eradicate the virus. Children have a unique immune system that
does not always respond to infection the same way as adults, and an increased understanding of the HIV-specific
immune responses that persist in children after early ART is needed in order to inform development of
immunotherapies that promote ART-free HIV viral control in children.
In preliminary studies, we have shown that early initiation of ART before six months of age blunted the HIV-
specific adaptive immune responses in children enrolled in the Thai HIV-NAT209 cohort. We were able to detect
HIV-specific CD8+ T cells that persisted in these children as late as four years after ART initiation, but the
frequency of CD8+ T cells that produced IFN in response to stimulation with HIV peptides was significantly lower
in children compared to adults living with HIV on ART. As neonatal CD8+ T cells have impaired production of
IFN, these standard assays may underestimate the frequency of HIV-specific memory CD8+ T cells
differentiated during infancy.
We have the unique opportunity to follow-up with children of the HIV-NAT209 cohort to determine if these HIV-
specific immune responses persist through 6-10 years of ART, and further characterize their phenotype. We
hypothesize that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells that persist after long-term antiretroviral therapy in children with early
treated perinatal HIV will be less differentiated than those in early treated adults on long-term ART. To address
this hypothesis, we will: (1) determine the magnitude, phenotype, and functionality of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells
that persist in early treated children after long-term ART and (2) determine the T cell receptor repertoire and
transcriptomic differences between HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in early treated children compared to adults after
long-term ART. We will use unique functional cell-based assays and single-cell RNA-sequencing to analyze HIV-
specific responses in these children and compare them to HIV-specific responses in early treated adults.
Data from these studies will provide important information about the persistence and functionality of HIV-
specific CD8+ T cell responses in early treated children, and will help to inform the development of pediatric
targeted therapeutic interventions to promote ART-free viral control in children."
10906170,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The pathophysiology of hemispheric hypodensity is unknown. It is a pattern of brain damage only occurring in
young children, often resulting from abuse, where the majority of the hemisphere underlying the subdural
hematoma appears hypodense on computed tomography spanning multiple vascular territories. When the
subdural hematoma is over one hemisphere, the damage is predominantly unilateral. Recently, we
successfully induced unilateral hemispheric hypodensity in piglets developmentally similar to human toddlers
by re-creating the clinical characteristics of this injury: mechanical trauma, midline shift, subdural hematoma,
seizures, apnea, and hypoventilation. This model results in an age-dependent neurologic impairment,
metabolic acidosis, and unilateral hypoxic-ischemic-type injury encompassing most of the cortex underlying the
subdural hematoma. The pattern of damage, degree of vasogenic edema, and upregulation of matrix
metalloproteinases are age-dependent. The percentage of hemispheric damage is positively correlated with
hemorrhage area and seizure duration. Our long-term goal is to understand the age- and injury-specific
pathophysiology to develop therapies that halt or inhibit the progression of tissue damage after abusive head
trauma. The overall objective in this application is to determine the contribution of seizures and hemorrhage in
the development of the damage and if the cascades of injury can be aborted. Our central hypothesis is that the
large forces generated from abuse causes extensive tissue damage that is primarily driven by an interplay
between focal seizures and hemorrhage and that the resultant damage cascades can be arrested with anti-
epileptic drugs. The rationale is that by understanding the pathophysiology and determining if the tissue is
salvageable, then therapeutics that potentially halt the damage can be tested. We will test our central
hypothesis with two specific aims:1.) Determine the contribution of seizures and hemorrhage to the
development of unilateral hemispheric hypodensity; and 2.) Determine if stopping seizures at a time when
children present to the emergency department prevents the extensive damage. Our contribution is the first
model of hemispheric hypodensity that replicates the potentially synergistic multifactorial injury cascades within
comparable developmental stages and brain morphology of human infants and toddlers where the
pathophysiology and contribution of seizures can be determined. This approach is innovative as it departs from
the status quo of using a single injury to induce “severe traumatic brain injury”; instead, we study the
synergistic interplay of multiple injuries and insults and manage 30 hours of critical care using standard
pediatric critical care protocols with clinically relevant outcomes. The proposed contribution is significant
because age-specific therapies that abort the cascades of the pathophysiology of abusive head trauma might
reduce the severity of neural damage and reduce the number of infants that die or are permanently disabled."
10906762,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 1
The lack of effective treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains a significant health problem and
highlights the need for novel and innovative approaches. Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of
the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells in the brain. For the past 15
years, our group and others have been testing active vaccination strategies, such as dendritic cells (DC) pulsed
with tumor lysate, to induce antitumor immunity in glioblastoma patients. From the interim results of the clinical
trial we initiated in our current SPORE funding period, we found that in addition to inducing T-cell infiltration into
brain tumors, DC vaccination + anti-PD1 blockade may also create a pro-inflammatory environment within the
tumor that induces the immigration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells (TIM). These cells are phenotypically
similar to the myeloid cells that dominantly attenuate the T-cell response to chronic viral infections, and may
counteract the effective anti-tumor T-cell responses induced by DC vaccination within the tumor
microenvironment. Therapies that target myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment represent a promising
new strategy. As such, inhibition of these myeloid cells using a CSF-1R inhibitor, in conjunction with autologous
tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination (ATL-DC) and PD-1 mAb blockade, resulted in significantly prolonged
survival in tumor-bearing animals with large, well-established intracranial (i.c.) gliomas. Our hypothesis is that
myeloid cells mediate adaptive immune resistance in response to T cell activation induced by
immunotherapy. In this SPORE Project renewal, we have planned a series of novel pre-clinical studies to re-
polarize myeloid cells, to optimize how the timing and sequence of immunotherapy can influence ant-tumor
immunity, and a new clinical trial to test the first-in-human combination of a new brain penetrant CSF-1R inhibitor
(CSF-1Ri; PLX3397, Daiichi-Sankyo) with DC vaccination and PD-1 mAb blockade (Pembrolizumab, Merck) in
patients with newly diagnosed GBM. A better understanding of the biology of these cellular interactions will
provide insight into more effective ways to induce therapeutic anti-tumor immune responses for this deadly type
of brain tumor. These studies span the continuum of translational research in brain tumor immunotherapy, and
will likely provided informative new insights for the development of new, rational immune-based strategies for
brain tumor patients."
10906764,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 2
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal of all cancers. This is in large part due to the inability of currently
available therapies to induce significant tumor cell death. Using integrated molecular (exome and RNAseq) and
functional (via BH3 Profiling) characterization of a large library of GBM patient specimens, compelling preliminary
data for this project identify that all GBM tumors are comprised of two molecular intrinsic apoptotic blocks –
consisting of MCL1 and BCL-xL – that drive basal GBM survival. Notably, while DNA damaging therapy (IR/TMZ)
or molecularly targeted therapy (e.g., EGFR TKI) can ablate the MCL1 block in a genotype specific manner, the
BCL-xL block persists ultimately driving resistance to apoptosis under these commonly used therapeutic
paradigms. These exciting new results, together with complementary findings from the previous SPORE funding,
has led to the hypothesis that selective targeting of BCL-xL in combination with either IR/TMZ or EGFR TKI can
overcome intrinsic apoptotic resistance and induce profound GBM tumor regressions. This SPORE Project
renewal will test this hypothesis through the following aims. Aim 1 will investigate whether a novel BCL-xL
antagonist (in collaboration with Abbvie) with GBM specificity has anti-tumor effects when combined with TMZ/IR
or a new, clinical brain penetrant EGFR TKI in preclinical GBM models. Aim 2 includes a “window of opportunity”
clinical trial to explore whether these novel clinical drugs can ablate the two intrinsic apoptotic blocks in recurrent
GBM patients. Finally, Aim 3 proposes to identify potential mechanisms of resistance to targeting the intrinsic
apoptotic machinery in diverse preclinical GBM samples. Together, the studies proposed in this application
present a new therapeutic paradigm through specific manipulation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in malignant
glioma and have the long-term potential to shift current approaches in glioma therapy."
10906768,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Biospecimen and Pathology Core (BiPC)
The Biospecimen and Pathology Core (Core 1), a biorepository and multi-faceted research resource, provides
critical support for the translational and diagnostic/therapeutic studies of the three major SPORE projects, the
Developmental Research projects and Career Enhancement programs of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer.
The SPORE projects and programs have a critical need for high-quality brain tumor biospecimens, associated
clinical and molecular annotations, histology, immunohistochemistry, genomic sequencing, and characterization
of models systems derived from the human biospecimens. The projects also require neuropathology and
biobanking expertise to accomplish their research aims. For Aim 1, the core will optimally collect, store, prioritize
and distribute high-quality brain tumor biospecimens. The core provides detailed annotation of collection and
preservation of biospecimens and tracks them with pertinent data through interfacing with the data management
platform of the Administrative Core (Core A) using Daedealus-BTM. Aim 2 of the core is to molecularly
characterize and analyze SPORE patient-derived tumor tissue and derivative models specific for each SPORE
project, using histologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and genomic tools. The core provides a variety of
neuropathology services related to the analysis of patient specimens (e.g. in situ hybridization, tissue
microdissection, immunohistochemistry, genomic analysis), as well as services related to the pre-clinical studies
and clinical trial components of the SPORE. The core also works with Core 3, the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
Core (BBC) to perform integrated comparative analyses of next generation molecular characterization of
samples and models derived from human glioma patients (e.g., germline, whole tumor, purified tumor cells,
gliomaspheres, and xenografts). Aim 3 of the core is to centrally create and provide novel human biospecimen
derivatives, patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX), and organoids to support SPORE major and
developmental projects. We will use our established protocols to create and characterize patient-derived
gliomaspheres, adherent cultures, and direct-from-patient animal orthotopic xenograft models representing the
molecular diversity of glioblastoma. Our novel gaussia (sGluc-GFP) reporter system will facilitate the analysis
of xenografted tumor models. The core will provide and utilize cerebral organoids and other cellular derivatives
to propagate rare tumor models and to study the tumor microenvironment, invasion, and therapeutic targets. The
core will also collaborate with the Administrative Core (Core A), the Neuro-Imaging Core (NIC, Core 2) and the
Biostatistics & Bioinformatics (BBC, Core 3) to develop an integrated clinical-radiologic-molecular pathological
characterization database and provide this to SPORE investigators, SPORE-associated clinical trials (projects
1-3), and public repositories. Our team approach will flexibly and robustly provide biobanking, neuropathology
expertise, cell culture, xenograft, genomics and clinical trial resources critical for the ongoing success of the
major and developmental research projects of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer."

format and able to accommodate a wide range of anxiety presentations are needed. Accordingly, Veterans
Anxiety Skills Training (VAST) was designed to be evidence-based, transdiagnostic, feasible for PCMHI, and
Veteran-centered. VAST comprises empirically-supported cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques
adapted into a manualized modular intervention specifically designed for delivery in PCMHI. As VAST is being
piloted at a single site with study therapists, the next scientific step is a multi-site randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to evaluate its effectiveness using PCMHI providers in routine care. Significance/Impact: This study
addresses Veteran care priorities of mental health and suicide prevention, MISSION Act priorities of increasing
access to care and improving patient satisfaction with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care, and Health
Services Research and Development (HSR&D) focus areas of quality, effectiveness, and efficiency as well as
implementation science research methods. Improving anxiety treatment in PCMHI will address a major gap in
VHA treatment options, given the high prevalence of anxiety in primary care, tendency for patients with anxiety
to seek treatment in primary care rather than specialty mental health settings, and absence of Evidence-Based

examination of fidelity to inform future implementation. Specific Aims: The specific aims are to: (1) Compare
patient clinical outcomes for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care between baseline and 16 weeks (post) in a multi-site
RCT in which PCMHI providers deliver VAST, and examine whether treatment gains are more likely to be
maintained for VAST vs. PCMHI usual care at 28 weeks (follow-up); (2) For participants assigned to receive
VAST, explore patient-level predictors of (a) early (8 weeks) and (b) overall (16 weeks) treatment response;
and (3) Conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation of VAST implementation to examine rates of, barriers to,
and facilitators of achieving and sustaining high-fidelity intervention delivery. Methodology: In this multi-site,
hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation RCT, 178 adult Veterans with elevated anxiety symptoms will be
recruited from primary care at two VHA sites. PCMHI providers will be randomized to deliver either VAST or
usual care (routine PCMHI care, meaning whatever care the provider deems appropriate), and participants will
be randomized to condition. VAST (up to six biweekly 30-minute sessions) consists of a standard initial and
final session as well as up to 4 CBT skills-based modules. The primary outcome (Overall Anxiety Severity and
Impairment Scale) and secondary outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptom severity, functioning, quality of
life, suicidality) will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16 (post) and 28 weeks (follow-up). Multi-level modeling
will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that patient clinical outcomes will improve more from baseline to 16
weeks for participants receiving VAST compared to PCMHI usual care. Multivariate logistic regression will be
used to explore predictors of early (8 weeks) and overall (16 weeks) VAST treatment response. A mixed-
methods process evaluation will examine the proportion of PCMHI providers who achieve and sustain high-
fidelity VAST delivery as well as barriers to and facilitators of high-fidelity delivery. Implementation/Next
Steps: VAST will be disseminated to VHA PCMHI leadership and providers nationwide using several
strategies, and a follow-up hybrid III trial will facilitate formal implementation in VHA PCMHI."

 VRC01 is prototypical broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb), capable of neutralizing diverse HIV strains.
Vaccine-based shepherding of VRC01 germline-reverted B-cells to the mature phenotype has proven difficult
in mouse models. The overall goal of the proposed research is to design and test novel immunogens for their
ability to guide the evolution of the VRC01 B-cell lineage towards a mature phenotype capable of producing
bNAbs. We have used existing structural information to aid in the design and construction of prototypes of
these immunogens, and we propose to use artificial intelligence-based protein design tools to engineer new
immunogens. Engineered immunogens will be tested for a defined set of biochemical attributes, fulfillment of
which will lead to testing in an animal model containing the VRC01 lineage.
 Specific aim 1 is to perform in vitro testing of existing prototype immunogens and proposed
immunogens. Binding assays will be performed to determine the affinity of our immunogens for germline-
reverted VRC01 mutants using surface plasmon resonance and cell-based methods. Additionally, we will
assay immunogens for their ability to activate B-cells in vitro using a flow cytometry-based method.
 Specific aim 2 is to test the engineered vaccines in a knock-in mouse model. We will test our
immunogens in a mouse model producing an overabundance of the VRC01 germline. We will monitor
populations of VRC01 germline B-cells using flow cytometry. We will also determine the complementary
determining region (CDR) sequences of flow-sorted VRC01-class B-cells to monitor affinity maturation in the
population. Lastly, we will determine neutralizing potency of sera from immunized mice during the course of
their vaccine regimen."
10918079,"Dr. Suzuki’s (PI) ultimate research goal is to identify environmental factors related to craniofacial
pathophysiology and develop novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for environmental
factor-associated oral diseases. This career development K02 award would provide the protected
time 1) to gain expertise in physical analysis of skeletal tissues, including Micro-CT, FIB-SEM and
QLF, and 2) to establish collaborative relationships with experts in environmental health science
field. The proposed research project aims to characterize the health effects of fluorinated
pollutants PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or organofluorine compounds) on tooth
development. PFAS are a group of man-made organofluorine compounds, including
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFOA precursor, Fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). PFAS do
not readily breakdown in the environment and are water-soluble. PFAS can be found in drinking
water and living organisms, including fish, animals and humans where PFAS can build up and
persist over time. Laboratory animal studies showed that PFAS can cause tumors and adverse
effects on reproductivity, development and immune system. Previous studies demonstrated that
FTOHs (precursor of PFOA) induced tooth malformation, including degeneration of ameloblasts
in rodent incisors. However, examination of how FTOHs alter tooth phenotype (physical and
histological) is limited and the molecular mechanisms of how FTOHs affect tooth development
are largely unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms of PFAS adverse
effects on odontogenesis. Our overall objective here is to establish PFAS (hazardous chemical)
use in an animal model and determine how FTOHs affect amelogenesis in vivo. Our central
hypothesis is that FTOHs induce DNA damage and mitochondrial damage to perturb ameloblast
function during tooth development that results in enamel malformation. Our hypothesis has been
formulated based on our preliminary data showing that PFOA inhibited cell proliferation, induced
apoptosis, DNA damage and mitochondrial damage in ameloblast-like cell (LS8 cells). The impact
of the proposed research is to define the effects of PFAS on tooth development and to highlight
the molecular mechanisms involved in tooth malformation. Once PFAS adverse effects are
identified in tooth formation, PFAS could be considered as a possible causative factor for
cryptogenic abnormalities in dentinogenesis, including Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH) of
which the etiology is unknown. We plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish our overall
objective by pursuing the Specific AIM: Identify FTOH effects on enamel phenotype in a mouse

10918257,"We propose to conduct a prospective cohort (observational) study of 150 participants with
moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) unable to tolerate positive airway pressure
who are undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), including measurement of upper
airway closing pressure (Pclose), and tissue-repositioning soft palate surgery. Before and 6
months after surgery, we will measure OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index) with sleep studies
(polysomnograms). Using our recently-validated polysomnography-based signal processing
algorithm, we will systematically assess the underlying mechanisms of OSA (traits) and airflow
shape (consistent with palate obstruction). The expected 90 participants without resolution of
OSA after surgery (surgery failures) will participate in an experimental randomized crossover
study of acetazolamide (1 month) and acetazolamide/eszopiclone combination (1 month).
Polysomnograms will be performed with each treatment, with algorithm-based determination of
traits. The research goals are: (1) to define how mechanistic traits modify effectiveness of
anatomic treatment (surgery) and (2) to examine the therapeutic efficacy of surgery in
combination with endotype-directed (especially loop gain- and arousal threshold-directed)
treatment. Aim 1: To determine the mechanistic factors modifying the impact of soft
palate surgery on airway collapsibility. Hypothesis: tissue-repositioning palate surgery will
decrease airway collapsibility, with the decrease greater with palate-only obstruction (based on
DISE and non-invasive airflow shape analysis). Aim 2: To evaluate the mechanistic factors
modifying efficacy of soft palate surgery on OSA severity. Hypotheses: surgery efficacy will
be independently associated with palate-only obstruction (DISE) and the following prior to
surgery: lesser airway collapsibility, lesser loop gain, and greater arousal threshold. Aim 3: To
evaluate the efficacy of combining surgery with loop gain and arousal threshold
interventions. Hypotheses: In surgery failures (non-responders), lowering loop gain
(acetazolamide) will lower OSA severity (expected response rate = 40%); efficacy will be
associated with lesser postoperative (prior to medication) airway collapsibility and greater
postoperative loop gain. Lowering loop gain and raising arousal threshold together
(acetazolamide/eszopiclone) will further reduce OSA severity (expected response rate = 60%);
efficacy will be associated with lesser postoperative airway collapsibility and the combination of
greater postoperative loop gain and lesser postoperative arousal threshold."
10918266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Monogenic kidney diseases such as cystinuria are well characterized genetically, but lack safe and effective
clinical treatments. Patients with cystinuria form numerous cystine-based stones in their urinary tract due to
failure to reabsorb cystine in renal proximal tubule cells, leading to chronic kidney disease in up to 70% of cases.
The most common subclass of cystinuria, type A, is a result of a homozygous deficiency of SLC3A1, which
encodes an amino acid transporter (rBAT) that reabsorbs cystine in proximal tubules. Recent advances in the
genome engineering field have allowed for potentially curative therapy for monogenic diseases
including cystinuria. Current barriers to renal genome engineering include delivery and sustained expression
of transgenes. However, cystinuria is an ideal model disease to investigate and potentially overcome these
barriers as the proximal tubule is targetable within the kidney, a low level of rBAT is estimated to prevent stone
formation, and cystinuria could be targeted at any stage of life. When designing renal gene therapy for cystinuria,
previous work has shown advantageous integration efficiency of transgenes using the piggyBac transposon
system. Kidney-targeted genome engineering using piggyBac transposons for in vivo models can be
accomplished with a novel proximal tubule-targeted adeno-associated virus (AAV). I hypothesize that the
combination of a renal specific AAV with piggyBac transposon integration of SLC3A1 will lead to stable, kidney-
targeted phenotypic correction in models of cystinuria. To test this hypothesis, I will engineer renal-specific AAV
vectors to contain piggyBac-SLC3A1 in AIM 1. Self-complementary AAV has shown improved kidney specificity,
but its’ compact size necessitates the splitting of SLC3A1 into two AAVs. Therefore, I will design a dual AAV
system that recombines in vivo to express full length SLC3A1 using homologous recombination and mRNA
splicing. I will also test the recombination and functionality of the dual AAV-piggyBac-SLC3A1 system in vitro. In
AIM 2, I will generate SLC3A1-/- kidney organoids derived from human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
I will then quantify expression of rBAT and cystine transport after delivery of the proposed system. Finally, I will
assess the potential of AAV-piggyBac-SLC3A1 to phenotypically correct cystinuria through prevention of cystine
stone formation in a mouse model of type A cystinuria in AIM 3."
10919174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes with important immune functions in killing virally infected
cells and cancer cells. NK cells have been explored for cancer immunotherapy and have advantages over T cell-
based therapies. However, their cytotoxicity and tumor immunosurveillance functions are often dysfunctional in
cancer patients, in large part due to elevated levels of TGF-β, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine. Cyclin-
dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a Cdk family proline-directed serine/threonine kinase. Unlike other Cdk members,
its kinase activity is primarily dependent on binding of the coactivator p35 or p39, and it has unclear cell cycle
roles. Cdk5 was thought to primarily function in neuronal cells, but recent research has discovered new roles for
Cdk5 and p35 in other cell types, including cancer and immune cells. For the first time, we have discovered that
Cdk5 and p35 protein are both expressed in NK cells and appear to play an important role in regulating NK cell
cytotoxicity. Additionally, TGF-β appears to induce p35 expression in NK cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Cdk5/p35 kinase activity negatively regulates NK cell
cytotoxicity and is a key mediator of TGF-β-induced NK cell dysfunction, and we also hypothesize that Cdk5/p35
inhibition can be utilized to enhance NK cell immunotherapy. First, we will explore how the Cdk5/p35 and TGF-
β signaling pathways overlap in NK cells. Using genetic tools to knock down p35, as well as the selective Cdk5
inhibitor roscovitine, we will determine whether Cdk5-inhibited NK cells can mitigate the various phenotypic
changes caused by TGF-β treatment. We will measure any changes in the expression of NK cell
activating/inhibitory receptors, lytic granule cytotoxic enzymes, and cytokine release. We will also determine how
TGF-β induces p35 expression in NK cells, then investigate the molecular mechanism of how Cdk5/p35 activity
regulates NK cytotoxicity. Whole transcriptome sequencing of p35 knockdown NK cells will be used to reveal
differentially expressed pathways downstream of Cdk5 kinase signaling. We also wish to explore the therapeutic
potential of Cdk5/p35 inhibition in enhancing NK cell immunotherapy. Using in vitro cytotoxicity assays against
cancer cell lines, we will determine whether p35 knockdown will enable NK cells to resist TGF-β-induced
suppression of cytotoxicity. Similarly, using established patient-derived xenograft mouse models, we will test
whether p35 knockdown NK cells are able to enhance NK cell adoptive therapy against patient-derived B cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which is known to cause NK dysfunction through elevated TGF-β
secretion. Discoveries from this project would advance our basic understanding of the signaling pathways that
regulate NK cytotoxicity and mediate NK dysfunction, potentially leading to improved NK cell-based cancer
immunotherapies."
10919176,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Intestinal cancer is the 3rd most common malignancy and cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and
women. Unfortunately, recent advances in our understanding of the underlying intestinal biology and cancer-
related pathways have not translated to significantly improved patient outcomes. While numerous animal
models of intestinal cancer have been developed, mostly based on misregulation of the β-catenin pathway,
some key features of human cancers (particularly tumor mutational burden) now known to be critical for tumor
progression and therapy response, have not been adequately modelled or investigated in animal models of
intestinal cancer.
 More recently, genome sequencing efforts led to the discovery of an intestinal cancer mutator phenotype
where single amino acid substitutions within proofreading domains of the housekeeping DNA polymerases
result in the highest mutation rates described in human cancers (ultramutation).
 Unlike human cancers, genetically-engineered animal models exhibit very low mutation rates, limiting their
utility for studies of intratumoral heterogeneity and competition, immune responses, and immune checkpoint
therapies, now known to be essential aspects of human tumor biology. We propose to overcome these
limitations in intestinal cancer animal models by building upon 1) a strong track record in the generation of
cancer animal models and novel genetic tools for their development 2) a well-characterized conditional PoleP286R
allele that we previously used to develop a robust model of endometrial cancer and 3) expertise in genomics,
inflammation, intestinal cancer, and mouse models of intestinal disease. These models will be useful not only
to recapitulate POL-driven intestinal cancers, but also to humanize any intestinal cancer mouse model with
respect to mutational burden. This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-20-131 to expand and improve the
development of mammalian models for translational cancer research."

This proposal is a five-year research and training plan with a scientific focus on interactions between CD8 T
cells and fibroblasts in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have found that the
majority of CD8 T cells in RA synovium have an unusual phenotype characterized by low expression of classic
cytotoxic proteins such as granzyme B, perforin, and granulysin. Instead, these cells express high amounts of
granzyme K, which induces synovial fibroblasts to produce pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6. Based on
our preliminary data, we believe that granzyme K does more than simply activate synovial fibroblasts. We
believe that granzyme K activates the complement system to induce so-called inflammatory priming of synovial
fibroblasts, characterized by metabolic reprogramming and augmented activation to stimuli.
The specific aims proposed here will investigate the interactions of CD8 T cells and synovial fibroblasts in three
complementary ways. Aim 1 interrogates whether human granzyme K induces the metabolic reprograming
associated with inflammatory priming and whether complement mediates the downstream effects of granzyme
K. Aim 2 uses imaging mass cytometry, traditional immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomics to
evaluate granzyme K+ CD8 T cells and their relationship with fibroblast subsets and complement deposition
within the context of human synovial tissues. Aim 3 uses mouse models of inflammatory arthritis to determine
the effects of granzyme K on clinical and cellular measures in inflammatory arthritis.
This study combines mechanistic studies, patient-derived samples, mouse models, and cutting-edge
transcriptomic technologies to provide the candidate new training in several key aspects of translational
immunology. The candidates immediate career development goals are to gain experience with microscopy
techniques, spatial transcriptomics, cellular metabolism, mouse models of autoimmune diseases, and
bioinformatic analysis. A specific career development plan is described by both the candidate and her mentor
Dr. Michael Brenner, MD, an expert in lymphocyte biologic and synovial inflammation. She also has the
support of an Advisory Committee of experts in the areas in which she will build her skills. The candidate’s
long-term goal is to attain a tenure-track faculty position pursuing research that integrates high-dimensional
analysis of patient samples with detailed mechanistic studies to characterize cellular interactions within tissues
in rheumatologic diseases, with the ultimate goal of identifying new cellular and molecular candidates for
diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases."

This application seeks to develop improve and expand a multi-platform clinical decision support system
(CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension
Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used in adults and children to: a) guide therapeutic decisions
and b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large
databases of completed trials in PAH, ongoing adult and Pediatric PAH registries and Biobanks. The proposed
aims co-create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering,
advanced PAH, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and palliative
care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the
acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a
prospective, multi-center META-Registry in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to modeling best
practice interventions leading to improved long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this

Microglia, the resident neuroimmune cells of the CNS, play important developmental roles. While brain
microglia have been extensively studied, less is known about the molecular properties and function of microglia
in the developing retina. The goal of this proposal is to address how retinal microglia change over the course of
development, the molecular pathways involved and how this relates to their function. The first aim will
determine whether there are molecularly distinct subpopulations of microglia in embryonic and early postnatal
retina. The second aim will address the function of microglia in the early postnatal retina by utilizing knowledge
about their gene expression signature and targeting them for depletion. Finally, in the last aim we will test how
developmental events govern retinal microglia phenotype and function, and the molecular pathways involved.
By determining how changes in microglial properties are regulated and contribute to development of the retina
we will gain insight into fundamental mechanisms of retina development and microglial function. This may
ultimately inform our understanding of how microglia are modulated and participate in degenerative disease
processes resulting in loss of vision.

 It has yet to be determined whether human brain myeloid cells (BMCs) serve as an important reservoir for
persistent HIV-1 (HIV) infection in the central nervous system (CNS). This is hampered by the challenges faced
in accessing fresh human brains. Therefore, our current knowledge of HIV CNS reservoirs in humans is largely
limited to in vitro microglia/macrophage models of HIV latent infections and animal studies from SIV-infected
NHP or HIV-infected humanized mouse models. There is an urgent need for innovative HIV latency models of
BMCs that are physiologically close to the cells in the human brain. By working with the “Last Gift” Program, we
have established a platform to isolate, expand, and characterize BMCs derived from people with HIV (PWH) on
antiretroviral therapy (ART). We showed that a near full-length HIV can be recovered from BMCs, which was
replication-competent in both T cells and BMCs. Bioinformatics analyses predicted the R5 tropism of this BMC
HIV strain, which was confirmed by in vitro infection in BMCs, during which BMC infection by this strain of HIV
was effectively dampened by a CCR5 inhibitor, Maraviroc. Pseudoviruses of Env cloned from this strain of BMC
HIV efficiently infected CD4low but CCR5high affinofile cells, supporting its M-tropism nature. Interestingly, human
BMCs expressed the newly identified HIV latency gene Nurr1 as well as anti-apoptosis genes, including Bcl-2
and MCL1, which could be essential for the stable HIV reservoir in BMCs.
 With the needed expertise to successfully isolate CNS cells (CNS T cells and BMCs) from postmortem fresh
brains, technical innovations of single-cell technique pipelines, and the unique and rare resource of the “Last
Gift” cohorts, this proposal will define the mechanism underlying the stable replication-competent HIV
reservoir in BMCs. We will isolate BMCs from the brains of ART-suppressed PWH. We will define replication-
competent HIV through de novo infections in T cells and BMCs as well as BMC-QVOA and T cell-QVOA
analyses. We will genotype BMC HIV by single genome amplification sequencing and phenotype it by Env-
pseudoviral infections in cells expressing low levels of CD4. We will characterize the transcriptionally active HIV
as a possible viral reservoir in BMCs (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will define the survival signaling pathways that may
be acquired in the latently infected BMCs. We will study latency reversal using epigenetic modulators in BMCs.
We will define the mechanisms of the epigenetic regulation of BMC HIV. We will also test whether previously
identified BMC transcription factors play essential roles in HIV latency in postmortem BMCs. In Aim 3, we will
examine new tools to directly target the transcription machinery of HIV to control viral reservoirs and delay or
prevent viral rebound, which may also limit immune activation.
 This proposal will address critical knowledge gaps in replication-competent HIV reservoirs in BMCs and
underlying molecular mechanisms. The tools and BBB-penetrating small molecules used in this proposal could
be developed into novel cure strategies to eradicate HIV from the CNS."

Automated docking is a computational method that is now routinely used for identifying small molecules that
have the potential to be new drugs. Over the past three decades we have developed docking methods and
our docking software AutoDock is not the most cited docking software with over 40,000 citations in the peer
reviewed literature. As such, it has become an important resource for the community. We seek to create a
national resource that will allow us to maintain and modernize this software to adapt to evolving hardware
platforms and operating systems, to keep the software up to date and relevant by incorporating the latest
algorithmic developments, and to support its large user community. In parallel with these efforts, an important
goal of the proposed Resource is to chart a path toward a self-sustained software ecosystem where
contributors from around the world will contribute to maintain and further develop this software after the
lifetime of this award. This goal has been achieved by other successful open source projects such as Debian
and Python, and the written interest of many colleagues bolster our confidence that the AutoDock software too
can reach this goal. To this end we propose three specific aims. Our first aim is to maintain and modernize the
software code. This critical work is needed for the software to remain functional and able to address the
evolving needs of the community. As we overhaul the software, we will leverage newer toolkits for generating
modern and intuitive graphical user interfaces. These interfaces enable researchers, such as clinical
physicians or chemists with limited computational skills for instance, to use docking to better understand the
mechanism of action of a drug and optimize it. Our second aim is concerned with making our software tools
interoperable with other important modeling software tools such as molecular dynamics for instance. Not only
does this augment the potential of docking to lead to novel therapeutic molecules, but it also serves our goal
to create a community of developers who will ultimately maintain this software ecosystem. Finally our third
and final aim is about supporting the large user community, growing it and ensuring that the software is easily
discovered, obtained and installed.
We have a long track record of developing open source software promoting best practices in software
engineering, and making these tools usable, useful, and available to the community. Likewise we have
supported and grown our user community for many years. This puts us in a unique position to create the
proposed research which, if funded, will allow us to convert this valuable software code into a community
supported software ecosystem ensuring that this software will continue to support the design of novel
therapeutic molecules beyond the lifetime of this award."

The Developmental Core will be the backbone of the JH-E-dARC, working across the Research Cores,
investigators and users to enhance capacities and opportunities for rigorous engagement and scientific
advancement in structural determinants of health research, including stigma and health equity research.
Creating capacity building and research opportunities that support the career development and scientific
advancement of structural determinants of health research is critical in coming years, because the HIV
response increasingly requires attention to closing gaps in access to equitable treatment and prevention
outcomes across populations. We must invest now in developing and supporting the next generation of
scientists who will lead the science of reaching and serving these communities with interventions and services
to improve equity. Through the Developmental Core of the dARC, we will foster a culture of innovation,
investigator development and collaboration through activities drawing from our experience of scientific
mentorship, technical capacity development and career development support. We will draw upon a team of
experts with inter-disciplinary expertise. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1: Develop a community of practice and
technical support to empower the next generation of stigma and structural determinants of health researchers.
Activities include a self-paced series of on-demand, short grant development videos that include content
specific to stigma and health equity concepts; internal review services for specific aims and coordination of
external reviews of grants; manuscript review and support on journal placement, revisions, and increasing
visibility and impact; and a seminar symposium series emphasizing career development. Aim 2: Advance the
proliferation and dissemination of science in measuring and responding to stigma and structural determinants
of HIV among emerging scientists. Bi-annual small grants will be made the Developmental Core, to support
new, stigma-related analyses of existing datasets. To bring in investigators new to these topic areas, we will
utilize mentorship models within the small grant system. Additionally, dissemination awards to report stigma-
related research at relevant conferences will be funded by the Core on a rolling basis to facilitate dissemination
and foster networking opportunities for early-stage investigators. Aim 3: Build partnerships with community
action groups, service providers and health departments to foster the meaningful engagement of impacted
communities in all phases of research. Core will liaise with community groups and representatives to build
academic-community partnerships for future grants. This process will improve the significance of grant
concepts by ensuring meaningful engagement with community partners and supporting the incorporation of the
priorities, ideas and capacities of community partners. Further, Core will support compensation of community
partners to engage in review of grant concepts and/or written text of academic grants. This process will better
integrate community input and mentorship within grant development and review."

The Intervention Core has a unique opportunity to greatly enhance the value of stigma and HIV intervention
research at JHU and Emory by implementing programs and establishing structures that foster collaborations
across a range of domains: junior and senior faculty; behavioral and biomedical prevention researchers;
prevention and treatment researchers; researchers in public health and other schools and departments within
JHU and Emory. While there several biomedical and behavioral interventions addressing HIV prevention and
treatment at JHU and Emory, there is a limited awareness and availability of evidence-based interventions
focused on stigma and structural determinants of HIV using appropriate study designs. To date, there is no
formal academic institutional structure that: (1) provides investigators with access to expertise in stigma and
HIV interventions, (2) offers foundation in the development and evaluation of stigma and HIV interventions, (3)
assists investigators with harnessing the full potential of innovative stigma and HIV interventions, and (4)
utilizes the guidance and expertise JHU and Emory investigators implementing stigma and HIV interventions.
We propose mechanisms through which an Intervention Core would establish a culture that clearly values the
goals of supporting investigators, training and collaboration and interdisciplinary research while providing an
infrastructure to facilitate these goals. Particularly, the Intervention Core aims to: Aim 1: Facilitate productive
collaborations between JHU and Emory intervention scientists and community organizations and encourage
investigators without prior intervention research experience to collaborate with Core-affiliated stigma and
HIV/AIDS intervention researchers. The core will link trainees and junior JHU and Emory faculty to Intervention
Core-affiliated investigators as mentors, link faculty to Intervention Core-affiliated community organizations as
collaborators, offer guidance in study design, implementation, and analysis from researchers in the Intervention
Core, provide opportunities to gain knowledge in intervention research through an Intervention Core Fellows
program and an annual training symposium, and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities by
providing regular intervention research updates, international and domestic conferences, and community-wide
town hall meetings. Aim 2: Foster expansion of the Maryland, Georgia, and international intervention research
base at JHU and Emory by increasing access to scientific services in support of stigma and HIV researchers.
Achieved by Facilitate access to faculty expertise in intervention research through an Intervention Core
Consulting Service which will link experts and community organizations with faculty, students, and community
organizations interested in engaging in this research area. Provide training on the development of
effectiveness and implementation studies addressing stigma and HIV through didactic webinars, experiential
learning, and intervention design and analytical assistance. Create and maintain an accessible repository of

Invasive urinary bladder cancer (invasive urothelial carcinoma, InvUC) is lethal in 50% of patients. Immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause dramatic remission of advanced InvUC, but only ~20% of patients have
this level of benefit. Pre-clinical animal models are critical for research to improve ICI outcomes, but
experimental models lack many of the hallmark features of human cancer and are poor predictors of outcomes
in humans. To address the gap in relevant animal cancer models for immunotherapy research, we will study
dogs with naturally-occurring InvUC as canine InvUC closely mimics the human condition in pathology,
molecular features including luminal and basal subtypes, clinical presentation, local invasion, and frequent
metastasis. The proposed work will strengthen the canine InvUC model by defining immune cell
responsiveness and ICI outcomes, with comparison to human studies. Our long range goal is to improve the
outlook for people with InvUC. The objective of this proposal is to address the gap by determining the suitability
of canine InvUC to serve as a model to improve ICI therapy in humans. The central hypothesis is marked
similarities will exist between dogs and humans in the immune cell responses in InvUC, and ICI therapy effects
including immune adverse events, antitumor activity, immunological responses, and predictors of treatment
success and failure. Some differences between dogs and humans are expected, with these also being
informative. The hypothesis is formulated and based on strong evidence in the literature and preliminary data.
The rationale is that demonstrating the shared immune cell responses and ICI effects between dogs and
humans with InvUC will allow the canine model to be fully employed to improve ICI therapy for humans. The
objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) determine similarities and differences between
dogs and humans in the immune cell responsiveness to InvUC, and (2) determine the safety and antitumor
activity of a canine PD-L1 antibody and predictors of success and failure in dogs with InvUC with comparison
to findings in humans. The approach will be to: (1) perform dog-human comparison of InvUC through analyses
of RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, WGS, and CITE-seq data, and (2) conduct a clinical trial of an ICI, our canine PD-L1
antibody, in dogs with InvUC to assess antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse event profile, and
correlative sequencing and clinical data to predict outcomes, and to compare results to those from human PD-
L1 antibody trials. The expected results will define shared immune cell responses and ICI effects in dogs and
humans, expand the understanding of predictors of ICI therapy, and justify use of the canine model to improve
ICI and other immunotherapies in humans. Samples from dogs in the ICI trial will also be made available for
other immune, microRNA, and microbiome research by our collaborators and beyond. We look forward to
contributing to the Canine Cancer Immunotherapy Network and depositing our study data in the NCI's
Integrated Canine Data Commons, to complement two InvUC data sets that we have previously deposited."

10921119,"SUMMARY
 Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability. Stroke-related costs in the United States came to
nearly $53 billion between 2017 and 2018. Available treatment options have been limited to early intervention
with tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular thrombectomy. Management of stroke relies on initial early
intervention and secondary management to reduce further brain damage and rehabilitation. There are no
pharmacotherapeutic treatments for stroke recovery. Commercial opportunities for stroke have been proposed
to focus on specific populations with specific treatments. Significant opportunities remain for effective treatments
for stabilization of patients and their recovery post-stroke.
 Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a major cause for neurodegeneration post-stroke. α7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation suppresses neuroinflammation and produces therapeutic benefits
after stroke in rodent models. We introduced positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of α7 nAChRs as a novel
therapeutic approach to the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and reported therapeutic efficacy of the
prototypical PAM, PNU120596 (i.e. PNU hereafter), after AIS in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) model of AIS with rapid reperfusion. The 7 nAChR is uniquely positioned as a target in AIS due to its
potent anti-inflammatory action through the cholinergic vagal anti-inflammatory pathway. Our data demonstrate
that PNU administered intravenously up to 6 hours after MCAO in rats significantly reduces infarct volume and
neurological deficits. Repeated sub-chronic treatments of PNU further improve benefits suggesting that sub-
chronic α7 nAChR activation is therapeutically relevant for post-stroke recovery. PNU remains the most valuable
drug candidate for development yet, despite having excellent efficacy after MCAO, PNU is unsuitable for clinical
applications because of poor solubility for IV use. In our previous studies, DMSO-based PNU (i.e. dPNU) was
used. We developed a novel PAM formulation, exemplified by EPGN2325. In preliminary studies in rats,
EPGN2325 demonstrated therapeutic efficacy comparable to dPNU. In the proposed study, our team aims to
optimize the formulation suitable for intravenous (i.v.) use in both acute (72h) and recovery (2 mos) phases
post-AIS. This proposal is the first step towards providing a novel α7 nAChR product to meet clinical needs. We
will test optimized EPGN2325 efficacy in mice in these proposed studies using clinically-relevant functional
assays for primary outcomes in stroke recovery. These studies will: 1) Develop a novel, clinically-relevant
formulation of optimized EPGN2325 suitable for AIS; and 2) Determine the PK/PD profile of optimized
EPGN2325 in acute and recovery (2 mos) phases post-AIS. The obtained data will determine the potential of
optimized EPGN2325 for development toward IND."
10921352,"A Novel Tool for Integrating Resident Preferences for Improving Service Delivery and Satisfaction
 in Long-term Care Settings
Abstract
 At any given time approximately 5% of older adults with an average age of 84 years are living in nursing
homes and assisted living communities. Federal regulations mandate a focus on person-centered care based
on knowing and honoring resident preferences. Yet despite good intentions, preferences are often overlooked
in the day-to-day press of managing residents in long-term care. When preferences are honored, residents
report greater satisfaction with care. Staff may report higher job satisfaction when they know and honor
resident preferences. Preliminary research has established there is a significant industry need for a
streamlined tool to capture and act upon resident preferences to improve the quality of care in long-term care
settings. The digital tool we envision will be called Care Preference Assessment of Satisfaction or
ComPASS™.
 Members of the research team have developed the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory (PELI), a
scientifically validated questionnaire that helps long-term care staff learn about a person’s most important
preferences. The PELI’s 72 questions focus on five key domains of an individual’s day-to-day life: 1) social
contact, 2) personal development, 3) leisure, 4) living environment, and 5) daily routine. Phrased in clear,
conversational language and tested with a diverse sample of older adults, the PELI gathers practical
information about how each person likes to live daily life – including preferred wake-up times, whether to take a
shower or bath and the recreational activities that bring the most pleasure. Information from the PELI helps
care teams customize services and activities, as well as build trusting relationships with residents that result in
better and more personalized care.
 Sixteen PELI questions are consistent with Section F of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0. The MDS is a report that is required to be gathered on every resident
residing in over 15,800 long-term care facilities annually. There is an opportunity to increase the value of data
gathering if resident care preferences can be shared digitally in a way that is utilized for care execution,
operations assessment, management, and required MDS reporting. This project will focus on establishing the
feasibility of overcoming institutional barriers and achieving these outcomes through a demonstration of the
impact of the ComPASS technology. This Phase I project will accomplish the following specific aims:
AIM 1: Complete 3 focus groups (administrators and IT, nursing staff, activities and certified nursing assistants)
to define the organizational needs, use of information, and barriers to implementation.
AIM 2: Expand the pilot digital tool (ComPASS-16) to a) enable additional PELI items flexibly for targeted data
gathering, b) provide summary data for caregivers to deliver resident preferences, and c) provide summaries
on delivered care for internal assessment and improvement and for MDS reporting.
AIM 3: Conduct a field test of ComPASS in 4 long-term care facilities and assess short-term impact.
With a successful implementation and demonstration of the impact on residents, staff, and administrators, we
will pursue full commercialization of ComPASS in Phase II. In doing so we will significantly improve the ability
of care staff to deliver preference-based care to older adults living in long-term care."

10916633,"Abstract: Mayo Clinic Nephrology & Urology Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (nuSURF)
 The Mayo Clinic has a rich history in both basic science and clinic science research in Nephrology & Urology,
and has active PhD, MD and MD-PhD training programs. Annually, the Mayo Graduate School receives >1500
applications from Undergraduates to work with Mayo Clinic Investigators. The Mayo Clinic is home to both an
Kidney Stone Research Center as well as a Mayo Translational Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) Center. Both
Mayo Centers have been NIH funded. 2011-2013 both Centers have received supplemental funds to support
summer undergraduate research related to kidney stones and PKD, respectively. This second renewal proposal,
in response to RFA-DK-23-013 (R25) merged these successful summer undergraduate programs into a more
generalized Mayo Clinic Nephrology & Urology Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (nuSURF; ~234
total students). Numerous students from Mayo's programs have entered or finished PhD, MD, MD-PhD, DO,
DMD, VDM, MPH and MBA programs, or have co-authored Nephrology or Urology-oriented peer-reviewed
papers. The “fruit” of the nuSURF program is that more than 25 federal / foundation grants were awarded,
and at least 16 alumni (of 234) are in Nephrology or Urology-related research or clinical areas.
 Over the next 5 years, we proposed to fund 14 students/summer (70 students total) through nuSURF to
work specifically with Mayo Investigators engaged in basic or translational research in Nephrology & Urology.
This 5 year period will allow undergraduates in the program to perform innovative Nephrology & Urology research
with leading Mayo Clinic research laboratories. Students will also participate in various educational programs
(e.g., weekly seminars and mini-courses) to enhance their research experience. Their 10-week summer
experience will culminate with (1) a 10-minute oral presentation of their work, (2) a Mayo-wide Summer
Undergraduate poster presentation (> 180 student/yr) and (3) a NIDDK-KUH Summer Undergraduate Research
Symposium held annually at the end of the Summer at one of the funded R25-centers. Following the Summer
Program, students will be academically tracked to determine the effectiveness of the Mayo nuSURF experience
in Nephrology & Urology, basic research and clinical medicine. Our goal is to continue increasing the number of
basic and clinical Nephrology & Urology researchers through this nuSURF training experience. Thusfar, ~10%
of our nuSURF alumni (those who have graduates college) are pursuing Nephrology or Urology-related careers."

“The Virus Structure and Assembly Conference” is the premier international meeting for structural virology,
attracting hundreds of researchers at every career level from around the world. Organized as part of the FASEB
Science Research Conference series, it has been running biennially since 1990. The Conference covers a broad
range of bacterial and eukaryotic viruses, with an initial focus on virus structure and assembly pathways,
mechanisms of virus entry, virus-host interactions, and viral replication, recently expanded to encompass viral
genomics and evolution, therapeutics, vaccines, and nanotechnological applications. A unique feature of the
Virus Structure and Assembly Conference has been the ability to merge and integrate tremendous advances in
biophysical studies of viruses with functional aspects of virus biology. Fueled by the cryo-electron microscopy
revolution, the FASEB meeting has brought together structural biologists, virologists, and microbiologists,
promoting interactions and guiding young researchers to embrace studies on viruses. The broad focus on virus
systems studied from different angles encourages inter-disciplinary approaches, stimulates collaborations, and
supports the rapid transfer of technology, overcoming silos and roadblocks of more topic-focused conferences.
To maintain its legacy of scientific innovation in virology, our program includes top investigators in all areas of
structural virology from around the world, more than one-third of whom are new to the Conference. For 2024,
we will strengthen the focus on pandemic readiness with ample exposure to RNA viruses such as HIV-1,
Influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.
 A vital aspect of the FASEB Virus Structure and Assembly Conference pedigree is the focus on mentoring
and training sessions that we achieve through extensive small-group activities between senior and junior
researchers. Scientific discussions with speakers and among participants are vital to encourage the flow of new
ideas and new collaborations, expanding the base and bringing new scientists to the Conference. In 2024, we
will have feature daily “Meet the Expert” sessions as well as “Meet the Sponsor” and “Flash Talk” sessions for
graduate students to present posters selected by our judges for 15-minute platform talks. A rich “Career
Development Workshop” will be offered to early-stage researchers with guests from academia, the private sector,
and government agencies, who will present, compare and contrast alternative career paths in science. All
sessions will keep a strong focus on women and underrepresented groups in science, creating awareness and
promoting scientific inclusiveness. Robust fundraising primarily made possible by our super-sponsor Thermo
Scientific and support through this NIH R13 will allow us to offer travel scholarships to an unprecedented number
of graduate students, postdocs, and early-stage researchers. While continuing the tradition of top-quality FASEB
meetings, the 2024 Virus Structure and Assembly Conference will also substantially attempt to enlarge the
scientific base and promote the participation of underrepresented scientists."

 Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CME) is responsible for more than 15% of the total deaths of AIDS
patients. The disease claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year, with global mortality rates of ~70%
despite antifungal therapies. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine clinically available for cryptococcosis. The
challenges of preventing and treating this fungal disease motivate our investigation of cryptococcal pathways
that can induce a strong protective host response. The encapsulated fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is
known to undergo yeast-to-filament morphological transition. We previously showed that morphotype of this
fungus has a profound effect on its interaction with various hosts. In mammalian models of cryptococcosis, the
yeast form is pathogenic while the filamentous form is not. We established that the transcription factor Znf2,
which drives filamentous growth, is a powerful anti-virulence regulator. Cryptococcal cells overexpressing
ZNF2 (ZNF2oe) are avirulent and elicit strong and long-lasting protective immunity, which serves as an effective
vaccine against subsequent lethal challenges. Importantly, we showed that once mice are vaccinated with
ZNF2oe cells, their CD4+ T cells are dispensable for protection at the time of fungal challenge (mimic
people with HIV prior to AIDS). Furthermore, vaccination with ZNF2oe cells even in hosts with pre-
existing CD4+ T cell deficiency is also protective against cryptococcosis (mimic AIDS patients). These
findings are important because the majority of cryptococcosis patients are AIDS patients with low CD4+ T cell
counts, and our preclinical studies suggest that cryptococcal vaccines could be effective in these individuals.
 The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the filamentation pathway and explore it for
therapeutics (e.g. vaccines). We have made significant progress in establishing the link between morphotype,
virulence and immunity, and discovered multiple regulators required for both Znf2-directed filamentation and
Znf2-induced host immunity. Recently, we also identified mutations that block Znf2's function in filamentation,
but do not affect its ability to induce host protective effects. These findings provide a unique opportunity to
pinpoint cryptococcal factors associated with host protective effect of Znf2. Because ZNF2oe in both heat-
inactivated and live cells provides host protection, we predicted that extracellular components of ZNF2oe cells
are important protective immunogens. Consistently, host protection elicited by ZNF2oe cells depends on the
capsule where extracellular antigens are localized. Additionally, our preliminary data revealed that some
antigens are secretory proteins including several glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins.
Capitalizing on these discoveries and our expertise in mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) technology, we
aim to (1) define cryptococcal factors that are important for Znf2's anti-virulence effect; (2) identify
immunogens that elicit protective host responses; and (3) use selected immunogens to develop
mRNA-LNP or recombinant protein vaccines against cryptococcosis."
10918313,"Quantitative model-based ESUS reclassification using cardiac and cerebral vessel wall MRI
Stroke is a major cause of death and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke is the
dominant stroke variety, representing approximately 80+% of strokes in the United States. Defining the specific
underlying pathophysiology of ischemic strokes is critical for personalized secondary prevention treatments with
the goal of minimizing the risk of recurrent events. However, even with extensive diagnostic workup in current
clinical practice, a large portion of ischemic strokes are classified as embolic stroke of undetermined source
(ESUS), leaving these patients without optimal treatment tailored to their specific pathophysiology. Recent
literature has demonstrated that among subjects diagnosed with ESUS, there may be under-detected lesions of
atherosclerosis in intra/extracranial arteries or cardiac pathology on a path towards atrial fibrillation, a so called
“atrial cardiopathy”. This implies that there are opportunities to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of etiologic
diagnosis to reduce ischemic strokes classified into the ESUS category, allowing for more targeted, personalized
secondary prevention measures. New developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of intra/extracranial
atherosclerosis and atrial cardiopathy may provide new opportunities to detect these currently under-detected
lesions and allow reclassification of ESUS patients into large-artery atherosclerosis or cardioembolic categories
leading to focused treatment strategies.
However, there are still significant challenges to using these imaging methods in practice: 1) Specialized vessel
wall and cardiac MRI (ESUS-imaging) and image analysis algorithms need to be integrated into the standard of
care workflow of stroke patients; 2) A model-based analysis will be needed that combines new findings from
ESUS-imaging and findings from existing clinical workup so that new “risk features (RFs)” can be defined for
reclassification; and 3) The impact of using these RFs on stroke subtype reclassification needs to be studied
prospectively. In this proposal, we plan to develop a model-based analysis focused on ESUS-imaging and test
the hypothesis that among acute ischemic stroke subjects diagnosed as ESUS under current clinical workup, a
new set of RFs drawn from ESUS-imaging will allow reclassification of a subset of ESUS into large-artery
atherosclerosis or cardioembolic categories. The specific aims will: 1) establish new vessel wall and cardiac MRI
(ESUS-imaging) and image analysis techniques; 2) develop a multiparametric statistical model that combines
information from the standard stroke workup and new ESUS-imaging to identify a set of RFs that can reclassify
ischemic stroke etiology; and 3) evaluate the impact of the model on ischemic stroke subtype re-classification.
If successful, this proposal will help to establish a clinical workflow that includes ESUS-imaging in ischemic stroke
workup and provide a model-based algorithm to assist in future stroke subtype classification."
10918324,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Restrictive eating disorders (R-EDs) are among the most lethal psychiatric illnesses and common in
adolescence. The proposed K23 resubmission will increase our understanding of the brain barrier in R-EDs
and test a novel therapeutic target (estrogen) as a neuroprotective moderator of brain barrier functioning,
ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes in R-EDs. My epidemiological research demonstrates that
widespread immune dysregulation is prevalent in R-EDs. Estrogen deficiency is common in R-EDs (~60%) and
may drive neuroinflammation in R-EDs due to the neuroprotective effects of estrogen on the brain barrier. It
remains unclear whether central nervous system (CNS) inflammation (e.g., neuroinflammation) is present in R-
EDs, and whether therapy directed at a novel CNS target has beneficial effects on inflammation in R-EDs This
K23-Patient Oriented Research Career Development award application uses an innovate translational
neuroscience approach to examine the impact of estrogen deficiency and replacement on inflammation, brain-
barrier functioning, and core symptoms of R-EDs. By leveraging an ongoing R01 investigating the clinical utility
of 12-weeks of estrogen replacement in hypoestrogenemic females with R-EDs, we will evaluate the influence
of estrogen replacement (vs. placebo) on inflammation markers (Aim 1), the brain barrier – measured using
non-invasive neuroimaging to characterize volume, perfusion, and brain parenchyma extracellular water (Aim
2), and core eating disorder symptoms (Aim 3). The training aim corresponding to this project will support Dr.
Lauren Breithaupt in becoming an independent translational scientist with a program of research examining
neuroinflammation in eating disorders to identify novel therapeutic treatment targets. Each aim of the study
corresponds to a specific training goal, which will map onto three main areas of competency for Dr. Breithaupt :
(1) advanced clinical neuroscience principles, (2) non-invasive imaging of brain barrier functioning, and (3)
psychoneuroimmunology. Training goals will be implemented under the guidance of Drs. Kamryn Eddy
(primary mentor), Marek Kubicki and Madhusmita Misra (co-mentors), Cynthia Bulik, Marco Loggia, Steven
Arnold, David Alsop, Beth Stevens, (scientific advisors), and Diego Pizzagalli (collaborator)."

 While monoclonal antibodies inhibiting immune checkpoints (ICI) and CAR T-cell therapies have
dramatically changed the therapeutic options for many cancer patients, up to 60% of patients will experience
immune-related adverse events (irAE) depending on the tumor type and immunotherapy. Thus, many patients
treated with immunotherapy will not see long term benefit and therefore only suffer potential side effects (and
possibly hyper progression), and the importance of predicting and managing immunotherapy-related adverse
events has already been identified as a critical gap in knowledge and clinical practice. Significantly, a common
molecular node of integration between the various inflammatory mechanisms of irAE, particularly in the subacute
setting, focuses on spurious activation of the innate immune system. Recently, we reported the synthesis and
validation of 4-[18F]fluoro-1-naphthol ([18F]4FN), a novel redox-tuned radiopharmaceutical for the selective
imaging of high energy oxygen and nitrogen radical species (RONS) by PET/CT. [18F]4FN provides a convenient
reagent for rapid, quantitative whole-body imaging to identify and monitor inflammatory foci generated by NADPH
oxidase-2 (NOX2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) of the innate immune system and multi-organ inflammation,
including immunotherapy-mediated irAE. Monitoring irAE by PET imaging is the long-term clinical imaging goal
of our line of investigation. Near-term, we propose to investigate the role of activated innate immunity in vivo by
combined molecular imaging and multiplexed analysis of tissues in mechanism-based pre-clinical murine models
of irAE for which we can enhance our understanding of the activation dynamics of innate immunity and gain
signals of efficacy."
10918326,"PROJECT SUMMARY
WNT pathway hyperactivation is a dominant oncogenic driver in colorectal cancer (CRC), and directly linked to
disease progression and drug resistance in many other cancer types, including lung (LUAD), breast and prostate
cancer. Indeed, there is strong evidence from pre-clinical model systems that targeting hyperactive WNT
signaling can provide significant therapeutic benefit in multiple cancer models. We and others have shown that
blocking the function of redundant Tankyrase enzymes (TNKS and TNKS2) can suppress hyperactive WNT
signaling, impede cancer cell proliferation and drive differentiation, particularly in CRC. However, WNT signaling
is also critical for the homeostatic maintenance of multiple organ systems. Consequently, drugs that effectively
block WNT, like TNKS inhibitors, have shown a range of on-target toxicities in essential tissues such as the
intestine and bone. Defining a strategy for tumor-restricted WNT pathway suppression is a major goal in precision
oncology.
Advanced cancers often contain significant disruptions to their genomes, including gains and losses of large
chromosome segments. These large-scale alterations encompassing many genes are presumed to support
cancer cell growth. However, they also lead to loss of ‘passenger’ genes that do not drive cancer progression,
but may unintentionally ‘rewire’ the signaling networks. Such cancer-specific collateral damage may provide
opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We will test the hypothesis that a large chromosomal deletion on
chromosome 8p, which induce loss of TNKS, create a tumor-specific dependency on TNKS2 that can be
exploited to block WNT only in cancer cells. Because normal cells express both redundant family members, they
should remain unaffected by selective targeting. In Aim 1, using a panel of CRC, LUAD and breast cancer cell
lines and patient-derived organoids, in combination with CRISPR-based genome editing, we will determine how
heterozygous and homozygous chromosome deletions impact the response to TNKS2 inhibition. Further, we will
define downstream protein targets that are most sensitive to TNKS disruption and TNKS2 suppression. In Aim
2 we will exploit a unique transgenic shRNA system we developed, to define the safety of systemic and selective
TNKS2 inhibition in vivo and determine the efficacy of selective TNKS2 inhibition in immunocompetent animal
models of aggressive CRC and LUAD. Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of novel TNKS2-selective small
molecules in cancer cell lines and organoid models and evaluate potential mechanisms of therapy resistance to
TNKS2 inhibition.
Identifying a safe and effective approach to block hyperactive WNT signaling in multiple tumor types could have
a profound impact on the clinical management of advanced cancers. Thus, we believe our work will contribute
substantially to the overall goal of developing safe and effective targeted therapies for WNT-driven cancers."

 Cancer research is often driven by hypotheses that postulate that a specific protein is important for the
disease, hypotheses often tested by adding an antibody to that system. The technology to be developed here will
create new reagents (AEGISbodies and AEGISCleavers) that not only bind a target protein (like an antibody), but
also cleave it, at a cost 10 to 100 fold lower than a service-provided antibody, in weeks rather than months, and
across a range of affinities that support quantitative research. These will be obtained by applying laboratory in
vitro evolution (LIVE) to libraries built from an artificially expanded genetic information system (AEGIS), and
decorated with precisely selected chemical groups. AEGIS is a biopolymer like DNA, but with up to 12 building
blocks, enhanced folding, greater stability, and functional groups that assist in the cleavage reaction, which
gives products where an AEGISCleaver is covalently attached to a fragment of the target peptide.
 AEGIS-LIVE has high level of technical readiness because of preliminary studies that created (a) platforms to
manufacture AEGIS DNA, (b) a molecular biology to support AEGIS-LIVE, and (c) sequencing, fold prediction,
and other tools to analyze the products of AEGIS-LIVE. The team has proven the cancer-relevance of AEGIS-LIVE,
creating AEGISBodies that bind specifically and selectively to breast and liver cancer cells, to cancer-relevant
proteins heterologously expressed on mammalian cell surfaces, and to isolated proteins from anthrax. The first
catalytic AEGISzymes are in hand. To further this technology development, we will:
Aim 1. Apply AEGIS-LIVE to create AEGISbodies that bind Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), a recognized
target for cancer therapy. We will also target extracellular peptide loops in the PD-L1 fold, made from L- and D-
amino acids. The second are mirror images of the natural amino acids, and allow production of mirror image L-
AEGISbodies that are stable against nuclease digestion. We will metric these for binding affinities and stability,
and validate their efficacies compared to current technologies.
Aim 2. Apply AEGIS-LIVE to create L- and D-AEGISCleavers that cleave peptides from PD-L1, and the analogous
segments when embedded in the complete protein. We will metric and benchmark these for affinity, cleavage
rates, and stability against nucleases.
 The new reagents will be transformative since they do things that antibodies cannot: covalently tag and destroy
target proteins. Further, the reagents are expected to be stable in biological fluids, including cell culture, blood,
and living animals. Longer term, ultra-stable AEGISCleavers may even come to be diagnostic and therapeutic
tools."

 The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in hematologic malignancies, especially in
multiple myeloma (MM). Each cellular and non-cellular component of the TME exerts a different effect on MM
cell survival, proliferation, immune evasion, and resistance to treatment. Several studies have shown that CAR-
T therapy produces an overall response rate of 78% in the relapsed/refractory MM setting; however, many
patients still relapse, and the median time to disease progression is about 1 year. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to define mechanisms of disease progression and resistance to CAR-T and bispecific antibodies using an
in vitro cell culture system that mimics the complex TME.
 Continuous progress in tissue engineering, including the development of various 3D scaffolds and
microfluidic systems, has improved the diversity, fidelity, and capacity of culture models that can be used in
cancer and other disease research. Most 3D in vitro culture systems lack the integral TME and dynamic perfusion
and/or influence immune-tumor crosstalk or/and prolonged culture capabilities. In addition, most models cannot
mimic the hypoxic gradients observed in tumors, which dramatically reduces the efficacy of molecular and
cellular therapeutics. The hypoxic TME likely protects tumors against immunotherapies by altering cellular
metabolism and inducing immune suppression. Therefore, an ideal experimental in vitro cell culture system
should mimic the heterogeneous nature of the hypoxic TME to allow a more complete understanding of cancer
cell and immune cell biology, immunotherapy validation, and development of efficacious treatment strategies for
clinical application. To address the aforementioned limitations, in this proposal, we will focus on developing a
novel microfluidic droplet-based platform (MDP) technology to generate and analyze a 3D biomimetic
multicellular immunogenic tumor model and test its capabilities to (1) establish multiple levels of hypoxia within
the same tumor-chip for parallel processing; (2) investigate spatiotemporal interaction between TME cancer-
immune cells during therapy; (3) quantify the impact of state-of-the-art targeted immunotherapy efficacy and
define multiparametric (dynamic, secretomic, and transcriptomic) responses for a comprehensive analysis of cell
fate. We will incorporate patient tumor cells and their microenvironment in MDP to predict the status of the patient
as a potential responder or non-responder. Potential responders to immunologic therapy such as CAR-T will
benefit from not having to wait for several months in clinic to determine whether the therapy has achieved
response or not, while potential non-responders will be spared the side-effects of non-effective treatment and
help clinicians choose other forms of therapy. Our approach will therefore result in the development of a versatile
and multifunctional system that can serve as a new and innovative technology for deep analysis of cell-cell
interactions and predicting the optimal therapy for individual patients and significantly advance the goal of
personalized medicine."

COVID-19 launched mRNA vaccines to the forefront as the most effective and rapid strategy to respond to the
pandemic. mRNA vaccines require formulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to protect the mRNA from
degradation and to achieve efficient intracellular delivery. However, LNP-mRNA vaccines pose a real risk of
causing transient myocarditis and a requirement for ultra-cold storage to maintain stability. Gene gun (GG)
delivery holds considerable potential to improve the safety and stability of RNA vaccines. GG delivery results in
the direct microinjection of DNA and/or RNA vaccine-coated gold microparticles into cells of the epidermis.
Delivery into the highly immunocompetent skin layer, including direct transfection of local antigen presenting
cells, results in robust immunogenicity with very low doses of DNA or RNA. In addition, the dry, nuclease-free
formulation holds potential to offer stable ambient formulation that could obviate the need for ultra-cold storage.
GG delivery to the epidermis is also needle-free and pain-free and eliminates the need for LNP formulation that
may contribute to the rare adverse events, including myocarditis associated with mRNA/LNP vaccines.
Furthermore, GG delivery into the skin, in contrast to the muscle, elicits robust mucosal antibody and T cell
responses that could enhance protection from mucosally transmitted diseases. In the 1990s, PowderJect
Vaccines developed a prototype clinical GG that showed, for first time, the ability of a DNA vaccine to induce
protective levels of immunity in humans. Orlance has since implemented engineering improvements to this
device resulting in enhanced dose delivery, immunogenicity, and field-/clinic-friendly features such as battery
power, automatic dose advancement, and lock-out functions. Historically, the GG delivered only DNA vaccines
but due to its physical mechanism of intracellular delivery, we have found that GG can also efficiently deliver
RNA vaccines in a dry formulation that could offer significant advantages in warmer temperature stability, efficacy
at lower doses, and improved safety/reactogenicity. Indeed, our preliminary studies show that the GG can
effectively deliver RNA vaccines and GG delivery of low doses of RNA induces comparable immunogenicity as
RNA vaccines delivered in LNPs. In Phase I SBIR, we will optimize RNA formulations for GG delivery. With
further optimization, we hypothesize that GG delivery of RNA vaccines will offer substantial advantages over
current mRNA/LNP vaccines with respect to stability and safety while achieving comparable systemic
immunogenicity and superior mucosal immunogenicity. In Aim 1, we will identify an optimum formulation for GG
delivery of RNA vaccines including maximum loading, functional integrity, stability, and immunogenicity. In Aim
2, we will determine if GG delivery of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines are stable at room temperature
or 4°C and can induce comparable or superior systemic or mucosal immune responses with lower reactogenicity
when compared LNP/RNA vaccines. If successful, these studies will provide an alternative RNA vaccine delivery
strategy with advantages in mucosal immunity, safety, stability, dose sparing, and pain/needle-free delivery."

Project Summary
Vivreon is an innovative life sciences company that is developing a novel small molecule Ca2+ channel
therapeutic lead candidate to delay the progressive muscle weakening associated with dystrophinopathies,
including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The lead modulates the Orai1 Ca2+ channel which has recently
been validated as a drug target in preclinical models. To this end, Orai1 is upregulated in skeletal muscle of
dystrophin mutants and skeletal muscle-specific knockout of Orai1 improves muscle force generation in
preclinical models of DMD. Orai1 upregulation in disease leads to cytotoxic Ca2+ overload as well as activation
of the myofibrillar protease calpain. The subsequent skeletal muscle fibrosis and necrosis leads to chronic
activation and recruitment of resident and peripheral leukocytes, including neutrophils and macrophages leading
to secondary pathological chronic inflammation. A role for Orai1 activity as an activator of nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT) and κB (NF-κB) transcription factors in these cells is well established. Therefore, the
lead, with its excellent oral bioavailability, potency, and ability to abrogate multiple pathological processes, is a
strong candidate for reducing the progressive muscle weakening in DMD. This grant effort will further assess the
suitability of the candidate drug’s properties and its efficacy in preserving muscle force generation in a DMD
model.
The candidate compound does not inhibit seven primary cytochrome P450 enzyme activities, demonstrates
promising preliminary pharmacokinetic properties, and possesses low nM potency against the Orai1 channel. In
Aim 1 we will assess the toxicity profile of the therapeutic candidate to identify an appropriate dose for efficacy
studies. In Aim 2 we will test the efficacy of the candidate for reducing eccentric contraction-induced muscle
damage using a well-validated in situ muscle force generation system in a model of DMD. Additional endpoints
will include serum creatine kinase levels and histology to assess gross muscle structure, inflammatory infiltration
and fibrosis. We will compare our candidate to another cytotoxic Ca2+ targeted small molecule therapeutic that
is currently in Phase 2 clincal trials for DMD. Our goal is a 50% improvement of muscle force production.
Achieving these milestones will signal that the candidate therapeutic should be developed as a candidate for
dystrophinopathy therapy."

 Radiation therapy is a potent element of standard cancer care, used in the treatment of over half of all
cancer patients. While the clinical benefits of radiotherapy are well documented, the dose to adjacent and
intermeshed normal organs and subsequent toxicity remains the biggest obstacle to continued escalation of
radiation doses to tumors in order to obtain cancer cures with RT. Significant number of patients will develop
locally persistent/recurrent tumors after radiotherapy. Therefore, radiosensitizing compounds, radiosensitizers,
have been developed to enhance tumor killing effects without escalation of radiation doses. However, their
clinical applications are limited due to invasive or insufficient tumor delivery and lack of specificity or systemic
toxicity. The goal of this project is to develop a prodrug-based therapeutic strategy empowered by a
nanotechnology pioneered by us —in cellulo nanoassembly—to amplify and enhance radiotherapeutic efficacy
for treating prostate cancer. Unlike common nanoparticle-based delivery approach, this delivery strategy does
not rely on the tumor enhanced permeability and retention effect. We propose to take advantage of the intrinsic
heterogeneous response to radiation therapy by targeting this initial population of apoptotic cells for depositing
radiosensitizers and enhancing radiotherapeutic effects. The project will develop and characterize the new
prodrug radiosensitizers for targeting apoptosis (Aim 1); investigate the pharmacokinetics, toxicity and validate
the in vivo treatment mechanism (Aim 2); and develop an image-guided treatment strategy, followed by a
comprehensive evaluation of the therapeutic benefit in orthotopic prostate cancer mouse models (Aim 3)."

Approximately 34 million people in the United States suffer from Diabetes Mellitus. Some of the early
complications of diabetes are glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy. Despite being a temporary increase
in kidney function, hyperfiltration progresses into irreversible damage to the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB)
and nephron. Hyperfiltration is additionally one of the secondary effects of heart failure and can be a
precipitating cause of progressive heart failure. Being able to stop the progression of glomerular hyperfiltration
may help stem the development of diabetic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. As such, we seek to
develop a physiomimetic Organ on a Chip model of the glomerular filtration barrier to aid in studying the
progression of hyperfiltration. This model will help to facilitate an understanding of the cellular changes to the
endothelial cells and podocytes that make up the glomerular filtration barrier. To mimic the GFB, we have co-
cultured podocytes and endothelial cells on opposite sides of a porous collagen membrane scaffold. The
membrane can be transplanted into our Organ on a Chip device, and media can be run across the basal and
apical sides of the membrane in two separate channels. Our model can effectively recapitulate the effects of
both causes of hyperfiltration, osmotic and hydrostatic. Our pressure control system on the chip allows us to
control the hydrostatic pressure across our GFB, specifically adjusting the pressure in the apical and basal
culture chambers. Alteration of the media protein concentrations allows for osmotic control. Modeling
hyperfiltration will allow us to demonstrate the cytoskeletal changes, upregulation of cell-glomerular basement
membrane attachment proteins, that occur in the podocytes and endothelial cells. Additionally, we will show
that peak hyperfiltration will lead to scarring and buildup of membrane proteins in the GFB that will lead to
decreased filtration as is seen in human hyperfiltration progression."
10910918,"Project Summary/Abstract
All essential 24-hr operations (e.g., first responders, hospital services) rely on nightshift workers who forgo
nocturnal sleep for work. Shift workers comprise 20% of the workforce, with 15 million regularly working nights.
Most do not adapt to the inverted sleep-wake schedule, resulting in shift work disorder (SWD) characterized by
excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia with sleep loss. Furthermore, because nightshifts are critical to safety-
sensitive operations, the risk for catastrophic accidents makes SWD a threat to public health and safety. There
remain critical gaps in the clinical translation of shift work research into validated treatments for SWD. One gap
is a lack of mechanistic research in large clinical samples of SWD that probe pertinent treatment targets. As
such, treatments have predominantly focused on symptom management (e.g., stimulants to maintain alertness
and hypnotic medications for sleep). Symptom management alone leaves the underlying mechanisms
unabated which can continue to cause a myriad of acute and long-term problems and morbidities. To address
this gap, the overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate critical and novel mechanisms driving SWD. Our
long-term goal is to develop a treatment that identifies and targets the appropriate underlying mechanisms in
SWD. Our pilot data indicates that in addition to circadian misalignment (i.e., a mismatch between the body-
clock and the sleep-work schedule), one novel and critical mechanism in SWD is sleep reactivity. Sleep
reactivity is a trait where sleep is easily disrupted by environmental stimuli and stressors. Our pilot data in a
cross-sectional sample suggests that sleep reactivity predicts persistent SWD symptoms even after reducing
circadian misalignment. We also show that sleep reactivity can be reduced with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT). However, sleep reactivity has not been experimentally disassociated from circadian misalignment as an
independent causal mechanism of SWD. This research is critical because it would demonstrate that SWD
treatment should target sleep reactivity independently from circadian misalignment. To do this, we propose a
two-step mechanistic randomized controlled trial in SWD stratified by high and low sleep reactivity (N=150): the
first step probes circadian misalignment using timed bright light exposure, and the second step reduces sleep
reactivity with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Our central hypothesis is that symptoms of SWD will reduce
proportionately with circadian realignment in SWD with low sleep reactivity; however, both insomnia (Aim 1)
and sleepiness (Aim 2) symptoms will persist in SWD with high sleep reactivity even after experimental
reduction of circadian misalignment. In those with persistent symptoms despite reduced circadian
misalignment, further reducing sleep reactivity with CBT would result in reductions in symptoms (Aims 3 & 4).
Upon completion, results from this study will have established sleep reactivity as a novel causal mechanism of
SWD to be inform future precision medicine approaches for this highly prevalent and undertreated disorder."

HIV prevalence in correctional facilities in the US is about five times greater than in the general
population and about 14% of people living with HIV (PLWH) experience incarceration/release
every year and 15% of those incarcerated do not know their HIV status. Over 50,000 people are
incarcerated in New York state and 1-2% are estimated to be PLWH. Similarly, substance use
disorder (SUD) is highly prevalent among criminal-legal system (CLS)-involved people, with an
estimated 70-80% of US jail detainees having a SUD are at high risk of relapse, overdose-
related mortality and HIV infection post-release. Intervening during incarceration provides an
opportunity to address HIV care in hard-to-reach individuals, though more robust interventions
are needed to improve care continuity. Increasing point-of-care rapid testing would maximize
HIV detection and results receipt among people in jails, and prepare them with needed
knowledge and skills post-release. To fill this gap, we propose a Regional Research Hub (RRH)
and 2-phase, Hybrid Type II effectiveness/implementation study to evaluate the effectiveness of
TechMPower, an intervention that bundles implementation strategies to increase delivery of
evidence-based intervention (EBPs) to prevent adverse HIV-related (new infection, untreated
HIV) and SUD-related outcomes (fatal and non-fatal overdose) among a sample of individuals
(n=1125 ) in 15 New York State county jails.
 In the first phase, we will pilot TechMPower to prepare for the phase two full R33 trial,
informed by PRISM/RE-AIM and the health equity framework, by recruiting in one NYS county
jail (n=50) and an existing HEALing Communities Study coalition to implement the selected
EBPs to increase: 1) HIV screening/testing via self-testing (TRUST); 2) SUD screening/testing
(SBIRT); and 3) access to and uptake of biomedical HIV and SUD prevention and treatment
(PrEP/PEP/ART); overdose education/naloxone distribution [OEND], opioid use disorder
medication [MOUD]) delivered through 4) hybrid linkage (telehealth, face-to-face) to services via
Navigation Enhanced Case Management (NCM). To optimize EBP delivery, TechMPower
applies key implementation strategies including: a) data driven, equity-focused, community
coalitions; b) implementation teams led by champions; c) training in intersectional stigma/harm
reduction for service providers/organizations from CHHANGE; and d) tech-mediated trainings.
This study capitalizes on investigators’ experience in community-driven implementation studies,
EBP design, and equity/anti-stigma approaches to provide evidence for tech-mediated HIV and
SUD service delivery integration in jails with linkages to community-based care."

The goal of this project is to develop the CapScan gastrointestinal (GI) tract sampling capsule, and to utilize
this device to advance our understanding of gastrointestinal disorders. CapScan is a novel ingestible device
with the potential to routinely collect and analyze the microbiota of the GI tract, including the metabolic
transformation of food products by gut microbes. We will develop, bench test and assess the safety,
reproducibility, regional specificity of the CapScan device on healthy human volunteers. We will then utilize the
CapScan device in two additional studies to test the effect of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on the microbiome
and metabolome and to measure the regional differences in the GI tract in patients with small intestinal
bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) before and after antibiotic treatment. Given the centrality of the gut to human
health, there will likely be additional uses of the CapScan technology in monitoring a person's health,
eventually making CapScan as routine and informative in the practice of medicine as a blood test is today."

 Depressive and anxiety (referred to internalizing) disorders are increasing in prevalence in adolescents; yet,
no specific etiology has been clearly demonstrated. This is quite concerning given that these disorders are
associated with substantial distress and impairment, jeopardize one's trajectory towards a productive adulthood,
and increase suicide risk; the latter being the 2nd leading cause of death in adolescents, with worsening recent
trends. Iron deficiency (ID) has been associated with neuropsychiatric impairment, including depressive and
anxiety symptoms. This is not surprising, given iron's role in dendritic mitochondrial motility during hippocampal
neuron development, monoaminergic signaling, and myelination. In fact, across two independent samples of
medically-healthy adolescents, we have found prevalent ID and an inverse association between iron stores and
the severity of internalizing symptoms. Moreover, our preliminary evidence suggests that body iron stores are
associated with brain morphometry and connectivity, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Building on these novel findings, the current research application seeks to enroll unmedicated 10 to 17 year-
old participants with and without internalizing disorders to examine the association between peripheral iron
stores, as captured by serum ferritin, and brain iron content, as measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping
(QSM), a state-of-the-art MRI-based technique (Aim 1). Moreover, in order to establish the impact of ID on brain
development, we will examine the association between brain and body iron stores, on the one hand, and brain
structure, brain connectivity, and white matter integrity, on the other (Aim 2). Finally, in order to establish the
clinical significance of the findings, we will examine the association between brain and body iron stores and
psychiatric symptom severity (Aim 3).
 The proposed work will be the first to investigate the effect of ID on brain development and clinical symptoms
in late childhood and adolescence, a developmental period characterized by increased risk for ID as well as
rapid brain structural and functional changes. The ultimate goal is to determine the clinical significance of ID, in
the absence of anemia, informing future therapeutic interventions."
10920964,"The goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score for people
living with HIV (PWH), leveraging the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE) to
integrate inflammatory and immune biomarkers, imaging, and genetic data. PWH confront an increased burden
of CVD thought to be attributable in part to HIV-related inflammation and immune activation. Yet established
CVD risk prediction algorithms developed for use in the general population include only traditional CVD risk
factors and do not reflect the unique mechanistic factors thought to drive excess CVD risk in PWH.
Consequently, established CVD risk prediction algorithms have been hypothesized to underperform in PWH,
and several recent studies have demonstrated underestimation of risk. Few CVD risk scores in the current
treatment era have been designed specifically for PWH, and none has incorporated biomarkers or genetic
data. Through this proposal, we will employ the REPRIEVE cohort to conduct novel analyses to develop
comprehensive, accurate HIV-specific CVD risk prediction scores that more fully reflect the complexity of HIV-
associated CVD. In Aim 1, we will assess concordance among five established CVD risk prediction scores
among all REPRIEVE participants, including a non-laboratory based score and an HIV-specific score, and will
assess the association of each score with coronary plaque indices based on coronary computed tomography
angiography (CTA). In Aim 2, we will develop new HIV-specific CVD risk prediction scores incorporating clinical
CVD and HIV-related factors (Aim 2A), inflammatory and immune biomarkers (Aim 2B), and CTA indices (Aim
2C) to predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We will specifically assess the performance of the
new scores in analyses stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, baseline CVD risk score, and
receipt of statin in REPRIEVE. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether integration of a novel polygenic risk score
developed from the REPRIEVE cohort further enhances accuracy of prediction of CVD events among PWH,
assessing interactions between polygenic risk score and sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. The
proposed work will answer critical questions about how to quantify CVD risk most accurately in PWH, a
population that confronts disparities in CVD prevention due to underestimation of risk using established risk
scores. Moreover, the studies will have implications for other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with
excess CVD risk. The knowledge gained will impact clinical care paradigms and reduce current inequities in
cardiovascular preventive care in the aging HIV population."
10917502,"Project Summary
 Understanding how cancer cells reprogram their metabolism and interact with other biological processes to
gain aggressiveness and/or resistance to a treatment is of paramount significance to advancing current diagnosis
and treatment strategies. Cancer metabolism is a highly complex and heterogeneous process, subject to micro-
environmental cues. Investigating the vastly complex metabolic landscape of cancer remains extremely
challenging due to intra-tumoral heterogeneity, cancer cell interactions with different cell types, and dynamic
state of the microenvironment. Metabolomics has been a golden standard for detection of cellular metabolites.
The disadvantages of metabolomics remain its destructive nature, prohibiting live cell or intravital analysis, and
lacking spatial information. Fluorescence microscopy offers high selectivity and provides subcellular resolution.
However, the fluorophore labels are much larger than the targeted metabolites (e.g. fatty acids, choline) and
thus can hinder or alter the intrinsic metabolism. Here, we propose to fill in this gap through a new approach
termed bio-orthogonal mid-infrared photothermal (MIP) imaging. By using a visible beam to sense the IR
absorption induced refractive index change, MIP microscopy allows highly sensitivity imaging of chemical bonds
at the visible diffraction limits. We propose to develop nitrile-based IR-active probes that produce extremely
strong MIP signals in the spectrally silent region and induce minimal perturbation to the molecule of interest. In
feasibility studies, we have developed a series of nitrile-based substrates that sense the activities of specific
enzymes including caspase and phosphatase. Importantly, due to the much larger infrared absorption cross
section than Raman scattering, the MIP limit of detection of these nitrile sensors reaches a few micromolar level,
which is ~1000 times below the detection limit of alkyne-based Raman tags. On the instrumentation side, we
have developed a laser-scan MIP microscope, which increased the imaging speed from millisecond per pixel to
microsecond per pixel. Based on these preliminary studies, we propose to systematically develop bio-orthogonal
mid-infrared photothermal imaging in three steps. (1) Building a library of nitrile chameleons to sense important
molecular events inside cancer cells. (2) Building a library of nitrile-tagged small molecules to sense nutrient
metabolism in cancer cells. (3) Developing microsecond-scale mid-infrared heating spectroscopy to enable
multiplex bio-orthogonal imaging. Ovarian cancer cells will be used as a testbed. Our technology synergistically
couples two innovations in probe development and instrumentation. Broad use of this technology, via
dissemination and commercialization, will allow researchers to quantitatively measure various molecular events
at subcellular level, and will open exciting opportunities for molecule-based precision diagnosis and discovery of
novel targets for precision treatment of cancers and other diseases."
10923805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common psychiatric conditions. They are also highly comorbid, and
co-occurrence is associated with worse patient outcomes. Neurobehavioral dysfunction in cognitive control and
emotional reactivity are considered fundamental mechanisms of disorder onset and progression. To inform
effective preventative treatments, it is critical to identify modifiable factors that directly impact these
transdiagnostic processes. Sleep is one such factor. The deepest stage of sleep, slow-wave sleep, is consistently
reduced in most psychiatric conditions and can be modified using a variety of techniques. Slow-wave sleep
predominates over the prefrontal cortex, providing particular benefit to cognitive processes, including cognitive
control. Cognitive control is instrumental in downregulating negative affect to aversive stimuli. The aim of the
current study is to elucidate the role of slow-wave sleep in cognitive control and emotional reactivity to aversive
stimuli. We will study 40 young adults with elevated anxiety and depression symptoms and sleep disturbance.
Participants will complete two overnights in our sleep lab with polysomnography to assess sleep architecture.
Participants will also wear an acoustic stimulation device to enhance slow-wave sleep. During one of the
overnights, the device will play sub-arousal tones to boost slow-wave sleep; during the other overnight, tone
volume will be zero. The day after each overnight, participants will complete assessments of cognitive control
and emotional reactivity in an fMRI scanner. We will examine effects of acoustic enhancement of slow-wave
sleep on neurobehavioral measures of cognitive control and emotional reactivity and whether improvements in
emotional reactivity occur through cognitive control improvements. This study will elucidate sleep-based
mechanisms of anxiety and mood disorder onset in an at-risk sample and inform innovative, targeted, accessible
sleep preventative treatments. The candidate possesses skills in sleep manipulation, polysomnography, and
assessment of cognitive processes to conduct the proposed research. With additional critical training in 1)
advanced targeted sleep manipulation and sleep EEG spectral analysis, 2) cognitive-affective neuroscience and
fMRI, and 3) clinical knowledge and treatment of anxiety and mood disorders, the Principal Investigator will
obtain the skills necessary to develop an independent research program focused on sleep and mental health.
Training and research activities for the current proposal will be completed at the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine. The Department of Psychiatry and the Center for Sleep and Circadian Science are leaders in sleep
and mental health research and devoted to the professional development of early career scientists. The
candidate has assembled a mentorship team of experienced independent researchers and clinicians with
expertise in the proposed research aims and a successful history of mentorship. The intellectual and material
resources provided by the University of Pittsburgh, combined with the proposed mentorship team’s guidance
strongly position the candidate to achieve her proposed training, research, and career goals."
10923806,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asthma prevalence in Bronx, NY schools is 20-25%. Physical activity (PA) is an important component of asthma
management in children. Studies show that PA is associated with decreased severity of asthma symptoms, as
well as improved disease control and quality of life. However, urban minority children with asthma face barriers
to PA on multiple levels. In our prior work (K23HD065742), we identified several barriers to PA in urban minority
schoolchildren with asthma. These barriers include: inadequate access to asthma rescue medications in school,
suboptimal prescribing of preventive asthma therapy by primary care physicians (PCPs), lack of school PA
opportunities, stigma associated with asthma, parent/child fear of an asthma attack with PA, and lack of teacher
confidence in assisting students with asthma. We developed a novel Asthma management program to Promote
Activity for Students in Schools (Asthma-PASS) in collaboration with stakeholders to address these key barriers.
We pilot tested Asthma-PASS with 109 students with asthma from 4 Bronx elementary schools and their parents
to demonstrate proof of concept and preliminary evidence of intervention effectiveness. Results from the pilot
study demonstrated significantly greater increase in symptom-free days (SFDs) (primary outcome measure) and
PA levels. In addition, preliminary mediation analyses suggested vigorous PA and step counts are mediators of
SFDs. We now plan to build upon this work and evaluate in a full-scale randomized trial whether the Asthma-
PASS intervention reduces asthma morbidity among high-risk urban schoolchildren. We propose a cluster-
randomized controlled trial with 416 children ages 5-11 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from 26
Bronx schools. Schools will be stratified by size and then randomly assigned to either (1) the Asthma-PASS
intervention (PCP collaboration to ensure optimal guideline-based preventive asthma care and community health
workers to facilitate rescue medication availability in school and provide asthma awareness programming and
education for children, parents and school personnel to reduce stigma around asthma and PA) or (2) an asthma
management (AM) comparison group (PCP and parent notification of child’s asthma status and general asthma
education). Both groups will participate in an existing district-wide classroom-based daily activity program (‘Move
to Improve’). We will assess the effectiveness of Asthma-PASS in reducing asthma morbidity (primary outcome
- SFDs), and improving PA (secondary outcome) as well as additional clinical and functional outcomes. We will
measure PA with accelerometers using previously established procedures. We will also identify potential
mediators and moderators of the intervention effect. We will evaluate the process of intervention implementation
by applying the RE-AIM framework. This proposal directly builds on our prior work in schools to improve asthma
outcomes and reduce health disparities. If Asthma-PASS successfully reduces symptoms and improves health,
it will provide a powerful argument for policy change in schools and urban communities nationwide."
10923812,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a proposal for continued funding for the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students
(ABRCMS), now renamed the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Scientists. The low rates
of participation in the STEM by minoritized populations relative to their proportion of the U.S. population remains
a significant and ongoing concern.The NIH has recognized this disparity and supports a wide range of programs
geared toward addressing this issue. Trainees participate in research and other career development activities
however there are few national research symposia designed specifically for such students to gather and present
their work, while also learning about cutting edge science, and experiencing career and professional
development, and mentoring. Although minoritized students attend scientific society sponsored national
meetings, the paucity of their numbers at any one meeting can sometimes be daunting and discouraging. Many
scientific societies have recognized this and have developed programs focused on welcoming such trainees,
however the issue persists. Thus, in addition to attendance at such discipline specific society and national
meetings, meetings focused on minoritized students and their specific needs for professional development and
mentoring are critically needed. Since 2001, the ABRCMS has been such a forum. Organized and managed by
the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), ABRCMS hosts increasing numbers of students from backgrounds
underrepresented in STEM, enhancing their exposure to cutting edge science, and fostering their pursuance of
advanced careers in STEM, focusing on the biomedical and behavioral sciences. The ASM has received funding
to support ABRCMS for 4 cycles and seeks continued funding for another 5 years to continue this critical, timely
and important work. ABRCMS has arguably become the largest and best recognized scientific conference for
minoritized students, with >5,200 students and educators at the 2019 conference. Furthermore, ABRCMS
provides a unique recruitment opportunity for many graduate programs across the country to support their efforts
in diversifying their programs. Thus the importance and role of ABRCMS in increasing STEM diversity nationally
cannot be overstated. Throughout its 20-year history, ABRCMS has had clear, operational goals that have
evolved to meet the changing needs of minoritized students in STEM. In this funding cycle, the specific aims are
to 1) Provide opportunities for developing scientists to share their research via in person and virtual presentation
platforms; 2) prepare developing scientists for successful transition to graduate or professional training via
exposure to the cutting edge science, professional development, and biomedical and behavioral sciences
research careers; and 3) provide professional development opportunities for faculty advisers, research scientists,
and program directors to enhance their roles as advisers, mentors, educators, and leaders."

areas of the clinical and basic neurosciences, and include 30 investigators from BCH, 15 investigators from
BIDMC, seven investigators from HMS and five investigators from other Harvard and Harvard Hospital
affiliates. Thirty of these investigators are engaged in clinical/translational neuroscience research and forty-two
are engaged in basic neuroscience research. Mentors have been drawn not only from the Departments of
Neurology/Neurobiology, but also from Divisions/Departments of Anaesthesia, Cell Biology, Genetics,
Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Pathology, Radiology, Developmental Medicine, and Psychiatry. Selected
resident participants will learn state-of-the-art laboratory skills and will acquire the critical expertise necessary
for the conduct of responsible research. Data collected and analyzed will serve for publications as well as for
future NIH proposals. The program will be governed by a Steering Committee consisting of the PD/PIs, the
Department Chairs, and the Residency Directors of the participating residency programs. This Committee will
work together to recruit and select trainees, to monitor their progress, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the
training experience."
10906769,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Neuro-Imaging Core (NIC)
The extremely poor prognosis and lack of effective treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) remains a significant
public health issue. While traditional MRI techniques are valuable in determining GBM response to common
anti-neoplastic therapies, novel treatments including immunotherapies, anti-angiogenic agents, or therapies
that alter tumor metabolism may result in radiographic changes that are challenging to differentiate from non-
responsive or growing tumor. Therefore, the primary goal of the Neuro-Imaging Core (NIC) will be to provide
advanced MRI and PET imaging support with established reliability and consistency to SPORE project
investigators for their respective projects. Specifically, the NIC will use quantitative µMRI and µPET for pre-
clinical imaging (Aim 1) and state-of-the-art MR and PET imaging acquisition, advanced post-processing, and
novel analysis tools for clinical imaging of patients in novel clinical trials (Aim 2). Additionally, we will provide
professional expertise and resources for traditional and enhanced radiographic response assessment for the
clinical trials for individual SPORE projects (Aim 3). Hence, this Core will add value to the overall SPORE by
helping investigators to better understand the in situ metabolic, physiologic, functional, and traditional
radiographic changes within the brain and tumor to address specific objectives of each of the UCLA Brain
Cancer SPORE projects. Another main goal of the NIC is to understand the link between metabolic and/or
physiologic imaging and tumor biology to reliably delineate treatment response versus recurrent tumor, which
in turn will facilitate the direct translation of new MR-PET companion biomarkers/techniques to the clinic for the
evaluation of treatment response in ongoing and new therapeutic clinical trials resulting from the SPORE
projects and cores."

The goal of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to foster the
exploration of innovative research ideas through the funding of pilot developmental research projects in the
field of brain cancer. This program identifies new, innovative projects for funding that will constantly renew the
vigor of our Brain SPORE research portfolio and add to, augment, or replace current major research projects.
The DRP serves as a source of pilot funding and a timely mechanism to expand discovery within the SPORE.
Each year, 2 – 3 highly innovative proposals are selected for funding at $50,000 - $75,000 each. Prospective
developmental research projects are solicited through a request for applications (RFA) sent throughout the
UCLA main campus and affiliated institutions via institution-wide and region-wide channels through the UCLA
David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM), the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC), and the
Brain Research Institute (BRI). Faculty at all levels are encouraged to apply, both those beginning a research
career and established investigators who wish to re-direct their research into the field of brain cancer. This
provides a broad base of applicants and new ideas, and allows funding opportunities for investigators from a
variety of local and regional institutions. The DRP Selection Committee meets and selects the most
meritorious translational brain cancer research applications, with input from outside ad hoc reviewers as
necessary.
Funding is made primarily for new and innovative ideas/projects, but also to initiate intra- and inter-SPORE
collaborations. We anticipate funding of at least one underrepresented minority (URM) investigator's project
per year in the next funding cycle, and have identified a pipeline of potential URM candidates. The DRP will
receive supplemental funds from the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) Dean's Office and the
Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC), which will allow for rapid and nimble funding of important new
initiatives within the scope of our overall SPORE research goals. The priority for funding will be those
initiatives/projects considered of highest scientific merit and with translational potential and relevance to the
overall mission of the UCLA Brain SPORE. Successful translational research projects may receive further
funding in the SPORE and replace unproductive funded major projects. The anticipated outcome of the DRP
is to enlarge the overall pool of brain cancer SPORE investigators at UCLA and to increase the diversity of our
Brain Cancer SPORE research portfolio."

of translational projects and innovative investigators at major research institutions, as well as an institutional
commitment to support outstanding, dedicated scientists in the field. In order for translational scientists and
physician-investigators to grow and flourish, funding support and peer mentorship is imperative. The UCLA
SPORE in Brain Cancer Career Enhancement Program (CEP) will provide this research support and mentoring
resource, allowing junior faculty to transition to independent investigator status with adequate peer-reviewed
funding and established investigators to focus or redirect their research to the area of brain cancer. CEP funds
will be designated to prepare investigators for careers in translational brain cancer research and enhance their
chances of success in the field. Applications will be accepted from MD, PhD, or MD/PhD advanced post-
doctoral fellows who are ready to transition to a faculty position within one year or junior faculty who will work
with established investigators and senior mentors in the brain cancer research field. Special efforts will be
made to recruit qualified women, individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, as well as

The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) of the University of North Carolina Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) is a highly successful core that catalyzes key resources to provide two
classes of services: (1) the Participant Registries (PR) serve to maximize recruitment of research participants
in IDDRC research; and (2) the Brain & Behavior Measurement Laboratory (BBML) assists UNC IDDRC
investigators with multi-modal characterization of brain structure and function and behavior to advance the
discovery of early risk markers, brain and behavior mechanisms, targets for therapeutics, and outcome metrics
for assessing the impact of interventions. In this application, 39 projects from 27 IDDRC investigators are
proposed for core access. The BBML further assists investigators with the design, measurement, and analysis
of clinical neuroscience studies, and provides assistance with the development of clinical teams. The structure
of the PR and BBML promotes cross-disciplinary interactions critical to maximizing the potential to understand
the pathogenesis and treatment of IDDs. The Specific Aims of the CTC are: (1) to maximize recruitment of
research participants for clinical studies; (2) to develop and provide access to tools and services that maximize
the ability of IDDRC investigators to conduct cutting-edge clinical studies of brain and behavior measurement
in IDD research; and (3) to facilitate translational IDD research by facilitating linkages between human and
preclinical studies and the promotion of interdisciplinary research. The overarching objective of the CTC is to
support clinical translational research that advances our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of
IDDs. The core catalyzes translational IDD research at UNC by providing key support and services, ranging
from consultation on the initiation of interdisciplinary projects, to supporting the formation of interdisciplinary
teams, assisting in the design of complex experimental protocols, providing access to a large well-
characterized pool of participants, to desiging custom-built and project-specific innovative neuroimage analysis
tools. By providing access to resources and expertise in IDD research, the CTC integrates cutting-edge
cognitive, behavioral, and clinical neuroscience methods to capitalize on our strengths in imaging and, in
particular, early brain development. This integration of recruitment, phenotyping, study design, and brain
imaging tools and resources in this CTC has catalyzed translational IDD research at UNC. Indeed, the
development of novel image analysis tools customized for infant brains, early in the history of this core, has
transformed the field’s understanding of infant brain development. The tools developed by this core have
played key roles in translational research examining early risk markers of, brain markers of exposure to bio-

10906781,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation is essential for removing neuroinflammatory proteins through a process that
involves the brain's newly discovered lymphatic system. Circulating CSF also delivers growth factors that help
regulate brain development. Aberrant CSF circulation can result in a pathogenic buildup of neuroinflammatory
proteins and alter brain growth. CSF serves to link the central nervous and immune systems, which are
dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In three independent cohorts, our team was the first to
report that children with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (iASD) have increased CSF volume surrounding
the brain (extra-axial CSF; EA-CSF) from 6 months to 4 years of age (Shen et al., 2013; 2017; 2018). Excessive
EA-CSF was detectable at 6 months of age (prior to onset of the defining behavioral symptoms of ASD), was
correlated with severity of specific later symptoms, and predicted later diagnosis. We extended this research to
single-gene NDDs with varying degrees of overlapping and distinct symptoms with iASD and now present
preliminary data showing that these single-gene NDDs also have excessive EA-CSF volume. Our preliminary
data also indicate that rodent models of these NDDs have excessive EA-CSF, similar to the patient populations,
and reduced CSF circulation. Our new observations suggest that excessive EA-CSF may be a potential
biomarker of a shared pathophysiological process in multiple NDDs. This project will prospectively study infant
cohorts of multiple NDDs, and corresponding mouse models, to examine the overarching hypothesis that
excessive EA-CSF volume and impaired CSF circulation result in an accumulation of neuroinflammatory proteins
and are related to aberrant brain and behavior development. This proposal will: [1] leverage resources from
ongoing NIH-funded MRI studies of children with NDDs; [2] enlist a multidisciplinary team with expertise in CSF
abnormalities in children with NDDs, neurophysiology of NDD mouse models, mouse neuroimaging, infant
neuroimaging, clinical phenotyping of infants with NDDs, and the lymphatic system; and [3] utilize all three UNC
IDDRC research cores to address the following aims: Aim 1: To elucidate potential mechanisms underlying
excessive EA-CSF in selected NDD model mice. Aim 2: To examine relationships between EA-CSF volume,
CSF circulation, and brain and behavior features in children with etiologically-distinct NDDs. This research will
expand our knowledge of a new phenomenon – aberrant CSF physiology in the early development of NDDs –
by examining the mechanisms and brain and behavior correlates in NDDs and corresponding rodent models, to
provide important insights for: development of targeted treatments, potential predictive biomarkers of later
disease progression, and knowledge about CSF pharmacodynamics relevant to upcoming clinical trials in NDDs
using intrathecal CSF drug delivery.

Clinical studies of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) often involve small sample
sizes, longitudinal behavior measurement, and the integration of genetic data. These multifaceted studies
invariably require complex methods for data analysis and careful attention to study design to ensure rigor and
reproducibility. In addition, massively parallel sequencing technology and multi-modal brain imaging studies
generate a deluge of data that must be carefully analyzed to distil biological meaning. Likewise, preclinical
studies of IDDs often generate multimodal behavioral, genetic, and other molecular omics data that require
complex analytic approaches. While these technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to develop
diagnostic tools and personalized interventions for individuals with developmental disorders, most scientists lack
the expertise and resources in bioinformatics, biostatistics, computer science, and psychometrics, to make full
use of these advanced approaches. The Data Science Core (DSC) was established to make available these
critical services and resources to IDDRC investigators and other IDDRC research cores. In this application, 41
projects from 27 IDDRC investigators are proposed for core access. The DSC interacts with the large user base
of IDDRC investigators and the Preclinical (PC) and Clinical Translational (CTC) Cores to provide state-of-the-
art processing and analysis of modern biomedical data. By consolidating resources and expertise, the DSC
facilitates inter-disciplinary, collaborative IDD research, employing the methods of biostatistics, psychometrics,
bioinformatics and computational neuroscience. In providing expertise to analyze and interpret complex and high
dimensional data, this core maximizes the potential for IDDRC investigators to conduct cutting-edge research to
positively impact the quality of life of individuals with IDDs and their families. Through regular interactions with
the PC and CTC, the centralized services of the DSC provide expertise within and across preclinical and clinical
domains to promote cost-effective, high quality, translational research. Specifically, the DSC has the following
aims: Aim 1. To provide innovative and comprehensive biostatistics, psychometrics, and computational
neuroscience support to IDDRC investigators. Aim 2. To provide comprehensive bioinformatics support to
IDDRC Investigators. Aim 3. To facilitate integrative and multidisciplinary IDDRC research and training."

The Administrative Core represents the executive, training, coordinating, and oversight component of the
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) Core Centers for Clinical Research (CCCR). The BWH CCCR, VERITY
(Value and Evidence in Rheumatology using bioInformaTics, and advanced analYtics), leverages the
resources of BWH and Harvard Medical School (HMS) to offer services to the community of clinical
investigators defined by the NIAMS mission, locally and nationally. The services provided by the
Methodology Core and Bioinformatics Core respond to identified needs for better access to a complete
array of clinical research methods organized in a streamlined and readily accessible format. Building on
the success of the prior cycle of funding, the Administrative Core contains an enhanced Enrichment Program
with wide course offering through both face-to-face and virtual distance learning, aiming to train and mentor
pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) clinical researchers, locally and nationally. The
specific Enrichment Program offerings are informed by our experiences in the prior cycle and survey data from
the Research Community. The overall purpose of the VERITY Administrative Core is to continue to build
and maintain a community of trainees, junior, and senior investigators working toward the common
goal of improving treatment and outcomes of rheumatic and MSK disease. The Administrative Core
provides scientific oversight for all aspects of the Methodology Core and Bioinformatics Resource
Core. These objectives are accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1. To facilitate and supervise
the scientific and administrative work of the Methodology Core and Bioinformatics Resource Core, ensuring
that the needs of the Research Community are met in an efficient and responsible manner; 2. To train the next
generation of adult and pediatric clinical researchers in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, with an
increased focus on URiM capacity building. During the first 4+ years of VERITY, the faculty trained and
mentored over 40 junior faculty and trainees. The modes of training have included: formal pedagogy through
the biennial VERITY Clinical Research Course and mini-courses; 1:1 mentoring through a robust local and
national program; heavily discounted Core services for junior faculty and trainees; a Pilot & Feasibility grant
program; and a series of seminars with web-based streaming. In sum, the VERITY Administrative Core
provides effective scientific and administrative oversight to ensure optimal use of the Methodology
and Bioinformatics Resource Core services. The Enrichment Program attracts, educates, and mentors the
next generation of clinical researchers to enhance pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK disease research in
the US. Furthermore, the Administrative Core collaborates with other NIAMS CCCRs to create synergy across
sites improving services for the Research Community."
10906800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rheumatic diseases and musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders often persist for decades, have profound impact on
quality of life, and require complex and costly management. Complexity of management is governed by the
heterogeneity in risk factors for these conditions, concomitant comorbidities, and variability in responsiveness
to specific treatments. This complexity requires that epidemiologic analyses use data from a range of sources,
including real-world data from electronic medical records and registries. Randomized clinical trials are critical
for the identification of efficacious treatments to control symptoms and/or arrest joint destruction. Observational
studies and intervention trials must account for complex phenotypes and varying durations of disease;
importantly, they must also address the balance between efficacy and toxicity. Outcomes of rheumatic and
MSK conditions are influenced by social determinants of health, which affect access to high value care,
especially for racial and ethnic minorities. Studies of the determinants of access to quality care -- including
implicit bias, geographic diversity, and the role of social networks -- have the potential to improve outcomes in
populations often marginalized from health care.
Confronting these complex study questions and diverse data sources requires sophisticated, state-of-the-art
research methods. The VERITY Methodology Core (MC) focuses on addressing these methodologic
needs and analytic challenges. The VERITY MC is a centralized resource with the overarching goal of
providing critical insight into the design, planning and conduct of clinical research in patients with
rheumatic or MSK disorders. The focus of expertise in the VERITY MC aligns with the overall objectives of
the CCCR (“VERITY”). The Specific Aims of the MC include: 1. Ensure methodological rigor in the design and
implementation of studies aimed at improving outcomes in persons with rheumatic and musculoskeletal
conditions; 2. Develop and advance methods to optimize design and conduct of clinical trials; and 3.
Incorporate intervention approaches based on behavioral theory and behavioral economic principles and to
infuse cultural perspectives and perceptions of racial and ethnic minorities into interventions.
The MC has the requisite breadth of expertise to enhance the rigor of the broad spectrum of studies
undertaken by the VERITY Research Community. The MC is well positioned to support one of the key VERITY
objectives -- to design studies, providing the highest level of evidence, including RCTs when feasible, or trial
emulation based on real world data when randomization is not feasible or ethically justified. The MC advances
VERITY’s focus on patient-centeredness, particularly as it relates to social determinants of health."

Fisk University, Meharry Medical College, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)
propose a novel collaborative program to engage diverse undergraduate and graduate students
in meaningful biomedical informatics and biomedical data science summer research
experiences. The Biomedical Informatics Ecosystem to Support Talented Diverse Students in
Data Science (BEST-DS2) program builds on a strong foundation of collaboration among three
postsecondary institutions in Nashville and connects three strong data science programs: Fisk’s
computer and data science program, Meharry’s School of Applied Computational Sciences, and
Vanderbilt’s Biomedical Informatics program. The BEST-DS2 specific aims are to: (1) establish
meaningful high-quality short-term research experiences for talented diverse students; (2)
prepare these students for future educational and career opportunities in biomedical informatics
and biomedical data science; (3) provide a rigorous evaluation of the program; and (4) build a
regional and sustainable ecosystem in biomedical informatics and biomedical data
science. Both Fisk and Meharry are Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with a
high proportion of students from groups under-represented in biomedical informatics and
biomedical data science; VUMC provides substantial expertise in successful summer research
experiences through the Vanderbilt Biomedical Informatics Summer Program. Each summer,
three undergraduate students from Fisk and three graduate students from Meharry will join the
12-week BEST-DS2 program, for a total of 30 students over the five years of the award. At the
beginning of the summer program, a two-week bootcamp led by Fisk, Meharry, and VUMC
faculty will cover common methods and tools used in biomedical informatics and biomedical
data science. Students will receive instruction on Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and
engage in professional development activities (including some based upon the Entering
Research curriculum from the Center for Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research).
Students will also participate in a Biomedical Informatics Summer Seminar Series to explore
cutting-edge topics, career pathways, and training opportunities. This five-year program will also
reach an additional 50 students from HBCUs as part of online BEST-DS2 outreach activities. In
addition to preparing diverse students for their future in biomedical informatics and biomedical
data science, the BEST-DS2 program will enable Fisk, Meharry, and VUMC to develop a
sustainable biomedical informatics and biomedical data science ecosystem, which will support
educational and research collaboration among trainees and faculty at the three institutions."
10918077,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
People living with HIV infection have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), despite effective
antiretroviral therapy. Emerging evidence show that residual persistent immune dysregulation contributes to
CVD risk in the HIV population. In addition, metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and
increased visceral adiposity are common in people with HIV and also contribute significantly to excess CVD
risk.
The key hypothesis of this grant application is that CCR2 and CCR5 drive inflammatory macrophages and T-
cells into tissues including arterial intima causing atherosclerosis, and into adipose tissue causing insulin
resistance. We expect that dual antagonism of CCR2 and CCR5 chemokine receptors will reduce immune
activation, reduce inflammation in the vasculature, reduce adipose tissue inflammation and reduce insulin
resistance. To test our hypotheses, we propose a multicenter placebo-controlled, double-blind, 24-week long,
randomized trial of cenicriviroc vs. placebo (in 2:1 ratio) in 93 adult men and women living with HIV with
suppressed HIV-1 RNA on stable ART who have increased CVD risk to 1) determine the impact of dual
CCR2/CCR5 antagonism with cenicriviroc on arterial inflammation and circulating soluble and cellular markers
of inflammation and immune activation and 2) To determine the impact of dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonism with
CVC on insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation, gene expression, and immune cells.
This proposal will leverage the clinical trial infrastructure of the ACTG and the extensive scientific expertise of
collaborating investigators and laboratories within the ACTG."

Mexican American children are the only demographic group whose asthma prevalence is increasing and
Mexican American children with asthma have a ~2-3-fold greater risk of being hospitalized than their non-
Latinx white counterparts. This excess burden of morbidity affects the ~ 200,000 Mexican American children
with asthma in Texas. Thus, we propose to develop and pilot a scalable, culturally-tailored, multilayered
asthma intervention, Asma Guardián, designed to reduce asthma morbidity among Mexican American
children. Asma Guardián will be modeled on efficacious community-based asthma interventions and will
include three “tool kits”: (1) support for accessing asthma specialist care, (2) asthma management education
and support, and (3) home environment education, access to housing advocacy services, and access to
environmental intervention supplies. Asma Guardián will be developed in partnership with Mexican American
children with asthma and their parents and will be grounded in communication and behavioral science to
maximize engagement. The primary objectives of the project are 1) To develop Asma Guardián, a culturally-
tailored asthma intervention that facilitates access to asthma specialist care and provides education and
support for asthma self-management and home environmental interventions and 2) To conduct a pilot trial to
inform the planning of a state-wide trial of Asma Guardián. The proposed work is both necessary and
sufficient to inform the planning of a state-wide trial of Asma Guardián, which will be the first scalable,
culturally-tailored asthma intervention for Mexican American children and will serve as a model for delivering a
population-scale intervention."

In recent years, improvements in diagnosis and treatment have extended the lives of many patients with triple
negative breast cancer, but resistance to treatment remains a major clinical and scientific challenge. While
standard-of-care treatment and chemotherapy is effective in many TNBC patients, approximately 40% of
patients display resistance, leading to poor overall survival. TNBC are characterized by significant intratumor
heterogeneity, which further complicates treatment. Mechanisms of chemoresistance in TNBC patients
remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of available methods and models to measure intratumor
heterogeneity and track changes in heterogeneous tumor compositions over time. Here we propose to use a
new technology to track individual cells and clones as they respond to different chemotherapeutic agents; this
more detailed information about the tumor cell population will be used to build mathematical models better
predict and optimize therapeutic response. We first measure individual cell gene expression changes in
response to treatment and then assemble these measurements into cell subpopulation trajectories, taking
advantage of a barcoding technology developed in our lab to quantify clonally-resolved single cell
transcriptomes. These Aim 1 studies will build a compendium of gene expression, cell growth and survival
data that describes how each of the heterogeneous cells in major experimental models of subtypes of triple
negative breast cancer responds to clinically-relevant therapeutic agents. The new ability to layer clonal
identifier information on single cell gene expression data reveals the detailed trajectories of individual cells
that escape therapy. It also distinguishes subpopulations with pre-existing treatment resistance from those
in which a resistant state is induced. At a higher conceptual level, this proposal seeks to also address a broad
practical challenge: the high-dimensional ‘omics’ data collected in many large-scale efforts points often points
to correlations in disease progression but not been informative for building mechanistic models to aid in the
predictive of tumor response. Often, other types of data are more readily available-- lower dimensional data
with more frequent measurements. We therefore next ask: How can these distinct data types be integrated
into a useful framework to build predictive models of tumor cell response to therapy? This seems a fitting goal
for the systems biology of cancer community. We propose to tackle this challenge with our barcode tracking
technology; relative fractions of sensitive and resistance phenotypes, along with separate longitudinal
measurements of cell number (low dimension data), become the inputs for a mechanistic model to predict
therapeutic response and resistance (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will perform trajectory-mapping and model testing
using patient-derived triple negative breast cancer cells, towards understanding the potential for translational
utility. By integrating different data types into a cohesive framework, we aim to describe how sensitive and
resistant subpopulations in TNBC grow, die, and transition in response to treatment."

The mapping of the human genome and genome wide association studies have provided great insights in our
understanding of the genetic etiology of hereditary diseases; however, critical gaps remain. A type of genetic
variations that has been difficult to detect in genomic studies has been Structural Variants (SVs), disruptions
involving more than 50 base pairs. SVs have been implicated in a lot of inherited diseases and cancers, yet
their detection remains challenging with conventional DNA sequencing methods. Developments in third-
generation sequencing (linked-read and long-read sequencing) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
provide an opportunity to greatly improve the detection of SVs and Copy Number Variations (CNVs), one
common type of SVs. However, existing computational tools do not fully take advantage of the potential and
the opportunities that these technologies offer. In this project, drawing from our unique expertise in this rapidly
evolving area, we propose the development of a new generation of tools that will improve greatly the detection
and phasing of SVs from a large population of samples. We will develop computational tools to generate a
high-quality diploid assembly from each individual and to combine data from large populations of controls and
patients to characterize SVs that confer risk for any particular disease. We will further design a haplotype-
based linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping approach at the whole genome scale to identify unique sharing
haplotype patterns and provide a new perspective for complex disease studies. Detecting SVs in combination
with small variants will further allow us to explain the etiology of complex diseases. We will also develop
algorithms to detect CNVs from scRNA-seq datasets, which have application in cancer studies. Successful
completion of this project will constitute a major step forward in uncovering the genetic cause of complex
diseases and cancers."

It is estimated that more than one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (57.8 million), with many racial
and ethnic minorities (REM) groups reporting higher risk of persistence and disability from mental illness than
their White counterparts. Despite widespread demand, more than half of U.S. adults (roughly 28 million)
needing mental health treatment do not receive care. Treatment-seeking is particularly low among REM. Even
among REM treatment-utilizers, 30-57% terminate prematurely, yielding poor treatment outcomes. Primary
drivers of drop-out for REM include diminished client involvement and weak patient-provider alliance. This
poses a particular challenge for retention as REM frequently fear that providers will be ill-equipped to respond
to their mental health needs in an empathic, affirming manner. Equipping providers with innovative technology
that facilitates cultural attunement in real-time, particularly for REM patients, is essential for addressing mental
health disparities in the U.S. and globally at scale. Attunement in mental health care involves the provider
accurately understanding and responding to the client’s lived experience. Cultural attunement goes a step
further to describe the providers’ awareness and responsiveness to the intersections of societal context,
culture, and power in client experience. Cultural attunement has been shown to be a key element that retains
REM in mental health services.
DMH applications, including telehealth and chat-based treatments, have unprecedented access to the content
of treatment and quality of conversations and may therefore allow researchers to understand the key
conversational moments, predictors of success, and mechanisms of change in culturally-attuned treatment. To
our knowledge, we–mpathic.ai–are the first company to build capacities to detect and correct for cultural
attunement in real-time with natural language processing (NLP) and generative artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies. The current SBIR Phase I proposal is from a highly skilled and interdisciplinary team with
expertise in automated evaluation of health services. In this SBIR Phase I project we will employ AI and NLP
processing on conversational data from 300 hundred, 30-minute health coaching sessions (60% REM) to
improve cultural attunement in provider-patient interactions in real-time. The
product to be developed for this
SBIR will specifically: (1) detect behaviors vital to patient-provider alliance and cultural attunement, and (2)
offer real-time correction to improve clinical outcomes . We will compare our AI model outputs to human
labelers and patient-ratings of therapeutic alliance and cultural attunement. We will also pilot dissemination of
our technology with 50% of providers from our collaborators at Wave Life Inc., a mental health platform, to
gather key acceptability and feasibility data prior to launching a randomized control trial of our technology as
part of a Phase II SBIR."

 Effective treatments for obesity have been a major need for decades, as the high prevalence of obesity
and associated metabolic disorders has continued to rise. To achieve weight loss, obesity treatments must
either decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure. GLP-1 receptor agonists have recently emerged
as the first effective drugs that decrease energy intake by reducing appetite. While these drugs are promising,
the need for alternative and complimentary treatments persists due to reported variations in their efficacy and
suboptimal effects on body composition. Equator Therapeutics is developing a first-in-class drug to increase
energy expenditure. Specialized thermogenic reactions within mitochondria form the only known energy
expenditure pathway that can be safely controlled without negatively impacting other essential physiological
processes. Mitochondrial thermogenesis depends on H+ leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane
mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs). In vivo, UCPs are activated by long-chain fatty acids
(LCFAs). In humans, skeletal muscle plays a dominant role in adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis. The UCP
responsible for mitochondrial thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and its pharmacological control long remained
elusive until Equator’s scientific co-founders developed a method to directly measure mitochondrial H+ leak
using the patch-clamp technique and demonstrated that the LCFA-induced H+ leak in skeletal muscle is
mediated by the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) (Bertholet et al, Nature 2019). They also identified likely
AAC binding sites for LCFAs and small-molecule activators of H+ leak (Bertholet et al, Nature 2022). Based on
this work, we are developing small-molecule activators of H+ leak via AAC that mimic the thermogenic effect of
LCFAs but offer high oral bioavailability.
 In the Phase 1 SBIR, we developed a high-throughput drug discovery funnel and identified four
chemically unique lead molecules that selectively activate H+ leak via AAC. We also demonstrated that one of
our partially optimized compounds can increase energy expenditure and cause weight loss in diet-induced
obesity (DIO) mice. In this Phase 2 application, we propose to carry out further medicinal chemistry
optimization of these lead compounds and to test optimized analogs for efficacy and safety in DIO rodent
models. The proposal has three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will optimize our compounds to increase in vivo
potency and maintain good exposures with chronic dosing. The optimized lead compounds will then be
advanced to in vivo efficacy studies in Aim 2, where we will demonstrate that they increase the metabolic rate
in DIO rodent models and determine safe doses for use in subsequent weight-loss studies. Finally, in Aim 3,
we will determine the efficacy of the optimized lead compounds for treating obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty
liver disease in DIO rodents. Successful completion of this proposal will demonstrate efficacy of our
compounds in disease models and assess potential liabilities in preparation for IND-enabling studies."

Shift workers experience profound circadian disruption, which can have deleterious long term effects on their
health and quality of life. Due to the necessity of night shift work for 24-7 continuous operations and safety, it is
urgent that society prioritize ways to support shift worker health. Mood, fatigue, and performance can be
improved in shift workers by shifting the timing of production of the hormone melatonin outside the hours they
are expected to work. This can be achieved with a targeted lighting intervention, as light is the primary input to
the body’s circadian clock, and supported by behavioral interventions, including meal and exercise timing.
 Crafting such an intervention for an individual, however, requires knowledge of the person’s current
biological time, or circadian state, which has traditionally been extremely challenging to assess in shift workers.
The gold standard measure of circadian timing is dim light melatonin onset, or DLMO. For day workers, DLMO
most commonly occurs in a six hour window prior to habitual bedtime. For fixed night shift workers, however,
DLMO can occur anytime over the 24-hour day. This requires 24 hours of melatonin collection in order to arrive
at a single indicator of internal time, which is often prohibitively time consuming and expensive.
 The small business on this proposal, Arcascope, has developed new techniques for noninvasively
predicting circadian timing through consumer wearable devices (e.g. Apple Watch) in collaboration with
research partner organization Henry Ford. These techniques can accurately predict DLMO timing in shift
working adults using consumer wearable devices. The PIs of this grant have also developed mathematical
techniques for generating lighting recommendations based on predicted circadian timing, aimed at shifting the
peak circadian drive to sleep outside the window of working hours. These techniques have been evaluated in a
Phase I STTR, through the deployment of an iOS mobile app, SHIFT, which achieved large phase shifts in real
world night shift workers, demonstrating that it is possible to shift their circadian rhythms so that the melatonin
secretion occurs outside their working hours.
 The next step in this work is to move beyond feasibility and towards effectiveness and implementation.
In particular, it remains to be demonstrated that the mobile app can produce meaningful changes in
stakeholder-centered outcomes in large, rigorously tested cohorts. These outcomes include not only worker
health outcomes, such as depression and sleep health, but also quantities of critical import to their employers
finances, including worker turnover, safety, and health coverage costs. In this Phase II project, we propose to
evaluate how the SHIFT app can affect these outcomes, demonstrate noninferiority of an Android version, and
assess key facilitators and barriers to engagement and implementation."
10923658,"Platelets are increasingly recognized to be essential mediators of inflammation, independent of their role in
thrombosis and hemostasis. Platelet recruitment to microvascular endothelium is a critical initial step in the
inflammatory response. Although platelets have been shown to contribute to vascular dysfunction in the acute
phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the role platelets play in persistent TBI symptomology is incompletely
understood. TBI affects a large portion of Veterans, and Veterans who experienced TBI are at increased risk for
chronic neurological impairment with great detriment to quality of life. Currently, there is a distinct lack of effective
therapeutics aimed at preventing these long-term TBI complications. The mechanisms by which acute injury
transitions to persistent symptomology are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, the proposed
studies will use an innovative strategy combining real-time high-resolution intravital microscopy and a controlled
cortical impact (CCI) model of injury in a repeated-measures study of TBI.
The CCI model is a well-established models for replicating the neuronal cell death and overt vascular breakdown
which results from TBI and highlights the diffuse systemic coagulation which can result from brain injury. TBI
results in platelet activation and an acute disruption in the blood brain barrier (BBB) which may predispose
individuals to the development of long-term complications including neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this,
very little research has been conducted investigating the platelet-dependent changes that occur during the
transition from the acute phase of TBI to the chronic phase of injury. The mentor's laboratory has significant
expertise with platelet-microvessel interactions in systemic vascular beds and various models of inflammation.
The applicant recently developed a chronic cranial window model of repeated-measures imaging of the cortical
vasculature combined with a CCI model of TBI. Preliminary data generated in this model provide evidence of
pathological platelet-microvessel interaction and platelet extravasation into cortical tissue, concomitant with
disruption of the BBB, in the uninjured cortex contralateral to the site of injury. We will use this novel
approach to examine the longitudinal profile of platelet-endothelial interaction and BBB disruption that occurs
over the development of chronic TBI. The overall objective of this application is to determine the contribution of
platelets to the longitudinal cerebrovascular changes following TBI, and to determine the molecular mechanisms
responsible for platelet-microvessel interactions and cerebrovascular dysfunction following TBI. Our central
hypothesis is that platelet-microvessel interaction contributes to the cerebrovascular dysfunction, BBB
disruption and functional deficits found in the acute and chronic phases of TBI. This hypothesis was
formed based on the current literature in conjunction with our own published and preliminary data demonstrating
the contribution of platelets in vascular pathology and the development of hyperreactive and damaged vascular
endothelium in other vascular beds. This research will drastically improve our understanding of the role platelets
play in the cerebrovascular alterations that occur in the chronic phase of TBI and help inform therapeutic
strategies for this disorder. The proposed mentorship and career plans will develop the applicant into an
independent VA investigator dedicated to the study of neurodegeneration and microvascular pathology with the
goal of improving the lives of our Veteran population. In addition, the applicant is committed to mentoring future
VA investigators and helping to foster a vibrant and collaborative research environment at the VA. The applicant's
expertise and VA-based imaging and neurobehavioral program, distinct from that of his mentor, will enhance
the pre-clinical capacity of the Houston VA and foster further collaboration with the Texas Medical Center."

The goal of the project is to develop a closed loop electrical muscle stimulation (CL-EMS) system to mitigate ICU
acquired weakness (ICUAW). Multifactorial in origin (extended period of bed rest, acute inflammatory state,
exposure to multiple pharmacological agents such as neuromuscular blockers, antibiotics, and corticosteroids),
ICUAW starts within few hours of ICU admission, affects the limbs, particularly the lower extremities as well as
the respiratory muscles impeding weaning from mechanical ventilation, leading to prolonged hospitalization and
eventual short-term and long-term functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Currently, no effective
treatment exists for ICUAW and the focus is primarily on early mobility preventive measures. Current early
mobility program is executed by physical therapy and requires patient’s cooperation and could not be performed
immediately after ICU admission in critically ill/mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, there is high
interest in being able to intervene early via non-volitional exercise strategies. One such promising strategy is
“Electrical Muscle Stimulation” (EMS). EMS passively activates muscles using skin-surface electrodes and
electrical pulses. Clinical data from the literature support the use of EMS as a tool for early rehabilitation.
However, technical limitations prevented widespread adoption of EMS in ICUs: (1) no EMS device is developed
for ICU use raising safety questions related to electromagnetic interference (EMI) with cardiac monitoring
systems as well as life sustaining equipment such as cardiac implanted electronic devices and external
defibrillators; (2) the continuous presence of a skilled operator on site to set up the device and continuously
monitor the treatment session (by assessing physiological feedback from the patient and making adjustments)
increase the workload and cost of the intervention. We reasoned that an EMS device with low electric noise could
reduce the risk of EMI. Additionally, we reasoned that using real-time muscle bioelectric feedback in response
to electric stimulation could create the basis for a closed loop system. A low noise EMS system showed promising
results when tested with an ECG system. In addition, we find that the use of real-time bioelectric feedback is
reliable in detecting muscle response to electrical stimulation. Therefore, in this project we will integrate a
bioelectric feedback device with a low noise EMS device to create a CL-EMS system that is safe for use in ICU
setting. In phase 1 of this project, the electrical design integration of the closed loop prototype system was
completed successfully – preliminary safety was validated in a clinical trial in healthy volunteers. In phase 2 a
commercial prototype of the CL-EMS system will be built and tested for safety and feasibility in inducing an
effective muscle contraction in the intended use setting. The validation process will include IEC testing and
testing in critically ill patients."
10915883,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
 While antiretroviral therapy has significantly increased lifespan of people with HIV (PWH),
heightened rates of cardiovascular comorbidities continue to occur in this population as compared to
HIV-seronegative individuals. The mechanistic basis of this elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk in PWH remains poorly understood and constitutes a barrier to devising effective treatments.
Hypertension increases CVD risk and recent work has uncovered a role for gut microbial metabolism
in modulating hypertension. The gut microbiota is significantly altered in antiretroviral-treated PWH,
and the most robustly observed change in the HIV-associated gut microbiota is a depletion of
microbes capable of metabolizing dietary fiber into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Prior work from
outside the realm of HIV research suggests a depletion of SCFAs can cause increased blood
pressure and consequently increase cardiovascular disease incidence. Whether the loss of gut
microbial SCFA producers in PWH contributes to elevated cardiovascular disease risk remains an
important but unexplored question. Through this Catalyst Award, I will test the impact of the HIV-
associated gut microbiota on bioavailable SCFA production and investigate effects of fiber
fermentation on hypertension and manifestations of cardiovascular disease using a combination of
murine gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free models, omics technologies, and computational
biology. Mechanisms of host SCFA uptake and utilization as well as methods to augment SCFA
production within the HIV-associated microbiota will be explored to identify pathways that can be
targeted to alleviate hypertension in PWH. This high-risk series of studies have potential to elucidate
mechanisms of CVD risk in PWH and identify microbiota-directed therapeutic modalities."
10918338,"SUMMARY
Gaining a better understanding of aging biology is a pressing health and socioeconomic issue. In this regard,
cellular senescence is a key, but poorly understood determinant of organismal aging. Senescence is a stress
response program characterized by stable cell cycle arrest. Initially described as a tumor suppressor
mechanism, it involves the interplay between the tumor suppressors p53 and RB leading to a transcriptional
program of gene repression that silences proliferation associated genes. Beyond their arrest, senescent cells
secrete the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) composed of cytokines and matrix
remodeling enzymes. The SASP contributes to the induction of paracrine senescence as well as to the
recruitment of immune cells, whose role is to clear the senescent cells and restore tissue homeostasis. Indeed,
this is what happens in the context of wound healing or tumor suppression. However, for mechanisms that
remain unclear, in certain settings such as aging or age-related diseases, senescent cells accumulate over
time generating a pathological chronic pro-inflammatory milieu that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of
these conditions. Our goals are to identify cell surface markers that are selectively expressed in senescent
cells in aging for the purpose of better identifying, isolating and characterizing the senescence program in
aging. In parallel, we will exploit the selective features of these molecules with the aim of developing better
imaging strategies to monitor senescent cells in vivo as well as of developing CAR T cells able to selectively
eliminate senescent cells in aging. We will use these senolytic CAR T cells to functionally interrogate
senescence biology in vivo as well as to study their therapeutic potential in preclinical models of age-related
diseases. Preliminary data strongly supports the feasibility of the proposed work: we have already identified
one cell surface molecule expressed on senescent cells in aging and validated the potential of CAR T cells
targeting it as effective and safe senolytics in aging. In our application, we continue to identify and validate
additional markers, characterize the molecular program of senescence in aging and optimize cellular therapy
designs for aging conditions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has a longstanding history of nurturing successful
early scientist through their Independent Fellows program. This highly supportive environment is an ideal niche
to develop this project and launch my own research program as an Independent Fellow. Completion of the
proposed work will better define the senescence state in aging, produce new insights into the biology of
senescence immune surveillance and generate a new modality to both interrogate senescence and treat age-

10918342,"Non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) women in the United States (US) have higher probabilities
of breast cancer-related death than non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. H/L women from the Caribbean (C-H/L,
Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican) and black H/L are at an even higher risk of death than H/L from other
regions and white H/L. This higher risk is in part due to NHB and C-H/L with breast cancers being more likely to
be detected at younger ages, with tumors of higher stages and grades, and with triple-negative breast cancers
(ER-PR- and Her2- or TNBC). African ancestry combined with less of the protective European genome greatly
influences these risk factors in NHB and C-H/L women (on average having 79% and 27% African genomic
contribution, respectively). Centrosome amplification-driven mitotic dysfunction leading to chromosome
instability (CIN) and aneuploidy may also contribute to metastasis and poor clinical outcomes of these TNBC
patients. The Co-PIs published that the centrosome/mitotic kinases TTK, NEK2, and TBK1 generate CA/CIN
and that TTK and NEK2 drive the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Preliminary data indicates that
TTK, NEK2, and TBK1 mRNAs are dysregulated in NHB and TNBCs, and are overexpressed in breast tumors
from C-H/L. Also, by using a novel NCI-BMAP3 region breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) containing
samples from NHW, NHB, and C-H/L women, the Co-PIs found that TTK and pTBK1 are overexpressed in TNBC
and TTK correlates with EMT in TNBC. Inactivating TTK or TBK1 restored Rb in TNBC cells, suggesting it can
restore Palbociclib responses. Co-inactivating TTK and TBK1 in TNBC cells reduced the levels of
centrosome/mitotic regulators and EMT markers, and co-inactivating TTK/TBK1 or TTK/NEK2 significantly
reduced the migration and invasion of TNBC. The study team hypothesizes that TTK, NEK2, and TBK1
dysregulation in C-H/L and NHB women with breast cancer (BC) is dictated by African ancestry and contributes
to their poor survival outcomes by driving cancer cell survival and early metastasis. To test this hypothesis, the
team proposes the following Specific Aims: (1) Investigating signaling pathways linking mitotic kinases to early
metastasis and poor prognosis of non-Hispanic black (NHB), Caribbean Hispanic/Latino (C-H/L), and
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) women with breast cancer. The team will determine if RNA expression signatures and copy
number variations correlate with the expression of mitotic kinases with EMT markers, and survival outcomes,
using RNA and DNA seq done by the ORIEN consortium and a novel TMA developed by the Puerto Rico
Biobank. (2) To address how co-inactivation of mitotic kinases suppresses the mesenchymal state, metastasis,
and restores Palbociclib responses in TNBC cells. This will be addressed by single and combinatorial inhibition
of TTK, NEK2, and TBK1 in primary cell lines and PDX models of TNBC from NHB and H/L women with breast
cancer. Results from the proposed experiments will help reduce ethnic/racial breast cancer disparities by
identifying actionable targets (TTK, NEK2, TBK1, and other novel kinases found in Aim 1) against the aggressive
growth and early metastatic progression in NHB and H/L women with TNBC."

The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has increased substantially over the past two decades.
This increased prevalence is of concern given the association of GDM with adverse pregnancy outcomes as well
as longer-term adverse outcomes for both women and their children. Identification and treatment of GDM are
clinically important, as treatment can lessen the frequency of at least some — but not all — adverse outcomes.
One potential explanation for the inconsistent relationship of GDM treatment to the reduction of adverse
maternal, neonatal, and childhood outcomes is that GDM diagnosis and treatment typically occur in the third
trimester, which may be too late to ameliorate all of the adverse effects associated with maternal dysglycemia.
However, efforts to identify clinically relevant maternal dysglycemia earlier in gestation, such as the first trimester,
or to predict who will subsequently develop GDM, have not been successful. One reason for this lack of success
is that the evaluation of glucose levels during pregnancy has primarily involved singular measures of fasting
glucose or only a few glucose levels following a glucose load. Such measures may provide limited insight into a
maternal glycemic state that is in flux both in the short and long term. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
provides an opportunity to evaluate glucose profiles and gain information related to how these profiles change
longitudinally over hours, days, weeks, and months. In this proposal, we will address the hypothesis that maternal
glucose signatures, starting early in pregnancy, will predict the subsequent diagnosis of GDM and be better
associated with maternal and newborn outcomes than the third-trimester diagnosis of GDM. To address this
hypothesis, we will use data from CGM to examine glycemic patterns during pregnancy, and analyze these
patterns to determine how strongly they are associated with the subsequent development of GDM as well
as adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.
The proposed study will define the evolution of glucose levels during pregnancy in women without diabetes
mellitus, and define patterns of glycemia in early pregnancy that identify women who will progress to GDM and/or
who will be more likely to have maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. These data are crucial to help
determine future clinical trials and interventions to reduce short- and long-term adverse pregnancy outcomes."

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a hematopoietic disorder of childhood that is associated with a
poor prognosis. The current standard of care involves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), resulting
in many short and long-terms side effects. However, despite the intensity of HCT, outcomes are still poor with
event free survival (EFS) at three years of only 50%. Enigmatically, there are rare patients who are known to
experience spontaneous resolution of their disease with little to no treatment. While robust biomarkers of
favorable and unfavorable prognosis have historically been lacking in this disease, we have demonstrated that
a hypomethylated DNA signature identifies patients most likely to experience spontaneous resolution without
HCT. In contrast, the presence of a hypermethylated DNA signature portended a poor outcome even after
HCT. Our earlier work also showed that the presence of more than one somatically mutated gene was
predictive of exceedingly poor outcomes. Both these biomarkers have since been validated in additional
studies. Therapeutically, azacitidine and trametinib have each shown promise in early phase clinical trials in
this disease although neither is curative as a monotherapy. Our preclinical data demonstrates that the
combination of azacitidine and trametinib is more effective than either agent alone.Our overall hypothesis is
that risk stratified therapy will be feasible in patients with newly diagnosed JMML and will ultimately result in
improved outcomes. We expect that combinatorial therapy with azacitidine and trametinib (“Aza-MEK”) will
provide excellent disease control for those with lower-risk JMML, while Aza-MEK + chemotherapy will yield
molecular responses prior to HCT for those with high-risk JMML, therefore leading to better outcomes post-
HCT. We further hypothesize that dual inhibition of JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling will confer synergy and, as
such, we will test these agents in pre-clinical models to inform future clinical trials. In Aim 1 we will implement
the first risk-stratified trial in JMML. In Aim 1a we will determine the feasibility of avoiding HCT in lower-risk
patients (defined as those with a low DNA methylation signature and only one mutated gene) by treating with
azacitidine in combination with trametinib (Aza-MEK) for up to 12 cycles. Lower-risk patients will only proceed
to HCT in the setting of disease progression. In Aim 1b we will determine if adding Aza-MEK to cytarabine and
fludarabine for high-risk patients (those with multiple mutations or an intermediate/high methylation signature)
will increase the number of patients achieving a molecular remission pre-HCT.
Finally, in
Aim 2 we will
interrogate the JAK/STAT pathway as a therapeutic target in JMML. Our data from in-vitro and in-vivo testing
revealed single-agent activity of JAK2 inhibitors. In Aim 2a we will harness genetically engineered mice and in
Aim 2b, patient derived xenograft models to test the hypothesis that ruxolitinib will be synergistic in
combination with trametinib. Collectively, these studies will improve outcomes for patients with JMML by
expanding treatment options beyond just HCT."
10909897,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) are known to be at very high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with a
prevalence of up to 66%. OSA has been associated with neurocognitive impairment and impaired health-
related quality of life (HR-QOL) in children with DS. Current treatments for OSA in children with DS include
adenotonsillectomy and positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Unfortunately, treatment effectiveness is
limited by a high risk of residual OSA after adenotonsillectomy and poor adherence to PAP therapy. OSA is
prevalent among children with DS and is associated with neurocognitive impairment and impaired HR-QOL.
Targeted therapies are needed to mitigate these negative effects of OSA in children with DS. Airway hypotonia
during sleep has been identified as a cause of OSA in children with DS. Consistent with this, OSA treatment
aimed at improving airway tone via hypoglossal nerve stimulation appears to be effective in adolescents with
DS. However, use of hypoglossal nerve stimulation may be limited in children given that multiple revision
surgeries would likely be necessary in younger children to adjust for growth over time. The combination of
atomoxetine and oxybutynin (ato-oxy) was shown to improve airway tone during sleep and treat OSA in adults
without DS. Given that both drugs are routinely used and well-tolerated in children, we hypothesize that ato-
oxy will be an efficacious treatment for OSA in children with DS and will lead to improvement in neurocognition
and HR-QOL. Specific aims of this project during the R61 phase include: Aim 1: To evaluate the short-
term efficacy of ato-oxy treatment for OSA in children with DS. Aim 2: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of
ato-oxy treatment on improving HR-QOL in children with DS and OSA. Specific aims of this project during
the R33 phase include: Aim 3: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of ato-oxy treatment for OSA in children
with DS. Aim 4: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of ato-oxy treatment on improving HR-QOL in children with
DS and OSA. Aim 5: To evaluate the efficacy of ato-oxy treatment on improving neurocognition in children with
DS and OSA. If successful, this project would identify a novel treatment for OSA in children with DS, as well as
medication-based route to improve cognition in children with DS."

The consumption and abuse of alcohol during adolescence is a serious public health problem. In this age
group, alcohol is often consumed in large quantities within repeated binge-like episodes that result in high levels
of intoxication. In addition to legal ramifications and concerns with physical safety, these patterns of alcohol
consumption appear to adversely impact continued brain and behavioral maturation during the transition from
adolescence to adulthood. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls higher-order cognitive functions such as
working-memory and behavioral flexibility. Adolescence represents a critical period of refinement of PFC
neurocircuitry that supports maturation of executive cognitive functioning. This research component of the
NADIA consortium will test the overarching hypothesis that AIE-induced deficits in cognitive control in adulthood
are associated with alterations in DA neurotransmission in the PFC. This hypothesis is based upon previous
studies demonstrating AIE-induced deficits in PFC-mediated behaviors and alterations in expression and
function of prefrontal DA. The proposed studies are designed to establish a direct link between AIE-induced
altered DA signaling and behavioral impairments, and further test the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations in
gene expression are a primary mechanism underlying AIE-induced cognitive deficits. The proposed studies
involve the following four specific aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that alterations in activity of DA D1
receptor-expressing neurons in the mPFC contribute to AIE-induced deficits in behavioral flexibility. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that DNA hypermethylation in the mPFC underlies AIE-induced cognitive deficits. Aim 3
will test the hypothesis that normalization of DNA hypermethylation will reverse AIE-induced alterations in
structural plasticity in the mPFC. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that AIE disrupts the in-growth of VTA-DA axons
from the nucleus accumbens to the mPFC. These studies involve an innovative and multidisciplinary set of
experiments that utilize state-of-the-art methodologies and procedures. Together, these studies will yield novel
and exciting new findings and will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of adolescent alcohol
exposure on cognitive function and behavioral control in the adult, and identify novel therapeutic approaches
for treatment."

Osteoporotic fractures threaten the health, independence, and survival of millions of people nationwide. An
estimated 40% of women and 30% of men will suffer a hip, spine, or wrist fracture in their lifetime. Two million
Americans experience a fracture annually, resulting in more than 430,000 hospital admissions, 2.5 million
medical office visits, and 180,000 nursing home admissions. Due in part to an aging population, the cost of
osteoporotic fracture-related care will exceed $25 billion by 2025. This suffering and cost is preventable. Large
randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the substantial benefit of osteoporosis drug therapies
(ODT) in reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet, fewer than 50-80% of patients at risk of fracture will
receive ODT and half will discontinue them prematurely. Underuse of, and poor adherence to, ODTs stems in
part from the lack of evidence about the effectiveness and safety long-term use of anti-resorptive ODT (i.e.,
bisphosphonates and denosumab), particularly with respect to rare side effects such as atypical femur fracture
(AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). While interruption of long-term ODT (‘drug holiday’) and use of
sequential therapies (i.e., anabolic ODT followed by anti-resorptive ODT) have been proposed as ways to limit
risks of AFF and ONJ, it remains unknown whether these strategies actually reduce risk of harm without
compromising ODT effectiveness with respect to fracture prevention. We will address these knowledge gaps by
emulating a series of target RCTs examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of ODT regimens with
respect to fragility fractures (primary outcome), AFF, ONJ, and other safety endpoints. We will use claims and
electronic health record data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a dataset of privately-insured and Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries, linked to a 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims, to allow for an
unprecedented evaluation of ODT over time and across populations, geographies, health systems, and health
plans. We will emulate the following target RCTs (eRCTs): Aim 1) eRCT 1 comparing ≤3 years vs. >3 years non-
interrupted anti-resorptive therapy. Aim 2) eRCT 2 comparing non-interrupted long-term biphosphonate ODT
(>3 years) vs. short-term (≤3 years) ODT followed by either brief (≤3 years) or prolonged (>3 years) drug holiday.
Aim 3) eRCT 3 comparing sequential therapy with anabolic ODT followed by >3 years bisphosphonate vs.
denosumab treatment. Within each eRCT, we will assess for heterogeneity of treatment effects as a function of
gender and risk profile (e.g. steroid use, etc). Finally, to address the gaps in translation of evidence to patient
care decisions, Aim 4 will update and field test an effective but outdated shared decision-making tool
(Osteoporosis Choice) with data produced by Aims 1-3. At the conclusion of this work, we will generate both the
evidence to inform high quality osteoporosis care and a ready-to-use shared decision-making tool to support the
implementation of this evidence into practice to improve the health of patients with osteoporosis."

Obesity disparities among racial/ethnic minority children are widening. These disparities may berelated to
inequitable exposure to food swamp environments (i.e., neighborhoods where unhealthy food retail
environments inundate healthier alternatives). Yet, little is known about themechanisms linking neighborhood
food environments to child diet and obesity disparities. To fill this gap, we propose a community-based
participatory research (CBPR) project utilizing mixed methods to explore the relationships between food
swamp environments and parents' food and beverage shopping habits, ethnically diverse parents' perceptions
of unhealthy vs. healthy food and beverage access, and diet quality and food preferences among young
children (ages 2- 5). In phase 1, we will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods design and complete
objective assessments of neighborhood food environments in 6 socioeconomically diverse Hartford
communities using both secondary data and primary food store audits followed by short interviews with
community stakeholders to solicit feedback. This phase of the project will result in level of food swamp
exposure scores and GIS maps at the census block group-level. In phase 2, we will survey ethnically diverse
parents (n=300) with young children to assess their food and beverage shopping habits, the home food
environment, child food and beverage preferences and intake, plus parents' perceptions of their food
environment, and their level of support for Policy, Systems, and Environmental (PSE) strategies to alleviate
dietary disparities among ethnic-minority children. Then, to contextualize key findings from quantitative survey
data, we will conduct focus groups with parents (n=40) of young children followed by theapplication of novel
mixed-methods GIS mapping techniques. We will take a convergent mixed methods approach and
analyze/interpret Phase 2 quantitative and qualitative data together using joint displays. The final phase
(Phase 3) involves drawing from Phase 1 and 2 findings to co-develop a community based
PSE intervention trial with a Community Advisory Board. We will solicit feedback on the draft intervention plan
from resident parents (N=20) via focus groups. The proposed research will improve our understanding of
neighborhood factors (i.e., food access) as determinants of early childhood dietary inequities. This K01 award
will allow Dr. Cooksey Stowers to obtain the necessary training and mentorship to develop a unique,
independent health equity research program that integrates CBPR, GIS, Mixed Methods, and Intervention
Development (i.e., PSE strategies). Findings from this work will inform the PI's future R01 application focused
on implementing a community based RCT testing a PSE intervention targeting the neighborhood food
environment. This K01 award will also allow the PI to obtain training and mentorship to develop a unique,
independent research program that integrates CBPR, nutrition disparities, geospatial analytic techniques, and
mixed methods with the ultimate of alleviating diet-related health inequities among young children."
10910032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite extensive evidence that friendships play an integral role in adolescent development, we know
relatively little about the friendships of maltreated adolescents, a group that is at significantly elevated risk for
experiencing future adverse outcomes. The existing literature regarding the influence of friendships on
maltreated youth’s development is highly conflicting and limited by investigations that do not account for the full
complexity of friendship experiences. Thus, there is a critical need to study how maltreated adolescents’
friendships might mitigate or exacerbate their risk for proceeding on negative developmental trajectories.
 The overall objective of this project is to investigate how the friendship experiences of maltreated and
non-maltreated adolescents differ, and understand how these experiences influence risk for adverse
outcomes. There are three specific aims. During the K99 phase, this proposal will (1) use data from two
prospective longitudinal studies to identify how maltreated and non-maltreated adolescents’ friendships differ,
and (2) use data from both studies and results from Aim 1 to test for the potential mediating effects of multiple
friendship experiences on the relationship between maltreatment and psychopathology/peer victimization. Aim
3 will be completed during the R00 phase and use clinical trial methodology to pilot a procedure to assess
maltreated adolescents’ friendships using observational and multi-reporter methods, and investigate how they
influence psychophysiological reactivity to a laboratory stressor and later psychopathology/peer victimization.
 This project is innovative because it represents a substantive improvement upon existing research by
considering the influence of a range of friendship experiences on the adjustment outcomes of maltreated
adolescents using longitudinal data and multi-reporter and observational methodology. This contribution will be
significant because it will help to delineate whether friendship can offer the same health and social benefits
and/or risks for some of our most vulnerable adolescents, as they provide for normative/low-risk populations.
 This proposal will greatly enhance the PI’s career development and enable her to advance toward her
long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator at a research institution. Penn State College of
Medicine provides an optimal environment for training with a wealth of resources for career development and
several interdisciplinary faculty who study child maltreatment and are actively engaged in mentoring the next
generation of maltreatment researchers. Training and mentorship will be provided to develop expertise in the
study of friendships; acquire skills in longitudinal data collection and analysis; learn new multi-reporter, multi-
level, and observational techniques; and gain clinical trial experience. Furthermore, the PI will be engaged in
training activities that foster her transition to independence, including grant writing, publishing, presenting, and
preparing for the academic job market. These skills and activities, combined with the proposed research, will
prepare the PI to compete for future R01 funding."
10908003,"ABSTRACT
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly form of pancreatic cancer with limited treatment
options and a low overall survival rate. Oncolytic viruses, particularly vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), have shown
promise in treating therapy-resistant cancers, including PDAC; however, concerns about neurotoxicity and safety
have hindered its clinical application. We have developed a novel oncolytic vector platform, VMG, using virus-
directed evolution technology, which replaces VSV glycoprotein with the glycoprotein of the Morreton virus and
incorporates the M protein of the Malpais spring virus. VMG has demonstrated tumor immune modulation in
murine models and a non-neurovirulent and non-pathogenic profile in toxicology studies. The dense stroma in
PDAC, consisting of hyaluronic acid and collagen, promotes tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapies.
Our proposed high-risk, high-reward strategy involves VMG-mediated oncolysis and the expression of
hyaluronidase and collagenase enzymes to break down the stroma, which will serve to enhance viral
biodistribution and immune cell infiltration into the tumor. This dual-stroma disruption strategy aims to improve
tumor control and patient survival. Furthermore, VMG-induced cancer cell death could enhance tumor
immunogenicity, leading to better recognition and destruction by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We have also explored
the potential of encoding SER, a novel proteolytic enzyme, into VMG to break down the stroma and induce
immune cell infiltration. This exciting development offers new avenues for effective PDAC treatment as a
standalone approach or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Another high-risk, high-reward
strategy we plan to employ involves VMG vectors expressing murine major histocompatibility complex
alloantigens (H-2Kk, H-2Kd) in PDAC cells. This alloantigen expression is expected to trigger a potent allogeneic
immune response, leading to tumor rejection. These innovative modifications will enhance drug bioavailability,
tumor immunogenicity, and immune response against PDAC cells, potentially improving treatment efficacy in
preclinical studies and human patients. Our research addresses critical gaps in PDAC therapy and presents
novel approaches to enhance oncolytic virotherapy for this challenging cancer type. This work holds significant
potential to revolutionize cancer immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes in PDAC and other stroma-dense
and cold tumors."

The past decade has seen substantial progress in the discovery of microbiome biomarkers associated with hu-
man health and diseases. However, despite the exciting prior work, we currently still lack an understanding of the
mechanism by which the gut microbiome impacts human health. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate
microbiome and other -omics data types generated in microbiome multi-omics proﬁling studies to elucidate mi-
crobial functional pathways. Unfortunately, available statistical methods for integrative analysis do not adequately
address the analytical challenges speciﬁc to microbiome data. Microbiome data are compositional, zero-inﬂated,
high-dimensional, and highly structured where samples are related by ecologically deﬁned distances and taxa are
related by their phylogeny. We propose to use our expertise in network analysis and high-dimensional statistical
inference to tackle these challenges unique to microbiome data analysis. Our overall objective is to develop rigor-
ous statistical methods that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating microbial functional pathways with host
health conditions. The proposed methodologies are motivated by our collaboration with the Study of Latinos and
the Dog Aging Project, and include a novel inference procedure for joint analysis of microbial and metabolomic
networks (Aim 1), a novel method for joint dimensionality reduction which incorporates prior biological knowledge
about the relationships between samples and between variables (Aim 2), and a powerful framework for jointly
associating microbiome and other -omics data types with health outcomes (Aim 3). We will develop efﬁcient and
easy-to-use software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 4). This work is innovative and signiﬁcant, because it
will provide systems biology insights into the role of the microbiome and has the potential to make a major impact
on the identiﬁcation of novel microbiome biomarkers. Successful completion of this proposal will generate impor-
tant community resources, including new methodologies for integrative analysis and their user-friendly software
tools. With these analytical tools, the longer-term goal of this project is to hasten the discovery of microbiome-
based therapeutic targets and contribute to the development of microbiome-based precision therapies."
10911249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by lung vascular endothelial cell (EC) barrier compromise resulting in
pulmonary edema. While bacterial infections induced by E.coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), and their
respective bacteria toxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and pneumolysin (PLY) are the major causes for ALI, the
molecular mechanisms involved in LPS- or PLY-induced ALI are ill-defined. The Scientific Premise comes from
our novel preliminary data, which show that both LPS and PLY activate endopeptidase calpain in human lung
microvascular ECs (HLMVECs) in ERK-dependent manner and that specific calpain inhibition prevents LPS-
and PLY-induced disruption of EC barrier in HLMVECs and LPS-induced pulmonary edema in ALI. Further, we
found that ERK-mediated calpain phosphorylation at Ser-50 and calpain activity were much higher in murine
lung microvascular ECs isolated from lungs exposed to LPS, indicating that ERK-calpain pathway is highly
related to ALI. We show that LPS/PLY induces talin cleavage into head and rod domain and talin phosphorylation
in HLMVECs and that overexpression of calpain causes talin cleavage, and Rho-mediated inhibition of myosin
light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Talin is activated through either talin cleavage or phosphorylation. Talin
cleavage separates head from rod domain thus removing auto-inhibition and stimulating talin head binding to
integrin and thus induces activation of focal adhesions (FAs), leading to RhoA-mediated MLCP inhibition and
increased lung EC permeability. We found that MLCP, which opposes EC barrier compromise in ALI, is down-
regulated in lungs of ARDS patients, highlighting the importance of MLCP inhibition in human ALI. MLCP binds
talin and induced talin dephosphorylation, which may lead to talin degradation followed by FAs disassembly.
Interestingly, MLCP dephosphorylates another calpain substrate, ezrin, leading to its deactivation and withdrawal
from membrane cytoskeleton. Activation of talin/ezrin axis is involved in FA formation and our data suggest that
talin is upstream of ezrin in LPS-induced EC cytoskeletal remodeling. It was shown that ezrin depletion
decreases calpain activity suggesting positive feedback effect of MLCP inhibition on LPS/PLY-induced calpain
activation and EC barrier compromise via ezrin phosphorylation/membrane attachment. These data led to our
novel hypothesis that calpain/MLCP crosstalk coordinates talin activation leading to lung EC barrier disruption
in ALI. To test this hypothesis we will employ unique molecular tools such as murine lung-targeting gene delivery
in vivo, EC-specific inducible calpain and MLCP KO mice and ERK insensitive knockin mouse (Capn2S50A). We
will: (1) evaluate whether ERK-mediated calpain activation is involved in lung microvascular EC barrier disruption
and cytoskeletal reorganization in ALI induced by bacterial toxins (LPS, PLY), live bacteria (E.coli, Spn) and in
sepsic conditions; (2) determine whether Gram- and Gram+ bacteria, their toxins and sepsis induce talin
activation (cleavage/phosphorylation) and FA strengthening leading to lung microvascular EC barrier disruption;
(3) examine whether MLCP activity affects calpain activation induced by LPS/E.coli, PLY/Spn and sepsis."

 Over 60% of cancer patients undergo radiation therapy during their disease process, which frequently leads
to injury to surrounding healthy tissue and results in complications such as oral mucositis and proctitis. This
normal tissue injury can cause severe morbidity and treatment discontinuation, resulting in potentially inferior
tumor control. Attempts to reduce these side effects include systemic radioprotectants, tissue spacing technolo-
gies, and radiation techniques, yet these methods are fraught with limitations like selectivity, severe hypotension,
issues with spacer placement, and infection. As a result, there is a pressing need for innovative methods for
effective radiation protection.
 To address this need, we propose to develop clinically deliverable RNA strategies for radiation protection,
which facilitates the cell-specific targeted delivery of nucleic acids, enables sustained expression of extremophilic
proteins for enhanced radioprotective capabilities, and ensures the therapy can be effectively and safely admin-
istered into tissues. Our work aims to lay the groundwork for the use of nucleic acid-based therapies for radiation
protection. By leveraging the protective qualities of extremophile proteins and developing new delivery methods,
we aspire to reduce the impact of radiation-induced injuries, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and quality of
life."

Lyme disease (LD), caused by the tick-borne bacteria Borrelia, is the most common vector-borne infectious
disease in the US with 300,000 new cases annually. If diagnosed early and treated with appropriate antibiotics,
outcomes for LD are typically excellent, but delays in treatment result in arthritis, carditis, or neuroborreliosis.
The most telling manifestation of early LD is the erythema migrans (EM); however, the EM is often difficult to
distinguish from an allergic reaction, and 50% of those infected never develop the rash. Displaying non-specific
symptoms which mimic those of other diseases, LD can only be confirmed by laboratory tests. Current
laboratory tests rely on serological methods which are ineffective at diagnosing early LD and cannot distinguish
between an active and previous infection. Molecular diagnostic tests for direct detection of Borrelia from blood
continue to demonstrate poor performance. The end result is that no test can detect early LD with confidence.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind has developed RaPID/LD; a fully automated, ultra-sensitive test
specifically designed for the direct detection of Borrelia from whole blood. RaPID/LD displays a limit of detection
that is roughly two orders of magnitude more sensitive than existing molecular diagnostics. RaPID/LD will only
detect active infections and incorporates a broad menu of Borrelia species. The assay has undergone preliminary
analytical verification studies and has been assessed with clinical specimens. As a result of the demonstrated

10912632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Route 66 Endometrial Cancer SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to recruit and support early career and established investigators in translational endometrial cancer research. The CEP builds upon existing productive collaborations between outstanding researchers with expertise in translational endometrial cancer at the three partnering institutions: Washington University School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. We will further enhance these collaborations by providing funding support, didactic training, career development, and mentoring to new investigators in the field. The CEP will further solidify their mark on the endometrial cancer field by providing funding support and mentoring or advising to both: 1) early career investigators interested in pursuing endometrial cancer research and 2) established investigators interested in enhancing or exploring their interest to in translational research in endometrial cancer. The objective for the program is to build a cadre of investigators who will dedicate their efforts to endometrial cancer research and receive peer-reviewed independent funding. To achieve this objective, the CEP will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Recruit and support the careers of investigators new to endometrial cancer research; 2) Mentor and advise faculty researchers in translational endometrial cancer research; 3) Foster collaborations with partner institutions and other endometrial SPORE institutions, and 4) Promote diverse, equitable, and inclusive participation in endometrial cancer research. Successful completion of these aims will support new investigators, improve our understanding of the spectrum of endometrial cancer, and develop new approaches for early detection, prevention, and treatment of this prevalent cancer. Our ultimate goal is to build a strong inclusive CEP program that mentors investigators to achieve successful careers in translational endometrial cancer research with the skills to develop an independent SPORE project and vibrant research careers."

Rapid changes in eye position are used to reorient the eyes towards points of interest. Illuminating the
mechanisms underlying the initiation of these movements can provide insight into oculomotor disorders
typically characterized by involuntary movements such as saccadic intrusions. These involuntary movements
obscure vision by changing the focus of the retinal fovea. Detailed functional studies, primarily in non-human
primates, have resulted in models that propose that rapid eye movements occur when the activity of single
neurons or neuronal populations rises above a threshold. However, direct evidence for this model is absent.
The goal of this proposal is to provide structural and functional analysis of a cell type we have recently
discovered whose activity suggests a role in saccade initiation; these cells show a consistent rise in calcium
multiple seconds before saccades. We uncovered a disruption in saccade rate following focal laser ablations of
populations containing these neurons. To find these cells, we took advantage of the small size, genetic and
optical accessibility of the larval zebrafish brain to image calcium activity from single cells throughout the
majority of the hindbrain while simultaneously tracking spontaneous eye movements. The cells we found were
the only hindbrain neurons containing pre-saccadic activity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that these
cells contribute to the neural circuit initiating spontaneous saccades.
 I propose two aims to elucidate role of pre-saccadic activity in triggering rapid eye movements. In the
mentored K99 stage, I will characterize the activity of neurons with pre-saccadic activity during the fast phase
of optokinetic stimulation and saccades using whole-brain calcium imaging and electrophysiology. I will refine
the behavioral role of these neurons by reversibly silencing and activating their activity during stimulation (Aim
1; K99). Finally, I will assess how this neuron type interacts with other cell types in the oculomotor circuit and
characterize the morphology of this cell class (Aim 2; R00). Collectively, these experiments will address
unanswered questions in our understanding of how horizontal eye movements are generated. The training plan
described in this proposal details a focused strategy for acquiring the necessary skills I need to successfully
transition from a trainee to independent investigator. My principal mentor, Dr. Emre Aksay at Weill Cornell
Medical College, and my exemplary team of co-mentors have been carefully chosen to provide the necessary
experience and technical expertise to achieve this goal. Mentor counsel, recurring data presentations,
attendance of seminars, conferences and professional courses will all be utilized to build the necessary
communication and leadership skills vital to a successful scientific career. After transitioning to the independent
phase, I will use these skills to establish a laboratory that uses interdisciplinary tools to study the neural basis
of movement initiation."

Trillions of exosomes, a subset of extracellular vesicles, are naturally present in the blood and tissue, and all
cells secrete them into the extracellular milieu. Exosomes are on average around 100 nm in diameter and are
speculated to have an endosomal origin, with a membrane lipid bilayer of similar orientation as the plasma
membrane of the cells they originate from, and with capacity to enter other cells to deliver their constituents. The
cargo exosomes include proteins, lipids, mRNA, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and
genomic DNA; and their production and content can vary depending on the cellular source. Exosomes may
represent a novel mean of intercellular communication, but their biogenesis, trafficking, organ tropism, and
impact on normal physiology and pathology in the in vivo setting is largely unknown. Similarly, the function of
exosomes in pancreatic cancer remains understudied. Our research program is currently designed to address
key unanswered scientific questions related to the basic biology of exosomes, their functional role in
pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention of pancreatic cancer, a disease with dismal prognosis, and on the rise
in the United States. Employing newly engineered mice, we propose to address the role of exosomes in the
complex interplay between cancer cells, and the cells of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, employing
our established platform for clinical grade exosomes production, we will investigate the potential of engineered
exosomes to target driver oncogenes and modulate the pancreatic cancer immune microenvironment/tumor
immunity to facilitate therapeutic response. The proposed focus areas are rooted in the expertise we have
developed within our research program over the last decade, and our track record provides the rationale and
guidance for a higher chance of feasibility of the proposed studies, with potential for translational application."
10927219,"Significance: The goal of selective drug binding is a fundamental objective in the discovery and optimization
of a compound on a trajectory toward helping patients and becoming an approved medication. To aid in this
goal, our proposal aims to commercialize an innovative tool that addresses target selectivity in a rational de-
sign methodology. The prototype tool leverages our large database of chemical fragment binding maps on
therapeutically relevant proteins. These include over 100,000 maps covering over 600 drug targets including
those on the NIH priority pathogen list, all SARS-CoV-2 structures, and almost 100 structures from the top life
science venture capital firms. Searching spatial and energetic binding patterns of fragments gives valuable in-
sights into designing selective or pan-selectivity in drugs.
Conifer Point’s main product, BMaps, is supported by NIH SBIR grants and will be commercially released in
2022. The product has the largest repository of fragment binding data, affordable/accurate water molecule
maps, and is integrated with other standard chemistry tools. To extract the information from the big data of
fragment maps, a web service—backed by cloud computing—provides the data in a rational drug design appli-
cation. Our prototype selectivity tool, BMaps-select, now allows users to identify candidate compounds by vis-
ualizing how and why compounds interact with multiple target proteins, and by exploring suggested compound
modifications derived from chemical fragment binding maps across multiple target proteins. The result is higher
affinity and more selective compounds that specifically exploit the details of binding sites of a particular protein
or protein family. BMaps and BMaps-select are low-cost, easy-to-learn, and available everywhere via the Web.
Innovation: To date, no tools are available for the rational design of selectivity across 100s of proteins using
fragment maps. Final compound evaluation can be done on individual proteins, but this is time consuming and
inefficient. Our solution, BMaps-select, offers the potential for users to design across 100s of proteins within
seconds and evaluate compounds across the same hundreds of proteins in minutes with easy-to-use tools.
Approach: Our approach follows a similar trajectory to our prior work. First, we will pre-compute a large set of
fragment maps (>1 million maps) for important therapeutic protein families. Build a web interface that can lev-
erage the data and allow for selectivity design across hundreds of proteins. Lastly, we will validate the data and
tools using open source and proprietary datasets, including a unique kinome-wide dataset of >600 inhibitors.
Overall Impact: Drug selectivity is an important and fundamental obstacle in the progression of preclinical
leads. BMaps-select offers the opportunity to be a first-in-class innovation to help accelerate preclinical drug
discovery and to reduce toxicities due to off-target interactions, thus improving success rates of clinical trials."

Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Emory Winship Cancer Institute, Georgetown 
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Virginia Cancer Center, and University of Wisconsin 
Carbone Cancer Center. This collection of Centers brings together many unique discovery strengths, diverse 
patient volumes, and locations both urban and rural. We will focus on 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1- To lead and 
maintain a clinical trial consortium that will support cancer clinical trials from Phase 1 initiation through proof-ofactivity and foster seamless Phase 2 clinical development of NCI CTEP IND agents; Aim 2- To actively 
participate and engage disease-focused clinical investigators in the ETCTN by promoting accrual to a range of 
ETCTN studies led by other LAO/AO members; Aim 3- To incorporate and implement innovative correlative 
and biological laboratory studies in the context of or as eligibility for participation in early phase clinical studies 
that enhance our understanding of determinants of toxicity and response that will be used for further definitive

Our current work in the NIAAA consortium on the Neurobiology of Adolescent Drinking in Adulthood (NADIA)
has revealed that long-lasting behavioral consequences of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) are
sex- and exposure timing-dependent. When tested in adulthood, only male rats exposed to ethanol during
early-mid adolescence (early AIE) demonstrate social alterations that include social anxiety and enhanced
sensitivity to ethanol-induced social facilitation, with exposure to ethanol later in adolescence (late AIE) having
no such consequences. Our most important translational finding is that a selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR)
agonist reverses the male-specific social anxiety. At the cellular and molecular levels, sex-specific
consequences of early AIE are evident as alterations in dendritic spine morphology and decreases in OXTR
mRNA and protein expression in the hypothalamus. Our current proposal will address critical gaps arising from
this work. Aim 1 will identify socially relevant regions differentially activated in adult males and females by
social stimuli following early AIE and will test whether recruitment of neuronal ensembles in identified brain
regions is required for male-specific social affective alterations. Aim 2 will further assess AIE-induced
alterations of the OXT system contributing to male-specific social anxiety and will investigate neural
mechanisms underlying the reversal effects of OXTR pharmacological activation. Aim 3 is designed to test
whether AIE selectively disrupts epigenetic regulation of the OXT neuromodulatory peptide system in brain
regions critical for normal social functioning."

Data sciences represent key advances for multiple areas of discovery in science and health. However, despite
such vast innovations in data science, as is the case with other STEM fields, key groups are significantly under-
represented in the current and projected workforce, particularly female and under-represented minority groups
(Hispanic or Black). In addition, individuals from rural communities and lower socio-economic backgrounds are
less likely to pursue STEM careers and study data sciences. We hypothesize that providing students with a
curriculum focused on using population-level Big Data for community health needs assessment, planning,
analysis, evaluation, and application will improve students’ understanding of the importance of science and Big
Data beyond the laboratory or classroom. We envision such a program will engage students by making science
more applicable. To address the gaps in the literature and the lack of practical tools to teach students how to
both use and apply population-based Big Data, we will pursue the following Specific Aims for our new SEPA
program, Data Detectives: Using Real Data to Solve Real Community Health Problems: 1) to implement a
novel, problem-based, experiential learning curriculum to teach under-represented middle school students
science and mathematics content and data science principles with direct application to community-based health
issues; 2) to conduct a robust evaluation of the program with measures of student knowledge, attitudes, self-
efficacy, and pursuit of future STEM careers; and 3) to prepare for broad dissemination of the curriculum
throughout Georgia and the US. This program will provide the foundation for K-12 students to use real data to
solve real problems focusing on improving health outcomes for communities. The proposed SEPA program
meets three NIGMS priority areas: A) teaching students to use Big Data instills needed computational and
quantitative skills; B) the curriculum demonstrates applicability to the real world by using problem-based learning
(PBL) to challenge students to solve real community-level heath problems using real population-based data; and
C) the program follows a robust mixed methods evaluation plan to measure both quantitative and qualitative
outcomes. The Research Education Program plan addresses the three Specific Aims and includes rationale for
adaptation of the Problem-Based Learning model; a detailed curriculum aligned with MS NGSS; clear
identification of population-based datasets to be used; explicit examples of PBL scenarios; a thorough diversity
recruitment plan with access to a large, diverse student applicant pool; and clear input from expert community
partners and evaluation experts. The Dissemination Plan will share the curriculum and materials across Georgia
and the U.S. The ability to evaluate this curriculum in a cohort of middle school students, to measure its effect
on potential for future STEM careers, and then ultimately disseminate it nationally to schools and informal science
education programs, has the capacity to impact K-12 educational approaches in new and important ways."
10918246,"Project Summary/Abstract Schizophrenia is associated with psychotic symptoms, mood disturbances,
deficits in cognition, comorbidities, significant social and functional impairment and is a leading cause of
disability in the U.S. and worldwide. Although antipsychotic medications and psychosocial treatments are
effective for some symptoms of schizophrenia, effective regimens for all symptoms are not established. The
primary limitation of treatment guidelines is reliance on RCTs that test limited treatments and their effects on
few symptoms and comorbidities. Trials of treatments administered to address all aspects of impairment is
prohibitively complex. Data driven machine learning (ML) can address this gap using large observational
datasets with information about complex and effective regimens used in real-world practice. ML can cluster
individuals with shared characteristics and identify unique regimens administered for their psychiatric and
clinical comorbidities. These new treatment regimens are possible precision treatments. ML algorithms can
then predict critical patient-centered outcomes for these different clusters (or classes) administered these
treatment regimens. Examining the comparative effectiveness of these treatment regimens that predict critical
outcomes is an essential next step. Unique pharmacoepidemiologic methods with observational data can
simulate clinical trials. Propensity score methods address confounding, mimicking balance achieved by
randomization in RCTs. These tools will determine which precision treatment regimens are the most effective
for the classes in these datasets. Relevance of ML findings depends on data quality. Claims have the largest,
most nationally representative samples reflecting real-world community practice patterns but use billing codes
not originally designed for research. Electronic health records (EHR) are extensive but limited due to bias from
incomplete records with uncertain accuracy and complexity due to their granular level of detail. This proposal
will establish the strengths and limitations of these dataset types by conducting ML analyses on exemplar
datasets, a Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) national sample, and the Observational Health Data Sciences and
Informatics (OHDSI) network New York-Presbyterian Hospital (iNYP) EHR. An enhancement to this project will
compare more traditional multivariate and regression techniques to the ML findings identifying whether ML
provides additional information. To address the “research-practice” gap the ML results will be translated into
personalized treatment rules to inform clinical practice for schizophrenia treatment. After training in
unsupervised and supervised learning in Training Aims A and B, Research Aim 1 will identify classes and their
administered treatments in the datasets and Research Aim 2 will predict outcomes of those treatments: time to
emergency department visit, time to re-admission and incidence of comorbidities. Research Aim 3 will use
pharmacoepidemiologic methods learned in Training Aim C to compare effectiveness of the treatments,
supporting an R01 submitted at the end of this K-award to test effectiveness in an international EHR dataset."

Preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, can advance to eclampsia, when the mother
displays novel seizures. The mechanisms that cause some preeclampsia patients to advance to
eclampsia are unknown. The long-term goals are to identify therapeutic targets to prevent
seizures in pregnancy and preeclampsia and to pursue a career as an academic scientist. The
overall objectives of this application are to: 1) identify whether the endocannabinoid system is
involved in increased seizure sensitivity in preclinical model of eclampsia, and 2) provide me the
additional training to establish a successful career as an academic scientist. The central
hypothesis is that changes in cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) activity is impaired following reduced
utero-placental perfusion (RUPP) and that impaired CB1R activation increases seizure severity.
The rationale for this project is that the rat RUPP model showed increased seizure susceptibility;
however, the contributing factors are not fully known. Additionally, seizures occur when brain
activity is not effectively modulated and the endocannabinoid system has been shown to modulate
neuronal activity and play a significant role in seizure activity. Our preliminary work shows
abnormal expression of enzymes important for endocannabinoid system activity in a mouse
RUPP model. Because these enzymes play an important role in modulating CB1R activity, it is
possible that the RUPP interferes with the endocannabinoid system’s ability to modulate neuronal
activity and thus increases sensitivity to seizures. Aim 1 will determine whether RUPP impairs
CB1R activity and whether modulating CB1R activity increases seizure severity following RUPP.
My postdoctoral plans in Aim 2 focus on the offspring and will determine whether disrupting the
endocannabinoid system during pregnancy leads to sex-specific differences in epilepsy in the
adolescent offspring. This application is innovative because it combines a clinically-relevant
preclinical model of eclampsia with a well-established neuronal modulator, the endocannabinoids,
thus having the potential to identify a novel therapeutic target. This grant will also allow for the
continued career development and success of a very promising neuroscientist."
10919157,"Project Summary/Abstract
Due to recent advances, immunotherapy is now part of the standard of care for patients with metastatic
melanoma (MM) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Immune checkpoint blockade with
drugs such as pembrolizumab (pembro; anti-PD-1) release the brakes on specialized white blood cells (T cells)
to boost anti-tumor immunity. Unfortunately, anti-PD-1 monotherapy infrequently cures patients with advanced
malignancy, thus curative regimens are still critically needed for these patients. There are many mechanisms of
resistance to immunotherapy, but tumor-induced immune suppression is likely one of the most important. Two
ways anti-tumor immunity is suppressed are through PD-1/PD-L1 interactions and the secretion of an inhibitory
protein called galectin-3 (Gal-3) by the tumor. Given the ability of PD-1/PD-L1 and Gal-3 to suppress anti-tumor
immunity, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that relieving two mechanisms of immune suppression by
treatment with a novel Gal-3 inhibitor (GR-MD-02; belapectin) plus PD-1 blockade will enhance tumor regression
in patients with MM and HNSCC. This innovative approach targets a unique regulatory pathway capable of
changing the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhancing T cell activity. Importantly, our recent phase 1 trial
(NCT02575404) provided evidence of clinical benefit in patients with MM (ORR 50%) and HNSCC (ORR 33%)
following GR-MD-02+aPD-1 therapy, which compared favorably with the 15-20% (10% in HNSCC) response
rate expected in this population of heavily pre-treated patients. Moreover, combination therapy was associated
with significantly fewer immune-mediated adverse events than anticipated with pembro monotherapy.
Responding patients experienced significantly increased effector memory T cell activation and reduced
monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) compared to non-responding patients, leading us to
hypothesize that combination therapy increases responses by boosting the function of tumor-reactiveT cells and
diminishing M-MDSC-mediated immune suppression. These data provide a strong rationale for comparing the
clinical and immunological activity of GR-MD-02+pembro vs. pembro monotherapy in patients with MM or
HNSCC. This research is significant because improvement to the ORR and reduction of potential side effects
associated with pembro monotherapy will considerably enhance clinical care. Our objective is to perform a
randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GR-MD-02 plus pembro compared to pembro
monotherapy in patients with MM or HNSCC. Our goals are to: 1) Determine the objective response of this novel
combination for patients with MM or HNSCC; and 2) Elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which
combined GR-MD-02+pembro immunotherapy augments anti-tumor immunity and influences galectin-3-induced
immune suppression. These studies will help elucidate the mechanisms for the anti-tumor effect of GR-MD-
02+pembro therapy, which will provide critical insight into the underlying mechanisms by which combination
therapy, in comparison to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, supports anti-tumor immunity."

Accurate measurement of human behavior using devices could significantly advance current knowledge on the
dose-response relationships between chronic diseases and behaviors such as physical activity, sedentary
behavior, and sleep. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop valid approaches to measure 24-hour
physical behavior, as well as to demonstrate a procedure via which those approaches can be compared to
others. We aim to help the research community to converge on methods that use devices to accurately
measure physical activity type and intensity, sedentary behavior and posture, and sleep in adults. Many
promising methods have been proposed to measure behavior from activity monitors. Unfortunately, these
methods – which are now being proposed in large numbers – are typically validated on small amounts of data.
Thus, they may perform well on lab data, but fail when used in the field on large-scale epidemiological or
intervention studies. Moreover, the performance of different methods is rarely compared head-to-head,
creating uncertainty for public health researchers about which are the best to use. Quantifying the relative
performance of methods that produce similar outcome measures but use different devices or on-body device
locations is even more unusual. We will make it easy for researchers interested in physical activity
measurement to meaningfully compare performance between new methods and confidently apply those
methods to both large-scale surveillance studies and longitudinal interventions. The project has four specific
aims: (1) Collect well-annotated data of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, (2) Use the data from
Aim 1 to develop and validate approaches that yield 24-hour estimates of free-living physical activity (type,
intensity), sedentary behavior (type, posture), and sleep (wake/sleep, stages), (3) Develop and incrementally
refine a suite of tools that researchers can use to easily deploy advanced approaches to measure physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, even for large data, and (4) Use the data and new approaches (Aims 1
and 3) to host four competitions evaluating models, where all entries submitted by other researchers, will be
directly compared, ranked, and improved. The goal is to help researchers converge on “gold standard” methods
to robustly measure physical activity using common monitor configurations, as well as those devices and
configurations likely to be used soon."

Hibernation is one of the most remarkable physiological traits observed across a spectrum of animal species.
Hibernating mammals reside primarily in a state known as torpor, characterized by lowered metabolism and
reduced body temperature to conserve energy and survive harsh conditions. This natural phenomenon has
inspired the concept of artificial hibernation (AH), which seeks to mimic the reduction in metabolism and body
temperature using artificial means. Hypometabolism induced by AH in humans has the promise to impact broad
medical domains, including enhancing survival rates during critical health events such as stroke and heart
attacks, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, extending the viability of organs for transplantation, and
promoting longevity. However, noninvasive and safe induction of AH has remained within the realm of
science fiction.
My group recently discovered that stimulating specific neurons in the hypothalamus using ultrasound could
noninvasively, safely, and reversibly reduce metabolism and body temperature in mice. We found this effect was
associated with ultrasound-sensitive ion channels in torpor-associated neurons in the hypothalamus. While mice
naturally enter torpor under food deprivation and cold exposure, we showed the feasibility of inducing AH through
ultrasound in non-hibernating rats. Building on these promising discoveries, we propose the audacious
hypothesis that neural pathways critical for metabolism regulation are conserved across mammals and can
be activated by ultrasound. Our overarching goal is to pioneer a platform technique that harnesses ultrasound
for the noninvasive and safe induction of AH, thereby catalyzing disruptive medical innovations. To achieve this
ambitious goal, we will utilize an interdisciplinary approach that combines ultrasound engineering, system
neuroscience, physiology, molecular biology, brain functional imaging, and behavior assays to address three
pivotal questions: 1) What are the molecular, cellular, neural circuit, and system-level mechanisms that
underpin ultrasound-induced AH in mice and rats? 2) How effective is ultrasound-induced AH in treating stroke,
as demonstrated using rat stroke models? 3) Is the technique translatable to non-human primates as a critical
step toward human application?
Our proposed research program is innovative because it is expected to offer a disruptive technique to induce

The ultimate goal of cryopreservation (CP) is to develop a biobanking process that results in a post-thaw
level of cell viability and function similar to a sister population that has not undergone CP. Most methods
used for the clinical level CP of human Natural Killer (NK) cells and other cell therapy cells result in poor
recovery due to post-thaw necrosis and apoptosis yielding an inferior cell product which is infused into
patients. Our research team has shown through dozens of publications that human stem and somatic
cells undergo delayed onset cell death triggered primarily by apoptosis that occurs over a several day
period post thaw. These publications support the following questions critical to the clinical use of CP
solutions: (1) How much of the observed in vivo cell loss associated with post-thaw infusion of
cryopreserved cells is a result of the manifestation of delayed onset cell death that is attributable to the
CP solution and post-thaw protocol used in the clinic? (2) What triggers the apoptotic cascade that
results in delayed onset cell death? One hypothesis to be tested in this Phase I proposal is that this
delayed onset cell death may be a result of CP-triggered premature cell aging and senescence – a
hypothesis that is supported by our group’s publications showing that resveratrol, an activator of the
Sirtuin (longevity) genes, can improve post hypothermic preservation outcome by up to 10 fold in human
hepatocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. But this agent could also be acting through other molecular
means as well. Given, however, a July, 2023, publication reporting that select chemical cocktails have
been formulated that can reverse the cell aging process this hypothesis can now be tested using CP
solutions and post-thaw revival formulations that contain these non-proprietary age-reversing chemicals.
Since, over half or more of all cell therapy products in clinical trials today, including NK cells, are
cryopreserved in 10% DMSO which is highly toxic, many studies have investigated ways to improve CP
as well as to use alternative cryoprotective agents (CPAs) such as sugar alcohols to avoid the known
toxicity of DMSO. Indeed, a symposium at Cryo2023 was solely dedicated to discussing alternatives to
DMSO as CPAs making this focus a high priority in the CP sciences. Yet, to date no new CP process that
eliminates DMSO has been developed commercially. To achieve this milestone, first, DMSO must be
replaced with CPAs that can prevent the formation and re-crystallization of lethal ice during the CP
process. Second, a post-thaw recovery conditioning dilution/infusion reagent must be developed that can
prevent post-thaw delayed onset cell death and improve NK cell viability and function immediately
following thawing. Specific Aims of this project are the following: SA1) Develop Chillout - a non-toxic
CPA cryococktail to replace DMSO; SA2) Formulate RevitalICE – a first in class CP dilution reagent
designed to ameliorate post-thaw apoptosis/necrosis increasing NK survival and infusion efficacy and
SA3) Evaluate NK cell cytotoxic function following CP. Hypotheses to be tested in this Phase I project are
the following: (1) The apoptosis-dependent delayed onset cell death is initially triggered by CP-induced
premature cell aging leading to poor CP outcome; (2) NK CP cell survival and function can be improved
through the addition of cell stress modulators and age-reversing chemical cocktails; and (3) elimination of
DMSO will further reduce NK stress associated with CP. Hypotheses to be tested in the Phase II project
are the following: (1) A DMSO free CP solution can be developed with cell stress and age-reversing
modulators that is FDA and clinically acceptable for therapeutic application and results in better post CP
outcome than traditional solutions containing 10% DMSO: (2) Delayed onset cell death occurs in vivo in
animal models if NK cells are stored in DMSO-containing CP solutions but does not occur if the proposed
Chillout and RevitalICE containing cell stress and age-reversing modulators are used as the CP
formulations and post-thaw revival solutions. These efforts will result in improved NK and other cell
therapy cell CP and thereby improve clinical outcome for patients receiving these cells."
10916708,"Detection of reliable biomarkers that represent treatment response and drug resistance remains a major
clinical challenge for ovarian cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent new opportunities as emerging
circulating cancer biomarkers. These cell-derived membrane-bound vesicles contain protein and nucleic acid
cargos, which could represent a molecular `snapshot' of tumors. Namely, molecular analyses of tumor-derived
EVs have shown promise to enable non-invasive, real-time cancer monitoring. A major technical challenge in
further exploiting EVs' potential and accelerating their clinical translation is developing a sensitive, robust, and
standardized assay that can determine EVs' composition, cellular origins, and molecular profiles in clinical
samples. Most EVs are small vesicles with limited numbers of epitopes and surface areas for immunolabeling
(i.e., weak detectable signals), which often require sophisticated multi-step signal amplification strategies. A
key aspect of new EV assays is thus a robust signal amplification strategy; otherwise, a significant fraction of
EVs remain undetected. The overall goal of this application is to address these technical challenges by
developing an integrated nanoplasmonic sensing platform. Termed nano-CRISPR, the new system will
incorporate single EV capture and analysis using plasmonic nanodisk arrays, CRISPR/Cas13a sensors for
lysis-free, amplification-free RNA detection in captured single EVs, and plasmon enhancement for simple,
robust signal amplification. Using the integrated system, we will perform rigorous validation experiments using
cell lines and patient-derived 3D organoid models with different drug responses, establish a standard operating
protocol, and evaluate the assay reproducibility in research and clinical settings. Finally, we will apply the nano-
CRISPR technology to comprehensively profile EVs in serially collected human plasma samples of ovarian
cancer patients undergoing treatment. Success here will produce an advanced EV detection platform with high
sensitivity and multiplexed biomarker sensing capability. This will help the field understand how well EVs'
molecular profiles offer additional insight into cancer progress or treatment response and could significantly
accelerate the clinical translation of EV analyses as routine procedures for cancer patient care in clinical
settings."

Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired lower esophageal sphincter opening
with swallowing. Achalasia is thought to be caused by ganglion loss in the neural plexus that innervates the
lower esophageal sphincter muscle. Despite excellent approaches to open the lower esophageal sphincter in
achalasia, disease recurrence in achalasia is common. As such, it may be there are additional biomechanical
elements that cause sphincter dysfunction in achalasia. In particular the fibrosis of the lower esophageal
sphincter muscle may play a critical role. This proposal will study the molecular mechanism and physiological
impact of muscle fibrosis in achalasia. Recently, it has been identified that mast cell activation and
degranulation is a prominent feature in achalasia. In this proposal, we will assess the impact of muscle fibrosis
on physiological function of the LES (Aim 1). We will use a novel technology, functional lumen imaging probe
(FLIP) topography, to conduct in vivo experiments and perform ex vivo muscle strip recordings. In Aim 2, we
will assess the mechanism of mast cell activation in causing fibrosis via fibrosis marker expression and cell
culture experiments. This study will facilitate an understanding of the alternative mechanisms of disease
pathogenesis and functional impairment in achalasia. Ultimately this may lead to novel treatment approaches
in achalasia such as molecularly targeted therapy. This study will also provide an in-depth understanding of the
precise components measured by the functional lumen imaging probe. In order to accomplish the aims put
forth in this grant and his career goal as becoming an independent clinical and translational investigator in the
field of esophageal motility disorders, the Principle Investigator, Dr. Anand Jain, will require in-depth training in
both fundamental and advanced biological laboratory techniques used to study smooth muscle, esophageal
functional data analysis, and biostatistics. His career development is enthusiastically supported by his strong
mentorship team, led by R01-funded enteric neuronal biologist Dr. Shanthi Srinivasan at Emory and including
R01-funded esophageal translational esophageal physiologist Dr. Ravinder Mittal from University of California
San Diego. The robust training resources available via the Emory University School of Medicine and protected
time and in kind support provided by the Emory University Department of Medicine and the Division of
Digestive Diseases will facilitate his transformation to an independent clinician scientist."
10916833,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is debilitating illness, impairing health, well-being, and productivity of
25-30% of combat veterans. Currently approved drug treatments are largely ineffective. Behavioral therapies,
including exposure therapy, can be more effective for some, but efficacy is also limited by many factors, including
the duration of treatment and the anxiety and distress it can produce, both of which contribute to a high rate of
attrition. Many patients cease treatment before completing the full course of therapy, so anything that can
enhance the effectiveness of exposure therapy and accelerate clinical improvement would be highly beneficial.
Thus, there is a need to identify and investigate new adjunct treatments that can enhance the efficacy of
exposure therapy. Exposure therapy is a form of extinction learning. To investigate the mechanisms underlying
the beneficial effects of exposure therapy and identify potential entry points for intervention that may enhance it,
we have developed extinction learning as a valid preclinical model of exposure therapy in rats. We showed that
treating rats with extinction learning was effective in reversing several behaviors impaired by exposure to chronic
unpredictable stress (CUS), that model key symptom dimensions of PTSD. However, our standard 16-trial
extinction model was fully effective in restoring stress-impaired behaviors that resemble components of PTSD,
which made it impossible to detect improvements in efficacy. Therefore, to be able to detect increased efficacy
with adjunct treatment, we developed a sub-effective 8-trial extinction procedure, and validated its ability to detect
improved efficacy with adjunct treatment. The first purpose of the current renewal is to now use this sub-effective
extinction model to test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive, painless, easily
administered neuromodulatory treatment, as a potential adjunct strategy to enhance the plasticity induced by
extinction in the infralimbic cortex (IL), a sub-region of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that has been
implicated in PTSD. Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that tDCS will: a) enhance the efficacy of 8-tone extinction in
restoring cognitive flexibility mediated in IL, and improve other PTSD-like behaviors mediated by sub-cortical
targets of IL; b) enhance the rescue of afferent-evoked responses in mPFC that have been compromised by
CUS; and c) enhance the activation by 8-tone extinction of mPFC and its downstream targets that mediate
stress-compromised behaviors. We previously showed that activation of the projection from ventral hippocampus
(vHipp) to mPFC is important for the therapeutic effects of extinction. In the last grant period, L-655,708, a
negative allosteric modulator of a5-GABAA receptors expressed selectively in the hippocampus, was studied as
a potential therapy for stress-impaired behaviors. Because a5 NAMs increase vHipp activity, in Aim 2 we will
test TB21007, a more selective and potent a5-NAM, as a potential pharmacological adjunct treatment to enhance
the efficacy of extinction. The impact of this project will be to identify readily translatable adjunct treatments that
can make exposure therapy better and faster, enhancing the quality of life for veterans struggling with PTSD."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related
death in 2025 and has a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. The progression of pancreatic disease is partly driven
by the transdifferentiation of acinar cells into metaplastic ducts in the pancreas. Metaplastic tuft cells (MTCs) are
a specialized subset of the metaplastic epithelium that has been previously described as cancer stem cells in
pancreatic cancer. Also known as solitary chemosensory cells, tuft cells were first discovered in rodent luminal
surfaces, including the nose, stomach, intestine, and bladder, more than 60 years ago. They are characterized
by the “tuft” of microvilli reaching into the lumen and, only recently, have studies started to determine the role of
normal tuft cells in different organs. These studies determined that tuft cells have unique functions depending
on the organ in which they reside. Tuft cells are found in several various organs during development; however,
studies have shown that tuft cells are not present in a normal pancreas. MTCs are only present in the pancreas
in PanINs during PDA progression in both humans and mice.
Furthermore, the population of MTCs in the pancreas disappears as PDA progresses into invasive carcinoma
when using canonical markers of tuft cells. We know little about the role of MTCs in the pancreas, but prior
studies have suggested their role as a progenitor cell during PDA. However, these studies do not exclusively
mark MTCs during their genesis in a progressive model of PDA due to a lack of mouse models and the complexity
of culturing them ex vivo. We have generated a unique mouse model to drive lineage tracing of MTCs during
PDA and a novel culture method to propagate MTCs ex vivo. I have preliminary data to suggest that MTCs are
not disappearing as PDA progresses but transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine cells as PanIns dedifferentiate
into invasive carcinoma. Our collaborations with Dr. Rosalie Sears have led to a publication investigating NECs,
which are a highly aggressive cell type in PDA. In this publication, we establish that MYC is a driving factor of
NEC development. We believe that MYC is a driving factor in the transdifferentiation of MTCs into NECs. It is
also known that both MTCs and NECs derive from the acinar cells. This transdifferentiation into MTCs and NECs
occurs during metaplastic development. Our central hypothesis is that Myc is a driving factor in MTCs
transdifferentiating into NECs. Through our unique lineage trace mouse model, we can trace MTCs into PDA
development when we overexpress or knockdown Myc in MTCs specifically and determine its role in Tuft to
Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation (TNT)."

 Addiction and substance use disorders (SUDs) affect more than 27 million people in the United States,
with an estimated $740 billion annual cost due to crime, lost work productivity, and health care expenses.
Unfortunately, these numbers continue to increase and even more, since the pandemic, unleashing an alarming
health and social burden. Despite worldwide efforts, no successful treatments have been developed to better
deal with this chronic and relapsing disease. In the past years, the gut microbiota and its composition has been
associated with different adult behaviors and diverse neuropsychological diseases, including SUDs. However,
the mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences these pathologies remains elusive, with most of the
available data originating from associations between human patients or animal models and their fecal
microbiome profiles. There is an urgent need to push the field toward more mechanistic studies to find actual
communication pathways and molecular mediators behind these gut-brain connections. Therefore, the goal of
this project is to identify and characterize relevant interactions between different members of the gut microbiota,
psychostimulant exposure, and vulnerability to develop SUDs. To this end, we will apply a conceptually and
technically innovative approach that really bridges the fields of neuroscience and microbiology. We will use
metagenomics and metabolomics to identify psychostimulant-induced alteration in microbial composition and
gut milieu. We will then apply pharmacological and microbiological techniques to modulate gut physiology and
bacterial genetics to validate identified host signals and characterize bacteria-sensing pathways that are
impacted by the drug. To understand how the microbiome influences the progression to disease, we will combine
gut microbial manipulations with well-established animal models to determine the impact of these manipulations
on addiction. We will leverage the availability of genetically tractable hosts (mice) and human gut bacterial strains
to build up in vitro and in vivo models that will allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved
in this interkingdom communication. This project is only possible because we have developed the protocols and
the technical resources to accurately manipulate and investigate bacterial physiology while also following
neurobehavioral alterations associated with psychiatric diseases. We have the experience and the equipment to
run a battery of behavioral tests under microbiologically controlled conditions. Our approach provides an exciting
opportunity for acquiring new knowledge regarding addiction, gut microbiome physiology, and their interaction,
that can make a vertical leap in the field.

10910036,"γδ T cells constitute an important component of the immune response against infectious agents and cancerous
transformations, yet the biochemical mechanisms by which they detect antigen through their somatically
recombined T cell receptor (TCR) remain unclear. Unlike αβTCRs, which are restricted to recognizing antigens
in the context of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, γδTCRs can recognize a diversity of ligands
ranging from self MHC to intact, unprocessed, viral glycoproteins. Our recent work has established CD1
molecules as ligands for a subpopulation of human Vδ1 γδ T cells, producing robust functional, biochemical and
structural evidence. We seek to extend our studies to the human gut, where γδ T cells, and in particular, Vδ1+
T cells, predominate. Our preliminary data suggests that CD1 recognition is robust and present in all individuals
examined, and that there exist important functional differences between CD1 reactive γδ T cells in tumors versus
healthy adjoining tissue. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to fully characterize this CD1 reactive
population in tumors versus healthy tissue, examining their functional effector phenotypes, TCR repertoire and
immunomodulatory signals, in addition to the TCR, that shape the recruitment, activation and potential expansion
of these cells in the context of a highly relevant human disease, colorectal cancer. Our first aim,
“Characterization of CD1-specific γδ T cells in normal and diseased tissue.”, seeks to use classical cellular
expansions complemented by direct ex vivo functional and transcript analysis to profile CD1 reactive and non-
reactive T cell populations derived from tumor and adjoining healthy tissue. These data will provide insight into
the signals that regulate γδ T cells within the tumor microenvironment compared to healthy tissue. Our second
aim, “Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which γδ TCRs bind to CD1/lipid complexes.”, will
focus on characterizing the interaction between the γδ TCRs expressed by these cells and CD1/lipid antigen.
We will use protein biochemistry, biophysics and x-ray crystallography to elucide the molecular mechanisms by
which the γδ TCR recognizes CD1/lipid. Our effort will significantly expand our understanding of the specific
signals that regulate γδ T cell activity in human health and disease. Our third aim, “Determine the presence
and role of ligand, co-stimulatory and/or co-receptor molecules in CD1 specific γδ T cell activation and
phenotype in the colon” will characterize the ligand and immunomodulatory signals that may regulate the
activity of CD1 reactive γδ T cells in the context of human colorectal cancer. We will combine RNAseq and
differentiation assays using cord blood derived, naïve Vδ1 cells to test the relevance of candidate signals. This
will be complemented by in vitro derived native Vδ1 T cells through the OP9/DL1 system. γδ T cells can be either
pro-inflammatory or regulatory, therefore we seek to understand which role these cells play, if any, in this disease
state. Together, these aims will begin to unravel the mystery of γδ T cells in human immunobiology, both at the
cellular and molecular levels."
10910131,"Cognition, learning, and memory all rely on precise neurotransmission and plasticity at glutamatergic
synapses in the brain. These processes require glutamate-responsive AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which
mediate fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. During many forms of plasticity, including
Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), synaptic AMPAR levels are altered to modulate synaptic strength and regulate
neural circuit function. However, recent studies have shown that synaptic strength is not determined simply by
the number of AMPARs at the synapse, but also by their nanoorganization within it. AMPARs are enriched
subsynaptically in high-density nanoclusters that are often aligned with presynaptic neurotransmitter release
sites, and this molecular architecture impacts both basal synaptic transmission and plasticity. Despite long
acknowledgement that AMPAR trafficking is critical for synaptic strength and plasticity, the mechanisms
controlling their positioning and even their retention at synapses remain unclear. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to investigate mechanisms by which AMPARs are regulated at both synaptic and subsynaptic scales.
 Leucine-Rich Repeat Transmembrane protein 2 (LRRTM2) has emerged as potential candidate for these
functions, with essential roles in multiple synaptic processes including AMPAR-mediated transmission and LTP.
Critically, by using an acute method rather than knockout to disrupt LRRTM2, our lab recently found that LRRTM2
regulates both the abundance and nanopositioning of AMPARs after long and short-term manipulations,
respectively. As a transmembrane protein located in the postsynaptic density, LRRTM2 forms multiple protein
interactions, including with PSD-95, presynaptic Neurexins, and directly with AMPARs. These interactions
suggest fascinating hypotheses about how LRRTM2 might retain AMPARs and position them specifically within
the synapse, both basally and during AMPAR recruitment post-LTP stimulation.
 To visualize and control endogenous LRRTM2, I have successfully adapted a new CRISPR-based tool
to genetically replace the LRRTM2 protein with a tagged, acutely cleavable, and/or mutated version. I will use
this approach to perform the first evaluation of LRRTM2 distribution and plasticity-dependent enrichment in
neurons. With this tool, I will then determine the mechanisms of LRRTM2-driven AMPAR alignment, stability,
and enrichment. I will engineer selective mutations of the genomic sequence and use super resolution
microscopy and single-molecule tracking to delineate how LRRTM2 interactions with its partners specifically
contribute to AMPAR trafficking. Finally, I will examine how LRRTM2 supports LTP. Our surprising preliminary
data suggests an unexpected role for LRRTM2 in LTP-dependent spine growth not explained by current models
of LRRTM2 function. I will investigate these mechanisms using a combination of live cell imaging and
electrophysiology. These tools and approaches establish new paradigms for understanding the roles of cell
adhesion molecules at mature synapses, and will provide a firm foundation for my independent career."

Our circadian clocks synchronize physiological processes and behaviors like eating and sleeping to
environmental light cycles. The central clock located in the brain attunes peripheral clocks located throughout
the body to daily rhythms in environmental light. This systems level coordination of biological processes extends
across all cell types and tissues and drives synchronization of whole-body metabolism. Recent work indicates
that these biological timers also synchronize functions of our gut microbiome to daily rhythms in our feeding
behavior. Given the essential role that the gut microbiome plays in nutrient acquisition, tuning the metabolic
functions of the microbiome with the rhythms of the animal host is logical. However, the underlying mechanisms
by which animal and microbial metabolism are synchronized, and the extent to which this synchronization
impacts animal physiology is not well understood. I propose to address this evidence gap by investigating how
circadian clocks and feeding rhythms promote oscillations in microbiome composition and function and how
these oscillations in microbial function impact host physiology. We have discovered a key mechanism whereby
the circadian clock may coordinate host and microbial metabolism through the regulation of multiple antimicrobial
proteins (AMPs). These proteins produced by the epithelial cells in the intestine, have previously been shown to
tailor the composition of the microbiome. This discovery has prompted two questions. First, how do rhythms in
distinct AMPs shape the composition and metabolic functions of the microbiome across the day-night cycle.
Second, how does the arrhythmic production of AMPs impact host physiology. To address these questions, my
lab will employ an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates emerging technologies with metabolomics,
gnotobiotic mouse models, and bacterial genetics."

Recent advances have transformed the treatment landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
improved patient outcomes. However, the transformation of CLL to Richter’s syndrome (RS) remains a major
barrier to disease control and limits survival. In CLL, genomic studies have advanced understanding of the driving
molecular events and biological pathways that underlie CLL development, progression and therapeutic
resistance, and enabled advances in clinical prognostication and tailored therapeutic approaches. In contrast to
CLL, the genetic basis of RS remains largely uncharacterized. Over the last few years, an analytic framework
was designed to overcome obstacles in the analysis of RS samples, including accounting for admixed CLL and
RS DNA and detecting copy number changes from archival tissue. As a result, pipelines have been established
to identify the CLL and RS clones and trace the evolution of CLL to RS. Using this approach, analysis of 40 RS
patient samples has been completed, leading to the identification of novel RS drivers, including disruption of
genes encoding epigenetic modifiers. Based on this preliminary data, Dr. Parry hypothesizes that recurrent
genetic and epigenetic driver events underlie the transition of CLL to RS and that the identification of
RS drivers will advance understanding of the biological pathways that drive transformation. To test this
hypothesis, she seeks to define the genetic drivers of RS through the comprehensive characterization of ~150
RS cases using whole exome sequencing and trace the evolution of CLL to RS (Aim 1). In Aim 2, she will identify
the epigenetic drivers of RS and examine how the transcriptome changes upon transformation to RS. In Aim 3,
she will examine the functional impact of recurrent RS drivers to yield insights into the cellular changes of
transformation. This research will provide a molecular definition of RS and identify biological mechanisms of
transformation, and thus, is a crucial step towards the goal of improving outcomes for patients with RS. Dr. Parry
has outlined a detailed five-year career development plan to meet her goal of becoming an independent
investigator focused on the biology and genetics of transformed lymphoma. In order to achieve this goal, she
has formed an Advisory Committee of mentors in cancer genetics, lymphoma biology and functional genomics
to provide her with detailed scientific and career mentorship. Additionally, she has formed collaborative
relationships with internationally recognized experts in computational biology, genomics, epigenetics, statistics
and CLL biology to provide her with project guidance, experimental input and training. The Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute is an ideal environment for Dr. Parry to achieve her career goals and execute her scientific plan, given
the world-renowned research community and strong focus on training the next-generation of independent
physician-scientists. Dr. Parry will have all the necessary resources to complete her proposed project and
achieve her goal of becoming an independent laboratory-based translational investigator."

Lower respiratory infections were the fourth leading cause of death worldwide for nearly twenty years, and in
2019 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory infections quickly rose to the leading cause of
death in many countries killing over 5 million people worldwide thus far. Our lungs are equipped with stem cells
to help us recover from lung related injury caused by inhaling toxins and pathogens. However, like in many
COVID-19 cases, the stem cells cannot always handle the injury burden. Alveolar type II (AT2) cells are
facultative stem cells of the lung that secrete surfactant and aid with gas exchange. During injury, AT2 cells
withdraw from homeostatic quiescence to repair damage through proliferation and differentiation into alveolar
type I (AT1) cells, then revert to quiescence when the epithelium is restored. The mechanism behind AT2 cell
reversible activation is unclear. To better understand this mechanism, we modeled respiratory injury in mice
through a murine parainfluenza virus known as Sendai virus. Lineage tracing of AT2 cells and proliferation
revealed that AT2 cells not only activate to perform in situ wound repair, but also cluster and proliferate at
regions away from damage, specific to the edges of airways and vessels, as well as the most distal border of
the tissue, representing de novo growth. ATAC-sequencing was performed on AT2 cells from infected mice at
the peak of AT2 cell proliferation and in the recovery phase after returning to quiescence. AT2 cells gained
accessibility of AP-1 motifs during injury repair and subsequently lost accessibility for AP-1 motifs at recovery.
The hypothesis of this proposal is that AP-1 transcriptionally regulates AT2 cell activation to induce
both in situ and de novo repair during lung injury response. We will first identify the spatiotemporal
activation of AT2 cells during infection through lineage tracing AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation for
detection with light sheet microscopy to generate 3D images for deciphering if the proposed in situ and de
novo regions of activation are truly distinct. We will also perturb an airway stem cell population known to
contribute to in situ wound repair to study region specific changes in AT2 cell activation when airway
assistance is disrupted (Aim1). Second, we will investigate the regulatory mechanism in AT2 cell activation by
looking at the kinetics of epigenetic change over time through injury response with bulk ATAC and single-cell
mutiome-sequencing. We will also examine the role of AP-1 through AT2 cell specific conditional knockout of
FOSB to examine its impact on AT2 cell activation and repair (Aim2). This study will help characterize the
novel concept of in situ and de novo AT2 cell activation as well as the undiscovered epigenetic and
transcriptional regulation of lung regeneration."

The advancement of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has significantly reduced the HIV mortality and morbidity by
reducing the viral load (VL) to undetectable levels. Recently revised WHO guidelines strongly recommend routine
VL testing to monitor ART adherence and minimize failure. To this end, HIV self-testing, a process in which
individual who wants to know HIV status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the result in private,
has become an empowering approach. While nucleic acid testing (NAT) is readily available in centralized
laboratories for viral load quantification, its availability in self-testing has not been demonstrated due to sample
processing and assay complexity. This project aims to develop a quantitative test on an ultra-compact USB
device to detect viral rebound that is simple enough for laypersons to test themselves in the United
States.
The R61 phase of the project will develop the whole blood-based test that can quantitatively assess the presence
of HIV-1 RNA at concentrations as low as 1000 copies/ml, threshold recommended by WHO for determining
treatment failure. In aim 1, we will develop a disposable microfluidic chip for streamlined and automated plasma
separation and viral RNA extraction from whole blood. In aim 2, we will optimize the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay and
explore the minimum copy number sensitivity. In aim 3, we will integrate the quantitative USB analyzer hardware
and develop software for easy and robust operation. In aim 4, we will validate the prototyped test in the BSL-2
lab using HIV-1 plasma samples spiked into whole blood.
The R33 phase of the project will assess the test performance, usability and stakeholder needs within the HIV
Comprehensive Care Program at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. In aim 5, the performance of the proposed
test on HIV-infected patients will be benchmarked with standard laboratory methods. In aim 6, we will evaluate
the user’s experience, attitude and perception of HIV VL self-testing.
Through innovations in microfluidic chips and the USB analyzer, we anticipate the test would be able to quantify
HIV-1 VL as low as 1000 copies/ml directly from 100 µl of finger prick blood. The potential impact of this project
is very high. If this proof-of-concept project is successful, it has the potential to significantly enhance the
treatment outcomes for individuals of HIV under therapy. The potential transformative capacity warrants the
challenges associated with this project."

To improve patient outcome in cancer, better methods are urgently needed to measure therapeutic response
and detect early relapse. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 50% of patients in remission will relapse within 2
years. Current methods lack the sensitivity and generality to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in all of
those patients. Multiplex Accurate Sensitive Quantitation (MASQ), is both sensitive and general. It can target up
to 50 patient-specific mutations, with sequence error rates reduced to 1 in 1 million, and count mutant DNA
molecules with molecular tags. In a pilot study of AML, MASQ detected somatic variants at levels ranging from
1 in 100 to nearly 1 in 1 million, with higher mutation frequencies in patients who relapsed. There is also a critical
need to interpret minimal residual disease in the context of pre-leukemic clonal hematopoiesis and the evolution
of leukemic cells. Relapse may arise from drug-resistant leukemic cells, a genetically diverged subclone, or a
reservoir of pre-leukemic stem cells. In this proposal, I apply and improve innovative genomic tools for measuring
treatment response, predicting clinical outcome, and investigating the nature of residual cells in AML.
This project utilizes a large observational clinical study of AML to track patient-specific leukemia-associated
variants in blood samples taken over the course of the disease. Aim 1 will analyze subclonal treatment response
and the dynamics of relapse by tracking leukemia-associated variant allele frequencies across time. Aim 2 will
establish the prognostic value of a personalized, highly sensitive, and quantitative test for residual disease in
AML. Aim 3 proposes to isolate the rare residual cells harboring leukemia-associated variants from a remission
blood sample to determine the genomic and transcriptomic profiles that may provide further biological and clinical
insight into the disease.
I have proposed a tailored career development plan that will prepare me for my transition to independence.
Following my postdoctoral fellowship training, I aim to be an independent tenure-track professor at a major
research university. The training environment at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) provides access to
world-renowned meetings and courses, and a plethora of investigators with expertise in cancer and quantitative
biology. My professional development activities center around mentorship, communication, teaching, lab
management, and preparing for the academic job search. My training will also include coursework in clinical
translation and single cell analysis; presentations at conferences in genome informatics, cancer biology, and
liquid biopsy; and mentored research goals under the guidance of my mentor Dr. Michael Wigler and my co-

 Research in our laboratory focuses on studying the molecular physiology, pathophysiology and cell biology of
the transport processes of water-soluble vitamins in organs of the digestive system. In this proposal, we aim to
continue our investigations into the physiology, pathophysiology and cell biology of the absorption processes of
both dietary and microbiota-generated forms of vitamin B1 [i. e., free thiamin and that of thiamin pyrophosphate
(TPP)] in the small and large intestine. Vitamin B1 (in its biologically active form, i. e., TPP) is essential for normal
physiology and health of all cells due to the critical roles it plays in oxidative energy metabolism, ATP production,
and reduction of cellular oxidative stress. Deficiency of vitamin B1 occurs in a variety of conditions including
inflammatory bowel diseases, sepsis and chronic alcoholism.
 Humans/mammals cannot synthesize vitamin B1 endogenously, and thus, must obtain the vitamin from
exogenous sources via intestinal absorption. Two sources of the vitamin are available to the host: dietary and
microbiota-generated. We have previously characterized different aspects of the uptake process of free thiamin
along the intestinal tract, and showed involvement of two transport systems: thiamin transporter-1 & -2 (THTR-
1 & -2; products of the SLC19A2 & SLC19A3 genes, respectively). As to the microbiota-generated vitamin B1,
this source provides thiamin in both free and phosphorylated (TPP) forms. Studies from our laboratory have
shown that both of these forms are absorbable in the colon; absorption of free thiamin occurs as in the small
intestine via a carrier-mediated process that involves THTR-1 & -2, while that of TPP occurs via a distinct, high-
affinity and specific (i.e., does not transport free thiamin) carrier-mediated process. Subsequent studies from our
laboratory have cloned a specific TPP transporter from the colon (the cTPPT; product of the SLC44A4 gene)
and found its expression along the intestinal tract to be restricted to the large intestine only, and occurs
exclusively at the apical membrane domain of the lining epithelia. Our objectives in this proposal are: 1) To
determine the contribution of cTPPT toward total carrier-mediated uptake of the microbiota-generated TPP in
the native colon, its role in normal colon physiology/health, and to study aspects of its cell biology; and 2) To
examine the effect of conditions/factors that the intestinal tract is exposed to under certain disease states
[namely: hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flagellin] on
colonic/small intestinal TPP and free thiamin uptake. Thus, in new preliminary studies we have generated a
Slc44a4 knockout (KO) mouse model, which upon initial characterization showed clear phenotype (with impaired
colonic TPP uptake) compared to wild-type littermates. We also identified putative interactors with cTPPT in
colonocytes, and showed an essential role for its cytoplasmic tail in apical targeting. Furthermore, we obtained
evidence to show that exposure of colonic/small intestinal epithelia to hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS
and flagellin to lead to inhibition in uptake of vitamin B1 forms. Based on these new (and previous) findings, our
working hypotheses in this proposal are that the cTPPT (SLC44A4) is the predominant system involved in carrier-
mediated uptake of the microbiota-generated TPP in native colon, that this transporter is important for colon
physiology and health, that cTPPT has interacting partner(s), and that apical targeting of cTPPT is dictated by
specific structural motif(s) in its c-terminal domain. We also hypothesize that exposure of colonic/small intestinal
epithelia to hypoxia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and to bacterial products to lead to inhibition in TPP and free
thiamin uptake. We will test these hypotheses by accomplishing two specific aims and will utilize state-of the-art
physiological/cellular/molecular approaches. Results of these studies should provide new information regarding
vitamin B1 absorption along the intestinal tract in health and disease. This should assist in the designing effective
strategies to optimize global (body) and local (gut mucosal) vitamin B1 nutrition, and thus, improve health."
10911021,"Overweight and obesity are common among Veterans served by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
Obesity and the chronic diseases associated with obesity place a tremendous burden on our healthcare system
and reduce quality of life for the general population as well as for Veterans. As our Veteran population ages over
the next decades, this burden will only increase. In addition to few effective pharmacotherapies for obesity
prevention, there are no effective therapies for long-term weight maintenance after weight loss in obese subjects.
Therapeutically targeting fundamental mechanisms that drive energy expenditure has a larger dividend in terms
of improving the health of the overweight Veteran population than would treating individual co-morbidities
associated with obesity. One of the possible mechanisms for the development of obesity is decreased availability
of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin. The orexin neuropeptide, produced in the lateral hypothalamus, are
key regulators of physiological functions, including energy homeostasis, sleep/wake stabilization and cognition.
A defective orexin system results in weight gain despite reduced food intake, and complete absence of orexin
neurons results in the sleep disorder narcolepsy, which is also characterized by weight gain, despite reduced
food intake. We and others have consistently demonstrated that orexin enhances physical activity and energy
expenditure, and improves sleep/wake patterns. Despite this demonstration that the orexin system can be
targeted for weight loss, it’s not feasible to peripherally administer the orexin peptide itself due to its lack of blood-
brain barrier permeability. Therefore, to achieve obesity therapies based on orexin, the development and testing
of small molecular weight orexin agonists is needed.
 The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that small molecular weight agonists for orexin will prevent
and reverse diet-induced obesity, through increasing energy expenditure and improving sleep/wake patterns.
The goals are to systematically test the efficacy of two small molecule orexin agonists in preventing and reversing
high-fat diet-induced obesity by enhancing energy expenditure and improving sleep/wake behavior. To this end,
we will expose mice to high-fat diet and use indirect calorimetry in conjunction with wireless radio-telemetric
sleep/wake behavioral analyses, to determine if activation of orexin receptors using peripheral novel small
molecule orexin agonists prevents and/or reverses obesity, and improves behavioral sleep/wake patterns. The
immediate goal is to generate sufficient preclinical data to support use of small molecular-weight orexin agonists
to prevent adverse body weight outcomes associated with exposure to obesogenic environments. The long-term
goal is to enable research and development of orexin agonists as therapies for obesity and associated
comorbidities commonly observed in the Veteran population."

Synapses are the fundamental signaling components of the nervous system and mediate trans-neuronal
information transfer. Brain functions require the precise, stereotyped establishment of diverse synaptic
connections into circuits during development, followed by the refinement and maintenance of these circuits
throughout life. Information processing by synaptic circuits underlies the brain's ability to generate behavioral
responses, and circuit alterations are hallmarks of neurological disorders. Despite the importance of synaptic
circuit formation for understanding brain functions and neurological diseases, the fundamental cellular and
molecular framework mediating these processes in the mammalian brain remain unknown. Emerging evidence
suggests that trans-synaptic signaling by networks of cell adhesion molecules directs critical aspects of synaptic
circuit assembly and function. Our previous studies found that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR)
Latrophilins (Lphn) mediate the synaptic wiring specificity of the hippocampal CA1 region. aGPCRs exhibit the
unusual dual function of trans-cellular adhesion and control of intracellular GPCR signal transduction cascades.
Studies of aGPCRs provide an opportunity into understanding the mechanisms of circuit assembly and function.
aGPCRs are the second-largest GPCR class containing 33 members in humans that are poorly understood. For
example, while a significant fraction of FDA-approved drugs target well-studied GPCRs, no effective therapeutics
exist presently for aGPCRs although they have been linked to a range of diseases, including cancer, ADHD, and
autism. Many aGPCRs are highly expressed in the brain, but their biological functions and signal transduction
mechanisms remain unclear. More generally, lack of mechanistic insights into brain circuit assembly is precluding
a deeper understanding of behavioral neuroscience and the basis of neurological disorders. Our studies will
interrogate the biological principles of mammalian central nervous system circuit assembly using a
multidisciplinary combination of approaches. First, we will determine the biological functions and signaling
mechanisms of the aGPCRs. These studies will provide insights into an understudied class of GPCR and reveal
novel principles of mammalian central nervous system development. We will subsequently employ genome
engineering combined with live imaging approaches to monitor the dynamics of synaptic connections forming in
mammalian circuits down to the nanoscale level. Our studies will use these approaches to visualize neural circuit
assembly in both aGPCR mouse models and human neurons derived from patients with neurological disorders.
Furthermore, using a combination of molecular and genetic approaches, we will determine the molecular codes
operating in distinct synaptic subtypes during in vivo synaptogenesis. Collectively, these studies will overcome
several current obstacles in the field and illuminate fundamental principles of how the mammalian brain
assembles via synaptic connectivity."
10909599,"Project Summary
The overall goal is to understand the energy supply mechanisms of learning and memory. The human brain is a
metabolically vulnerable organ, where even an acute interruption in energy supply leads to immediate cognitive
impairment. This energy consumption is primarily at neuronal synapses, which require energy for diverse
processes such as maintaining ion gradients, making new proteins, and transporting molecules. Because most
synapses are placed far from their neuronal cell body, mere ATP diffusion is insufficient to cope with the
immediate (minutes) and sustained (hours) energy demands of local biological processes – a local energy source
is necessary. Consistent with this notion, my lab recently showed that mitochondria are locally stabilized in
dendrites. Local impairment of stable mitochondria affects the ability of nearby spines to undergo synaptic
plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory (Rangaraju et al., Cell 2019, Bapat et al., bioRxiv 2023).
Therefore, spatially stable mitochondria are essential to fulfilling the constant local energy demands of synaptic
plasticity formation and maintenance. In light of our recent unpublished data, we hypothesize that mitochondria
synthesize ATP on-demand during synaptic plasticity, and the temporal and spatial coordination of mitochondrial
energy production near synapses dictates synaptic plasticity in time and space. So far, the known mechanisms
of mitochondrial energy production are primarily based on information averaged across all subcellular
compartments, but how plasticity stimuli regulate subcellular energy supply near synapses is unknown. We at
the Rangaraju Lab will discover novel regulators that dictate the flexibility of local mitochondrial energy
production in temporal (minutes to hours) and spatial (ms of dendrite) scales relevant for synaptic plasticity
formation and maintenance. To tackle this challenge, we combine recent innovations in subcellular proteomics
and CRISPR-based screening in primary neuronal cultures. In addition, we have developed state-of-the-art
methods to measure ATP synthesis and calcium handling in individual spines and mitochondria at high spatial
and temporal resolution to characterize subcellular (dendrites, spines) regulation of mitochondrial energy
production at different stages of synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we will characterize our newly identified mechanisms
in vivo in behavioral assays during various forms of learning and memory (spatial, motor, short- and long-term).
Overall, we will systematically investigate the synaptic energy logistics that allow the brain to process and store
information. As mitochondrial dysfunction is often linked to memory and cognitive impairment, filling the
knowledge gap between mitochondrial mechanisms and cognitive behaviors will provide new solutions to
learning and memory disorders."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Tanzania despite
access to highly active antiretroviral therapy, and tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people
with HIV in Tanzania and worldwide. The Kibong’oto Infectious Diseases Hospital (KIDH) in the Kilimanjaro
region of Tanzania began as a specialized care center for people with HIV, TB, and other complicated infectious
diseases, yet is rapidly transitioning to a National Infectious Diseases Institute (NIDI). Research administrative
capacity at KIDH/NIDI has not kept pace with the rapid increase in new laboratory and clinical research facilities,
total HIV/TB and other infectious diseases research funding, and new affiliated investigators including through
an active Fogarty International Center D43 for training Tanzanian postdoctoral scientists in research leadership.
Following a formal needs assessment, two core areas were identified to best capacitate KIDH/NIDI in its
transition to a national infectious diseases institute: 1) development of a multidivisional research administration
office (pre-award, finance/compliance, post-award) and 2) creation of a self-sustaining training program to
improve the efficiency and efficacy of research administration for KIDH/NIDI practices and later training of local
and regional partnered organizations. To accomplish this, KIDH/NIDI will leverage long-standing partnerships
with the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, a “near-peer” organization with experienced staff capable of local
mentorship, and the University of Virginia / Center for Global Health Equity which has successfully administered
multiple NIH / Fogarty International Center Training programs including a G11 for HIV research administration
in another East African setting. Research administrative trainees (one new hire for each track) will undergo
general and then specialized training within a track (pre-award, finance/compliance, post-award). Metrics of
training success differ for each track, and individual trainee and overall programmatic achievement will be
assessed by mentors, programmatic leadership, and a Training Advisory Committee composed of experienced
HIV scientists and research administrators working in Tanzania and with prior G11 participation. In addition to
improving KIDH/NIDI’s administrative capacity to increase the total number of awards submitted, the prime
awards to KIDH/NIDI, the number of awards submitted by junior investigators, and the overall diversity of the
HIV and local infectious diseases research portfolio, KIDH/NIDI is uniquely positioned to test the transferability
of the research administrative toolkit developed within this training program to one or more of the 14 other Sub-
Saharan African institutes in the PanACEA clinical research consortium that KIDH/NIDI serves as secretariat."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) affects 29.5 million people in the United States, and about 70% of those seeking AUD
treatment suffer a relapse in the first year. Stress and anxiety can trigger a relapse. There are no medications approved
for treating these flares and behavioral approaches are limited. Soovu Labs is developing wearable medical device to
treat anxiety and stress by stimulation of peripheral C-Tactile (CT) fibers and thermally sensitive TRPV-1 channels. Phase
I will determine the “best” stimulation paraments for these targets and then perform a proof of concept study. Phase II
will create and test a novel wearable device that stimulates two separate neurological pathways for use in treating
symptoms of anxiety and stress in those with AUD. That device will be modeled after our commercial pain relief device,
the Soovu Pain Relief Device.
CT fibers are found in the skin of most mammals and project to the insular cortex. Stimulation of CT fibers by light touch
causes a release of oxytocin and is associated with feelings of comfort and wellbeing. Peripheral TRPV-1 channels are
important in pain transmission and modulation of the stress response likely through the central release of oxytocin and
are stimulated by heat. In Phase 1 we will test stimulation of TRPV1 channels and CT fibers in human subjects to
correlate the lab findings with subjective human responses and test whether stimulation of CT fibers and TRPV-1
channels reduce anxiety and stress in subjects who suffer from AUD.
Aim 1 and 2. We will define the optimal parameters for CT fiber stimulation for force, temperature, and body location.
We will perform similar testing for peripheral thermal stimulation (TRPV-1) using our commercially available heating
pods. Parameters tested will include the optimal body location, number of heating pods (2-4) and temperature of pods.
In Aim 3 we will simultaneously apply both CT fiber and thermal stimulation in a proof of concept study. The
experimental group will receive active CT fiber and thermal stimulation and the control group non-physiologic placebo
stimulation. Subjects with a history of AUD will be randomized into control versus experimental groups and undergo
stress using a validated mental calculation stressors. Stress, cravings, and anxiety will be measured using standardized
assessments, and we will measure salivary oxytocin and cortisol levels, potentially biomarkers.
Phase 2 overview: Phase II will create and test a new wearable medical device that reduces stress and anxiety by direct
stimulation of the peripheral nervous system. The new device will be controlled by the user via a phone app with
support functions delivered via the app in a manner similar to the current one used by Soovu’s pain relief device. The
new device will be the first to offer a rapid onset nondrug intervention to treat stress and anxiety for those with AUD."
10919617,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel
approach to hepatic fibrosis treatment and to explore its clinical translatability. Hepatic fibrosis is
a progressive liver disease caused by multiple etiologies and can be seen in most patients with
chronic liver injury. While initially reversible, hepatic fibrosis is often left untreated due to its
asymptomatic nature and thus can progress into an irreversible late stage resulting in liver
cirrhosis, portal hypertension, liver failure, and eventually, death. Unfortunately, there are
currently no FDA-approved drugs available to treat liver fibrosis. VSR-H5 is a novel therapeutic
that specifically targets a unique epitope within the extracellular matrix (ECM) only in areas of
undergoing active ECM remodeling and fibrogenesis, disrupting pro-fibrotic myofibroblast
activation. This novel approach specifically avoids systemic disruption of critical, normal integrin
receptor engagement, thus represents an approach that can achieve both high potency and
strong safety. In this proposal we will explore two aims: 1) establish the in vivo efficacy of VSR-
H5 in treating liver fibrosis using a well-established Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mouse
liver fibrosis model; and 2) determine the clinical translatability of VSR-H5 by confirming the
presence of the target epitope in human cirrhotic liver tissue and evaluating the antibody's ability
to reverse fibrotic cellular phenotypes in primary human liver stellate cells our established and
validated human in vitro fibrosis model. Successful completion of this Phase I STTR will provide
the data necessary to justify further investment in this strategy toward treating liver fibrosis."

The proposed project aims to address the critical need for a comprehensive library of structurally defined sulfated
O-GalNAc glycans to advance our understanding of their biological functions in human health and diseases.
Despite their widespread occurrence and potential importance in health and disease, our understanding of the
precise functions of these glycans remains limited, primarily due to the lack of access to a comprehensive library
of well-defined synthetic sulfated O-GalNAc glycans and associated toolkits for functional glycomics. This
proposal aims to synthesize sulfated O-GalNAc glycans using Sulfated Modular Synthesis / Enzymatic Assembly
(SMSEA) approach. The SMSEA method stands out as it offers a cost-effective convergent modular synthesis
backed by well-established methodologies. Subsequently, glycosyltransferases are employed to expand the
core, utilizing diverse biosynthesis pathways. This results in the creation of complex, larger, and highly diverse
sulfated O-GalNAc glycans. The use of Fmoc-protected threonine as a terminal linker enables synthetic glycans
for versatile research applications, including glycoconjugates and glycopeptides. By synthesizing 38 unique
sulfated O-GalNAc glycans, including specific types such as the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X structure, this library will
act as an invaluable toolkit for functional glycomics. Furthermore, the project also innovates in glycan microarray
technology, developing coating chemistry tailored to the multivalent presentation of sulfated O-GalNAc glycans
on the array surface. This paves the way for the debut of a first-ever sulfated O-GalNAc glycan microarray,
establishing another invaluable toolkit for functional glycomics. This project holds significant promise to advance
our understanding of the glycobiology of sulfated O-GalNAc glycans."
10930848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of cirrhosis and liver failure, and the 12th leading cause
of death in adult patients in the United States. ALD progresses from fatty liver, to alcoholic steatohepatitis,
fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pharmacological therapies for ALD are urgently needed
as FDA-approved medications are currently available. In published work, we have demonstrated that the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a critical mediator of alcohol-related liver damage in both
humans and mice. IL-17A is mainly produced by CD4+ Th17 cells. IL-17A production is regulated by IL-23, a
cytokine that promotes the maintenance, survival, and proliferation of Th17 cells. Our preclinical studies clearly
demonstrate that blocking IL-17 signaling with an anti-IL-23 antibody-based treatment significantly improves
alcohol-related liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Here, we evaluate whether the IL-23 blocking antibody
guselkumab effectively reduces serum levels of IL-23 and IL-17A as well as the number of circulating Th17
cells48,49 in samples from treated patients from our Phase I clinical trial. This Phase 1 trial will enroll adult
participants who have a history of moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) along with documented clinical
evidence of chronic liver disease due to alcohol but no evidence of cirrhosis or severe hepatic dysfunction or
alcoholic hepatitis. It will follow a standard 3+3 Phase I dose escalation trial design with a maximum of 24
subjects. We will assess the drug’s safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in a population that meets
criteria for AUD and early signs of end-organ-damage to the liver, as made evident and quantified by advanced
non-invasive MRI based biomarkers of liver fat and fibrosis. We will assess biomarkers for both guselkumab
target engagement as well as biomarkers for early treatment response (ALT, ELF, Pro-C3).
Aim 1: Assess safety and tolerability of guselkumab (anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody) in a Phase 1 dose
escalation study in patients with alcohol use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease.
Aim 2: Assess the pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease.
Aim 3: Assess pharmacodynamics of guselkumab target engagement and biomarkers of early treatment
response."
10930909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Dosing of chemotherapeutics is limited by systemic toxic side effects. We are developing a new class of image-
guided temporarily deployable, endovascular catheter-based medical devices that selectively remove specific drugs from the
blood stream to reduce systemic toxicities. The proposed ChemoFilters incorporate specialized materials that bind target
drugs in situ through a variety of mechanisms. During intraarterial chemotherapy (IAC) infusion to a target organ (e.g., a solid
organ containing a tumor), excess drug not trapped in the target organ passes through to the veins draining the organ and
then is circulated to the rest of the body, causing toxicities in distant locations. By temporarily deploying a ChemoFilter in the
vein(s) draining the organ undergoing IAC, we seek to bind excess drug before it can escape to cause systemic toxicity. The
ChemoFilter would then be removed in the interventional radiology suite shortly after the IAC procedure, thus removing
excess drug from the patient. Although paired intraaterial infusion and venous filtration can theoretically be used for any drug
that has its site of therapeutic action in one location and its site of dose-limiting toxicity in another location, the most compelling
application for this technology is increasing efficacy and safety of locoregional cancer chemotherapy.
 Primary and metastatic liver tumors are among the top three causes of cancer death worldwide. Image-guided
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), a form of IAC, cost-effectively increases survival in this population. Doxorubicin
(Dox) is a low-cost, highly effective, chemotherapeutic agent frequently used in IAC. Dox use is limited by systemic toxicities,
most importantly irreversible cardiac failure. Dox follows a therapeutic linear dose-response model, in which increasing dose
linearly increases tumor cell kill, providing motivation for higher-dose Dox therapy. Our initial project has yielded ChemoFilters
that can reduce Dox deposition in the heart by 46% in animal models. We seek to build upon that success by designing,
building, and testing new devices that can be more easily navigated to the hepatic veins in human patients.
 Prototype ChemoFilters will be modeled, built, validated in vitro for efficacy, and tested in vivo in a large animal model
for navigability in Phase I by experienced teams from Filtro, Inc and UCSF. In phase II, the optimized devices from phase I
will then be tested for efficacy and safety in a large animal model and a first-in-man safety and efficacy study in patients with
unresectable liver cancer will be planned and initiated. Achievement of these aims will create new minimally invasive medical
devices that should markedly increase the efficacy of image-guided locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy by lowering
systemic drug concentrations and reducing systemic toxicities for the usual dose of Dox as part of TACE. Completion of this
study will poise the ChemoFilter technology for a pivotal clinical trial that would assess Dox dose escalation in any given
IAC/TACE procedure to achieve better local tumor control in fewer IAC/TACE sessions."
10930921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite great promise, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have had only modest impact on breast cancer
patients’ survival. Mechanistic studies into the interplay between the immune system and the tumor cells
identified the tumor microenvironment (TME) as the critical factor in dictating the impact of ICIs on tumor
progression. Clinical advancements in ICI efficacy will require combinations with agents that can induce a
broad shift in the microenvironmental milieu, which may prove especially important for highly aggressive
tumors. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly lethal breast cancer with few therapeutic options.
In phase II clinical trial for triple-negative IBC patients, we found that anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab
(PmAb) combined with preoperative chemotherapy led to a high treatment response. We further found that in
IBC models, PmAb reduced the expression of immunosuppressive chemokines and led to increased infiltration
of cytotoxic T cells; suggesting a broad shift from an immunosuppressive to immunoreactive TME. Building on
these preliminary findings, we propose to determine the mechanism by which EGFR promotes the expression
of immunosuppressive chemokines and if, in turn, this effect is responsible for the observed
immunosuppressive TME in IBC. While EGFR inhibition has been examined as a way to target tumor cell
proliferation and survival, to our knowledge, no other group has examined EGFR as a modulator of the TME in
IBC. We propose 3 aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which the EGFR pathway modulates the
TME in IBC. We hypothesize that the EGFR pathway induces an immunosuppressive TME in IBC through
EGR1-regulated expression of immunosuppressive chemokines. We will test this hypothesis via in vitro assays
and our novel humanized IBC immunocompetent mouse model. Aim 2: Evaluate the combination of
immunotherapy with EGFR inhibition in IBC. We hypothesize that EGFR-targeted therapy will enhance the
efficacy of immunotherapy in IBC by shifting the TME from an immunosuppressive to an immunoreactive
phenotype. We will test the efficacy of targeting EGFR and inhibiting immune checkpoints in combination using
the novel IBC humanized mouse model and triple-negative breast cancer immunocompetent mouse models
with intrinsic and acquired resistance to ICIs. Aim 3: Determine the clinical relevance of EGFR-modulated
TME changes in IBC. We hypothesize that reduced expression of EGR1 and its likely transcriptional targets
correlates with TME immunoreactive status and predicts IBC patient response to PmAb-based therapies. We
will assess the clinical relevance of our pathway using an IBC genomic dataset and multiplexed
immunostaining on an IBC tissue microarray and IBC tissues from an ongoing PmAb clinical trial. Upon
completion, we expect to identify TME changes that predict patient response to EGFR-targeted therapy and
establish a novel EGFR-based combination therapy with ICIs for patients with IBC. Beyond IBC, our research
will broaden our understanding of how we can modulate the TME as a potential therapeutic approach."

10921377,"KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate an app, Personalized 
Approach To Habits – Sleep [PATH-S], that will use casual gaming and intermittent reinforcement to 
encourage Black teens (ages 14-17) with asthma to adopt and persist with personalized habits to improve sleep 
duration.
Although sleep is fundamental for human productivity and health, only one quarter of teens in the U.S. 
report obtaining recommended amounts of sleep. Sleep problems are magnified among teens with asthma, who 
are more likely to experience sleep disturbances like trouble falling asleep, wheezing during sleep, frequent 
nighttime wakening, and daytime sleepiness. Asthma symptoms impact sleep, and poor sleep, in turn, worsens 
asthma symptoms.
The data on overlapping health disparities for Black teens in regard to sleep and to asthma are stark. Because 
being Black heightens the independent likelihood of both poor sleep and having asthma, it is unsurprising that 
Black teens with asthma experience worse sleep outcomes than White teens with asthma, and their sleep 
problems are likely to persist into adulthood.
In this Phase I proposal, KDHRC will develop and evaluate the PATH-S minimally viable prototype (MVP), 
an app that specifically addresses this health disparity and supports Black teens with asthma to build and 
persist with habits that will build sleep duration, focus, and attention, and decrease asthma symptoms in turn. 
KDHRC will develop and evaluate PATH-S with technical vendor Thrust Interactive, on Thrust’s existing and 
research-validated Treks platform. PATH-S will increase user engagement by providing health-related content 
in the form of a game that breaks behaviors down into simple, daily, evidence-based tasks that the app refers to 
as “micro-habits.” Users can 1) learn healthy sleep habits and create a personalized path to better sleep; 2) 
review progress and make plan adjustments; and 3) report their own asthma symptoms and the extent to 
which their symptoms impacted them. PATH-S will create competition against other users via a leaderboard
and provide game-like reinforcement for achievements. PATH-S will sync to a FitBit to allow users to track 
sleep metrics.
In this Phase I project, KDHRC will receive input from an expert advisory committee, develop the PATH-S 
MVP, conduct user testing of the PATH-S MVP, finalize the PATH-S MVP, and conduct a feasibility study of 
the PATH-S MVP. To commercialize PATH-S, KDHRC will sell to third party payors, expand PATH-S to 
support more audiences at risk for sleep problems, and begin direct-to-consumer marketing."

 In this renewal, we build on our experience serving as the VERITY Bioinformatics Core, expanding Core
services to include advancements in the field since the last application. Research using electronic medical
record (EMR) data continues to grow with increasing availability of EMR data. Simultaneously, methods to
utilize data for research have also advanced including natural language processing (NLP) and machine
learning (ML) to extract crucial clinical data embedded in narrative notes, and to include these data in models
of disease risk and outcomes. However, there remains a large gap between access to raw EMR data
optimized for billing and patient care, and the ability to fully and appropriately utilize these data in clinical
research. Through consultations, courses offered as part of the Bioinformatics Core, and current Core projects,
we have identified 4 areas of high demand and/or unmet need for clinical investigators: (1) phenotyping using
EMR data; (2) extraction of clinical data from narrative notes using NLP, including early applications of this
technology to study social determinants of health; (3) use of EMR for studies of treatment effects and
applications of causal inference methods; and (4) approaches for multi-institutional EMR studies without
requiring direct sharing of data (termed federated learning).
 The mission of the Bioinformatics Core remains supporting investigators from the pediatric and
adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) research community to apply and integrate bioinformatics
approaches to clinical research studies using EMR data. While our target audience remains trainees and
junior faculty, in this renewal, our expanded services are also designed for established investigators interested
in incorporating bioinformatics to their research programs. Aim 1. To provide methods for investigators to
obtain robust and accurate phenotypes using information from EMRs and integrating these data for clinical
studies. This requires applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches for phenotyping
with EMR data. As well, we will utilize causal inference methods applied to EMR data for studies of treatment
effects. Aim 2. To provide NLP support enabling clinical research studies with EMR data. We will support and
develop the use of NLP to incorporate social determinants of health (SDoH) in studies of health equity using
EMR data. As well, we will support and educate investigators on the use of NLP based data and tools. Aim 3.
To strengthen existing ties and build new partnerships between the rheumatic and MSK clinical research and
bioinformatics communities through Core platforms and consulting services.
 The Bioinformatics Core team and a network of expert advisors will perform consultations, provide
educational services, and deliver bioinformatics research services to the Research Community. Additionally,
we will build on our foundation to enable cross-institutional studies with federated learning approaches for
clinical studies on rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions."

Clinical and Translational Research Core (CTRC) 
The Clinical and Translational Research Core (CTRC) provides the infrastructure for neurodegenerative disease 
(NDD) clinical research within the Center for Neurodegenerative and Translational Neuroscience (CNTN). In 
Phase 1, the Core recruited, characterized, and retained a clinical cohort consisting of more than 190 “deeply 
phenoyped” research participants across five diagnostic groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC), PD with mild 
cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and cognitively normal controls (CNC). Data from this cohort directly supported 
the research goals of 5 projects in Phase 1, as well several other collaborations. In Phase 2, the core will extend 
the study up to ten years. As in Phase 1, the CTRC will provide each project leader with operational and 
regulatory support, project management, and research instruction that will help advance them toward the goal 
of independent funding. A notable enhancement of the Clinical Core in Phase 2 includes a focus on the role of 
neuroinflammation in NDD. The CTRC’s multimodal approach to neuroinflammation (including neuroimaging, 
blood-based biomarkers, genetics, and clinical assessments) represents one of the first comprehensive 
databases in the field of NDD. In addition to sustaining the clinical core, the CTRC will focus on increasing 
participation rates of traditionally underrepresented patient populations. Participation will be facilitated through 
expansion of our education and outreach program. This program, which was implemented in Phase 1, is guided 
by input from a Community Advisory Board (CAB) and includes an innovative education and outreach website 
(Healthybrains.org). Finally, the core will also establish the first biobank in Southern Nevada at the University of 
Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) under the direction of Dr. Jefferson Kinney. This new resource will store, analyze, 
and provide expertise in the evaluation of non-clinical and clinical biospecimens. In addition to supporting the 
currently proposed projects, a number of additional COBRE and non-COBRE collaborators will access this 
valuable resource. The CTRC has formative and summative assessments imbedded within in that will insure 
success in achieving its specific aims."
10921427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal’s long-term goal is to improve the care of patients with communicating hydrocephalus, normal
pressure hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Use of CSF diversion systems such as
lumboperitoneal shunts, ventriculoperitoneal shunts and ventriculoatrial shunts is well established, however,
substantial limitations remain.
Current shunt systems have been in existence for decades, however they do suffer from many limitations.
Shunt revision rates due to shunt failure are extremely high with up to one-third of patients undergoing revision
surgery within one year. Infection rates are high at 20%. Other common complications include hemorrhage
and obstruction.
A few groups have proposed the development of novel minimally invasive and even endovascularly delivered
CSF diversion systems. One such system involves the delivery of a puncture needle to the inferior petrosal
sinus at the skull base followed by the delivery of a shunt catheter which allows for CSF diversion from the
cerebellopontine angle to the internal jugular vein. Early studies with this device have been promising, but
there are concerns with this anatomical approach given the proximity of the puncture needle to critical
structures including the basilar artery and brainstem.
Through our experience in the treatment of a rare form of spinal CSF leaks called CSF-venous fistulas, our
group has developed a very large experience in the transcatheter navigation of the spinal venous space,
particularly the epidural and foraminal veins and have realized the potential feasibility of transvenous
transcatheter delivery of catheters from the spinal venous space to the CSF space for treatment of CSF
accumulation disorders. We have demonstrated the anatomic and technical feasibility in cadaver models.
In this Phase I STTR program, we are proposing the development of a novel Lumbo-venous CSF Shunt for
Treatment of Communicating Hydrocephalus. This novel catheter system includes a novel 6.5Fr steerable sheath,
transvenous dural puncture needle and an innovative shunt catheter implant design that allows for equilibration
of CSF pressures with the common iliac vein and easy retrievability. If successful, our Lumbo-venous CSF Shunt
system will enhance care of patients requiring CSF diversion treatments."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a rapid, non-invasive, accurate, and low-cost smartphone
application (app), called iLIGN, to perform automated pre-screening using artificial intelligence for diagnosing
ocular misalignment (Strabismus) by individuals without specialty expertise or training. Strabismus, commonly
referred to as ""crossed eyes"" or ""squint,"" is an ocular condition whereby the eyes are not properly aligned. The
worldwide estimated prevalence in children is ~2%, being higher in underdeveloped countries (5.7%) than
developed countries (1.3%). In adults, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with new-onset strabismus is
approximately 1-in-25 subjects. To prevent irreversible vision loss, it is critical to evaluate children of all
populations for ocular alignment as early as possible. Poor academic performance, diminished workplace
achievement, esthetic dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, delayed developmental milestones, and familial and
societal low acceptance are well-known outcomes. Therefore, early diagnosis and therapy restores binocular
vision, eliminates permanent vision loss, and lessens the need for repeated lifetime treatments. Once diagnosed,
therapy can be as simple as prescribing glasses and covering the normal eye with a patch while the weaker eye
improves, or for severe cases surgical correction and re-alignment.
 Even in developed nations, strabismus screening requires not only qualified healthcare professionals but
also specialized devices. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a visual acuity screen for 4- and 5-
year-olds and cooperative 3-year-olds. Traditional eye charts can detect visual impairments from ages 3 to 5 but
with limitations. These are often tedious and result in inaccurate findings. Due to this reason, instrument-based
screening can be utilized for children up until 5 years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American
Academy of Ophthalmology currently recommended photo-screening for children under 3 years old. All current
methods require qualified healthcare personnel as operators. A mobile app is in development for strabismus
screening but, again, for use only by trained technicians. Our solution will utilize AI models on current photos to
identify strabismus without the requirement for specialists with specialized training. In Aim 1 we will develop an
image capture protocol and data curation and in Aim 2 we will develop an automated image analysis software
for deep learning-based strabismus diagnosis. iLIGN’s key innovation is in allowing untrained end-users with
automated software assessment to diagnose and thereby prevent a condition which often geos undiagnosed
without requisite specialty training and healthcare resources, and untreated carries enormous financial and
societal impact. The expected outcome of this project is a software platform (smartphone app), iLIGN, a
paradigm shift in the pre-screening of vision-threatening strabismus, which is a leading cause of preventable
blindness in children and a major contributor to morbidity in adults."
10921494,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over half of all children severely hurt their teeth through physical injury or carious legion, resulting in the
performance of 4.7M endodontic procedures per year in the pediatric and young adult population. Maintenance
of vital pulp in the tooth is critical for the ability to fight future infections, prevent fracture, and retain the tooth,
particularly for immature permanent teeth without fully developed roots. Existing treatment options include non-
vital therapies, such as apexification and root canal therapy, vital pulp therapies, which preserve some existing
pulp but do not maintain vital pulp throughout the dental canal, and revascularization therapy, which suffers
from high rates of adverse events. Treatment with Vital-Dent, a hydrogel material that supports the
regeneration of vital pulp tissue for the restoration of pulp throughout the dental canal, will increase tooth
retention and promote resistance to fracture and infection. Vital-Dent is an acellular, drug-free hydrogel that
provides obturation and pulp regeneration for regenerative endodontic procedures. Vital-Dent consists of two
biopolymers (porcine derived gelatin with added unfractionated heparin) and photoinitiator dissolved in saline.
The liquid hydrogel precursor is placed into the pulp canal and then is photocrosslinked. The hydrogel works
as a barrier to influx of blood into the treated tooth root, inhibiting the acute inflammatory response to thrombus
formation, with the gelatin supporting cellular migration into the hydrogel from the periapical space. The
heparin supplement promotes swelling of the gelatin hydrogel to ensure the full obturation and the barrier
function. The extensive testing completed to date demonstrates the regeneration of pulp tissue and
maintenance of tooth vitality with Vital-Dent. Phase I results showed that Vital-Dent doubled the incidence of
apex closure relative to revascularization. This is the paramount outcome for pediatric indications, as continued
tooth development greatly increases tooth survival. The work proposed here represents a significant step
towards bringing Vital-Dent to the clinic. The Vital-Dent manufacturing process will be scaled up and the
product formulation will be optimized to include cGMP precursor biomacromolecules while maintaining the
equivalent physical properties and biocompatibility of the final hydrogel. This aim will result in the manufacture
of a fully cGMP-compliant batch of Vital-Dent. The mechanical and functional properties of the final Vital-Dent
formulation will be characterized, and an in vivo study will evaluate the effectiveness of Vital-Dent. Finally, we
will perform biocompatibility testing to assess for cytotoxicity, sensitization potential, irritation, and acute and
subacute toxicity. The proposed studies have been designed to support the filing for FDA clearance of Vital-
Dent, a critical step towards adoption of Vital-Dent."
10927418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microphthalmia, anophthalmia and coloboma (MAC) is a group of severe ocular phenotypes characterized by a
reduction in size or absence of the eye or a gap (hole) involving various ocular structures. The success rate for
identifying a genetic diagnosis for MAC spectrum remains incomplete, making the discovery of novel
mechanisms an important priority. Copy number variations (CNVs) are deletions or duplications of genomic
segments that can be inherited or occur as dominant de novo variants. There is a growing list of developmental
phenotypes associated with CNVs, indicating that dosage imbalance represents an important factor in human
disease. Within this group, the contribution of dosage gain variants remains underappreciated due to many
factors including the involvement of multiple genes necessitating complex functional studies. In this proposal,
we will combine our expertise in MAC and the zebrafish model to reveal novel mechanisms of these
debilitating human phenotypes. We present evidence for the association of dosage gain at two different
genomic regions, 20q11 and 3q29, with isolated and syndromic MAC, with multiple affected families identified
in our cohort for both loci. We will utilize our extensive collection of DNA samples from individuals affected with
MAC to further define the contribution of these and other candidate regions to human disease, as well as to
discover novel disease-causing dosage-sensitive loci. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the driver gene(s) and
pathway(s) involved in phenotypes associated with 20q11 dosage variation by generating and studying dosage
gain/loss models for the zebrafish id1, bcl2l1 and tpx2 genes, identified as top candidates within the region; 2)
reveal driver gene(s) and pathway(s) involved in phenotypes associated with 3q29 dosage variation by
exploring dosage gain/loss models for zebrafish rubcn, dlg1 and/or bdh1 genes, located in the affected human
region; and 3) uncover critical dosage-sensitive regions involved in human MAC spectrum by additional
mapping of previously identified CNVs as well as exploring a large cohort (760 samples from affected
individuals and their relatives) of extensively tested but unexplained MAC families, followed by dissection of
novel candidate regions in zebrafish. The successful completion of this project will identify novel factors in
human ocular development, both genomic regions/genes and affected pathways, and generate robust animal
models of these complex human phenotypes."

Pediatric SDB, which ranges in severity from mild snoring to the most severe condition, obstructive sleep apnea
syndrome (OSAS), is extremely common. SDB occurs in 10.5-17.1% of children, with 1-3% experiencing OSAS,
making OSAS the second most common pediatric chronic health condition after asthma (8.6%). OSAS has been
linked to considerable cardiometabolic, cognitive, and behavioral complications, including increased risk of
death. Even mild SDB, or snoring without apnea, is associated with similar cardiometabolic and neurobehavioral
impairments, such as hypertension, poor asthma control, and deficits in behavior, attention, and executive
functioning. Untreated SDB can result in a 215% elevation in child healthcare usage and 40% more hospital
visits. Many studies show that compared to White children, Black children are up to 6 times more likely to develop
SDB across SDB severities. In the seminal Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), Black children had more
severe OSAS on polysomnography (PSG) compared to children of other racial/ethnic backgrounds (p=0.004).
This finding held even when controlling for factors that differ by race and contribute to OSAS severity, such as
obesity. CHAT also found that Black children were less likely to improve following adenotonsillectomy (AT), the
gold standard treatment for OSAS. In a prospective study conducted here at CHOP, 35% of Black children
experienced post-operative respiratory complications following AT for OSAS compared to 24% in other races
(p=.036). Finally, despite an increased prevalence of SDB in Black children, they are significantly less likely to
receive AT treatment when diagnosed with OSAS compared to White children. Few studies have examined
whether factors beyond comorbid conditions (obesity; prematurity; asthma) and variation in family socioeconomic
status (SES) contribute to these observed disparities by race in SDB prevalence, sequelae, and treatment
outcomes. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to identify novel socio-ecological factors contributing
to disparities by race in SDB, particularly with regard to the SDB-related symptoms of sleepiness and
neurobehavioral impairments, and to explore the role of provider's implicit racial bias in parent
perceptions of SDB-related healthcare and disparities in referral patterns."

 The purpose of this Career Enhancement Program is to support promising investigators who will participate
in translational breast cancer research projects. There are one to two awardees at any one time, who may be
either MD's or PhD's. Candidates are selected based on their previous accomplishments and their potential and
desire to pursue a career in academic breast cancer research. While our primary focus is to support promising
young investigators at the junior faculty level, it is possible that more established investigators may also be
appropriate for support.
 The general outline of each awardee’s research will have been discussed by the applicant and the Selection
Committee as a part of the selection process, and a principal mentor from the Program Faculty will be agreed
upon. Awardees will receive further guidance from the Executive Committee and the selected mentor in
developing their translational research projects throughout the award period. They will also participate in an
extensive set of seminars, professional development courses, and clinical opportunities.
 The research environment at the Baylor Breast Center is ideal for supporting translational activities. Scientific
excellence in breast cancer research continues to be reaffirmed by the award of both individual and collaborative
grants, while both national and local programs of clinical investigation are well established at the Baylor Breast
Center and can serve to assist in the translation of research findings into clinical practice. This is an excellent
setting for enhancing and focusing the careers of outstanding investigators on productive translational research
in breast cancer. Indeed, of the 21 young investigators who received partial support from this program in the 26
years since our first SPORE award, most are active in academic research positions in breast cancer, and four
have important roles in this new SPORE proposal including one project leader."

10919243,"The central goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to understand the structure and function of human brain circuits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has great potential to achieve this goal, however fMRI is fundamentally an indirect measure of neuronal activity—it assesses brain function through the measurement of changes in blood flow and oxygenation driven by local neuronal activity, and is also influenced by regional differences in tissue anatomy including vascular density. The cerebral cortex consists of layers that are well- known to serve as inputs or outputs for the connections across brain regions, and so localizing fMRI signals to individual layers will be key to deciphering brain circuitry in humans. However, the cortical microanatomy varies dramatically across layers, introducing biases that have been demonstrated to confound our ability to detect and localize activity within layers with fMRI, and therefore to hinder the interpretation and use of laminar fMRI. Our aim is to characterize and remove these fMRI signal biases due to local differences in microanatomy, in order to address this fundamental limitation of fMRI and to more accurately relate fMRI to neuronal activity. We will achieve this goal by combining histology of human brain specimens with advanced ex vivo and in vivo imaging to develop a framework for enhancing fMRI neuronal specificity—through deriving a mapping between tissue microarchitecture and quantitative MRI, and then correcting fMRI signal bias related to tissue microstructure. The candidate is trained in physics and computer science; has experience in high-resolution structural MRI and in correlating in vivo and ex vivo MRI with histology; and seeks training in experimental neuroscience in order to become an independent researcher in this field. During the mentored phase, she will develop a model of intracortical microstructure using ex vivo data from regions of visual cortex. She will measure vascular density in vivo to map out this additional source of fMRI signal bias, then develop a model to derive predictions of cortical microstructure and fMRI responses in vivo, and validate it through an fMRI experiment using a wide range of acquisition parameters. To achieve these goals, the candidate—with guidance from the experienced mentors, the pioneers of laminar microanatomy and fMRI—will extend her knowledge, gain new skills in advanced ultra- high-field fMRI acquisition and data analysis. Building on this, in the independent phase she will apply the model to laminar fMRI experiments designed to validate the bias correction. This project will prepare the candidate for her long-term career goal of establishing a research program applying non-invasive functional imaging techniques, with aid of quantitative tissue property analyses, to study the circuitry of the human brain. The mentored phase will be carried out at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, a highly collaborative environment with state-of-the-art imaging facilities and world-class experts available for mentoring/consultation. The K99 award will facilitate the required training and research components of this project to aid the candidate in becoming an independent researcher."
10919163,"Project Summary: Revolutionary advances in imaging drive discovery in the biological sciences and
medicine. These advances in imaging sciences depend on innovations in technology throughout the
physical and biological sciences. In recent decades, a number of significant breakthroughs have
underscored the fundamental importance of this interdependent relationship between technology and
biomedical science. One important discovery that culminated in the 2008 Nobel Prize was the work on
fluorescent proteins in the laboratories of Shimomura, Chalfie, Inoue, Tsien and many others. “Live cell
microscopy would have remained in the hands of a small number of skilled cell biologists had not these
groups devised a simple way to use molecular biology to tag vital proteins in living cells. Gene products can
be localized not only structurally, as with antibody technology, but also dynamically within living cells. With
this technology, it is now possible to place virtually any biomolecule in the context of structure and
dynamics; that is, within space and time.”
From the current perspective, where are the frontiers of imaging sciences in the 21st century, and what are
its biggest challenges? Challenges in basic and translational sciences, often define the imaging science
challenges, as illustrated in the following examples. (1) Optogenetic and Chemogenetic techniques have
revolutionized the way brain circuitry is probed, and now enable dissection of complex neuromodulatory
circuits related to reward, aversion and anxiety. Novel Sonogenetic methods are also just now emerging.
Yet these technologies for “writing” information into the brain require advances in imaging to “read” the
responses. (2) Computational imaging has experienced a revolution over the last 5 years with the incredible
growth in machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, as these methods are translated into
clinical applications the challenges in optimizing and validating implementation loom large. (3) Tremendous
progress is anticipated in the area of cell therapy and tissue engineering. Yet, these advanced therapeutics
are asking for advancements in imaging for personalized therapeutic optimization. (4) Major advances in
multimodal imaging technologies have recently been made, most prominently the development of PET/MR
hybrid systems. New hybrid imaging systems that combine PET and optical or photoacoustic imaging, for
example, advance only through solving imaging science challenges.
A new educational and creative paradigm is required to prepare future imaging scientists for solving these
problems. Interdisciplinary teams of engineers, physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians, chemists,
biologists, and physicians working together at the interfaces between biology, technology, and medicine are
needed to collaborate in the development of new imaging technologies and strategies. With these needs
and goals in mind, Washington University created the Imaging Sciences Pathway (ISP)."
10919165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although aggressive treatments
have improved outcomes, many MB patients still die of their disease, and survivors suffer severe long-term side
effects from therapy. MB comprises four subgroups—WNT, Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3 and Group 4—that
differ in terms of molecular alterations, clinical characteristics and outcomes. We have some understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying WNT, SHH and Group 3 tumors, but the pathways that drive Group 4
medulloblastoma (G4MB), the most prevalent form of the disease, remain a mystery. The lack of progress on
G4MB has been due to a poor understanding of the genes, cells and processes leading to the disease. Recently,
we identified a putative cell of origin for G4MB and a polyprotein complex whose members are mutated in the
majority of G4 tumors. Our preliminary studies suggest that G4MB arises from a population of bipotential
progenitor cells in the rhombic lip that gives rise to glutamatergic neurons, including unipolar brush cells (UBCs)
and granule neurons (GNs). The fate of these progenitors is controlled by the Core Binding Factor (CBFA)
complex, which contains transcriptional co-repressors, transcription factors, histone demethylases and histone
methyltransferases. During early development, this complex maintains cells in a progenitor state. Later, when
the complex is inactivated, cells undergo differentiation into GNs and UBCs. Alterations that prevent inactivation
of this complex are predicted to prevent differentiation and maintain cells in a progenitor state. Importantly, we
found that genetic alterations in members of this complex are among the most common driver events in G4MB.
We hypothesize that mutations in the CBFA complex derail normal differentiation and constitute the core
mutational route to G4MB, and that targeting this complex will improve outcomes for G4MB patients. To test this
hypothesis, we will determine how the CBFA complex regulates differentiation and tumorigenesis, test whether
alteration of the complex can drive G4MB tumorigenesis, and determine whether targeting the CBFA complex
promotes differentiation and inhibits G4MB. Collectively, these studies will address fundamental questions
regarding the origin and underlying mechanisms driving G4MB tumorigenesis, and probe newly revealed
vulnerabilities to develop novel approaches to therapy for this devastating disease."
10919171,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness and will affect >110 million
people by 2040. Early detection and treatment are critical, as symptoms typically do not present
until the disease is advanced. A data-driven precision medicine approach is needed to better
identify individuals who are at greatest risk of developing the disease and who are at greatest
risk of progressing quickly to vision loss. While there has been considerable progress in eye
imaging and testing to improve glaucoma monitoring, precision management of glaucoma is
incomplete without accounting for patients' co-existing systemic conditions, concurrent systemic
medications and treatments, and adherence with prescribed glaucoma treatment.
Understanding how systemic conditions, and specifically vascular conditions such as
hypertension, impact glaucoma presents growing public health importance given the increasing
co-morbidities facing aging populations. Preliminary studies have demonstrated the predictive
value of systemic data, even without ophthalmic endpoints. Similarly, measuring medication
adherence is important for guiding patient counseling and engagement and avoiding
downstream interventions such as surgeries, which carry high cost and morbidity. These factors
are important for providing a more comprehensive perspective of glaucoma management and
for improving patient outcomes, yet they are relatively understudied.
I propose applying multi-modal advancements in health information technology (IT) to address
these gaps and achieve the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning-based
predictive models classifying patients at risk for glaucoma progression using systemic electronic
health record (EHR) data from a diverse nationwide patient cohort; (2) evaluate how integrating
blood pressure (BP) data from novel smartwatch-based home BP monitors enhance predictive
models for risk stratification in glaucoma, and (3) measure glaucoma medication adherence
using innovative flexible electronic sensors to validate their use for future interventions aimed at
improving adherence and clinical outcomes in glaucoma. These studies would leverage state-
of-the-art methods in big-data predictive modeling as well as cutting-edge advancements in
sensor technologies. This multi-faceted approach will build a foundation for a health IT
framework geared toward improving risk stratification and generating novel therapeutic targets
for glaucoma patients."
10919244,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and its treatment is life-altering; up to 60% of mCRC patients
and a similar percentage of their intimate partners report clinically significant levels of distress.1-5 Effects of
mCRC often lead to unique challenges on both an individual and relationship level,6-14 and an intervention
designed to address these concerns and reduce distress in couples facing mCRC is critically needed.6-8,10-12,28,30
A mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) could fill this gap, given strong evidence for reducing distress in cancer
patients32-34 and partners35 and in improving relationship outcomes.36-38 However, existing MBIs are poorly suited
for couples facing mCRC due to several inadequacies in their content and format. Given significant changes that
would be needed to modify an existing MBI, a new couple-based MBI designed to meet the unique needs of
mCRC couples is warranted. Therefore, the overall objective of the proposed research project is to develop,
refine, and evaluate a four-session, couple-based mindfulness intervention (“MIND-Together”: Mindfully
Navigating Distress Together) delivered via video-conference and designed to promote mindful coping and
reduce distress for mCRC patients and their partners. First, we will generate data on the needs and preferences
of 12 couples facing mCRC (N=24 patients and partners) and 12 clinicians treating mCRC through qualitative
interviews, which will include queries about intervention content (e.g., scope) and structure (e.g., format). Then
we will develop drafts of the intervention protocol, which will be refined and finalized through cognitive interviews
with 6 mCRC couples (N=12 patients and partners) and expert review. Second, we will assess the feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary effects of the intervention through a pilot randomized controlled trial among 45
mCRC couples (N=90 patients and partners), assigned 2:1 to either MIND-Together (n=30 couples) or an
attention-controlled condition (n=15 couples). In an exploratory aim, we will use exit interviews to explore
couples’ experiences of MIND-Together in order to further optimize the intervention content and delivery, and
identify potential mechanisms to assess in future trials. Upon study completion, we will have established whether
the intervention is feasible, acceptable, and preliminarily efficacious in reducing distress in a sample of couples
facing mCRC. Future research will be to evaluate the intervention efficacy and assess mediators in a larger
randomized trial. In addition to the research study, formal training in three content areas will support the PI’s goal
of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in the development, evaluation, and delivery of
interventions among individuals affected by cancer. Training areas include: (1) cancer survivorship issues among
colorectal cancer patients, (2) couple-based approaches for improving psychosocial outcomes in cancer
survivors, and (3) developing and evaluating psychosocial interventions. Overall, the proposed research has the
potential to help address the critical psychosocial needs of couples facing mCRC and to advance the science of
mindfulness and couple-based approaches in cancer care."
10918272,"Clear cell ovarian cancer (ccOC) is a rare and lethal cancer with few treatment options. Based on molecular
analysis ccOC appears intrinsically immunogenic but with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment,
similar to other ovarian cancer types. However, ccOC is very distinct from high grade serous ovarian
carcinoma. Strikingly, it is similar in gene expression profiles to more frequent clear cell renal cell carcinomas
(ccRCC), suggesting that clear cell cancers share intrinsic mechanistic or microenvironment properties, not just
morphological appearance. Around 25% of ccRCC respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but
markers for predicting response are lacking. The objective response rate for monotherapy pembrolizumab in
one study was 33.3% for ccOC patients; but, in general, it is unknown which clear cell cancer patients could
benefit from ICI treatment. Recent work has shown that tumor behavior is driven not just by cellular
composition, but also by the spatial organization of different cell types including immune and stromal cells, as
well as malignant cells themselves. Knowledge of clear cell cancer tumor microenvironments and their spatial
architecture is lacking. Addressing this gap will improve our understanding of mechanisms of response to ICIs
in clear cell cancers, including rare ones like ccOC, and improve selection of patients for immunotherapy.
This study will use systems biology approaches to (i) elucidate and compare the cell types and their
transcriptional states present in ccOC and ccRCC; (ii) characterize the spatial architecture of these cells within
tumors using the CODEX (CODetection by indEXing) single cell proteomic imaging platform; and (iii) model
and validate cell-cell interactions in the spatial tumor microenvironment that drive clear cell cancer response to
immunotherapy through extensions of causal signaling inference algorithms to incorporate spatial context, and
to optimize experimental validations in mouse models that maximize the information gain about interaction
networks. Similar intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental features shared by ccOC and ccRCC, will nominate
common mechanisms of immunotherapy response, and identify the subset of both who might benefit from
treatment with ICIs. Successful development and application of these methods to clear cell cancers will
establish a framework that can be applied to other cancer types, notably to rare ones.
The expected outcome of this proposal is a comprehensive definition and dissection of the tumor
microenvironment of ccRCC and ccOC. It will identify common features and mechanisms between these clear
cell cancers, providing a basis to extend the approach to other classes of cancer, opening new avenues for
treatment, particularly in rare cancer types."
10918273,"7. Project Summary / Abstract
 In all eukaryotes, the largest nuclear body is the nucleolus, a phase-separated, non-membrane bound
organelle specialized for the synthesis of ribosomal RNAs and their assembly into ribosomes. Additionally, the
exterior of the nucleolus is a hub for interactions with multiple specific DNA loci, thereby contributing to the
three-dimensional architecture of the eukaryotic nucleus.
 Nucleolus-genome interactions are intimately connected to processes central to human health. For
example, nucleolar-associated DNA is highly enriched in centromeric repetitive sequences. Centromeres, the
sites of chromosome attachment to mitotic spindles, are fundamentally important for proper chromosome
segregation. Several nucleolar proteins have been implicated in centromere-nucleolar interactions, and several
centromeric proteins prominently reside in nucleoli in interphase cells. We have found that the nucleolar-
centromeric interactions are regulated during cellular differentiation and are greatly increased in cancer cells.
However, the mechanisms that regulated these interactions remain unknown.
 Not only do cancer cells display increased centromere-nucleolar interactions, they also frequently contain a
perinucleolar compartments (PNC), a complex cytological feature that is absent in non-tumor cells. PNCs are
located on the surface of nucleoli and contain multiple RNA species and RNA-binding proteins. We
demonstrate here that these bodies also contain specific DNA loci, some of which encode non-coding RNAs
retained within PNCs. A candidate cancer therapeutic termed metarrestin was isolated based on its ability to
dissociate PNCs; metarrestin is currently in clinical trials based on its ability to reduce metastasis in human
tumor xenograft experiments. Importantly for this proposal, we have observed that metarrestin also perturbs
centromere-nucleolar interactions.
 We also present data that centromere-nucleolus interactions are perturbed in macrophages upon exposure
the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a canonical stimulus for the innate immune system. We also show that
this response is blocked upon inhibition of specific signaling pathways. These changes are accompanied by
altered nuclear distribution of the H3K27me3, a histone modification characteristic of facultative
heterochromatin.
 Altogether, the central theme of this proposal is that the factors that govern centromere-nucleolus
interactions are important for understanding chromosome missegregation, metastasis, and innate immunity.
We plan a series of synergistic experiments to learn more about the underlying mechanisms. For example, we
will test whether the centromeric activity of neocentromeres generates nucleolar associations, or if instead that
is a property of centromeric satellite repeats regardless of activity. We will take candidate and unbiased
approaches to finding centromeric proteins required for nucleolar interactions. We will characterize how
metarrestin affects association of DNA loci with PNCs and nucleoli, and we will define cis-acting loci involved in
PNC association. We will characterize the signaling pathways required for signaling-mediated disruption of
nucleolar-centromeric interactions in macrophages. Results from these studies will allow for subsequent testing
of universality. For example, do signaling components in macrophages also operate in tumor cells when
treated with the therapeutic metarrestin? In this manner, this collaborative proposal will unite questions from
diverse experimental systems to answer questions about the fundamental links between nuclear organization
and human health."
10918275,"Several risk factors are prevalent during early adulthood that can lead to cancer later in life. Emerging adults
(EAs) aged 18-26 residing in rural areas of the United States engage in many cancer risk behaviors, especially
sedentary lifestyles, poor eating patterns, nicotine product use, excess alcohol intake, infrequent sun
protection, and inadequate uptake of the HPV vaccine. This application responds to RFA-CA-20-051, “Social
and Behavioral Intervention Research to Address Modifiable Risk Factors for Cancer in Rural Populations.”
The goal is to improve cancer risk behavioral factors among diverse EAs aged 18-26 living in rural counties in
the Four Corners states, a unique, underserved region, using a social media campaign designed with
community advisors. EAs, including in rural communities, are heavy consumers of online content, especially
over social media, and social media provide responsive, engaging, and low-cost platforms for distributing
cancer prevention information with high dissemination potential. But, social media also circulate inaccurate,
misleading, and harmful information. The specific aims of this research are to: 1) Develop a social media
intervention for diverse EAs in rural communities via a community-engaged process that combines expert
advice, user-generated content, and online instruction to communicate about behavioral cancer risks, cancer
misinformation, counter marketing, digital and media literacy, and family communication; 2) evaluate the
effect of a theory-based social media intervention on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), healthy
eating patterns, nicotine product use, alcohol intake, sunburn prevalence, and HPV vaccination with the
diverse population of EAs aged 18-26 in rural counties in AZ, CO, NM, and UT (Four Corners states) recruited
from Qualtrics' survey panel and enrolled in a pragmatic randomized trial using a stepped-wedge design in
which individual EAs will be randomized to 1 of 4 cohorts and receive the social media feed for varying
durations in separate Facebook private groups; 3) test if improvements in EAs' cancer risk knowledge and
beliefs, digital and media literacy skills, accurate cancer prevention information, and family communication
mediate impact of the social media campaign; and 4) explore whether the impact of the social media campaign
differs according to: a) level of EAs' engagement with campaign, b) cancer risk factors, and c) biological sex of
the participants (as required by NIH). The research is innovative because it tests a theory-based, multi-risk
factor approach to cancer prevention with diverse EAs in rural counties, an under-studied population, in a very
popular new media. Social media may reach EAs more than interventions through other community channels
(e.g., clinics, schools, and workplaces) and for lower cost in the geographically-dispersed, underserved rural
communities in the Mountain West. The overall impact is extremely high because it will aid rural EAs in
making informed decisions that reduce cancer risk factors and prevent cancer later in life and help EAs
critically evaluate and resist misinformation and marketing that promote cancer risk behaviors."

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains brain health by protecting the brain from the bloodstream. These
barrier properties frustrate the treatment of nearly all brain disorders, representing one of the largest
challenges in neuroscience and drug delivery. Yet, intriguingly, recent studies have discovered a variety of
surprising peripheral influences on brain function, hinting at the existence of underappreciated modes of
communication across the BBB. Indeed, while canonical BBB properties, such as paracellular tight junctions
and minimal caveolin-mediated transcytosis, have been established via a handful of standard tracers, it
remains unclear whether these tracers fully represent the BBB’s physiological interactions with and
permeability to the thousands of circulating proteins and cells it is constantly exposed to. By developing
methods to tag and track the blood plasma proteome, I recently observed an unexpected degree and diversity
of protein transport into the healthy adult brain. Thus, I hypothesize that brain health is maintained not just by
BBB impermeability—but by specific routes of blood-to-brain communication actively facilitated by the BBB.
Specifically, I propose that there are three logical routes for how peripheral information is communicated
across the healthy BBB: the direct transport of proteins into the brain; the responsive relay of proteins made by
the BBB into the brain; and the BBB-licensed migration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. By combining
proteome tagging techniques with bioorthogonal chemistries, each proposed aim explores one independent
route to systematically reveal the identities and mechanisms of the signals transmitted via the healthy BBB. I
will begin by creating a first catalog of plasma proteins that directly cross the BBB and quantifying their
permeabilities (Aim 1). I will subsequently characterize a new BBB relay function by deducing the signals the
BBB secretes into the brain in response to peripheral cues (Aim 2). Lastly, I will elucidate neuroimmune
surveillance by determining the BBB sites and molecules enabling healthy immune cell migration into the brain
(Aim 3). Together, these studies will expand our understanding of how the BBB maintains brain health and
enable new studies exploring the neurological functions of BBB-permeable proteins and cells in health, aging,
and disease. Our results will also provide a comprehensive set of functional targets to enhance drug delivery to
the brain, reveal new mechanisms to understand and blunt neuroinflammation, and generate innovative tools
to decipher intercellular communication for broad use across disciplines."
10919186,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a worldwide prevalence of 10-15% and claims over 130,000 lives annually in
the US. Systemic potassium deficiency hastens progression of CKD while higher dietary potassium is protective;
however, the mechanistic link between CKD progression and potassium remains entirely unknown. Coordination
of total body potassium homeostasis involves both the kidneys and skeletal muscle, with inwardly rectifying
potassium (Kir) channels in both organs being critical molecular regulators of this process. I aim to understand
how alterations in plasma potassium determine CKD progression. As multiple cell types are involved in the
progression of CKD, my focus is on potassium-mediated signaling on proximal tubule epithelial cells and renal
macrophages. Using a combination of whole animal kidney physiology, single cell RNA-seq, electrophysiology,
and cell biology, I will determine how Kir channels in muscle, proximal tubule cells, and macrophages mediate
kidney injury and if these pathways can be targeted as a novel approach to slow CKD progression. I propose to
(1) determine how the basolateral potassium channel, Kir4.2, in the proximal tubule mediates kidney injury and
metabolism, (2) determine how Kir2.2 in macrophages affect kidney injury, and (3) determine how Kir2.1 and
Kir2.2 in skeletal muscle affect systemic potassium balance and in turn, kidney injury. Successful completion of
this proposal will change our fundamental understanding of Kir channels as regulators of potassium signaling
and identify Kir4.2, Kir2.1, Kir 2.2, and their related pathways as targets for CKD treatment. Further, it will define
a muscle-kidney axis linked by plasma potassium as the signaling molecule. This project is my first as an
independent investigator and will be supported by significant institutional support from Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. This includes funding, laboratory space, and protected research time to establish my research
program focused on potassium signaling via Kir channels and CKD."
10931437,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
According to Council for Disability Awareness, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,
such as the ligaments, tendons and bone are the #1 cause of disability in the United States. MR imaging has
been increasingly becoming the diagnostic tool of choice for evaluation and management of these diseases
and injuries due to its potential of providing information on not only anatomic structure but also function
noninvasively. However, the capability of MRI in studying human ligaments, tendons and bone is limited by
inadequate sensitivity and slow acquisitions of conventional MR technology. Semi-solid/solid tissues, including
collagen-rich tissues such as calcified ligaments and tendons, as well as periosteum, cortical bone and
trabecular bone, provide very little MR signal with traditional MRI due to their very short transverse (T2)
relaxation time of a few milliseconds or less. In addition, during the long acquisition times, involuntary
movements of human subjects introduce motion artifacts, posing a critical challenge in obtaining high-
resolution images with diagnostic value. Several recently developed technologies have the potential to address
these limitations. Ultrahigh field 7T MRI, parallel imaging, and compressed sensing have demonstrated unique
advantages of high sensitivity and fast acquisitions in vivo. Studies on musculoskeletal imaging using ultra-
short echo time (UTE) and zero echo time (ZTE) methods have shown unparalleled capability to image short
T2 species normally invisible in MRI. However, the implementation of these technologies at ultrahigh fields is
challenging due to design difficulties of the required high frequency multichannel coil arrays, as well as the
problems associated with ultrahigh fields, e.g. increased susceptibility, B1 inhomogeneity, and increased SAR.
In this study, through a synergistic bioengineering research partnership, we propose a comprehensive project
for developing advanced hardware and imaging methods at 7T to enable morphological and functional
characterization of human ligaments, tendons and bone. These developments aim to produce highly sensitive,
isotropic ~100-150um resolution images of semi-solid connective tissues with clinically relevant contrast in 1
minute scan time. Hardware developments will include multichannel coil arrays for knee and extremities using
quadrature and flexible array technology with metamaterial decoupling, as well as application of pyrolytic
graphite materials for reducing susceptibility artifacts. Imaging acquisition developments will be based on
improved UTE/ZTE sequences, and we propose new integrated techniques for improved semi-solid tissue
contrast, motion correction, and acceleration using parallel imaging and compressed sensing. We will also
validate the methods developed and assess the performance and safety/SAR. This research would provide
sensitive imaging tools for morphological and functional characterization of ligaments, tendons and bone,
which are highly demanded and essential for studying semi-solid connective tissues. We expect this research
will have a long-term clinical impact in the management of musculoskeletal system diseases and injuries."
10931439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina,
speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and
large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major
obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus
remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a
poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear
compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease.
However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions,
and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in
throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and
genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide
limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet
these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the
structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools
for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3)
Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear
organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding
of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their
functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more
complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live
and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction
maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be
publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types,
thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related
datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in
human health and disease."

10922587,"The long-term objective of this research program is to develop effective, precision-care models to improve
the functional outcomes of Veterans whose hearing difficulties are not explained by traditional hearing
loss. Determining the cause of these types of auditory processing deficits and selecting effective
rehabilitation options poses a substantial challenge for clinicians. The present proposal aims to address
whether auditory processing is affected by the presence and severity of another condition common
among Veterans and wider the American populace: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The objectives of
this proposal are to a). explore associations between peripheral and central auditory system function and
indices of OSA severity in Veterans with normal hearing sensitivity, and b). to provide data necessary for
the design of a full-scale Merit Award proposal addressing the utility of continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) therapy to improve auditory function. The central hypothesis of the current proposal is
that OSA is associated with measurable auditory processing deficits even when standard audiometric
test results are within normal limits. During the course of the study, the central hypothesis will be tested
in addition to gathering pilot data needed to inform a largescale study of CPAP therapy and auditory
function by pursuing the three specific aims, including 1) Measure the strength of the relationship between
AHI score and objective markers of central and peripheral auditory system function in Veterans with
untreated sleep apnea, 2) Develop a predictive model of auditory functional capacity based upon AHI
scores, and 3) Measure change in auditory function among patients prescribed CPAP therapies as a
function of compliance with clinically recommended CPAP usage. We will identify and recruit Veterans
who have recently been diagnosed with OSA via polysomnography (PSG) conducted at the Portland VA
Medical Center (n = 45), as well as a group of healthy control Veterans of similar age (n = 10). Recruited
patients will have a range of OSA severity based upon Apnea-Hypoxia Index (AHI) including mild,
moderate and severe. Exclusionary factors include cardiovascular & cerebrovascular disease, diabetes,
age greater than 55 years, and clinical hearing loss. All participants will complete a rigorous audiometric
test battery including behavioral measures of auditory processing, physiological measures of cochlear,
brainstem, and cortical responses to sound, and self-report measures of hearing handicap and function.
The strength of relationships between these auditory functions and measures obtained via PSG will then
be examines, including the AHI, oxygen desaturation index, hypercapnia load, and snoring amplitude.
This data will be used to develop a model predicting auditory function based upon AHI score. Finally,
OSA patient participants will repeat all auditory testing following two months of CPAP therapy. Changes
in auditory capacity will then be assessed as a function of compliance with CPAP usage. This information
will provide pilot data regarding the influence of CPAP therapy on auditory function and will allow us to
gather data necessary for the planning and implementation of a future clinical trial including recruitment,
retention, screen failures, and compliance with recommended therapy. This work will advance clinical
care for Veterans with hearing difficulties unrelated to hearing loss by identifying a potential contributing
source underlying dysfunction leading to improved diagnostic test batteries and counseling. In addition,
this work will lay the foundation for performing a subsequent study aimed at determining whether CPAP
therapy can improve auditory function and possibly even prevent or mitigate development of permanent
hearing loss and tinnitus associated with longstanding OSA."
10923287,"Project Summary
Developing an effective HIV vaccine to curb HIV infections is a global urgency. Env is the sole target for broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), and is the focus of vaccination strategies. One barrier to a protective HIV
vaccine is the dense array of glycans that covers the surface of the Env spike restricting the immunogenicity of
Env proteins. There are ~90 individual glycan sites per trimer and each site can be decorated with high-mannose,
hybrid or complex-type glycans. These glycans are crucial for various Env functions including its conformation,
antigenicity, immunogenicity and the ability of HIV to evade humoral responses. The presence/absence and type
of glycans on Env-based vaccine candidates can influence both antigenicity and immunogenicity of the protein.
Most bNAbs include Env glycans as part of their binding epitope, making the glycosylation of Env a key aspect
of HIV-1 vaccine design. These bNAbs has been isolated from chronically HIV-1 infected individuals but induction
of such bNAbs by vaccination has not been successful yet. Thus, Env immunogens that display glycan and
antigenic profile matching those present on the virus may have a better prospect at inducing a cross-neutralizing
Ab response. However, a clear understanding of what comprise the site-specific glycan make-up of virus-
associated Env is missing, particularly for clinically relevant isolates being pursued for human vaccine trials. The
mechanisms/factors that regulate the Env glycan pattern and composition are not understood. This information
is critical for improving Env as immunogens and for understanding the optimal epitopes of glycan-dependent
bNAbs. The proposed study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating Env biogenesis and glycosylation
that starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment of the host cells and continues to be modified in Golgi.
A better understanding of the processes that are involved in the ER and Golgi will provide us with the tools that
can be used to generate Env immunogens with native antigenic and glycosylation profiles. The overarching goal
of the proposed study is to 1) characterize the site-specific glycosylation of native Env on virus, 2) investigate
the processes in the ER and Golgi that regulate and imprint the type of glycans on HIV Env, 3) identify ways to
express Env with glycans that match virus-associated Env, 4) characterize how native glycans impact the
structural and conformational flexibility of Env, and, 5) evaluate the immunogenicity of these Env in animal
models for their capacity to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies. This study will take advantage of several
innovative technologies such as LC-MS/MS, HDX-MS along with the complementary expertise of the investigator
team to accomplish the goals. Successful completion of the study will reveal several new and unknown aspects
of protein synthesis and mechanisms that can be applied towards the development of improved Env
immunogens for HIV vaccines."
10922516,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are genetically and morphologically diverse hematopoietic neoplasms that
arise from a small pool of mutant clones within hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments [1-9]. MDS is
a pre-leukemic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Only four drugs have received regulatory approval
for MDS, with the two hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine (iv and oral with cedazuridine)
each with suboptimal response rates (~15-20% for CR+PR) and of limited durability, typically 1-2 years [10].
Once these agents fail, there is no second-line treatment. Prognosis after failure is dismal, with median survival
at <6 months for higher-risk patients, and <18 months for lower-risk patients [11]. That MDS is frequently
characterized by relapse or failure to achieve durable remission, indicates that current treatments do not
adequately eradicate the disease-initiating stem cells. Clearly there is a significant unmet need for a new MDS
treatment in the frontline and HMA-relapsed/refractory (HMA-RR) settings that eradicates leukemic stem cells
and normalizes cytopenias. Chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (CXCR1/2) and its ligands (CXCL 1, 2,
3, 5, 7 and CXCL8) are elevated in the bone marrow and plasma of patients with AML and MDS where they
drive mutant stem cell growth and correlate with reduced survival [12-16], transfusion dependence [17] and HMA
resistance [14]. CXCR1/2 on MDSCs are pivotal in their recruitment to the bone marrow where they kill
hematopoietic progenitors and impair anti-leukemic immune surveillance [18-20]. Dual CXCR1/2 blockade is
therefore a preclinically validated multi-prong strategy to attack (1) mutant stem cells, (2) the immunosuppressive
marrow microenvironment and (3) hematopoiesis-killing MDSCs, and (4) are implicated in de novo and acquired
HMA-resistance. SX-682 is a clinical-stage, small-molecule CXCR1/2 inhibitor that is in multiple trials in which
it exhibits activity in metastatic melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and as a single-agent in HMA-
RR MDS (NCT04245397), where it arrests unrestrained outgrowth of stem and progenitor compartments and
alters the mutant stem and progenitor architecture and inflammatory niche. The specific aims of this proposal
encompass adding additional cohorts to our ongoing MDS trial that will test SX-682 alone and together with oral
or intravenous decitabine in the frontline and HMA-RR settings and the preparation of SX-682 study drug to
support clinical evaluation. Our hypothesis is that de novo or acquired resistance to HMA involves the CXCR1/2
axis, and that adding SX-682 to decitabine will provide efficacy better than either agent alone. The primary
objective is to show preliminary clinical evidence of improved outcomes in patients treated with SX-682 and
decitabine compared to historical data for either agent alone. If successful, SX-682 added to decitabine would
transform the MDS treatment landscape."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue affecting ~700 million worldwide, including 15% in
the US. The most common form is diabetic kidney disease (DKD), affecting 40% of diabetics and occurring 3.5
times more frequently among diabetics than non-diabetics. Clinical symptoms include progressive albuminuria,
decline in glomerular filtration rate and glomerular hyperfiltration and sclerosis, hypertrophy, podocyte injury and
depletion on a cellular level, eventually culminating in end stage kidney disease (ESKD).
In diabetic patients, CB1 receptor is upregulated in glomerular podocytes and involved in development of renal
fibrosis. Thus, blocking the CB1 receptor represents a viable strategy in combatting DKD. We have demonstrated
that our peripherally acting CB1 neutral antagonist, AM6545, has a positive effect on metabolic and renal
function, improving hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver, and mitigating development of metabolic
syndrome. In rodent diabetes models, AM6545 slowed albuminuria, nephrin loss, inflammation, and fibrosis. The
combination of AM6545 with perindopril (ACE inhibitor) or AM1241 (CB2 agonist) was even shown to reverse
clinical markers of DKD. Further modifications on AM6545 led to the discovery of AM6588 with improved affinity
for CB1 (Ki = 0.9 nM), excellent metabolic stability profile in human microsome and hepatocytes (t1/2 > 60 min).
However, its aqueous solubility (28 µg/mL) and bioavailability (F ~ 2%) were still suboptimal.
Hence, this proposal aims to develop novel peripherally acting CB1 neutral antagonists, based on AM6588, with
improved pharmacokinetic parameters. In Phase I, Aim 1, we will design and synthesize analogs which possess
the aromatic alkynyl heterocycle core, aiming to increase potency and CB1 selectivity, enhance oral
bioavailability, metabolic stability, and reduce brain permeability. Analogs will be evaluated for their ADME
profiles. In Aim 2, one advanced lead will be selected and tested for its efficacy in the ZSF-1 diabetic rat model,
a validated and robust model for DKD. In Phase II, Aim 3, the advanced lead will undergo a series of IND-
enabling studies (CMC development and formulation) to prepare for IND filing. An additional diabetes animal
model (db/db AAV-renin uni-nephrectomized model) will be used to validate the efficacy of lead. In Aim 4, further
IND preparation will be completed by partnering with experienced regulatory and business consultants.
Completion of this project will result in one advanced lead candidate ready for further IND enabling studies and
eventual development of a novel therapeutic mode for DKD."

Background: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV incidence in
the U.S. Though pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use is increasing among YMSM, dropout from care is high,
and YMSM are more likely than older MSM to contract HIV after discontinuing PrEP. CDC recommends
motivational interviewing (MI) and personalized health education as part of PrEP care, and these evidence-
based practices are promising for increasing retention in care. Providers lack sufficient time to implement them.
Implementation research is needed to investigate how to facilitate their delivery in diverse clinic settings.
Present Study: The proposed mentored patient-oriented career development award (K23) project will use
implementation science methods to deliver and evaluate an enhanced care intervention, HIV Prevention Plus
Care (HP+ Care), for YMSM starting PrEP in two clinics. HP+ Care will include MI and personalized health
education to promote retention in care and use of PrEP and other prevention methods. Specific aims are: (1)
using the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework,
investigate factors influencing implementation of HP+ care for YMSM in the constructs of the recipients (staff),
their context (clinics), and the innovation (MI and personalized health education); (2) using Aim 1 data, identify
appropriate Expert Recommendations in Implementing Change (ERIC) implementation strategies to facilitate
delivery of HP+ Care in two clinics; and (3) conduct a trial of HP+ Care in two clinics to assess feasibility,
acceptability, and appropriateness.
Candidate: Andrew Barnett, Ph.D., is a clinical psychology postdoctoral fellow at the Alpert Medical School of
Brown University whose research focuses on addressing health disparities, including HIV, among sexual and
gender minority adolescents and young adults.
Mentoring: The primary mentor, Dr. Larry Brown, is an expert in implementing evidence-based practices to
prevent HIV and enhance HIV care, and three co-mentors have complementary expertise in rigorous
quantitative analysis methods (Dr. Barker); HIV prevention and PrEP engagement in clinic settings (Dr. Chan);
and applying implementation science methods to improve delivery of evidence-based practices in healthcare
(Dr. Elwy). The mentors also each have extensive experience guiding early career researchers.
Training: Training activities will advance the following goals: (1) gain experience in conducting implementation
science investigations to prevent HIV in healthcare settings; (2) expand knowledge of novel biomedical HIV
prevention approaches, including PrEP on-demand, long-acting injectable PrEP, and other modalities currently
under development; (3) gain expertise in methods for quantitative analysis of clustered data, including
hierarchical linear modeling; and (4) advance professional development, research ethics, and grants
management skills. Training will prepare the candidate to conduct NIH-funded independent investigations."
10918086,"Research has shown that African Americans are less likely than other racial groups to engage in genetic
testing for hereditary cancer syndromes, which can uncover genetic mutations that increase cancer risk.
African Americans also have lower rates of cancer cascade testing, a process for providing genetic counseling

mutations. As clinical genetic testing becoming increasingly available, it is critically important to design
interventions to reach all populations, especially those that have been traditionally underserved. Tailored
strategies are particularly useful for increasing intervention access and uptake where health disparities exist.
This career development award provides Dr. Ellis the opportunity to develop and test a family-tailored

behavior and education) and social work (interpersonal practice with individuals and families), and postdoctoral
training in cancer health disparities, puts her in a unique position to develop interventions that attend to both
the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of cancer genetic testing for African American families. The career
development goals and mentoring plan include courses and workshops; guided mentoring, including directed
readings with mentors; experiential learning, including shadowing in a cancer genetics clinic and intervention
development, testing, and evaluation; tailored health messaging development; attendance and participation at
professional conferences; and, manuscript and grant writing and submissions. These activities support the

to African American family communication about genetic testing and cascade testing through eight focus
groups; (2) Develop a tailored, eHealth intervention for African American families that encourages uptake of
recommended cascade genetic testing by improving communication about genetic testing results and targeting
drivers of and barriers to behavior change (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, skills for communication and testing); (3)
Conduct a pilot test of the intervention with 30 families to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability and
engagement and explore its potential impact on cascade testing. Dr. Ellis’ mentoring team has expertise in
each of her key developmental areas. At the completion of this K01 award, Dr. Ellis will have the expertise to
become an independent investigator who conducts family-based intervention research to improve cancer
outcomes with African American families with increased cancer risk."
10918094,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in neonates, infants and
children with diverse heart, lung and systemic diseases. A major barrier to improving outcomes of children with
PVD is the fundamental lack of understanding the differing pathobiologies among the spectrum of these
disorders, which intersect between multiple clinical disciplines. This is compounded by the scarcity of training
opportunities to develop and retain physician-scientists and scientists with expertise in PVD that allows for the
successful translation of laboratory and clinical science across multiple disciplines. Thus, there is a need for
well-trained scientists in Pediatric PVD who can perform collaborative and rigorous inter-disciplinary investigation
to enhance the development of new treatment modalities. This novel application requests the resources to
establish a unique two-year post-doctoral collaborative research training program in Pediatric PVD within the
Departments of Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, the University of Colorado, and
Vanderbilt University. The goal of the program is to increase the number of highly trained, successfully funded
and sustainable pediatric pulmonary vascular scientists, who will perform high level laboratory, clinical-
translational, and/or health services research that will ultimately improve our understanding of the pathobiology of
diverse pediatric PVD, design therapeutic plans that specifically target an individual’s underlying pathobiology,
and thereby improve both short and long-term outcomes. To this end, this program aims to provide comprehensive
scientific training through novel mentoring and collaborative approaches to enhance career development for
physicians or post-doctorate scientists with an M.D., M.D./Ph.D. or Ph.D., who commit themselves to an
academic career in pediatric PVD. The key and unique elements of this training program are: (1) a rich, diverse,
mentored research experience; (2) interdisciplinary and inter-institutional experiences, including joint didactic
learning opportunities, with direct integration into the North American Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network
and the associated Annual International Conference; and (3) continuous review and evaluation from academic
leaders in the field. The centerpiece of the program for pediatric-scientists is the continuation of a 4-year fellowship
training program (including but not limited to Pediatric Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine,
Neonatology, or Pulmonology), with 2 years devoted to intense research training in basic laboratory science,
clinical-translational science, health services or epidemiology related to pediatric PVD. Exceptional faculty have
committed their support as mentors, who lead and are affiliated with several of their universities’ research units
and clinical programs, a represent a “critical mass” that few single centers can provide. Thus, the rationale for this
novel proposal is based on the need for well-designed training programs in Pediatric PVD research, including
the need to foster multi-disciplinary and multi-interdisciplinary collaborative approaches, and that these three
institutions have the vision, experience, and collaborative infrastructure to train the next generation of leaders."

RNA-binding proteins are essential components of numerous large complexes that carry out fundamental
processes including transcription, splicing, and DNA repair. Many RNA-binding proteins possess regions
predicted to be disordered based on low-complexity sequence characteristics that are critical to normal RNA-
processing functions, but also drive aberrant protein assembly in various neurodegenerative disease and
cancers. The molecular interactions and functional roles of these disordered domains remain incompletely
characterized, especially in the context of disease. Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) is one of twenty-nine human
RNA-binding proteins that contains both an essential disordered low-complexity domain (LC) with unusually
low charged residue composition and a high frequency of aromatic amino acids as well as several RGG motif
regions. Despite disorder, these domains are thought to facilitate interactions in normal RNA metabolism by
forming dynamic associations, thereby enabling tunable, reversible spatial clustering. Yet, excessive self-
association between FUS disordered domains is believed to result in the formation of pathological neuronal
inclusions in sub-types of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), irreversible
neurodegenerative diseases that lack effective treatments. Moreover, fusion of the FUS disordered domains to
several DNA-binding domains through chromosomal translocations results in uncontrolled gene expression
leading to a family of aggressive cancers. Though FUS has emerged as the primary model system for
understanding biological phase separation, the contacts holding together FUS assemblies and their structures
in physiology and disease are currently unknown because they are invisible to traditional techniques in
structural biology. However, we have demonstrated that we can visualize dynamic assemblies of FUS with
residue-level resolution. This project will apply advanced nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular
simulation, and cell models of FUS function to 1) visualize the molecular contacts that mediate LLPS and in-
cell interactions, 2) probe the molecular and cellular impact of LC and RGG mutations of FUS found in familial
ALS, and 3) determine the functionally relevant atomic details of FUS complexes with RNA and the C-terminal
domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II associated with RNA processing and transcription. These studies of FUS
assembly will provide necessary structure/function information on future pharmacological targets for inhibiting
pathological protein associations in types of ALS, FTD, leukemia, and sarcoma. Furthermore, because FUS is
only one of many essential RNA-binding proteins containing aggregation-prone low complexity domains, the
results of the project will serve as a foundation for understanding an entire class of proteins and for correcting
their dysfunctions in disease."

 Eswatini was among the first countries to achieve the UNAIDS 95, 95, 95 targets resulting in substantial
declines in HIV incidence and TB prevalence. Despite this achievement adolescent girls still have a 1.5% annual
incidence of HIV infection and the case detection gap for children with TB is estimated to be well over 60%.
 This highlights the need for new strategies that complement current approaches to HIV and TB prevention
and detection. This study will explore HIV and TB wastewater surveillance as a strategy to reignite the drive
toward elimination. These pathogens are well suited to wastewater surveillance due to long infectious periods
during which patients are asymptomatic and unlikely to present to health facilities for testing. Wastewater
measures of TB and HIV from specific sampling areas will ultimately help target public health community case
detection interventions. In the first phase of this project, we will establish the pipeline for wastewater surveillance
of HIV and TB in Eswatini, building off our experience at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The second
phase will validate and quantify detection of HIV and TB from multiple sites, establishing variability, a range of
quantification, and correlation between the HIV and TB levels detected in wastewater with hospital epidemiology,
public health reporting data, and HIV recency testing data. The third phase will establish whether proven public
health interventions to increase case detection and treatment initiation for people with TB and HIV will result in
reductions in HIV and TB in wastewater samples from those same communities. If successful, this approach has
the potential to be a game changing, cost-effective and highly innovative tool in the fight against HIV and TB.
 The candidate is ideally suited to lead this grant, having a background of proven success in pioneering
wet-bench virology and immunology as well as seven years of experience leading epidemiologic and clinical
research in Eswatini. This project merges these two areas of experience, and success will require the ability to
introduce and adapt wastewater sampling to new pathogens with an in-depth understanding of HIV and TB
transmission, epidemiology, and prevention strategies. The team assembled for this project is further evidence
of the candidate's ability to assemble strong collaborative teams, drawing together partners from numerous
health and environmental programs in Eswatini and colleagues at Baylor College of Medicine.
 The data generated from this project has the potential to add precision to HIV and TB prevention and
case detection strategies and create a platform for wastewater surveillance of other emerging pathogens in
Eswatini. Early pathogen detection systems in low-resource environments will ultimately improve health security
globally. This strategy, candidate and partners are perfectly positioned to catalyze the elimination of TB and HIV
transmission in Eswatini and set the stage for improved wastewater surveillance systems throughout sub-
Saharan Africa."

 This proposal seeks external funding for a recently launched internship program for Native Hawaiian and
Pacific Islander (NHPI) undergraduate students interested in a biomedical career related to improving kidney
health. Our program, named the Haumana 'O Pasifika program by our inaugural class of 8 Haumana (Hawaiian
for ""student"") Scholars, aims to help outstanding NHPI undergraduates achieve their goals of becoming the
next generation of nurses, physician assistants, physicians, and scientists by provide research experience,
clinical exposure, career development, and community outreach over the course of a 12-week summer program.
NHPI face significant health disparities. These include chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, obesity, infant
mortality, Alzheimer's Disease, and renal cancer. The lack of NHPI representation in health professions
contributes, in part, to health disparities observed in these communities. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is
the most illustrative example of a health disparity in NHPI communities. As compared to Americans who
identify as White, the incidence rates of ESRD are 3-fold higher in African Americans and 8.4-fold higher for
Pacific Islanders. Diabetes is the most common cause of ESRD in NHPI, with incident rates nearly double
those of African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, populations that are widely known to be at elevated
risk for diabetes. Eliminating diabetes and kidney health disparities among NHPI are established goals of the
NHPI community. Our community leaders have defined a significant need to increase NHPI representation in
the biomedical workforce as a critical step in eliminating such health disparities. Indeed, while 1.9% of Utahns
are NHPI, only 3 of our >1,400 board-certified physicians at the University of Utah (U of U) self-identify as
NHPI.
 With overwhelming support from U of U administration, colleagues, and community leaders, we created
and implemented the Haumana 'O Pasifika Program, a 12-week summer research internship which provides: i)
hands-on research experience (basic, clinical, and translational) with established scientists; ii) professional and
career development; iii) clinical shadowing; iv) cultural mentoring; and v) community outreach. With NIH
support, we aim to continue annual research experiences and educational training in kidney disease (with an
emphasis on diabetes-related kidney disease) through the Haumana ‘O Pasifika Program. We will: 1) Execute
a summer research internship centered on kidney health for NHPI undergraduates that includes
comprehensive and life-long academic, career, and educational support through mentored research and the
development of a strong, supportive cohort experience; 2) Engage Haumana 'O Pasifika Scholars in outreach
with Utah's vibrant NHPI community; and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the Haumana 'O Pasifika Program
on increasing NHPI representation in STEM careers and the nephrology-related biomedical workforce."

 Conventional models of Parkinson’s disease (PD) dysfunction do not account for sensory feedback, which is
both clearly represented in the basal ganglia and clearly impaired in PD. Despite the critical importance of this
feedback to normal movement, the contribution of impaired sensory processing to PD pathophysiology is
unknown. Our long-term goal is to clarify the role of sensory feedback in the production of pathological motor
commands in PD. This research could help reveal the neural basis of both PD pathology and its treatment,
leading to more efficient clinical practices, driving the development of novel therapeutic technologies, and helping
to alleviate the enormous burdens of PD on patients and providers.
 In healthy people, the motor system will automatically ignore sensory feedback that is not directly relevant to
the current behavioral goal. In this proposal, we seek to determine whether the basal ganglia participate in this
goal-directed sensory filtering, and whether this process is impaired in PD. This phenomenon could potentially
provide a framework to explain PD motor symptoms with a single underlying cause: normal sensory feedback is
not filtered appropriately, which reduces the ability of the motor system to produce normal commands.
Underdamped sensory feedback could produce excessive transcortical reflexes in rigidity, corrupt the brain’s
internal models and interfere with movement planning in bradykinesia, and even produce tremor via stochastic
resonance (a phenomenon common in nonlinear neural systems in which a sub-threshold oscillation is amplified
by noise).
 Whether or not our specific hypotheses are supported, the experimental paradigms of this study will
generate unparalleled data and insights into sensorimotor integration in the human brain. If our hypotheses are
correct, however, we will further provide a framework for an unprecedented mechanistic model of PD symptom
generation and a roadmap towards improved treatment."

Substance abuse is rising due to multiple factors, with over 20 million adults seeking treatment for substance
use disorders (SUD) every year. Increasing rates of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety during COVID-
19 coupled with reduced access to mental health care have culminated in a critical need for evidence-based,
telehealth interventions to support families and reduce digital inequities in treatment delivery for populations at
high risk. Research suggests a developmental pathway to SUD that includes problem behavior in early
childhood and disrupted family relationships that lead to deficits in self-regulation and risk behavior during
adolescence and adulthood. This pathway to SUD’s can be disrupted through effective prevention. In response
to this critical need, we have developed the Family Check-Up Online (FCU Online), a digital, web-based
application designed to support parents and children in the development of parenting skills and reduction of
stress and other risk factors associated with a range of long-term outcomes, including substance abuse.
In the proposed application, we will develop and test an asynchronous, online training program for health care
providers that will lead to large-scale dissemination of the FCU Online model in community settings. We will
develop the product with a series of interviews that will guide the development and content of the training
modules. We will then test the training program with 20 providers who will give feedback on the feasilbity and
acceptability of the training model in real-world settings. Our team includes experts in implementation and
dissemination, evidence-based interventions for at-risk families, business development and marketing, and
product development. Letters of support from primary care and community health providers demonstrate our
strong partnerships that will facilitate this research. The study will significantly contribute to our understanding
of mobile ehealth interventions for families and children at risk of SUD to reduce digital inequities and barriers
to delivery of evidence-based interventions in community settings."

training, career-development resources, and ongoing mentorship will be provided to increase the number of UR
students involved in health disparities research related to diabetes, obesity, and kidney disease."
10908049,"Project Summary
Primary characteristics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include persistent fears and excessive
maladaptive avoidance behaviors. Preclinical models of PTSD have heavily investigated the brain
mechanisms of fear inhibition and active avoidance learning. Significant progress has been made in
translating fear conditioning and extinction data into the human brain and their implications have helped
further our understanding of PTSD psychopathology. The mechanisms of active avoidance, however, have
scarcely been examined in the human brain, especially within the context of maladaptive responses as in
the case of PTSD. The studies proposed in this application are designed to begin to fill this scientific gap.
We will use a novel conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP) to examine the neural
correlates of active avoidance and fear extinction learning and explore how extinction modulates
active avoidance responses in participants with and without a PTSD diagnosis using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). PTSD psychopathology involves dysfunctional limbic-frontal activity
including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus (HPC), and amygdala. Studies of
avoidance in rodents and a few fMRI studies in healthy humans suggest that the vmPFC and striatum
mediate threat response by toggling the expression of fear vs. avoidance responses. Participants (healthy
controls with trauma exposure, and patients diagnosed with PTSD) will undergo the novel (validated) two-
day CAAP. On day 1, participants will undergo Pavlovian fear conditioning, immediately followed by an active
avoidance conditioning phase. Avoidance is achieved by pressing a button to prevent a shock from occurring
but will not terminate the conditioned stimulus (CS). Pavlovian fear extinction learning (button removed; no
avoidance possible) will follow. On day 2, recall of extinction learning will be tested. Before the start of the
recall test, participants will receive a small monetary endowment and will be told that this money could be
used to pay for shock avoidance during the recall test. The first aim is to Identify neural correlates of active
avoidance. The second aim is to study activations after the CS+ terminates that index the relief from the
avoided shock. The third aim is to examine neural correlates of extinction-to-avoidance transfer. The
proposed studies are expected to provide a more integrated mechanistic understanding of the
psychopathology of PTSD and reduce the gap between the rodent literature and human neuroimaging in
avoidance research."

Neuromodulation is becoming the new frontier in psychiatry. Our recent advances in the understanding of
neural circuits involved in fear and its regulation provide us with a well-defined targets and circuits to manipulate
to restore normal functioning. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a great tool to non-invasively
manipulate such circuits. Despite some great clinical success in TMS and its application to psychiatric
conditions, the mechanisms of how TMS impacts fear circuits are not understood and its parameters currently
employed are not fully optimized. Our objectives are to 1) understand how varying TMS parameters affect
targeted brain regions in order to 2) optimize its impact on enhancing fear extinction memory consolidation in
a population with known fear extinction deficiencies: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As with all
manipulations, not all participants will respond to TMS and fear reduction induced by TMS will vary across
subjects. An exploratory objective is to develop mathematical models for predicting who will respond to TMS
based on the magnitude of conditioned and unconditioned fear along with clinical and anxiety measures.
Subjects will undergo our well-established fear conditioning and extinction paradigm across 3 days. On day 1,
they will be aversively conditioned to two cues. On day 2, subjects will undergo extinction training where
conditioned cues will be paired with TMS in a temporally and anatomically specific manner. On day 3,
conditioned cues will be presented in the fMRI scanner. The network to be investigated is the fear extinction
circuit: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), hippocampus, and
amygdala. Skin conductance response (SCR) will also be measured. We will explore the impact of narrow
TMS timing variance (relative to onset of conditioned fear stimuli) and anatomical location on fear extinction
memory on the activation of fear extinction network. Our target will be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
that is functionally coupled with the vmPFC. Using the principles of response surface methodology (RSM), we
will characterize and establish the effect of temporal and anatomical variations of TMS relative to the
conditioned cue on conditioned fear reduction (aim 1). We will then use the optimized TMS parameters to test
if TMS can restore extinction memory deficit in subjects with PTSD (aim 2). An exploratory aim will be to
develop mathematical models to predict TMS success in obtaining the best outcome on extinction memory
based on SCR and clinical data. Our findings would provide key translational data applying knowledge
gathered from rodents into the human brain and could help us understand the mechanisms of neuromodulation
regarding change in the neural correlates of fear extinction network in PTSD patients."
10910152,"Abstract/Summary
Post-menopausal bone loss has been an unresolved clinical problem since the Women’s Health Initiative
showed the risks of hormone replacement therapy. To address this issue, a clinical trial using beta blockers
(BBs) to improve bone health has recently been funded entitled, “Beta1-selective blockade for prevention of
postmenopausal bone loss: A randomized controlled trial” (R01 AG065154-A1). While this trial will evaluate the
efficacy and safety of BBs for this indication, questions will remain about the mechanism and optimal use of
this prevention strategy. Heterogeneity of BB effects on bone outcomes have been observed and may be due
to pharmacogenetics, as we have discovered and validated pharmacogenetic variants in ADRB1 and HDAC4.
Furthermore, the mechanisms of treatment effect remain controversial. Although previous mouse studies
showed that the beneficial bone effects of BBs were due to competitive binding to B2-adrenergic receptors
(B2-ARs) on osteoblasts, many human studies have found B1-selective blockers to be associated with better
bone outcomes. In addition, we have discovered that miR-19a-3p, which we hypothesize to target B1-AR
(ADRB1), is associated with BB use and higher bone mineral density (BMD). We also show a
pharmacogenetic association in an ADRB1 variant, which is positively associated with miR-19a-3p expression.
In mouse studies, we have shown a novel direct effect of BB treatment on osteoclasts that is not mediated by
osteoblast signaling. In summary, our preliminary pharmacogenetic and microRNA results underscore the
importance of B1-AR in addition to B2-AR signaling for BB bone effects, and our mouse studies show evidence
of direct effects of BB treatment on osteoclasts in addition to indirect effects via osteoblasts. Our central
hypothesis is that genetic and microRNA (miRNA) variables associated with treatment response contribute to
modulation of B1-AR and B2-AR signaling pathways in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We will test this
hypothesis via the following specific aims: 1) Measure the effect of in vivo atenolol treatment on differentiation
in participant-derived osteoclasts, discover and validate pharmacogenetic variants of atenolol treatment
response, and characterize their functional effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. 2) Use miRNA-seq to
identify circulating miRNAs associated with treatment response, and discover targets and validate mechanisms
in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We propose to rigorously perform these aims using participant-derived samples
from the previously mentioned trial. This proposal will allow us to characterize the mechanisms of BB treatment
effect on bone in post-menopausal women and to create personalized treatment models."
10910187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many species, including mice, use ballistic reorienting movements called saccades to actively explore their
environment for salient stimuli. Saccades result in a transient modification of visual perception such that it
becomes difficult to see visual stimuli which appear around the time of saccades. This phenomenon is called
saccadic suppression and it is associated with a decrease in neural activity across the visual system. Converging
lines of evidence show that this neural correlate of saccadic suppression arises from a combination of visual and
premotor mechanisms. Several studies have shown that the simulating the self-generated motion associated
with saccades is sufficient to reduce visual sensitivity in the retina and reproduces the perceptual deficits
associated with actual saccades. Complementary studies have hypothesized that the saccade motor plan is
broadcast to the visual system where it is used to suppress visual activity during the peri-saccadic epoch. This
is supported by studies which demonstrate the persistence of saccadic suppression under conditions which
minimize or preclude the effect of visual mechanisms. In this proposal, we seek to understand how the visual
and premotor components of saccadic suppression are implemented by neural circuits. We will focus our
investigation on the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), a visuomotor brain structure which has long been
suspected as the source of a corollary discharge that suppresses visual activity around the time of saccades.
We would like to add to this idea that the visual output of the retina is itself modulated by saccades. We
hypothesize that a corollary discharge of premotor activity in the SC and the peri-saccadic modulation
of retinal signals cooperate to produce suppression of visual activity in the superficial layers of the SC
around the time of saccades. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will dissect the premotor circuitry in the SC using
optogenetics, chemogenetics, and high-density in vivo recordings of single-unit activity while mice make
saccades. In Aim 2 of this proposal, we will examine SC-projecting retinal ganglion cells for peri-saccadic
modulation using two-photon calcium imaging and naturalistic visual stimulation. Public health significance. This
proposal aims to understand how saccadic suppression is implemented by dissecting the visual and premotor
circuitry in the midbrain SC. This research will advance our understanding of the neural basis for stable and
continuous visual perception across saccades which is critical for the conduct of normal visual behavior. In
addition, this research could lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of injury and diseases which
affect the oculomotor system."

The principal objective of this second cycle of Hawaii IDeA Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Trials2
(HIPACT2) is to capitalize on the success of the first fouryears of HIPACT as a productive and engaged
Environmental Influences of Child Health Outcomes IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ECHO
ISPCTN) site. The first four years of HIPACT launched ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials, engaged new junior
investigators in ECHO ISPCTN endeavors and built pediatric clinical trials capacity at HIPACT's partner
institutions. As a relatively small ECHO ISPCTN site with a historical paucity of pediatric involvement in clinical
trials, HIPACT successfully inspired and engaged new junior faculty across the spectrum of professional
development activities. The initial success of HIPACT spirited the momentum for academic and community
efforts to participate fully in the planning of HIPACT2 including newly committed partners. We have established
a mechanism to participate in HIPACT2 by engaging pediatric and maternal-fetal medicine faculty through the
Hawaii Pediatric Research (HIPR) Scholars Program. Moreover, we will endeavor to feed into the pipeline of
ECHO ISPCTN activities with the goal of increasing the number of junior faculty involved in HIPACT2. With the
overarching goal to improve the health and wellbeing of the diverse multiethnicpopulations in rural and
underserved areas of Hawaii including indigenous Hawaiian communities, and immigrant populations of Pacific
Islanders and Asians, HIPACT2will capitalize on established HIPACT partnerships with Hawaii Pacific Health
(HPH) Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children (KMCWC), and Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health
Center (WCCHC). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: To actively contribute to and participate in
ECHO ISPCTN pediatric clinical trials; Aim 2: To provide access to clinical trials to benefit rural and underserved
infants, children, and adolescents, many of who are Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Asians; Aim 3: To
participate in the “science” of ECHO ISPCTN multicenter clinical trials research; Aim 4: To mentor a cadre of
junior faculty via the Hawaii Pediatric Research (HIPR) Scholars Program. Taken together, HIPACT2 will act as
an eager partner in ECHO ISPCTN in this second five-year cycle of funding with a strong historical track record
of engagement and achievement, institutional support, and newly committed partners. It will enrich opportunities
for faculty research training and education, participation in collaborative multicenter clinical trial research, and
engage rural and underserved communities to improve health outcomes in Hawaii and across the nation."

This innovative T32 proposal addresses a critical need to train emerging postdoctoral scientists to become
leaders in cardiometabolic science. At the intersection between cardiovascular disease and metabolic
disorders lies excess morbidity and mortality, best addressed by successful scientists and research integrated
in these areas. Our proposal addresses 3 aspects of the training need: First, these scientists require training
from both cardiovascular and metabolic researchers. Second, training must occur in an environment where
relevant interdisciplinary collaborations among successful mentors are already underway. Third, the
advancement of women scientists must be actively pursued by both men and women to maximize the talent
pool. Drs. Hsueh and Raman, internationally-recognized, established investigators in diabetes/metabolism and
cardiovascular medicine, have brought together a team of NIH-funded cardiovascular and metabolic
researchers at the Ohio State University (OSU), with a dual mentorship training design that gives trainees
essential cross-disciplinary scientific and professional guidance. OSU’s environment for cardiometabolic
training is unparalleled, with faculty in the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute and the Diabetes and
Metabolism Research Center (Hsueh, Director) engaged in NHLBI-funded research across basic, translational,
and clinical disciplines. To advance women in cardiometabolic science, this T32 leverages a number of
programs across OSU including a predoctoral T32 program for diversity in cardiovascular science led by co-
investigator Dr. Rafael-Fortney. Faculty mentors have been chosen specifically both for their productive track
records and for research publication productivity and NIH award success of their trainees. We will enroll 2 new
postdoctoral trainees per year for 2 years’ training, with a 3rd slot supported by OSU College of Medicine
(COM, PhD) and Department of Internal Medicine (DOIM, MD or MD-PhD) funding. Recognizing that physician
scientists may be less competitive for a first K award due to inadequate research time, a third year of
postdoctoral training, covered by DOIM funds, is provided for physician trainees. OSU’s success in attracting
physicians willing to invest the needed time in research training is evident by such successful entities as the
Physician Scientist Training Program (PSTP). Highlights of this T32 include clear milestones, development of a
formal course in Cardiometabolic Science that distinguishes this program as an independent discipline,
regulatory sessions, and effective efforts across many institutional layers to change culture towards
advancement of women in cardiometabolic science. Individualized development plans are assessed by metrics
such as publications, career development awards, completion of coursework and workshop, and transition to
research and academic careers. Our faculty, infrastructure, leadership, trainee pool, and unique scientific focus
will deliver male and female cardiometabolic scientists and fill a critical postdoctoral training gap."
10908907,"The overall goal of this two-phase (R61/R33) study is to build capacity in the behavioral health workforce,
consisting primarily of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) staff, by training them to deliver an
evidence-based police education program to reduce HIV risk among people who use drugs (PWUD). A well
characterized evidence-base indicates certain policing practices, such as arrest, can elevate drug-related harm
by preventing access to life-saving medications and increasing overdose. Despite police officers having wide
discretion when responding to drug-related offenses, arrest and incarceration rates of PWUD remain high,
which in turn increase risk of syringe sharing, HIV, HCV, and overdose. This study will help fill a critical gap in
the science to examine the impact and scalability of a structural level HIV prevention intervention that shifts
policing away from arrest and toward referral to evidence-based MOUD. The Safety and Health Integration in
the Enforcement of Laws on Drugs (SHIELD) is a police education program that has been implemented in
numerous U.S. jurisdictions that focuses on reducing occupational risks and burnout among police, and task-
shifting to increase referrals to essential services for PWUD, such as MOUD. Thus far, delivery of SHIELD has
relied on a specialized academic team limiting its scalability. In this study, we will move SHIELD into the hands
of the behavioral health workforce and implement “SHIELD 2.0” in a region of Appalachia that has been hard
hit by overlapping epidemics of overdose and blood-borne virus transmission. Evaluating the implementation
processes and effectiveness of this approach will be a critical step towards SHIELD 2.0 having broader
implementation and population impact. We will leverage the infrastructure of an ongoing cohort of
approximately 500 PWUD (“SNAP” cohort, R01DA033862, PI: Havens) in Kentucky to externally validate
SHIELD 2.0. In the first year of this study (R61 phase), we will rapidly assess BHW acceptability and readiness
to deliver a structural HIV prevention intervention (SHIELD 2.0) to police (Aim 1) and adapt and pilot the
SHIELD 2.0 intervention to assess its feasibility and acceptability (Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will then
conduct a Type 2 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study to evaluate SHIELD 2.0 implementation
processes and outcomes (Aim 3), and determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SHIELD 2.0 on
referral to MOUD services and drug-related arrest on blood-borne virus transmission and overdose (Aim 4).
Given the increasingly recognized role of the justice system as a driver of HIV and other drug-related harms,
these aims are highly responsive to RFA-DA-24-015 “Ending the HIV Epidemic: Focus on Justice Populations
with SUD”. We expect findings from this study to be high-impact and would visibly transform policing to reduce
structural HIV risk. Further, enhancing the role of justice agencies to reduce HIV risk through enhancing
access to HIV prevention services, such as MOUD, is a major interagency priority of the Department of Health
and Human Services, Department of Justice, and the Office of National AIDS Policy."

This R01 application is responsive to the NIH initiative PAR-19-253 “Focused Technology Research and Development”.
Assays for measuring receptor-ligand affinity are valuable in many areas of biomedical research. The “gold standard”
surface plasmon resonance assay is limited to recombinant soluble receptors fixed on solid surfaces. The emerging adhesion
frequency assay (AFA) techniques can measure the receptor-ligand affinity on their native cellular membranes. However,
existing AFA methods can neither resolve the non-uniform distribution of receptors on single cells nor measure the rolling
cell adhesion under shear forces. In addition, currentAFAapproaches are generally bulky and low throughput, which require
tedious operation. Recently, we have invented a light-driven microrobot (LDM) platform as a non-invasive, programmable,
and multimodal cell-manipulation technology. Based on this versatile LDM platform, we propose to develop a paradigm-
shift four-dimensional (4D) AFA (i.e., integrated 3D translational AFA and 3D rotational AFA) to overcome these key
obstacles in the existing assays. In this R01 project, we will develop and validate our 4D AFA with the following features:
(1) measuring receptors on their native cell membrane environments, (2) resolving the non-uniformly distributed receptors
on single cells, (3) enabling both translational and rotational AFAs on an integrated platform, (4) investigating cell adhesion
under both shear force and tensile force, and (5) allowing on-chip multiplexed cell adhesion measurements. With such
features, the proposed 4D AFA has the potential to exceed current lab standards, address unmet needs in the field, and
enable high-throughput full profiling of receptor-ligand interactions at sub-cellular resolution. We will validate and improve
the 4D AFA performance using well-studied receptor-ligand pairs with variable affinities. We will further package and
apply the validated assay to investigate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and
to screen T cells for immunotherapy for cytomegalovirus infection. In this regard, we aim to demonstrate the far-reaching
potential of 4D AFA to enable improved research in areas ranging from clinical immunotherapy to fundamental biology."

BV is driver of the HIV epidemic, increasing HIV risk up to 60%. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is the most common
vaginal condition among women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 20-60% globally. Mediated by a non-
optimal vaginal microbiome and characterized by vaginal inflammation, symptoms can cause extreme
discomfort, including burning, vaginal malodor, and vaginal itching. A poorly understood component of BV are
its effects on infiltrating immune cells. Tissue resident macrophages may play a role in increased HIV risk, but
have not been investigated in the context of BV. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of a
non-optimal vaginal microbiome on inflammatory macrophage activation and training towards an HIV permissive
phenotype by establishing an ex-vivo macrophage stimulation model. Here we propose to assess changes in
macrophage activation when exposed to vaginal fluid from a global cohort of women (BV and healthy).
Macrophage activation will be characterized using both targeted analyses (HIV associated inflammatory
markers) and multi-level proteomics (epigenetic, total proteome). Vaginal fluid will be characterized using
metagenomics and metabolomics. Computational analyses and machine learning will allow for determination of
the role of unique microbial combinations on macrophage activation. We expect to identify specific microbial
compositions that correlate with an HIV promoting macrophage phenotype. This approach is highly innovative
because it couples machine learning with an ex vivo macrophage stimulation model to study microbiome-
macrophage interactions. Furthermore, vaginal fluid obtained from a global cohort of women in the US, South
Africa, and Ghana will be obtained using a citizen scientist model of recruitment which empowers and educates
participants. BV frequently recurs, and the vaginal microbiome is complexly variable among women. Completion
of the proposed project will advance the field of HIV prevention science, by providing a tool to directly examine
macrophage mediated-HIV risk. Additionally, it will provide a platform to test personalized, microbiome-informed,
probiotic interventions. Further, these finding will be paradigm-shifting as there is no precedent data to determine
if immune cells within the tissue micro-environment can be trained by a non-optimal vaginal microbiome, nor
studies to determine how this impacts HIV risk. Trained immunity has been linked to increased risk of HIV
infection, but has not been previously studied in the context of bacterial vaginosis. Completion of the proposed
study will reveal the effects of the vaginal microbiome on macrophage activation, identifying previously
unassessed novel mechanisms of inflammation. This multi-variate approach allows for deep proteomic and
metabolic characterization of the macrophage, which will provide data to determine the effects of vaginal fluid
on the macrophage training, differentiation and activation. Such models are necessary due to the complexity of
the biological processes, which cannot be readily assessed in direct clinical studies."

Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of the functional clotting factor FVIII
(hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B) in the contact activation pathway of the coagulation cascade. Current
treatment by protein replacement therapy is constrained by the short half-life of the clotting factors, requiring
repeated infusions at relatively large doses. The development of inhibitors (alloantibodies to clotting factors)
remains the single most important obstacle to managing hemophilia with protein therapy. Approximately 20–30%
of patients with hemophilia A and 5% of patients with hemophilia B develop inhibitors after protein replacement
therapy. In patients with inhibitors, the administration of clotting factors is ineffective, and poor control of
hemorrhagic episodes increases complications associated with the disease. Bispecific Factor IXa and X-directed
antibodies can be given to hemophilia A patients with or without inhibitors and are an improvement over infusions.
However, 47% of patients still require infusions for breakthrough bleeds. Hemophilia A gene therapies in
development for non-inhibitor patients have demonstrated limited durability of effect after a single infusion. To
date there have been no approved AAV based gene therapies in development for hemophilia patients with
inhibitors.
GeneVentiv is directly addressing this critical unmet need through the development of GENV-HEM, the first
universal gene therapy for all hemophilias and the first designed to treat inhibitor patients. GENV-HEM is an
AAV8 vector encoding human FVa (hFVa) driven by a liver-specific promoter. Within the coagulation pathway,
FVa functions downstream as a co-factor of activated Factor X (FXa) to amplify thrombin generation. FVa acts
in the common coagulation pathway and can generate thrombin via the prothrombinase complex without FVIII
or Factor IX. GENV-HEM offers a potential platform therapy that can treat multiple types of hemophilia including
hemophilia A and B with or without inhibitors and FV deficiency, including multi-year durability of effect. We have
demonstrated proof-of-concept in mouse models of hemophilia. The next major steps to allow commercialization
of this innovative technology are encompassed in the following Specific Aims: (1) Optimization of lead GENV-
HEM candidate in a mouse model of hemophilia with a reduced minimum effective dose; (2) Manufacture GLP-
grade GENV-HEM for IND-enabling studies; (3) Demonstrate efficacy of GENV-HEM in a canine model of
hemophilia; and (4) Develop bioanalytical methods in nonhuman primates in preparation for IND-enabling
pharmacology/toxicology studies. This data resulting from these studies will be used to inform IND-enabling
studies in dog and NHPs and predict starting doses for Phase 1 clinical trials. The successful outcome of this
Direct to Phase II project will support the commercialization of a technology that bypasses missing factors VIII
or IX and any inhibitors, restoring normal clotting in response to injury without thrombosis."
10918425,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This Phase I SBIR application seeks to meet NIDA’s desire for “Digital health technologies to address
the social determinants of health in context of SUD”. Romantic relationships are a core social determinant of
health that are widely neglected in SUD treatment and recovery services. Relationship conflict and distress are
common presenting complaints in SUD treatment and can lead to a reoccurrence and/or increase in use of
substances. Poor romantic relationships also interfere with successful SUD recovery. However, there are three
critical barriers to recovery service providers’ ability to offer existing relationship-focused interventions: they’re
not adjunctive, they’re too intensive, and they require extensive staff training. In this Phase I award, we will
create OurRelationship for Substance use (Our-S) to meet the needs of recovery centers nationwide as
an adjunctive, brief relationship program that does not require staff training.
 Our-S will be adapted from OurRelationship, a brief digital program that has been shown in multiple
RCTs to improve not only relationship functioning but problematic alcohol use, behavioral health, physical
health, and child functioning. This adaptation will occur through three aims. In Aim 1, Determine key market
requirements and barriers to adoption for Our-S, we will conduct a series of focus groups with staff and
administrators from recovery service providers as well as focus groups with individuals in SUD recovery
services and their partners. In Aim 2, we will develop new and adapted content for Our-S based on
information gleaned from the focus groups. This development will involve an iterative process of storyboarding,
validating that the new content would meet the requirements, and building that new content. In Aim 3, we will
test whether Our-S is user-friendly, endorsed by providers, and improves couple outcomes. One
hundred four couples – referred from a variety of recovery services providers – will be randomized to either
Our-S or a recovery service as usual (SAU). Intervention couples will be assessed repeatedly during the
program about its ease of use and engagement. Couples in both groups will respond to measures of
relationship outcomes and relational recovery capital – putative mechanisms of ultimate outcomes of
substance misuse. Recovery providers will also report on whether Our-S is valuable, feasible, and appropriate.
 There is strong potential for the commercialization of an adjunctive, digital relationship
intervention in the SUD recovery service industries. For example, NIDA’S and SAMHSA’s push towards
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)1 (NOT-MH-22-1702) – supported by Medicaid
expansion grants and other state funding – requires family-centered and family support services. Many
CCBHCs do not offer family services themselves, instead relying on contracts with Designated Collaborating
Organizations. Building on OurRelationship LLC’s existing nationwide services for the US military and EAPs,
we expect Our-S can fill the needs of CCBHCs and other recovery services nationwide in a cost-effective way."

10876996,"Project Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has thus far proven resistant to T cell redirecting therapies such as bispecific
antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which is unexpected given the proven success of these
in other hematologic malignancies. Preliminary studies show that the anti-tumor activity of CD19-targeting CAR
T cells (CART19) is enhanced in the presence of myeloid cells, and that targeting these myeloid cells with
CD33-targeting CART cells (CART33) leads to diminished long-term anti-tumor effect. Furthermore, removing
CD33 from normal myeloid cells improves CART33 expansion and disease control. Based on these findings,
the central hypothesis of this proposal is that bystander myeloid cells enhance CART cell activity, and directly
targeting myeloid cells compromises this effect. The objective of this proposal is to delineate how myeloid cells
influence CAR T cell behavior when they are targets of therapy, as compared to when they are simply
bystanders, so that we can intervene within these interactions and improve CAR T cell therapy for AML. This
will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1) Determine how bystander myeloid cells modulate CAR
T cell function; 2) Determine how targeting myeloid cells changes CAR T cell profile. To this end,
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) will be engineered through either viral gene transfer or CRISPR/Cas9 gene
knockout to generate myeloid cells that are positive or negative for the antigen targeted by the CAR. The
effects of wild-type or genetically modified myeloid cells on CAR T cells will be interrogated by in vitro culture
and in vivo mouse models, using flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-seq, and functional studies. The innovations
of this project are that it draws attention to host environmental factors that influence CAR T cell activity, and
advances the concept that the nature of the cell being targeted can influence CAR T cell behavior. This
research is significant because it will contribute to a better understanding of how CAR T cells work with the
immune environment, and illuminate methods to intervene within these interactions to improve the outcomes of
therapy. The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish the applicant Dr. Miriam Kim's career as an
independent researcher focused on developing novel cell therapies for AML. The proposed research and
career development plan will provide Dr. Kim with training in HSC/myeloid biology, immunology, and
bioinformatics. Her primary mentor, Dr. John DiPersio, and co-mentors Drs. Robert Schreiber, Todd Fehniger
and Carl DeSelm, offer complementary expertise in cell engineering and immunotherapy. Additionally, Dr.
Kim's collaborators Dr. Li Ding and Dr. Feng Gao will contribute to developing her skills in bioinforrnatics and
biostatistics. Furthermore, Washington University provides an ideal environment for Dr. Kim to successfully
establish herself as an independent investigator."
10817194,"This resubmitted R03 application seeks to determine how recurrent mutations common in splicing factors (SF)
lead to changes in chromatin accessibility and epigenetic landscape, thereby contributing to oncogenesis.
Recurrent mutations in SF are prevalent across multiple unrelated cancer types including acute myeloid
leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lung cancer and melanoma. Among the hundreds of splicing factors,
only 4 are commonly mutated: SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2. SF mutations are mutually exclusive and
non-synonymous, suggesting their role as tumor drivers with neomorphic function. Their well-established roles
in splicing catalysis have led to the presumption that alternate splicing of tumor suppressors or oncogenes is
the primary mechanism driving clonal evolution of mutant cells. While alternate splicing events are
demonstrable in RNA-seq datasets, such changes are quite modest and restricted to specific mutational
subtypes. This makes a direct role of alternative splicing in oncogenesis questionable. Recent studies have
looked at alternate molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis including excess R-loops that arise in response to
mutant SF expression. R-loops are 3 stranded structures of two DNA and one RNA molecules formed during
transcription. R-loops are critical regulators of chromatin states, and when unchecked can lead to genome
instability. These R-loops also cause S-phase arrest and can be rescued by the over-expression of RNAseH.
Emerging evidence points to the close coordination between spliceosomal machinery and messenger RNA
processing, including its 3' end cleavage and termination. We hence hypothesize that terminal R-loops arise
from defective mRNA processing. In the first aim of this proposal, we will determine dynamics of transcription
in SF3B1 and U2AF1 mutations through metabolic labeling of nascent RNA (transient transcript sequencing
with Timelapse chemistry or TT-TL-seq). Location of RNA Polymerase II in relation to R-loops and stalled
DNA replication forks will be determined through proximity ligation assay. The second aim will explore how
epigenetic modifiers regulate the formation and resolution of such pathologic R-loops. Our preliminary results
using a short hairpin RNA library reveals the role of histone deacetylase pathway in this regulation; hence we
will explore the relation between HDAC and R-loops in this aim. Finally, we will determine chromatin
accessibility in splicing factor mutant acute myeloid leukemia patient samples, since R-loops and open
chromatin are highly correlated. Given the limited scope of the R03 mechanism, the proposal is primarily
focused on biochemical studies linking aberrant RNA processing and R-loop formation. If successful, it will
form the basis of comprehensive investigations into the mechanisms of oncogenesis conferred by SF
mutations utilizing appropriate in vivo models."

Mitochondria are essential for cell health and survival. Understanding the quality control machinery that
mitochondria employ to maintain a healthy network is critical for health and disease. Our lab recently showed
the role that lipid transfer protein Vps13D plays a critical role in mitochondrial clearance by autophagy (mitophagy)
in the Drosophila developing midgut. Vps13D has been implicated in human movement disorders, highlighting
the importance of understanding how it controls this process. Importantly, we do not know what proteins Vps13D
may be interacting with at the mitochondrial surface to facilitate mitophagy. I performed an RNAi screen against
mitochondrial genes that were shown to physically interact with Vps13D in human cells. I discovered that Mtch,
the fly homolog of MTCH2, phenocopies both mitochondrial and autophagic defects that Vps13D mutants display,
including failure to clear mitochondria, autophagic cargoes like p62, and the autophagy protein Atg8a. I
generated a null mutant for Mtch, which displays phenotypes similar to what is observed by Mtch knockdown
with RNAi and Vps13D mutants. Importantly, Mtch mutant cells exhibit a robust decrease in Vps13D protein
puncta. I plan to use this Mtch mutant to: (1) characterize the function of Mtch in mitophagy, (2) determine the
relationship between Mtch and Vps13D in mitophagy, and (3) investigate the relationship between Mtch and
known regulators of autophagy and mitophagy. These studies will advance the field by creating a better
understanding of mitophagy, and will also provide a novel genetic pathway to study that could lead to targeted
therapies to correct mitochondrial disorders."
10919242,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 250,000 women develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) each year in the U.S,
affecting 6.4% of all pregnancies. Current methods for the diagnosis of GDM are not conducted
until the end of the second or early in the third trimester; however, it is possible dysglycemia
leading to both adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes are present well before this gold
standard screening. With the newest generation of continuous glucose monitors (CGM), the
ability to collect accurate data that does not require fingerstick calibration and can be
comfortably worn long enough to capture glucose dynamics is now feasible. The present
proposal seeks to longitudinally assess glycemia in healthy, non-diabetic pregnant women by
using blinded CGM data collection in 4-week intervals beginning between 6-12 weeks’
gestation. These data will allow for determination if a difference in mean sensor glucose levels
exists between women who develop GDM vs. those who do not using standard of care oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening. Furthermore, with the frequency of CGM data
collection, the optimal time to first detect the difference in mean sensor glucose levels can be
explored. Finally, more rigorous OGTTs will be conducted allowing for assessment of the
metabolic abnormalities that underlie the diagnosis of GDM including whether the dysglycemia
is due to insulin resistance or β-cell dysfunction. With the use of a consortium to conduct the
present study, a large cohort is feasible which will allow for assessment of factors that may
contribute to risk of dysglycemia and GDM, including race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI,
maternal age, parity and weight gain during pregnancy. The findings of this study may provide
a paradigm shift in how we diagnose GDM if blinded CGM can be used in place of an OGTT
and understanding of the metabolic alterations that lead to diagnosis of GDM."
10919245,"Minimally-instrumented home HIV detection and care linkage system
Project Summary/Abstract:
According to recent estimates, ~37 million adults and 3.4 million children live with HIV. High sensitivity
diagnostic tests for HIV are needed to reduce the spread and burden of the disease and allow detection during
the seroconversion window to enable “test and treat” and modify behavior. There is also a great need for
inexpensive, home / point of care viral load tests for HIV patients undergoing therapy to individualize treatment,
control the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains of HIV, and monitor adherence. To address these
needs, an interdisciplinary team of scientists from Penn Engineering, Penn Center for Aids Research
(CFAR), and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is proposing a system consisting of an
inexpensive disposable diagnostic cassette and inexpensive reusable processor. Our cassette will carry
out all unit operations from sample introduction, including plasma separation from whole blood, to multi-
plex enzymatic amplification, facilitating co-detection and quantification of HIV-1 clade B, Hepatitis B
(HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV), and beta Globin (positive control) with detection limit of 10 targets in a sample
(e.g., 350 copies/mL when whole blood sample volume is 100µL) and of HIV-1 Group M (subtype-
independent) in under 40 minutes. The cassette stores all reagents refrigeration-free with a shelf-life
exceeding 12 months. Our cassette mates with a simple battery-powered processor that provides
temperature-control, actuation, and an interface for a smartphone. The smartphone instructs the user in
operating the device; controls device operation, monitors and analyzes enzymatic amplification
processes; reports test results to the patient, to the medical team and public health officials (in
compliance with prevailing laws); and provides counseling. Our system carries out all the necessary unit
operations from sample introduction to test results. At the conclusion of this effort, we will have developed
a remarkable system for home/point-of-care molecular detection of HIV-1 and co-infections with minimal
instrumentation. Our system will be able to detect HIV during seroconversion to encourage individuals to
start therapy early and modify transmission behavior; monitor viral rebound to detect development of drug-
resistance and non-adherence, and enable personalized therapy with novel long-acting agents such as broadly
neutralizing antibody infusions likely to emerge over the next decade; and detect infection in infants born to
HIV–infected mothers (particularly in the developing world). As such, this system has the potential to allow
rapid detection of viremia and rapid intervention to prevent HIV transmission to the uninfected and reduce the
complications of HIV in those infected. More broadly, our system will enable individuals to assume
responsibility for their own care."
10919246,"We seek to renew our current award (UH3NS105562) as part of the Detect CID consortium and conduct a pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness + fidelity of our NIH Toolbox-derived paradigm to improve early detection and management of cognitive impairment/dementia in primary care settings serving health disparate patient populations. Early identification of cognitive impairment (CI), including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), is a top public health priority. Yet in primary care settings that manage the health of the majority of community-dwelling older adults, less than half of patients with any CI are detected and/or diagnosed. Among community health centers that serve marginalized patients - by low socioeconomic status (SES), minority race or ethnicity - rates of detection may be far lower. This is of great concern, as Hispanic/Latino (H/L) and Black older adults are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ADRD and to go undetected/undiagnosed compared to non-H/L Whites. Practical, scalable strategies are needed to help primary care practices better detect and manage CI, especially those caring for medically underserved, low SES communities. Since 2017, our team has been a member of the NINDS Detect CID Consortium; a network dedicated to improving clinical paradigms for early detection of CI and ADRD and its subsequent management in everyday clinical settings. Having developed the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (Co-I: Gershon, MPI: Nowinski) and with expertise in health system re-design for patient-centered care (MPI: Wolf), we validated our own clinical paradigm, known as MyCog. This includes a brief, iPad-based, self- administered, electronic health record (EHR)-linked strategy to assess for CI during primary care visits when concerns are identified. In response to RFA-NS-22-009, we will partner with a national primary care provider (Oak Street Health) and conduct a 2-arm, clinic-randomized, pragmatic trial comparing MyCog to usual care. We will focus on populations experiencing CI/ADRD disparities: Black, H/L, and low SES older adults. Our specific aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of the MyCog paradigm to improve early detection of CI and dementias among low SES, Black and Hispanic older adults; 2) investigate the presence of disparities in early detection of CI, its diagnosis, and rate of referrals by race and ethnicity; 3) determine the fidelity and reliability of MyCog and identify any patient, caregiver, clinician, and/or health system barriers to its optimal, sustained implementation; 4) assess the cost-effectiveness of the MyCog paradigm from a primary care perspective. Impact: Our findings will address known disparities and offer new evidence on a comprehensive, EHR-enabled, billable, scalable, primary care protocol for early detection of CI - informing future widespread dissemination."

Approaches to complete the human genome will benefit from careful, benchmarked advances that demonstrate
the capability to fully assemble and phase diploid chromosomes. The remaining unresolved regions in our high-
resolution genomic maps are known to contain long tracts of repeats. The long-term objective of our research is
to develop new experimental methods to complete chromosome scale assemblies to study the sequence
organization, structural diversity, and disease impact of these novel sequences. In our first aim, we demonstrate
the use of new approaches to generate the first telomere-to-telomere phased assembly of a human genome
using effectively haploid complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs), and demonstrate the ability to scale these
methods to a panel of CHMs. In our second aim we focus on validation methods of repeat assemblies to improve
upon the structural and base-level accuracy of our assemblies. In our third aim we harden haplotype phasing
method using high coverage ultra long data from diploid genomes to guide phased chromosome assemblies.
We propose to optimize a new, cost-effective method of improving high quality reference genomes to reach
complete, telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies. This research has the additional benefit that it will add new
sequence to the human genome to systematically explore genetic variation of regions frequently overlooked as
part of disease association and functional studies."
10923666,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One major objective facing the HIV research community is to facilitate drug-free viral remission in
People Living with HIV (PLWHIV). The host immune responses that can achieve this post-treatment
control (PTC) are poorly understood because PTC is rarely observed in PLWHIV and the commonly
studied SIV-infected rhesus macaques. CD8+ T cells are essential for control of HIV replication in the
presence and absence of ART, but no studies have identified that CD8+ T cells can promote ART-
free viral remission or delay the time to viral rebound after ART interruption.
We recently identified a Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model for sustained control of SIV
replication after stopping ART. MCMs who shared a non-protective MHC haplotype called M3 began
receiving ART 14 days after SIV infection and stopped receiving ART eight months later. They
suppressed SIV replication for more than five months after ART interruption. In vivo depletion of CD8+
cells led to prompt viral rebound, indicating a vital role for CD8+ cells in post-treatment viral
control (PTC). Our current proposal aims to unravel the function and type of CD8+ cells responsible for
PTC in MCMs.
This is the second competitive renewal of an ongoing R01 awarded to our lab. The first grant cycle
explored the role of CD8+ T cells targeting invariant SIV epitopes in the control of live attenuated SIV.
The second cycle focused on whether the IL-15 superagonist N-803 enhanced CD8+ T cell function to
suppress SIV replication. During cycle 2, we serendipitously discovered that MCMs frequently become
PTCs when ART is initiated two weeks post-infection, even without additional therapeutic interventions.
We are now proposing to use tools developed during both previous grant cycles to test the hypothesis
that MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells are required for PTC through a mechanism that is
independent of host MHC class I genetics.
We will determine whether the M3 MHC haplotype is necessary for PTC in MCMs. We will use in vivo
immune depletion studies and carefully engineered viruses with point mutations in viral peptides
restricted by M3 MHC class I alleles to characterize the specific CD8+ population(s) required for PTC.
Upon concluding this study, we will know whether PTC is universal among MCMs who begin receiving
ART two weeks post-infection and if PTC depends on MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells.
Successful completion of this study will identify whether PTC in MCMs is independent of MHC
genotype and if PTC relies upon virus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This information could
revolutionize our understanding of the specific types and functions of CD8+ cells that mediate PTC."
10921882,"ABSTRACT
Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria is second to P. falciparum (Pf) malaria with regard to global prevalence and
morbidity. Unlike Pf, control and elimination of Pv is complicated by frequent relapses – reactivation of dormant
parasitic forms called hypnozoites that persist in the liver for months to more than a year, that are not
eliminated by standard treatment, and that cause recurrent blood stage infections. Only primaquine and
tafenoquine target hypnozoites, drugs potentially causing life threatening acute hemolytic anemia in those with
G6PD deficiency which affects 8% of people in malaria-endemic regions. Efforts to develop better drugs or a
vaccine are hampered by the inability to propagate blood stages of Pv in vitro. Therefore, generating Pv-
infected mosquitoes for controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) to assess drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics
is reliant on feeding mosquitoes on fresh, Pv-infected blood from Pv patients and is rarely done due to complex
logistics. Absence of a readily available Pv CHMI of consistent quality hampers the development and testing of
interventions against Pv malaria compared to Pf. In our phase II grant, we produced Pv sporozoites (SPZ) of
the Chesson strain by feeding Pv-infected blood from specific pathogen free (SPF) Saimiri boliviensis (Sb)
monkeys to aseptic Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, and demonstrated that PvSPZ were highly infectious to
FRG mice with humanized livers. In compliance with GMPs we manufactured 1) a master cell bank (MCB) of
Pv (Chesson) asexual erythrocytic stage parasites in SPF Sb blood, and 2) one lot of aseptic, purified, vialed
cryopreserved PvSPZ, Sanaria® PvSPZ Challenge (Chesson). We submitted a pre-IND package to the FDA
detailing chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposal for a clinical trial and received positive
feedback and recommendations. In this competitive renewal, we plan to complete all quality control (QC)
assays to release the MCB and the cGMP PvSPZ Challenge lot, compile and submit an IND to the FDA that
includes a protocol for a CHMI study to assess the safety and infectivity of PvSPZ Challenge (Chesson). We
also propose manufacturing and releasing additional PvSPZ Challenge for future use in CHMI and as a potent
immunogen in the vaccination approach called PvSPZ-CVac (PvSPZ administered with an antimalarial drug).
Finally, to obviate the long-term need for producing and maintaining SPF Sb, we propose optimizing production
of aseptic, purified PvSPZ by feeding on blood from volunteers undergoing CHMI by injection of Pv-infected
erythrocytes. In summary, PfSPZ Challenge has revolutionized CHMI studies for Pf malaria, especially in the 6
African countries where it has been used, and brought Sanaria significant income. PvSPZ Challenge should
have equivalent impact, providing malaria investigators with a heretofore non-existent, transformative CHMI
model to assess efficacy of drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics for Pv malaria. It will be a safe quality-controlled
reagent with minimal variability in potency, logistically simple to use, and available to any research center in the
world and the foundation for establishing a highly protective approach to vaccinating against Pv malaria."

Last year, the care and treatment of roughly 6 million people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias cost the U.S. approximately $593 billion dollars. The tremendous costs associated with Alzheimer's
disease include direct medical costs, such as doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, as well as
indirect costs such as lost wages and productivity for both the affected individuals and their caregivers. According
to the Alzheimer's Association, the total cost of care for the estimated 13 million individuals with Alzheimer's and
other dementias in the United States by 2050 is projected to reach $1.1 trillion. Emerging lifestyle intervention
research is testing whether changes in physical exercise, sleep, socialization, and sedentary behaviors have an
impact on disease onset and progression of symptoms throughout the lifespan. Unfortunately, obtaining real-
world patient-generated health and behavior information to support this research from aging populations is
challenging and often relies on unreliable self-reporting. After years of meetings with 70+ investigators and
scientists at the NIH, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers,
numerous universities, and the Alzheimer's Association we determined and agreed that a consolidated database
of real-life, digital health information does not exist for Alzheimer's and dementia research. During Amissa's
SBIR Phase I, we created software to measure and collect physiological health data passively and unobtrusively
from non-stigmatizing smartwatches including the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy watch. This SBIR Phase
II project is critical to expanding that R&D and improving remote health measurements, collecting and sharing
rich digital health datasets, and identifying potential digital biomarkers that correlate to disease detection,
progression, and prevention. Our two software innovations will enable scientific researchers across the world to
utilize consumer-grade smartwatches as passive remote patient monitoring solutions. Researchers, labs,
universities, and healthcare practitioners will be able to create accounts on our platform, enroll her/his volunteer
subjects/patients for a study, and use our free software to collect longitudinal information including health vitals
and behavior data. Specific Aim 1: Develop A Research Platform and Real-World Health Data Marketplace To
Support Academic Research and Enterprise Partnerships. During Phase II R&D, Amissa Health will collaborate
with experts from Wake Forest University, Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center, Atrium/Advocate Health, Edge Analytics, and Microsoft to develop the first shared research
platform that will apply longitudinal, real-world, wearable sensor measurements to advance research of
dementia-related digital biomarkers and behavioral interventions. Specific Aim 2: Working with Edge Analytics,
a healthcare-focused data science firm that develops prototypes to production-ready algorithms, we will fine-
tune edge computing algorithms and smartwatch sensor data collection and compression techniques to
maximize real-time health data measurement and collection areas with poor cellular and/or Wi-Fi networks."
10923385,"Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), cardiovascular (CVD), liver (LD), and other chronic
diseases increasingly replace AIDS-related complications as the most common causes of morbidity and
mortality in HIV-1-infected patients. Gut mucosal damage leading to increased intestinal permeability and
ongoing chronic microbial translocation is a central factor in persistent systemic immune activation and
inflammation and represents a critical driving mechanism of HIV-1 pathogenesis. However, the specific
mechanisms and mediators of these processes are not well understood. Neutrophils, the most abundant
immune cell population in the body, are specifically geared for sensitive detection of invading microbial and
viral pathogens and represent the first and most robust innate immune population responding to microbial
translocation. Neutrophil NETosis results in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that promote
endothelial damage, atherosclerosis, and atherothrombosis. NETs provide the stimulus and the scaffold for
thrombus formation, prime macrophages for the production of cytokines that amplify immune cell recruitment in
atherosclerotic plaques, and induce endothelial damage. We show that neutrophils from HIV-1-infected
patients display a high capacity for NETosis and the production of NETs. The goal of this application is to
identify the specific subpopulations of neutrophils responsible for NETosis in HIV-1-infected individuals. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that HIV-1 infection is associated with the induction and expansion of
specific neutrophilic subpopulations with increased capacity to undergo NETosis. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and NETs released from activated neutrophils promote organ damage and contribute to the progression
of CVD, LD, and other chronic conditions. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our own
preliminary data and recently published reports demonstrating the critical role of neutrophils in HIV-1 infection
and other chronic inflammatory conditions. The overall objective of the proposed studies is to elucidate the
mechanisms responsible for chronic neutrophilic activation and production of NETs in HIV-1 infection in order
to reveal the specific checkpoints for intervention. In preliminary studies, we optimized the methods for detailed
neutrophil characterization and showed that neutrophils from HIV-1-infected individuals display an activated
phenotype, immunosuppressive properties, specific transcriptional profile, increased rate of degranulation, and
a high capacity to undergo NETosis. Using a novel method based on cellular indexing of transcriptomes and
epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq), we identified specific neutrophil subpopulations in chronic inflammatory
conditions. Specific properties of the newly identified neutrophil subpopulations strongly indicate that they play
a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. The objectives of this proposal will be accomplished in two
Specific aims: 1) Identify neutrophil subpopulations undergoing NETosis in HIV-1-infected individuals, and 2)
Determine whether the neutrophil populations undergoing NETosis are expanded in HIV-1-infected individuals
and whether the level of NETs in plasma serves as a prognostic marker of vascular and liver disease
progression in HIV-1 infection. The significance of the proposed studies is that once the role of neutrophils in
the progression of HIV-1 infection is defined, neutrophil activation can be pharmacologically targeted."

Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) affect millions per year, leaving 10-40% of patients with long-lasting (>1
month) physical, emotional, psychological, and cognitive symptoms for which effective therapeutic strategies
are lacking. Moreover, repetitive mTBI (rmTBI) can lead to cumulative severity and duration of adverse
consequences. Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that the spectrum of neurological sequelae seen
post-injury cannot be explained by biomechanical impact forces alone. Injury mechanisms underlying
neurological symptoms after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) are poorly understood and may be
distinct from more severe forms of TBI. Working together, Drs. Wood and Buckley (co-PIs) have recently
discovered that neuronal p38 MAPK phosphorylation is acutely up-regulated in mice predicted to have
worse cognitive outcomes after rmTBI. p38 MAPK is a stress-response pathway with a well-established pro-
inflammatory role in microglia after TBI. However, there is a gap in knowledge on the role of neuronal p38
MAPK phosphorylation in regulating response to injury that leads to cellular and cognitive dysfunction
after TBI. Our overall hypothesis is that p38 MAPK phosphorylation, especially within neurons, drives both 1)
acute changes in cytokine expression, microglia activation, and cerebral blood flow and 2) chronic changes in
microglia and cognitive deficits after rmTBI. Given limited knowledge on the role of neuronal phospho-signaling
in driving these neuroinflammatory, cognitive, and physiologic changes after TBI, the goal of this proposal is to
expand our knowledge on the role of p38 MAPK phosphorylation on brain sequalae following repetitive mild
TBI. Thus, the investigative team has designed specific aims to: (Aim 1) define the role of neuronal p38 MAPK
in driving neuroinflammation after rmTBI, including cytokine expression and microglial phenotype; (Aim 2)
define the role of neuronal p38 MAPK in driving longer term cognitive outcomes up to 12 weeks post injury,
test the ability of transient pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK to protect cognitive outcomes, and determine
if microglia mediate the effects of neuronal p38 MAPK on cognitive outcomes; (Aim 3) determine if neuronal
p38 MAPK or a neuronally expressed vasomodulatory cytokine (IL-17) drive changes in CBF after repetitive
mild TBI. The proposed work will be completed by a team with expertise in systems analysis of neural immune
signaling (Wood), pre-clinical models of traumatic brain injury and measurement of CBF (Buckley), microglial
phenotyping (Rangaraju) and mechanisms of cerebral blood flow regulation (Jo). Completion of these aims will
yield unprecedented insight into the role of neuronal phospho-signaling in driving sequalae following repetitive
mild TBI. Moreover, since this work will test a translationally relevant drug for inhibition of p38 MAPK, success
of these aims will present a rapidly translatable approach to treatment of repetitive mild TBI."

Cancer genomics aims to improve our understanding and treatment of all cancers by identifying differences in
DNA sequence and gene expression between tumor cells and normal host cells. Cancer genomics has
contributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The
Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support
research on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers,
highly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and
cancers among under-represented minorities.
 Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its
coordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and
goals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and
promotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements
of the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the
principles of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists,
especially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral
positions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.
 Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively
manage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing
administration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration,
dissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and
culturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations,
communication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and
disseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant
engagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to
the public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want
to address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of
future scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant
engagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues
in participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to
anticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine,
the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science."

More than 450,000 hospitalizations each year in the US are due to atrial fibrillation (AF) which contributes to
approximately 160,000 deaths. The incidence of stroke, morbidity, hospitalization and mortality is further
exacerbated by the 40% of heart failure (HF) patients who suffer from AF. The intertwined pathology between
AF and HF have emerged as global epidemics poised to dominate cardiovascular care for the next half-century,
imposing a staggering $372 million annual increase to the US healthcare system, and amplifying the urgency for
effective therapies. Catheter ablation has become an increasingly common treatment for AF despite limited and
highly variable success rates and complications, with arrhythmia-free survival rates < 29% at 5 years. The current
acute standard of care is external cardioversion, with or without antiarrhythmic drugs. Unfortunately, high-voltage
external shocks are extremely painful, can cause additional arrhythmias, and often require escalation of care at
an annual cost of ~$26 billion. Efforts to address this unmet need have focused on internal atrial cardioversion,
which has not been widely adopted due to the invasiveness and patient intolerability of the pain from high-energy
shocks. The Maxwell Biomedical Spatial Resynchronization Therapy (SRT) System resolves the limitations of
high energy cardioversion for treating AF by utilizing spatiotemporal identification of the excitable gap and ultra-
low energy stimulation within the gap to globally advance refractoriness of complex reentry patterns enabling
imperceptible pace-termination of AF. This is accomplished via a multi-site pacing electrode array lead system
(MPEALS), which consists of multiple paired electrodes that, when implanted, are distributed across the
posterior-inferior epicardial region of the left atrium and tunneled to a subcutaneous pocket located under the
left arm/shoulder and connected to a rechargeable pulse generator. The system records cardiac electrograms
from each of the electrodes and the algorithm analyzes these signals to determine electronic selection and timing
of stimulation at each electrode using a state-of-the-art method from Dynamical System Theory. Importantly, it
operates below 0.1 J, an order of magnitude below the threshold for pain. Evidence for the effectiveness of this
approach has been shown in bench simulations, in vivo swine, and first-in-human studies (n=10) where an
external system (MAX-SRS) connected to commercially available multipolar catheters placed during open-heart
surgery achieved 83.3% global synchrony across 48 independent test runs, demonstrating a remarkable ability
to effectively terminate AF. The Maxwell Biomedical SRT system is now ready for final refinement of the algorithm
(Aim 1) in parallel with development of the MPEALS (Aim 2) which will be evaluated for efficacy, safety and
deliverability with an implantable pulse generator as a complete system to capture, gain control and terminate
AF in an in vivo animal model of AF (Aim 3). Successful execution of Phase II studies will position the SRT
system for IDE approval to conduct the clinical studies required for PMA approval of a highly disruptive
technology to treat the growing population of patients with AF and HF."
10920991,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is a progressive orphan disease highlighted by pulmonary
fibrosis leading to a high mortality rate. Currently, there are only two FDA approved SSc-ILD therapies (OFEV
and ACTEMRA), both of which have limited efficacy and are mired with safety issues, warranting the
development of novel therapeutic targets to treat SSc-ILD. Our preclinical work has identified TGFβ-activated
kinase 1 (TAK1) as a key signaling element in fibroinflammatory signaling observed in pulmonary fibrosis. TAK1
plays a critical role in facilitating activation of protein kinase-mediated signaling pathways implicated in the
pathogenesis of SSc-ILD, and as a result has emerged as a novel target for regulating SSc-ILD mediated
inflammation and fibrotic signaling. Our recent discovery of the takinib scaffold has identified a highly selective
(selectivity score = 0.037), potent (IC50 = 2.5nM), and orally bioavailable (%F = 98%) small molecule inhibitor of
TAK1 (HS-276). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that TAK1 inhibition attenuates critical TGFβ fibrotic
signaling in human-derived fibroblasts, as well as limits pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling in activated human
macrophages. Furthermore, HS-276 significantly reduced bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, in vivo. Here,
we will build upon these foundational proof of concept studies and further develop HS-276 for the treatment of
SSc-ILD. In order to successfully further develop our program, this project includes the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: In vivo pharmacodynamic studies with HS-276 in two distinct murine lung fibrosis models: (Bleomycin
and Tsk1/+). Aim 2: HS-276 safety in bacterial and fungal opportunistic disease models. Aim 3: Completion of
key GLP safety and toxicology studies required for submission of an IND. Following successful completion of
these aims we will be poised to advance HS-276 towards Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of SSc-ILD."
10918170,"Disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism can lead to high cholesterol
concentrations in diseased tissue and the formation of cholesterol crystals (CC). CC are often
overlooked in traditional histo/immunohistochemistry as the ethanol, used for tissue processing,
can dissolve them. This masks CC presence and potential involvement in pathogenic
mechanisms. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of tissues prepared without an
ethanol dehydration step, we identified the presence of CC: i) in “lipid pools” between retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors (PR); ii) circulating freely in diabetic murine
blood; and iii) within circulating monocytes of diabetic human subjects. Since CC are very stable
physiologically and are not easily amenable to dissolving in vivo, they become a source of
chronic inflammation. CC are recognized by the innate immune system as foreign bodies
because of their shape, firmness, and inability to be dissolved. Moreover, CC also induce
inflammation via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These novel preliminary and published
studies have led us to propose the following hypothesis (see schematic in Fig.1): Diabetes-
induced disruption of i) systemic cholesterol homeostasis, ii) blood retinal barrier function; and
iii) SIRT1, LXR and CYP46A1 expression alters retinal cholesterol homeostasis leading to
CC formation within key locations: RPE, PR, monocytes/macrophages, and in the circulation
affecting the endothelium. This CC formation results in intra- and extracellular complement
activation and priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome for its activation and release of highly
damaging pro-inflammatory cytokines, promoting development of DR. To test this hypothesis,
we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim1: To determine the temporal changes in retinal
cholesterol accumulation that lead to CC formation. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that diabetes-
induced cholesterol accumulation and CC formation in the retina and in
monocytes/macrophages induces activation of intracellular and extracellular complement to
trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that LXR
activation and direct sequestration of cholesterol by alpha-cyclodextrin can inhibit CC-induced
complosome and NLRP3 inflammasome formation in the diabetic retina and in
monocytes/macrophages cells, thus preventing chronic inflammation and development of DR.
Impact: The successful completion of this project will result in identifying an entirely novel
pathway in which CC-induced complosome and NLRP3 inflammasome formation that can be
pharmacologically targeted to prevent DR."
10918178,"Project Summary/Abstract
Preclinical animal models have been the foundation for the development of novel cancer therapies. Historically,
this foundation has relied on mouse models. While mouse models are fundamentally important, the models are
insufficient and need to be complemented. Companion animals are an important combination of outbred
animals that have spontaneous cancer development with an intact immune system and have environmental
and epigenetic exposures as humans. Tackling complex cancer research problems should include
investigators with broad experience across animal and human species presenting a unique opportunity for
DVMs and MDs to have a crucial role in basic to translational research. Veterinarians can strengthen
comparative approaches essential to multidisciplinary research accelerating innovative treatments for animals
and humans. Medical doctors bring a patient-centered approach linking biology with clinical therapy.
Unfortunately, recruiting and retaining biomedical scientists with comparative oncology expertise, especially
DVM or MD clinician-scientists, continues to be a challenging issue facing the broader research community.
The Comparative Oncology Training Program (T32) will provide an outstanding environment to train
predoctoral (DVM/PhD) students and post-DVM or post-MD fellows who are interested in cancer research. To
accomplish this goal, Drs. Chen, Kent, and Canter (MPIs) organized a diverse team of twenty-seven UC Davis
faculty mentors from the School of Veterinary Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Biological Science,
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, and College of Engineering. The faculty mentors are
accomplished biomedical investigators with NCI or cancer-related funding. The proposed program will leverage
the NCI-designated UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and will be fully integrated into the Center’s
cancer education program. The T32 program’s objectives are to: 1) recruit and retain a diverse group of
clinician-scientists that prepares them to become future leaders in academia, government service and public
health, 2) expose the T32 scholars to cancer-focused career paths, and 3) train the scholars to use
comparative medicine to address human cancer biology. The objectives will be accomplished by providing up
to 3-year funding support for DVM/PhD dual-degree predoctoral students and post-DVM or post-MD
postdoctoral fellows. During the training, the T32 scholars will enhance their knowledge through tailored
coursework, mentored research, multidisciplinary interactions, and career development activities. By the end
of the grant period, we expect to train eleven professionals encompassing two dual-degree DVM/PhD
students, seven post-DVM fellows, and two post-MD fellows to become highly-qualified basic and translational
comparative oncology researchers."

This proposal seeks funds for a series of five summer workshops that will train a diverse group of early-career
scholars on the use of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFS), a population-based, longitudinal,
NIH-funded birth cohort survey developed to further understanding of the social and behavioral factors
affecting the development of urban children. Compared with children born to married, college-educated
parents, children born to unmarried parents, who lack a college education, often referred to as “fragile
families,” are much more likely to grow up in poor, high crime and violent neighborhoods and to attend schools
with other poor children. Biomedical and population scientists have raised a multitude of questions about the
extent to which such environmental factors affect child and adolescent wellbeing, the extent to which they may
moderate the genetic predispositions of children and adolescents toward health or behavioral challenges, and
the mechanisms that govern any causal effects. The FFS has played an important role in addressing these
questions; however, much remains to be learned, and the collection of new contextual and genetic FFS data
stands to further advance the research literature. As such, the proposed workshops will each focus on a
thematic area relevant to the above-mentioned concerns and will discuss different aspects of the FFS data not
covered in prior training workshops, including adolescent sleep, health behavior relationships; cognitive
development; DNA methylation ; brain development; criminal justice involvement; and outcomes for children
when they are 22 years old. The proposed series of workshops will train a new generation of researchers from
a variety of disciplines in the social and biomedical sciences on the capabilities of the FFS data and will result
in the dissemination of the Fragile Families data, an improved understanding of the issues facing adolescents
and young adults in fragile families, and opportunities for mentorship and collaboration for a new generation of
social, behavioral, and biomedical scientists."

This application, currently in the 10th year, is a competitive renewal of the “Training Program in Molecular
Physiology and Clinical Mechanisms of Lung Disease”, which is implemented as a Combined Adult and
Pediatrics Pulmonary Research-training program at Indiana University (CAPPRI). The program is unique in
synthesizing the adult and pediatric Pulmonary Divisions to examine diseases across the lifespan. Our mission
is to train exceptional MD and PhD scientists for leadership in investigative careers. In order to position the future
generation for this goal, our training program (CAPPRI) is designed to enable Trainees to have a comprehensive,
integrative, and formal career development experience with the goal of positioning them to become the next
generation of leaders in Pulmonary and Critical Care research. The CAPPRI stresses translational science,
incorporating the newest scientific platforms and didactic training integrated with cell, animal model, and human
tissue research with established clinical research programs. Formal graduate school training is available through
the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI). There are 33 Faculty Mentors and 7 Emerging
Mentors from 9 Departments. The inclusion of 7 emerging mentors (EM) is to provide the continuum of
mentorship and leadership development for the CAPPRI. CAPPRI is designed around selected Thematic Affinity
Groups (TAGs). The five TAGs include: 1) Vascular Biology, including both adult and pediatric presentations of
disease; 2) Outcomes and Health Services; 3) Airway Biology encompassing the continuum of the lifespan; 4)
Inflammation, Injury and Repair; and 5) Developmental Mechanisms. For a sustainable workforce, we will use a
conceptual model of academic persistence as our theoretical framework. Between 2009-2019, 22 T32 Trainees
were supported, with 18 completing their training. 83.3% remain in academic medicine or related research fields.
The group has published 147 peer-reviewed works. This group has been awarded 25 grants, including 8
fellowship awards, 5 career development awards, and 3 NIH R01 awards. The Trainees are highly diverse, with
50% women. All of these factors enable the Indiana University to be an ideal site for training future leaders in
respiratory diseases across the lifespan."

 Johns Hopkins University has recently re-established a multi-disciplinary, multi-school education
program in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS). The program is centrally coordinated and
managed by the newly established Section of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) in the Division
of General Internal Medicine. Faculty are drawn from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the Bloomberg
School of Public Health, the Whiting School of Engineering, the School of Nursing, and the Krieger School of
Arts and Sciences. The program is structured around four tracks: Translational Bioinformatics, Clinical
Research Informatics, Healthcare/Clinical Informatics, and Public Health Informatics. The program is built on
the decades of informatics training tradition fostered by the Welch Medical Library and the Division of Health
Sciences Informatics, now consolidated in the new BIDS Section. The new organization has established tight
integration with the University and School of Medicine Education leadership, support systems, and
infrastructure. We have revamped and extended our core curriculum to balance traditional informatics topics
with current data science principles and methods. Specialized curricula have been developed in depth for each
academic track of the program. Because of our newly formalized administrative structure, students are now
free to take elective courses anywhere in the University with tuition reciprocity. Students also have access to
the deep bench of research programs across informatics, computer science, biomedical engineering, and data
science throughout the university, anchored by an ever-growing portfolio of BIDS grants and cooperative
agreements in the BIDS Section such as the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Thus, BIDS students
have unprecedented opportunities for applied practica at depth to enrich and reinforce their education, provide
a basis for theses, and more importantly achieve experience as collaborators, contributors, and authors. The
University and School of Medicine provide state-of-the-art clinical and basic science data-analytics
environments, including our Secure Analytic Framework Environment (SAFE) virtual machines, the Precision
Medicine Analytics Platform (PMAP), the state HIE population-based EHR analyses platform (on PMAP), and
well-curated clinical data warehouses in OMOP, PCORNet, ACT, and TriNetX formats. Training in biomedical
ethics and the responsible conduct of research is deeply embedded in all practica involving patient data.
Students have opportunity to work with well-established, well-funded research mentors, and to receive
instruction from faculty with a deep commitment to education and training. The strengthening of translational
science, multidisciplinary teams, and enterprise-class infrastructure and computer support across Johns
Hopkins University provides students with opportunities to witness and participate in the new shape of
collaborative science into the future."
10909831,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a critical shortage of blood that affects many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Blood
collection rates in these regions are ten-fold lower than rates in high-income countries.
According to the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service (KNBTS), the country's healthcare
system requires nearly 500,000 units of blood per year. Last year, collections reached just 30%
of this mark. Unfortunately, the blood transfusion processes span a continuum from blood
donation to safe delivery that is complex, expensive, and prone to failure. The consequences
are devastating; postpartum hemorrhage, malarial anemia, sickle cell disease, and all other
forms of acute hemorrhage claim millions of lives each year. Thus, optimizing blood transfusion
services in LMICs represents both a major health challenge and a social imperative. The
overarching goal of this project is to identify, develop, and test effective strategies to enhance
the availability and delivery of safe blood for transfusion in Kenya. A research consortium led by
Strathmore University and the Center for Public Health and Development (CPHD) in Nairobi has
partnered with the University of Pittsburgh with the objective of defining and characterizing the
blood transfusion system in Kenya in order to provide evidence for the effective implementation
of a diverse set of interventions aimed at enhancing and streamlining the safe delivery of blood
in both urban and rural Kenya. Our research team has designed a multidimensional three-by-
three-by-three approach that consists of three clinical pathways determining the urgency of
blood transfusions; three distinct socioeconomic contexts within Kenya that best represent both
urban and rural settings; and three basic components of effective blood transfusion systems
(availability, processing, and safe delivery). Our specific aims are: 1. Evaluate ground-level
deficits in the continuum of banked blood transfusion — specifically availability, processing, and
delivery — across three distinct socioeconomic contexts in Kenya (Nakuru, Siaya/Kisumu, and
Turkana counties), and within three specific clinical contexts (emergent, urgent, planned); 2.
Evaluate ground-level and consensus solutions to optimize the continuum of banked blood
transfusion; and 3. Identify disruptive technologies for the implementation of safe and reliable
blood transfusion strategies, including innovative supply-chain solutions and crowd-sourcing
through social media and mobile technologies. This work will elucidate barriers to safe blood
access and quantify the impacts of unavailable blood in each clinical situation. During the UH3
phase of the project, we aim to implement innovative, contextually appropriate, stakeholder-
backed interventions to address deficits across the blood continuum, ultimately optimizing blood
donation, collection, testing, and timely availability so that blood is given to the right patient at
the right time and location, ensuring the highest quality of blood transfusion services in low
resource areas."

The Southwest Idaho Bridges to the Baccalaureate (SWID B2B) program is an enduring undergraduate
research program in Idaho that supports both the transition of underrepresented (UR) students from the College
of Western Idaho (CWI) community college into biomedical degree programs at Boise State University (BSU)
and their successful graduation. The SWID B2B program was originally developed using a previous NIH R25
funding mechanism and will be entering its second five-year span under the T34 mechanism. Based on statistics
from our institutional self-assessments, the SWID B2B program has the long-term goal of increasing the number
of individuals from UR groups in Idaho that pursue research careers in the biomedical sciences. The short-term
goals of this T34-funded B2B program are to i) increase the number of UR CWI community college students that
transfer to BSU into biomedical science majors, ii) increase retention and graduation rates for UR biomedical
science transfer students, and iii) prepare UR students for careers in the biomedical sciences. In steady state,
this program will serve hundreds of students per year and include annual B2B cohorts of 10 UR students. To
accomplish our goals, we request funding for the following five specific aims. Aim 1. Recruit and select
program participants. The objective of this aim is to Recruit UR students with strong potential interests in
futures that include biomedical research and to Select UR students (in cohorts of 10 per year) into the B2B
program. Aim 2. Advise and prepare student trainees. The object of this aim is to Advise CWI students early
and continuously through program ambassadors and to Prepare students for a research experience by offering
B2B-enhanced courses at CWI and providing peer mentoring. Aim 3. Immerse and include student trainees.
The objective of this aim is to Immerse community college students in a biomedical research experience with a
faculty mentor during the summer before they transfer to the university campus and to Include students in the
everyday activities associated with biomedical research. Aim 4. Equip and support student trainees. The
objective of this aim is to Equip students as they move through their degree program at BSU by providing an
academic-year research experience and a professional development course, as well as to Support students for
success by providing them continued scientific mentorship and the opportunity to present their research data
nationally. Aim 5. Continually engage and launch program participants. The objective of this aim is to
Continually Engage students as they leave SWID B2B and move through their degree program at BSU by
encouraging all students to continue their research in their mentor’s lab, enroll in a senior level seminar course,
and when appropriate, apply for additional summer fellowships. Studies have demonstrated that undergraduate
research experiences like the B2B program have an important positive impact on UR groups, and we expect that
our SWID B2B program will have enduring effects, transform the lives of UR students, and improve their success
as they move forward into biomedical careers."
10911022,"Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is a major cause of malaria worldwide and frequently results in illness among active
duty military personnel. It is also an important cause of malaria in veterans because the parasite develops a
latent stage of infection that can relapse years later. Our aim is to develop a vaccine and novel therapeutics
for Pv. The goal for vaccine development efforts is a multi-component vaccine that targets multiple stages of
the Pv life cycle in humans. In this proposal, our focus is on two essential Pv proteins required for parasitic
invasion of red blood cells (in this case, reticulocytes). These are the Duffy Binding Protein (DBP) and the
Reticulocyte Binding Protein 2b (RBP2b). Our approach is to generate human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
from individuals with naturally-acquired immunity to Pv. Using B cells from donors with robust immune
responses, we will identify B cells specific for DBP and RBP2b and generate mAbs against these two essential
invasion proteins. We will test whether the mAbs can block the binding of Pv proteins to their receptors on
reticulocytes and if so, whether they can inhibit Pv invasion of reticulocytes in vitro. We will then determine
which Pv protein targets (epitopes) are recognized by the most effective mAbs. We will identify the mAb targets
that are likely to be present in Pv strains globally and thus useful for inclusion in a pan-global vaccine. The
most promising mAbs will then be tested for their ability to protect against Pv blood stage infection in an Aotus
monkey model of Pv infection. Working with our collaborators at the NAMRU-6 primate unit in Peru, mAbs will
be passively transferred to Aotus monkeys and the animals monitored for protection against Pv malaria.
Pending the outcome of our animal protection experiments, we will proceed with further development of a
vaccine candidate (an immunogen) that incorporates the essential Pv targets identified. We will use a novel
animal-based approach to generate stable immunogens known as nanobodies or VHH antibodies. Our studies
will involve a carefully orchestrated collaboration by experienced scientists working on malaria at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Cleveland, OH; Center for Global Health and Diseases at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, OH; Malaria Unit, Institute Pasteur, Cambodia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute,
Australia; and the NAMRU-6 unit in Peru. Our results will enable progress toward a multi-component vaccine
against Pv. They will also advance the potential of antibody therapies for severely ill individuals and those in
need of sustained prophylaxis during seasonal transmission and tours of duty.

10911848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with extremely poor
survival and no effective pharmacologic therapies. The CBL gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and
signaling adaptor protein, is frequently mutated in CMML patients. We identified hyperactivation of the SRC
family kinase LYN as a key oncogenic driver in CBL-mutant cells. Consistent with this finding, we have also
demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative effects of LYN inhibition by dasatinib in CBL-mutant cell
lines and patient-derived CMML samples, providing rationale to explore the therapeutic potential of dasatinib in
patients with CBL-mutant CMML. The development of drug resistance represents a possible challenge to the
efficacy of dasatinib in CMML patients. Thus, an understanding of dasatinib-resistance mechanisms is essential
for the design of durable therapeutic approaches in CBL-mutant CMML. Moreover, discovery of other targetable
pathways in CBL-mutant disease will guide the selection of combination therapies that prevent the emergence
of drug resistance. Indeed, we have observed that an inhibitor of SYK, fostamatinib, also has anti-proliferative
activity against CBL-mutant cell lines, presenting an opportunity to test the efficacy of combined LYN/SYK
inhibition. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will assess dasatinib resistance and intracellular signaling in CBL-mutant
cells expressing a series of LYN and SYK alleles, including wild-type, kinase-dead, and drug-binding mutants. I
will also define genetic mechanisms of dasatinib resistance via a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen
in dasatinib- or vehicle-treated cells. In Aim 2, I will assess the biological effects of combined treatment with
dasatinib and a panel of FDA-approved inhibitors of SYK in vitro and test the efficacy of dasatinib plus
fostamatinib in patient-derived xenograft murine models of CBL-mutant CMML. Altogether, the experiments
proposed here will build significantly on our previous work and lead to further progress in the discovery of
effective treatments for CMML patients. The applicant, Dr. Roger Belizaire, is a clinical pathologist and
laboratory-based investigator in the Department of Oncologic Pathology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
(DFCI). He spends 80% of his time in translational research and 20% in clinical practice as a transfusion medicine
physician. He has proposed a five-year career development plan to enable the development of his independent
laboratory at the DFCI. Dr. Belizaire has assembled an Advisory Committee of world-renowned experts to
provide scientific and career mentorship. He has established collaborations with experts in myeloid neoplasia,
oncogenic signaling, and targeted cancer therapeutics to provide experimental guidance and specific training in
the field. Dr. Belizaire will conduct this research under the mentorship of Dr. Benjamin Ebert at the DFCI and
leverage the exceptional research and teaching environment at the DFCI. The DFCI, which comprises an
outstanding research community with an extensive track-record of successfully mentoring physician-scientists,
is an ideal environment for completion of these experimental and career development aims."

no prior work has explored neurocognitive predictors of FBT response, which may help to facilitate the
identification of treatment mechanisms and formulation of targeted treatments for non-responders. When
considering what neurocognitive processes may be implicated in FBT response, increasing work suggests that
adult AN may be characterized by alterations in reinforcement learning. Further, work in other forms of
psychopathology suggests that reinforcement learning may predict response to behavioral treatments. However,
few studies to date have tested alterations between reinforcement learning and treatment outcome, and none
have explored associations between reinforcement learning and FBT outcome. The current investigation will
leverage methods from cognitive neuroscience and computational modeling to explore reinforcement learning in
adolescents with AN (n = 58) and healthy control subjects (n = 58), as well as its associations with treatment
outcome in FBT. I will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: Consistent with existing data in adults, the AN group
will demonstrate poorer performance in the learning task compared to HC, decreased loss learning, and poorer
exploitation of prior learned information. Aim 2: Within the AN group, lower rates of learning from loss, as well
as lower explore/exploit parameter values will relate to poorer outcomes at 1- and 6-month follow-ups,
operationalized as lower body weight and greater eating disorder cognitive symptoms. With the mentorship of
five experts across biostatistics, adolescent clinical research, computational modeling, and cognitive
neuroscience, the current patient-oriented career development award will allow me access to training that will
facilitate unique expertise at the intersection of these fields. Short-term, data from the current investigation will
yield insights that can be used to understand the persistence of AN symptoms and identify potential methods to
improve treatment outcomes. Long-term, the current project will allow me to launch my career and take the next
steps in a programmatic line of research merging complementary expertise in neurocognition, computational
methods, and adolescent intervention development."

There has been a long history of cardiovascular research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center
(UMMC). Much of this research has been conducted in the Department of Physiology where their efforts are
directed toward developing a quantitative and integrated analysis of the cardiovascular and renal systems. In
addition both basic and clinical research on hypertension and cardio-renal diseases at UMMC have expanded
in various departments and programs such as Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Neurosciences, Medicine,
Endocrinology, Emergency Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. UMMC also serves as the Examination
Center for the Jackson Heart Study that has a major focus on cardiovascular disease in African Americans.
UMMC has also been a participant is several major clinical trials such as ALLHAT. Thus, UMMC has a
diversity of basic, clinical, and population research programs in cardiovascular diseases. The main objective of
the multidisciplinary Hypertension and Cardiorenal Diseases Research (HCDR) Training Program is to recruit,
train, and mentor pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students in hypertension and cardiovascular and renal
research so that they become the next generation of researchers in this field. To achieve this goal the
Cardiovascular–Renal Research Center (CRRC) at UMMC continues to provide a stimulating and productive
mentoring environment for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students. The HCDR Training Program not only
capitalizes on the expertise of a strong group of basic science and clinical investigators in the field of
cardiovascular and renal research at UMMC but also the resources provided by these established laboratories
and the CRRC core facilities.
The specific aims of this training grant renewal are as follows:
1. To train pre-doctoral students (3) in a multi-disciplinary approach in course work and research
 opportunities in hypertension and cardiovascular-renal disease research.
2. To provide postdoctoral students (6) multi-disciplinary training and mentoring in hypertension and
 cardiovascular-renal disease research
3. To recruit, train, and retain minority pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students in hypertension and
 cardiovascular-renal diseases research.
Continued funding of the HCDR training program at UMMC would increase the quality and quantity of trainees
in this multi-disciplinary program and greatly enhance our ability to train the next generation of biomedical
scientists in hypertension and cardio-renal diseases research."

The major goal of mitosis is to distribute the genetic material accurately between two daughter cells. Defects
in meiosis or mitosis lead to aneuploidy, which is a significant cause of birth defects and is a hallmark of
tumorigenesis. Critical to this process is the mitotic spindle, which is a cellular macromolecular machine
tasked with both alignment and segregation of the genetic material. Even though the spindle structure and
molecular players are highly conserved across organisms, the detailed organization of the spindle and protein
function can vary even between cell types within an organism. This variation suggests that cells have evolved
multiple pathways to ensure the proper distribution of genetic material. My lab has a long-standing interest in
understanding how molecular motor proteins organize spindle structure, regulate microtubule dynamics in the
spindle, and contribute to accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. These studies are important
because motor proteins not only play fundamental roles in spindle organization and function, but also because
they are often overexpressed in cancer cells and may be valuable targets for therapeutic development. In the
next five years, our studies will focus on three key questions. 1) How is molecular motor activity spatially and
temporally regulated? An important goal is to understand not only how molecular motors function individually,
but also how groups of motors cooperate with their binding partner to regulate spindle function. Our studies
will define critical networks between biochemical activities of motors and cellular readouts of that activity. 2)
How do regulated microtubule dynamics and centrosome clustering enhance mitotic fidelity? The current
model is that cancer cells generate low levels of aneuploidy to drive their survival while limiting severe
aneuploidy that would ensure cell death. We will uncover how key molecular motors impact mitotic fidelity by
dissecting their function in mitosis and DNA damage repair. In addition, we will examine how centrosome
clustering restricts severe aneuploidy in cells with amplified centrosomes. 3) How is accurate chromosome
segregation impacted by increased chromosome load in cells with altered ploidy? An important but
understudied problem is to elucidate how the normal complement of cellular proteins handles aneuploidy in
both normal and cancer cells and how changes in the relative expression levels of key players impact
accurate segregation of the genetic material. We will take advantage of our ability to generate cells with
different levels of ploidy to understand how changing expression of key molecular motors is impacted by
increased chromosome load and how that affects mitotic fidelity. Our proposed studies take advantage of our
toolbox of key molecules, rigorous biochemical assays, high quality imaging, and diverse model systems to
define the function of motors and regulatory networks that control mitotic fidelity. The outcome of these studies
will define mechanisms by which distinct protein-protein interaction networks impact spindle morphogenesis
and will provide new insights into how cells maintain genome integrity."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 80% of all dementia diagnoses.
In July 2023, the Alzheimer’s Association (AA) posted an update to their joint NIA-AA position on diagnosing AD.
It now requires biomarker evidence of AD-type pathology for diagnosis while also determining that biomarker
tests should not be ordered or interpreted in the absence of clinical context.
This new path for diagnosing and treating AD intensifies the need to ease the early, accurate, and accessible
identification of the patients who should undergo AD biomarker testing. Unfortunately, today’s techniques for
evaluating cognitive status and indicating the appropriateness of AD biomarker testing do not meet the clinical
need. These weaknesses hinder proper diagnosis of cognitive impairment, thereby limiting identification of
candidates for AD biomarker testing and treatment of AD.
To address these problems, SPARK Neuro is developing SPARK Scan, a standardized, objective, non-invasive,
and cost-effective diagnostic tool capable of identifying and staging cognitive impairment that is highly sensitive
to the presence of AD. In the proposed Phase II SBIR project, SPARK Neuro will build upon findings from a
successful Phase I in preparation for an FDA De Novo Submission and eventual commercialization. This effort
will include a pivotal clinical study (N=200) that will validate algorithm performance (Aim 1). Following this
validation, SPARK Neuro will finalize product software and cloud-based infrastructure, completing Verification
and Validation (“V&V) (Aim 2)."
11095702,"Health disparities in the United States have their origins as early as the prenatal period. Early life conditions including poverty and discrimination generate disparities in health over the life course that become further entrenched in the population through their transmission across generations.
Parental mental health, which is strongly linked with social and economic disadvantage as well as child development, may play a key mediating role in the transmission of disparities across generation, but a persistent gap in the disparities literature is that both maternal and paternal psychopathology have not been fully considered as mechanisms nor measured using phenotypically validated approaches.
As a result, though disparities in health are well documented, the developmental mechanisms that impact disparities at the very beginning of life are not, particularly those which lead to developmental deficits that emerge long before disease states. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) strategic plan (2016-2020) highlights the need for research to improve “understanding mechanisms that lead to disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.” Such enhanced understanding is needed to clarify the etiology of disparities – particularly the specific exposures linked with social or economic disadvantage that impact early development.
Advancing knowledge of the developmental mechanisms that generate disparities requires a more thorough understanding of how socioeconomic and race/ethnic status influence the determinants of development from gestation onward. To accomplish this, more in-depth measurement of potential causes of disparities is needed from more diverse samples starting
earlier in the life course are needed than is currently available from existing studies."
10919626,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit high heterogeneity in biofluids, a feature that traditional bulk-level analysis
approaches fail to capture in terms of individual variations. While numerous techniques exist for single-EV
analysis, the majority focus primarily on profiling surface proteins. Transcriptional analysis at the level of
individual EVs, however, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a
technology for multimodal profiling of individual EVs, leveraging next-generation sequencing and an optimized
method for multiplex library preparation. This proposed platform will serve as a unique tool for high-throughput,
integrative profiling of single-EV gene expression and surface proteins. It aims to offer high-sensitivity, multi-
dimensional biological insights, thereby potentially accelerating the advancement of EV-based diagnostics and
targeted therapies."

 The Society for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (BDRP) will hold its 64h Annual Meeting at the
Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown, in Pittsburgh, PA—June 22–26, 2024. The scientific program covers a
wide range of cutting-edge research in birth defects and disorders of developmental origin. The 2024 session
topics include the role of the microbiome in development; the role of stem cells in research; the epidemiology
of congenital anomalies in minoritized populations; how to effectively communicate complex scientific
concepts; exposures and biochemical pathways that lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes; facial morphology
and dysmorphology; understanding the risks and mechanisms that underlie spina bifida; PFAS and placental
dysfunction; developmental neuropathology; and DART strategies for oligonucleotides. BDRP encourages
innovation in the field of birth defects research. Each year the abstract reviewers identify the abstracts that they
find innovative and provide their reasons to the Awards Committee, They select the top three innovative
abstracts to compete for the Innovator Award which recognizes innovative and translational research at the
intersection of at least two of the following areas: basic science, new technologies, clinical research, policy,
and outreach. Meeting attendees historically come from diverse professional backgrounds including basic and
clinical scientists from the academic, industrial, and government research sectors. The BDRP Annual Meeting
provides a unique forum where basic, clinical, and epidemiologic researchers come together to share progress
toward a common understanding of the causes and mechanisms of birth defects and developmental disorders,
and to translate these discoveries into clinical practice.
 The Society strives to encourage, engage, and mentor students and new/early-stage investigators (trainees),
recognizing that its trainees represent the future of both the Society and the important scientific work
necessary to fulfill its mission to understand and prevent birth defects. Through the establishment of the
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Committee, BDRP is exploring how to recruit and mentor students
from under-represented and under-served populations. Specific events at the Annual Meeting encourage
trainee participation, including a career night to introduce trainees to members from different disciplines; and a
luncheon workshop highlighting professional development topics. Trainees are encouraged to present their
research; eight to ten trainees are invited to compete for the prestigious Wilson presentation award in a special
platform session, and all trainee poster presentations are judged for best poster presentation awards. Trainees
are also encouraged to serve as ad hoc members on Society committees, thereby deepening their involvement
within the Society. In this application, we are requesting funds to support Travel Awards for trainees to attend
the 2024–2028 Annual Meetings, and to partially support travel expenses of key nonmember speakers who will
help us educate and inspire these trainees."
10927190,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Development of effective therapies is an urgent, unmet medical need for patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The advent of immune checkpoint antagonists such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4
antibodies has revolutionized treatment of some cancers but remains unsuccessful in PDAC. We and others
showed that the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC is rife with myeloid-derived suppressor cells
including inflammatory monocytes (IMs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that stifle the effect of
chemotherapy and anti-tumor immunity. Excessive production of CCL2 in PDAC has shown to result in tumor
growth, dissemination, local immunosuppression, and resistance to chemotherapy. Targeting a key chemotactic
mechanism, the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)/ C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) axis, that draws
these cells to the TME potentiates the efficacy of chemotherapy in preclinical mouse model and a clinical trial
conducted at our institution, setting the premise to further confirm and optimize CCR2-targeted strategies in
PDAC. We are in the process of opening a phase I/II clinical trial combining a CCR2/5 inhibitor, chemotherapy
and anti-PD-1 agent. Realizing that not all patients will benefit from this regimen, a diagnostic tool capable of
assessing CCR2 abundance while predicting and monitoring treatment response will be invaluable. CCR2
inhibitor slows tumor progression, prevents metastasis in mouse models of PDAC, and potentiates effect in
patients with border-line resectable or locally-advanced PDAC (NCT01413022). We have developed a CCR2-
PET tracer (64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i) and shown its sensitivity and specificity in imaging CCR2 in multiple preclinical
inflammatory disease models and PDAC models and PDAC human specimens. Our PDAC PET imaging in
genetic mouse model demonstrated early, sensitive, and specific detection of CCR2 in tumors. The first-
in-man imaging showed low accumulation of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i in normal pancreas and liver (a common
site of metastatic disease where CCR2-bearing IMs and TAMs infiltrate the pre-metastatic sites prior to
establishment of metastatic clones) with rapid blood and renal clearance, indicating the potential of this PET
tracer for CCR2 detection in PDAC patients. We hypothesize that 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i can sensitively and
specifically detect CCR2 in PDAC, track the variation following CCR2-targeted treatment, and likely prescreen
PDAC patients for CCR2-targeted therapy. We propose to evaluate whether tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i
correlates with tumor expression of CCR2 and response to standard chemotherapy in PDAC patients. We also
will evaluate whether tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i predicts response to CCR2-directed therapy in PDAC
patients treated with CCR2/5 inhibitor and chemo-immunotherapy. The successful completion of this grant will
facilitate innovative means for clinical data interpretation, patient stratification, and therapy guidance."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with HIV
(PWH). Although clinical guidelines recommend detecting and addressing CVD risk among PWH, CVD
prevention has not been effectively implemented in routine HIV Care. Addressing this implementation gap is
critical for reducing the disproportionately greater burden of adverse CVD outcomes facing PWH. My K01
research aimed to address this gap by examining CVD risk among PWH, CVD preventive practices in HIV
care, and implementation strategies to improve these practices. My work showed CVD risk in PWH is driven by
traditional risk factors (e.g., hypertension) which HIV clinical guidelines recommend addressing. My K01
research also showed that lack of awareness about clinical guidelines, low clinician motivation to follow the
guidelines, lack of CVD preventive resources, and the clinic culture influence guideline adoption. I then
developed an agent-based model to simulate the effects of implementation strategies on these barriers: I found
education, audit and feedback, and leadership engagement are promising strategies to improve guideline
adoption. To determine if these findings are valid and aligned with current HIV care practices, my model needs
to be externally validated using data from diverse HIV care contexts. Further, to determine its acceptability and
real-world relevance, the model needs to be evaluated by HIV stakeholders and refined through participatory
modeling approaches. Thus, the overall goal of this R03 application is to externally validate and refine my K01
model through participatory agent-based modeling. First, I will externally validate the model that simulates the
effects of implementation strategies on hypertension care guideline adoption (AIM 1). Second, I will evaluate
and refine the model through participatory agent-based modeling with HIV stakeholders (AIM 2). The proposed
study responds to NHLBI’s call to explore CVD prevention in the HIV population and to optimize
implementation research to improve health. This study will contribute a tool that HIV decision makers can use
to inform their CVD prevention efforts, and a prototype implementation strategy that can be tested in real-world
HIV clinics."

Background: Dolutegravir (DTG) is a first-line antiretroviral drug used in combination therapy for the treatment
of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. Due to the roll out of generic DTG-based regimen, its
inclusion in national treatment guidelines and rising pretreatment resistance to non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in resource limited countries, in just 5 years, 15 million HIV-1 infected people
will be treated with DTG. This includes women of child-bearing age, who remain a significant infected population
(UNAIDS data, 2021). However, during recent years, growing data from clinical and pre-clinical studies have
suggested that DTG is associated with developmental neurologic abnormalities. Thus, concerns emerged for
the usage of DTG-based regimens in pregnant women or those of child-bearing age. Knowledge gap:
Underlying mechanism for DTG-associated developmental neurotoxicity (prenatal and postnatal), particularly in
babies born without structural, brain or spinal cord, malformations, remains unknown. Moreover, therapeutic
measures to enhance the DTG use for safer medication during pregnancy are infancy. Our preliminary data:
DTG was found to be a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs. The drug was found to bind Zn++ at the catalytic
domain, leading to inhibition of MMPs activities. Moreover, studies in pregnant mice showed that DTG can cross
the placental barrier, accumulate in the fetal CNS and inhibit MMPs activity during the critical period of brain
development. Further postnatal evaluation of brain health in mice pups following in utero DTG exposures
identified neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and behavioral deficits. These data demonstrated an association
between DTG dysregulation of MMPs activities during gestation and consequent neurotoxicity. Hypothesis:
We posit that DTG inhibition of MMPs activities impairs pre- and post-natal neurodevelopment and offered long-
acting approaches will serve to improve drug’s therapeutic benefits during pregnancy. Research Strategy: (1)
Determine longitudinal dose-dependent effect of DTG on MMPs activity and/or expression in brain of embryos
and early age postnatal pups and identify impact of such inhibitions in MMPs activity on neuronal development.
(2) Investigate postnatal neurobehavioral outcomes that occurs across mouse development from adolescence
to young age following gestational DTG exposure. (3) Utilize long-acting poloxamer-based DTG
nanoformulations to provide potential delivery means to attenuate drug-associated neurotoxicity. (4) Establish
scientific exchange with clinical study to establish clinical relevance. Outcome: Successful outcome of the
proposal will significantly advance the basic and clinical research fields in understanding the theory of DTG
inhibition of MMPs activities as the underlying mechanism for DTG-associated developmental neurotoxicity,
impaired neurobehavioral outcomes, and provide long-acting poloxamer-encapsulated DTG nanoformulations
as potential delivery means to improve the safety and therapeutic profile of DTG during pregnancy."

This Renewal Application for NRSA T32 MH20031 seeks to continue a highly successful Pre- and Post-
Doctoral Fellowship Training Program (established in 1999) in HIV prevention research at Yale University's
Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA). Over the past 24 years we have successfully trained
Post-Doctoral and Pre-Doctoral Fellows on HIV-related content knowledge, research skills, and professional
growth and networking, and they have demonstrated tremendous productivity. The Yale AIDS Prevention
Training Program (Y-APT) is housed at CIRA and within the Yale School of Public Health at Yale University.
The integration with CIRA and Yale provides an exceptional training environment that continues to keep step
with the changing HIV/AIDS pandemic. Our training program is unique in providing the following combination of
perspectives: a focus on the latest in HIV prevention content knowledge including the four pillars of the Ending
the Epidemic initiative (diagnose, treat, prevent, respond), mechanisms across the ecological model related to
HIV equity (e.g., structural determinants, social and cultural determinants, neighborhoods,
stigma/discrimination), and marginalized identities that have been linked to increased burden for HIV. Y-APT
provides a strong foundation of training that emphasizes methodological skills and rigor in both quantitative
and qualitatative analyses; opportunities to conduct ethically sound, community based health equity research;
the latest in digital health research; and implementation science skills and methods to support the design and
evaluation of interventions that are tailored to local contexts and study populations. We are requesting support
for 4 Pre-Doctoral and 5 Post-Doctoral slots per year. The focus of both the Pre- and Post-Doctoral Fellowship
is “hands on” conduct of research, analysis, paper and grant writing using a tiered mentoring approach. All of
our fellows are required to participate in a weekly seminar series. In additon, the Pre-Doctoral training also
includes: formal course work, research preceptorship, seminars, outside courses and meetings, qualifying
examinations, and dissertation research. Our approach to training future scientists for careers in HIV
prevention research will emphasize flexibility and individual tailoring of Fellows' research preceptorships, while
recognizing the importance of core training in HIV content, research skills, and professional networking. Over
the past 24 years we have successfully trained, and continue to train, 95 Fellows from a variety of disciplines.
Fellows are both exposed to, and actively collaborate in, a wide array of studies and career trajectories, with an
unprecedented opportunity to publish their own research. We are, therefore, confident in our ability to prepare
both Pre- and Post-Doctoral Fellows with the strongest foundation of knowledge, skills, and experience to
achieve and sustain careers as scientific investigators, contributing to advances in HIV prevention, specifically,
and health equity, in general."

NUCATS to pivot and focus on clinical and translational science (CTS). This proposal addresses three of the
most urgent and fundamental priorities to accelerate and catalyze translation: (a) cultivating a culture of
inclusive excellence to better capitalize on our full range of talent and enable effective translation for diverse
populations; (b) accelerating discovery and development of innovations in interventions and processes to
improve efficiency of translation; and (c) infusing implementation science (IS) methods into work across the
translational continuum to increase the demand for and supply of effective health services to improve public
health. NUCATS will develop, evaluate, and disseminate more effective health interventions to more patients
more quickly through teamwork with our exceptional coalition of community, health system, and CTSA partners
via three Specific Aims: INCLUDE, INNOVATE, and IMPLEMENT. For our INCLUDE Aim, we will work to
cultivate a culture of inclusive excellence as we expand our workforce, partnerships, and research participants,
including those historically underrepresented in biomedical science, to optimize the beneficial impacts of
translation on the health of all. For our INNOVATE Aim, we will catalyze innovation across all stages of the
translational continuum to promote entrepreneurship as well as the rigor and reproducibility of translational
research. For our IMPLEMENT Aim, we will infuse implementation science methods into clinical research
across the translational continuum to accelerate public health impact. Each Specific Aim will be attained via a
set of Strategies, which in turn consist of a set of Initiatives. Pursuit of the Specific Aims will be overseen by a
highly interactive Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) team ideally suited to provide strong oversight of the
Specific Aims, with each MPI having primary oversight of one aim. The MPIs will tightly coordinate a team-
based leadership structure emphasizing integration across hub and application components, supported by
Advisory Committees. This proposal is further enabled by our renowned evaluation infrastructure, our
longstanding leadership in open science principles (including Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
(FAIR) data) and our track record of leadership across the CTSA consortium. By the end of the proposed UM1,
NUCATS will become a national champion and consortium resource for transdisciplinary research teams
seeking to continuously improve CTS performance to more efficiently deliver inclusive, innovative, and
implementable solutions that improve health for all."

Ting Therapeutics LLC is a pharmaceutical company developing drugs to prevent and treat hearing loss.
Aminoglycosides are one of the most widely used drugs to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections. However,
aminoglycoside therapy causes hearing loss in 40-60% of the patients. To date, no drugs have been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for protection from aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss (AGIHL). Most
candidate compounds currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and
glutathione metabolism, such as ebselen or N-acetylcysteine. We have performed high throughput screens for
otoprotectants against AGIHL in zebrafish and identified TT003, known as piperlongumine, a natural product
extracted from the pepper Piper Longum. TT003 attenuates hearing loss in adult mice treated with kanamycin
(700 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days) when delivered intraperitoneally (IP) at 40 mg/kg/day for 17 consecutive
days. Interestingly, TT003 seems to be protective against excitotoxicity in a zebrafish model that mimics
glutamate overexposure. In this SBIR Phase II, we will perform Investigational New Drug-enabling experiments
to test TT003’s effect on aminoglycoside’s bacteria killing efficacy in vivo and to conduct efficacy studies to define
an optimal dosing regimen and therapeutic index in an animal model that mimic the pathophysiological
environment of patients with Gram-negative bacterial infections. The long-term goal is for TT003 to become a
standard otoprotective drug of aminoglycoside-based therapies. For this purpose, we will identify TT003’s no-
observed adverse effect level and demonstrate TT003’s efficacy in a mouse model of inflammation that mimics
the physiological environment of cystic fibrosis patients (Aim 1). We will determine pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics profiles in blood and perilymph, as well as efficacy, in a guinea pig model for aminoglycoside-
induced hearing loss (Aim 2). This Aim will be performed under contract with an independent and reputable
Contract Research Organization, Turner Scientific LLC. Finally, we will test drug-drug interactions in vivo to verify
that TT003 does not interfere with aminoglycoside’s anti-bacterial activity in mouse model for acute
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections (Aim 3). By successfully completing these studies, Ting Therapeutics will
obtain critical data necessary for the initiation of Investigational New Drug enabling complaint preclinical studies
and subsequent clinical trials. Ting Therapeutics has filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) for both the US
and international rights. The completion of this proposal will allow Ting Therapeutics to initiate conversations
with pharmaceutical companies and venture investments for the commercialization of TT003."

Background: South Africa has one of the largest rates of migration on the African continent, largely comprised
of migrant men, who are at high risk of HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at
preventing HIV. Migrant men face barriers to PrEP use, including lack of PrEP knowledge, stigma at clinics,
and unfamiliarity about health services in new settings. To decrease the incidence of HIV in South Africa,
interventions are needed to promote PrEP use among migrant men in South Africa. The goal of this proposal is
to develop and pilot test a “Healthy Welcome” intervention to support migrant men in starting and adhering to
PrEP by linking them to community pharmacies. Candidate: I am an Internal Medicine physician and an
Associate Scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Harvard Medical School). I am applying for a five-year
K23 Career Development Award to obtain the training and research experience that will allow me to become
an independent investigator at the R01 level and an expert in developing interventions to promote engagement
in HIV services among migrant populations globally. Mentoring: Drs. Ingrid Katz and Jessica Haberer will
serve as my co-primary mentors. Dr. Katz brings expertise in behavioral components of intervention
development and strategies to track hard-to-reach populations in South Africa. Dr. Haberer brings expertise in
PrEP clinical trials, including implementation science, the concept of “Prevention-Effective” (P-E) adherence to
PrEP, and mobile health strategies. Co-mentor Prof. Terris-Prestholt will provide mentorship on discrete choice
experiment (DCE) methodology. Profs. Pascoe and Setswe, South Africa-based co-mentors, will provide
mentorship on local application of DCE methods and behavioral economics (BE) strategies for intervention
development (Pascoe) and community engagement and local implementation (Setswe). Profs. Miot and
Venter, South-Africa based members of my Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), will offer guidance on integrating
my proposed study within an existing Gates-funded project to offer PrEP through community pharmacies in
South Africa and on policy implications of study findings. SAB member Prof. Lurie will offer guidance on
engaging migrant men. SAB member Prof. Thirumurthy will guide me on BE theoretical frameworks. SAB
member Smeaton will provide statistical expertise to guide the pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Training: Training in DCE methodology, BE strategies, and pilot RCTs for PrEP will be achieved through
intensive direct mentorship and coursework. Research: The specific aims are to 1) elicit preferences for PrEP
services among migrant men through a DCE; 2) design a “Healthy Welcome” intervention for migrant men to
promote linkage to pharmacies for PrEP uptake and adherence; and 3) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
appropriateness, and fidelity of the intervention through a pilot RCT. I will use this formative research to apply
for an R01-level grant to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention."

The global epidemic of HIV continues to pose a major world health threat with more than 1.5 million new
infections diagnosed in 2021. Although significant efforts have been underway for more than 30 years to
develop a vaccine to prevent HIV infection, to date, only one trial has shown any significant efficacy at infection
prevention. A recent study showed that monocyte gene enrichment correlated with the antibody dependent Fc
effector functions thought to be the reason for this vaccine’s efficacy. Monocytes are highly versatile cells that
regulate immune response through direct and indirect ways through secretion of cytokines. Monocytes are
recognized for their ability to contribute to vaccine efficacy across multiple vaccines, including malaria,
influenza and BCG. We hypothesize that monocyte subpopulations play a critical role in regulating
development HIV vaccine elicited antibody response through innate help and that, once characterized, can be
harnessed to improve vaccine efficacy. We will investigate this by two aims. Aim 1 will evaluate changes in
monocyte gene expression following infection, auto-immune disease and vaccination using publicly available
data and validate in healthy subjects an. Aim 2 will specifically identify monocyte sub-type specific signatures
associated with antibody response after HIV vaccination from four recent HVTN trials using CITE-seq and a
novel discrete-state mathematical algorithm with in vitro validation. Dr. Keefer and Dr. Thakar are the ideal
mentors for this project given their expertise in HIV vaccine research and systems biology. Through this
project, I will develop my computational and translational research and build a foundation from which I can
transition to independence as a physician scientist."

exaggerated. For example, social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent mental disorders,
affecting 12.1% of the U.S. population at some point in their lifetime, resulting in serious impairment and a
poorer quality of life. Yet, individuals with SAD often wait more than a decade before seeking treatment, if
they ever do seek care, given that social avoidance is a core feature of social anxiety. This makes seeking
in-person services very difficult, so there is a crucial need for scalable, accessible treatments that are
delivered outside of therapy and can be integrated into daily life. Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions
(JITAIs) delivered via smartphones represent a promising method to not only increase access to cost-
effective and acceptable mental health care, but also to tailor in-the-moment interventions to best match
the specific context of the individual and their personal stressors and determine when the individual is most
likely to benefit from the intervention. This work leverages mobile sensing to detect indicators of temporal
phases of social anxiety and personal context to optimize treatment. This project proposes the Context-
Aware Micro-Interventions for Social Anxiety (CAMSA) system, targeted at understanding relevant contexts
of social anxiety and delivering personalized interventions to reduce symptoms. This 3-phase project will
overcome fundamental barriers to continuous and accessible treatment. First, the CAMSA system will be
developed, consisting of sensor-rich smartphones and smartwatches that will collect data on relevant
features (e.g., type of anxiety, social context, physiological state) that identify an individual's state anxiety
context, along with user-centered design of personalized micro-interventions for social anxiety. Second, the
CAMSA system will be deployed to socially anxious individuals to identify biomarkers of state anxiety at
different temporal phases and optimize features to personalize the content and timing of the intervention
delivery. Third, a proof-of-concept for CAMSA will be demonstrated through a pilot study, with anxious
participants receiving JITAIs."
10925247,"Pancreatic cancer is a deadly malignancy, direly in need of new therapeutic approaches. Pancreatic cancer is
characterized by extensive accumulation of a fibroinflammatory stroma, containing abundant fibroblasts. Long
believed to be a uniform cell population, fibroblasts have emerged as a heterogeneous and functionally important
component of the tumor. Yet, the literature on fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer is controversial, with studies
supporting both a pro- and an anti-tumor role. Our preliminary data show that oncogenic KRAS, a hallmark
mutation of pancreatic cancer, expressed in tumor cells extrinsically reprograms the transcriptional program of
fibroblasts. Further, continuous expression of epithelial oncogenic Kras is required to maintain expression of a
panel of inflammatory cytokines in fibroblasts. Unlike mouse tumors, human pancreatic cancer is highly
heterogeneous in terms of genetic alterations and histological characteristics of cancer cells. How fibroblasts are
reprogrammed in the context of different types of human pancreatic cancer and how they contribute to
carcinogenesis is unclear. Lastly, most in depth studies on pancreatic cancer are based on largely White patient
populations, while the disease is equally prevalent in all race groups. The University of Michigan/Henry Ford
Health System team together has access to a large patient volume, diverse patient populations (with 30% HFHS
patients being African American), and the skillset to characterize and functionally assess fibroblasts on
pancreatic cancer. We will map fibroblast heterogeneity across tumors in a diverse patient population. We will
evaluate whether fibroblast heterogeneity correlates with different subtypes of tumor cells (classified as classical
and mesenchymal). We will further take advantage of the genetically engineered mouse models available in our
group to target fibroblast reprogramming at different stages of carcinogenesis. Overall, our work will shed light
on the regulation and function of pancreatic CAFs and open the way for new therapeutic approaches targeting
this population."

 In adults and older children, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for diagnosis and
management of retinal diseases and systemic disease effects. Most clinical OCT systems are large, tabletop
devices that require a compliant subject, capable of positioning in a chin rest and fixating on a target. This
typically excludes infants, young children and patients who are unable to cooperate, from OCT imaging. These
patients have one of the greatest needs for OCT imaging due to their inability to communicate about disturbance
or loss of vision before critical stages of disease development or irrecoverable vision loss occurs. One group in
particular are infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) who make up 1.4% of the newborn population.
The use of handheld OCT (HH-OCT) systems for point of care imaging has led to significant insights into the
development of ROP. However, the clinical adoption of HH-OCT has been limited due to the slow speed, size,
and weight of current commercial HH-OCT systems and their limited field of view. While the 40° FOV of most
handheld systems is useful for macular imaging, it is insufficient for imaging of the peripheral retina where many
pediatric retinal diseases, especially ROP, occur. The overall premise of this proposal is that the development of
a highspeed, lightweight, widefield, handheld OCT system will significantly improve the diagnostic utility of HH-
OCT for assessment of retinal diseases including those involving the peripheral retina, such as ROP, in I/YC/UC
patients. This development will ultimately improve access to care for these patients and reduce the cost of care
for these patients.
 Under NIH SBIR Phase I support (R43-EY033604) Theia Imaging developed the T1-W (widefield) system, a
light weight, high speed, contact HH-OCT system with a 110° FOV. The system operates at 300 kHz (9x faster
than any commercial handheld), its handpiece weighs 325g, and does not require mydriasis for imaging. Imaging
of an adult volunteer shows that the system provides excellent visualization of retinal structures in both the
macula and the periphery and en-face projections of retinal vessels demonstrate the ability of the system to
image most of zone II in a single acquisition. Under ongoing NIH support (R44-EY032394), Theia is developing
and pursuing regulatory clearance for 300 kHz non-contact OCT system. Instead of developing, pursuing
regulatory clearance for, and marketing a separate widefield device with the proposed modifications, we
will merge the non-contact and widefield systems into the T2-platform. The T2-platform costs of the T2-
core, a 300 kHz OCT engine with a modular scan head that accepts a variety of OCT lens bores including non-
contact and widefield bores. We believe that the flexibility and cost reduction provided by a modular
platform will dramatically improve access to OCT imaging for I/YC/UC patients, as one device can
provide imaging for the wide variety of pathologies that affect this underserved patient population."

Otitis Media (OM), commonly referred to as an ear infection, is the most common reason for antibiotics use in
children under 6 years of age. OM is also the second-most common cause of hearing loss globally, impacting
1.4 billion individuals in 2017 and currently ranked as the fifth highest disease burden. Otitis media with
effusion (OME) is a condition characterized by the presence of fluid behind the eardrum, often causing hearing
difficulties, while acute otitis media (AOM) refers to a sudden and painful infection of the middle ear, commonly
associated with fever and earache. Perforated eardrum and tympanosclerosis can result from untreated OM,
and these conditions can lead to hearing loss and other complications when left untreated. To prevent
unnecessary and harmful delays to OM diagnosis and management, there is a significant need for widespread,
affordable, and convenient access to otolaryngology specialists. OM is an ideal candidate for real-time
telemedicine visits due to its defined symptoms and visual diagnosis that can be accomplished with
straightforward data points and imaging. However, no platform currently exists to facilitate effective virtual visits
for ear infections. The overall goal of this Phase II project is to further develop and validate Remmie.ai, a next-
generation ear-nose-throat (ENT) mobile health platform, as an innovative telemedicine solution for accurate
and efficient diagnosis of OM. The three aims outlined in this proposal converge to empower Remmie.ai as a
transformative force in healthcare. Aim 1 leverages extensive image and data collection efforts to further refine
Remmie.ai models, enabling precise classification of OM. Aim 2 orchestrates real-world clinical testing to
validate Remmie.ai's effectiveness, assessing its impact on diagnoses and patient care in both in-person and
telemedicine settings. Finally, Aim 3 charts a path towards FDA designation by fortifying the platform's
infrastructure for data privacy and security, ensuring regulatory compliance, and refining the user-friendly
Remmie App. Together, these aims harmonize data-driven AI enhancements, clinical validation, and regulatory
groundwork, propelling Remmie.ai towards its overarching goal of democratizing access to otolaryngology
expertise and improving the diagnosis and management of ENT conditions while safeguarding patient privacy
and adhering to regulatory standards."
10918268,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Description)
Optical detection of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is a promising non-invasive method to monitor
brain injury in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), but its neuropathological correlates remain partially understood.
In this project, we will use photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) to measure CMRO2 in a murine model of HI to test
whether HI causes an overshoot of CMRO2 due to uncoupling of the mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) upon reperfusion/reoxygenation, whether a secondary decline of CMRO2 signifies cerebral energy
failure and irreversible brain damage after HI, and whether hypothermia with or without antioxidants interrupts
this pathological mechanism. This project has three specific aims.
Aim 1: To test whether post-HI overshoot of CMRO2 correlates with uncoupling of the mitochondrial OXPHOS.
We will compare the changes of CMRO2, mitochondrial respirations, and cerebral energy after the HI insult in
mouse neonates.
Aim 2: To test if CMRO2 predicts the outcomes and benefits of hypothermia treatment against neonatal HI. We
will compare the changes of CMRO2 and blood levels of three candidate biomarkers (osteopontin/OPN, S100b,
UCH-L1) in HI-injured mouse neonates with and without hypothermia treatment.
Aim 3: To test whether HIF1a and antioxidants attenuates the post-HI overshoot of CMRO2 and brain damage.
We will test the effects of MitoSNO, Edaravone, and GSK360A (a HIF1a-stablizer) either as a stand-alone or
adjuvant treatment to hypothermia against neonatal HI brain injury.
Successful completion of this project will shed insights into the mechanisms and prognostic value of CMRO2 in
neonatal HI brain injury. This new knowledge may lead to better clinical managements in neonatology."

Dr. Olachi Mezu-Ndubuisi is a neonatologist with a background training as an optometrist, now an Assistant
Professor of Pediatrics with an affiliate appointment in the Department of Ophthalmology at University of
Wisconsin (UW). She combines these experiences in her research studying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).
ROP is a bi-phasic disease of abnormal retinal vascularization in premature infants, characterized by
dysregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ROP has no cure, and existing therapies have
adverse systemic effects and long-term deficits. Dr. Mezu-Ndubuisi developed a non-invasive method of
visualizing retinal blood vessels in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) using fluorescein
angiography. She correlated in vivo retinal vascular changes (arterial tortuosity, venous dilation, and capillary
vascularity) to structure and function, and performed histological studies to show unique long-term features of
OIR mice, such as prolonged cellular apoptosis, glial activation, and ectopic formation of synapses. Having
defined the in vivo and histologic OIR phenotypes, she seeks to use molecular techniques to enhance
understanding of VEGF regulation in ROP in order to develop safe and effective therapies. In her preliminary
studies, there was a 6-fold increase in total mouse Vegfa164 levels at post-natal day (P) 13, early in Phase 2
ROP, in OIR mice compared to RA mice, and Vegfa164b showed a 1.3-fold higher trend in OIR than RA mice at
P10 (peak of retinal vaso-obliteration during hyperoxia). This suggests that an imbalance of VEGF isoforms
occurs in ROP. She then administered the pro-angiogenic isoform of VEGF-A165, VEGF-A165a, in sustained
release microparticles which resulted in earlier retinal revascularization with improved arterial tortuosity and vein
dilation. She next compared topical calcitriol (active form of vitamin D) eyedrop to intraperitoneal (IP) calcitriol
and both inhibited retinal angiogenesis later in Phase 2 ROP, but topical calcitriol did not cause growth restriction
like IP calcitriol. Dr. Mezu-Ndubuisi hypothesizes that using intravitreal VEGF-A165a early in Phase 2 and topical
calcitriol later in Phase 2, would rescue the abnormal OIR in vivo and histologic phenotypes. In this K08, Dr.
Mezu-Ndubuisi will determine the most effective and least toxic dose of intravitreal VEGF microparticles or free
intravitreal VEGF protein and topical calcitriol in Phase 2 ROP (Aim 1), and then study the molecular mechanisms
by which VEGF-A165a and calcitriol regulate angiogenic signaling in ROP (Aim 2). UW provides an excellent
academic environment, state-of-the-art facilities, and academic resources dedicated to Dr. Mezu-Ndubuisi’s
success. She has strong intra-mural and extra-mural mentoring from well-established NIH investigators and
experts in ROP, molecular genetics, angiogenesis, and Vitamin D. Dr. Mezu-Ndubuisi’s career goals and
objectives include a detailed training plan to increase her knowledge in biostatistics, biochemistry,
histopathology, molecular signaling, and research ethics and laboratory skills. This will enable her successful
transition to research independence and clinical translation of her research."
10918104,"Project summary/Abstract
The rewarding bonds we forge in adulthood, in particular our pair bonds with romantic partners, have innumerable
protective effects on our brains and behaviors. Individuals with difficulties in social engagement and competence, such
as those suffering from social anxiety, major depression, ADHD, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, are particularly
susceptible to the health risks of social isolation and impoverished social networks. Aberrant activity of dopaminergic
reward systems during adolescence coincides with the onset of many of these disorders, suggesting that developmental
abnormalities in the neural substrates that promote social reward underlies disease pathology. Critically, most of what
we know about the neural mechanisms that facilitate pair bonding come from the study of adult brains, highlighting a
dire need to investigate the functional development of social bonding circuits to design better therapeutic treatments
for social dysfunctions. The current proposal aims to leverage the socially monogamous prairie vole system to
investigate the maturational changes in dopaminergic reward circuitry that initiate the capacity for pair bonding in
adulthood. Prairie voles form strong pair bonds with their mates, which relies on the functional activity of dopamine
systems. In Aim 1, I will use fiber photometry to ask how developmental age and sex mediates socially induced changes
in in vivo dopaminergic neural activity. In Aim 2, I will use chemogenetic approaches to investigate how perturbing
dopamine circuits during sensitive developmental periods impacts adult pair bonding phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3 I will
investigate the developmental changes in transcriptional signatures of same‐sex and opposite‐sex social interactions as
prairie voles mature and become capable of dopamine‐dependent pair bonding. Altogether, these efforts will determine
how social experiences across developmental time scaffold the maturation of pair bonding dopamine circuits. These
findings will profer novel insights into the molecular and cellular processes that may be disrupted in neuropsychiatric
illnesses involving impaired bonding behaviors, which cannot be investigated in traditional non‐bonding rodent models."

Dental caries is a prevalent but preventable oral disease. In caries-active subjects, there is a shift towards a
microbial community dominated by acidogenic and acid-tolerant bacteria. Streptococcus mutans is a major
cariogenic pathogen. Commensal bacteria normally help to control S. mutans via bioactive products such as
H2O2. However, high-sugar consumption, which is frequently found in populations with a high rate of caries
development, could inhibit the generation of H2O2 through carbohydrate catabolite repression and thereby
disrupt homeostasis. Several metal titanates have recently emerged as effective green chemistry solutions to
produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2, O2˙–, ˙OH, and 1O2. They trigger oxidation stress in
certain bacteria and subsequently inhibit them. Metal titanates have the potential for broad dental applications
due to high compatibility with various dental materials, including dental adhesive systems, resin composites,
ceramics, and metals. Furthermore, as photocatalysts, metal titanates will not be consumed in the catalyzed
reaction but can act continuously, thus offering long-lasting benefits. Our group has demonstrated that gold
titanate could catalyze and produce H2O2, which could inactivate S. mutans while having limited impact on
commensal oral bacterial S. gordonii and S. sanguinis. It is hypothesized that selective photoactivated
semiconducting metal-titanates will produce extrinsic H2O2 from O2 reduction and other ROS to inhibit S.
mutans, while giving an advantage to commensal bacteria and thereby maintain homeostasis in dental biofilms
and thus prevent dental caries. To test our hypothesis, Aim 1 will optimize the application conditions of metal
titanates to maximize the potentials of the antibacterial efficacy. We will measure different species of ROS
production from gold titanate with in situ probe compounds. Then, we will synthesize semiconducting metal
titanates to enhance the photocatalytic activities (i.e., activation by visible light, more ROS generation) and
improve clinical performances (e.g., esthetics, compatibility, physical property, stability, and toxicity). Aim 2 will
identify the gene expressions of S. mutans and commensals exposed to metal titanates. The transcriptional
profiles of S. mutans with metal titanates will be revealed by mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and the oxidative
stress relevant genes will be specifically monitored. Aim 3 will focus on diverse multi-species oral biofilms,
especially in high sugar condition. First, we will examine the effect of metal titanates on the spatial organization
and composition of the dual-species biofilms of S. mutans and commensal bacteria in flow cell system. Second,
we will apply plaque-derived multispecies microbial biofilms and S. mutans-infected multispecies oral microbial
community to understand the response of species within complex oral biofilms to metal titanates in the oral
cavity, for which 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be employed to measure the composition shift. Collectively,
the study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of metal titanates on the formation and
ecology of dental biofilms and guide the development of an effective dental application."

Immunotherapy has shown great promise to cure cancers, especially with the success of checkpoint blockades
and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, but its utility is still limited by low patient response rate,
poor efficacy against many solid tumors, and/or severe side effects. These issues motivate the development of
new immunotherapy that can elicit potent and persistent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses and minimize
off-target toxicity. Targeted modulation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), a subset of DCs superior
in antigen cross-presentation, in lymph nodes will enable optimal activation of CTL responses and result in robust
immunotherapy, but has not been achieved so far. The primary goal of this project is to develop a macroscale
materials-based system that integrates immune cell-homing macroporous materials with metabolic glycan
labeling to achieve cDC1 recruitment, labeling, and targeting in vivo. With this material system, we aim to develop
an unprecedented technology for targeted conjugation of immunomodulatory agents, including antigens,
adjuvants, and cytokines, to cDC1s in lymph nodes, and further develop potent and safe cancer immunotherapy.
To achieve this, an injectable macroporous biomaterial loaded with cDC1-recruiting chemokines and azido-
sugars will be used to recruit and metabolically label cDC1s with chemical tags (e.g., azido group) in situ. These
chemically tagged cDC1s can migrate from the biomaterial to lymph nodes for subsequent targeted conjugation
of immunomodulatory agents via efficient and bioorthogonal click chemistry. Experiments will be organized
around three aims. In Aim 1, injectable pore-forming alginate gels with independently tunable pore size, stiffness,
viscosity, and chemokine release kinetics will be developed, and the impact of each parameter on the immune
cell recruitment profile will be elucidated, in order to rationally design macroporous materials that can
preferentially recruit and metabolically label cDC1s with azido groups in situ. In Aim 2, targeted delivery of tumor
neoantigens and adjuvants or liposomal vaccines to azido-labeled cDC1s in lymph nodes via click chemistry will
be explored, with a goal of improving neoantigen-specific CTL responses and the overall antitumor efficacy
against poorly-immunogenic solid tumors. In Aim 3, targeted conjugation and surface display of
immunomodulatory agents on cDC1s in lymph nodes will be explored to regulate cDC1-T cell interactions and
amplify CTL responses. We hypothesize that cytokines, once conjugated, can be retained on cDC1 surface for
hours to provide continuous stimulation to effector T cells during the T cell priming process. The completion of
this project will lead to new immunotherapies with robust antitumor efficacy against solid tumors and reduced
off-target side effects. Further, the cDC1 recruitment, labeling and targeting technology will also be promising for
future development of therapies against autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases."

Genetic discovery for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lags behind that in other areas of medicine, where the
identification of mutations responsible for familial forms of major disorders has yielded extraordinary biological
insights. However, recent successes in gene identification from both rare and common variant analyses indicate
what the field needs to do to catch up: expand the size, diversity and scope of genetic studies. Indeed, NIMH
recognized this need, issuing PAR-20-027, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in Ancestrally Diverse
Populations.” In response to this call, we will create the Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness
Association Studies (PUMAS) Project, an international collaboration of investigators from the US, South America
and Africa with the strongest track record of large-scale psychiatric genetic research in Latino and African
populations, along with several of the field’s leaders in genetic data generation and analysis. PUMAS will be well
powered to discover new genes for schizophrenia and bipolar; it will dramatically increase the diversity of genetic
discovery efforts, an important step towards reducing health disparities; and it will expand the scope of psychiatric
genomics by generating low-pass whole genome sequencing for 120,000 samples (which we will analyze
together with 22,500 samples already sequenced by our team). Through these efforts we will also discover
similarities and differences in genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and
environments. The Aims of the PUMAS project are to: 1) Build the PUMAS sample bank of schizophrenia cases,
bipolar cases and controls from Africa and from admixed populations in the Americas, achieving a total sample
of 183,500 (88,600 cases and 94,900 matched population controls) by recruiting 17,000 new cases and 16,500
controls. 2) Generate low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and variant calls on 40,000 cases of
schizophrenia, 40,000 cases of bipolar disorder and 40,000 matched controls from African, Native American and
admixed ancestries b) perform extensive sample and variant quality control. 3) a) Systematically analyze the
combined dataset to power discovery of the genetic basis of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries
and down the allele frequency spectrum; and b) through portals and browsers, share the data and results of the
genetic studies with the world. The PUMAS 120,000 sample WGS dataset, together with data for 22,500
previously sequenced admixed (AA+EA) samples, provides sufficient statistical power for genetic discovery for
SZ, BP, and combined across diverse ancestries. Our study will identify new genes and loci, increase the
precision of fine-mapping of known loci, and form the foundational knowledge base for polygenic risk scores
(PRS) of global value."
10918108,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organ-preserving therapy is the standard curative approach for numerous types of solid tumors. For patients
with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), bladder removal (radical cystectomy) and bladder-preserving
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) are the two curative treatment approaches supported by long-term safety and efficacy
data; however, these two approaches have never been compared in a randomized trial. Therefore, the decision
between approaches is currently made based solely on clinical-pathologic features and patient/provider
preference. There are currently no molecular biomarkers available to inform the decision between radical
cystectomy and bladder-sparing CRT. Our previous work identified a subset of ~15% of MIBCs with somatic
alterations in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene ERCC2. The NER pathway is a highly conserved DNA
repair pathway that repairs bulky DNA adducts caused by genotoxins such as UV irradiation and platinum drugs.
We showed that MIBC patients with ERCC2-mutant tumors have improved response to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy compared to MIBC patients with wild-type (WT) ERCC2 tumors, and our functional work
demonstrated that clinically observed ERCC2 mutations were unable to support normal cellular NER and were
sufficient to confer increased cisplatin sensitivity in preclinical bladder cancer models. However, the impact of
ERCC2 mutations on response to clinical CRT regimens is unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal
is that NER deficiency conferred by ERCC2 mutations define a subset of bladder tumors with unique biological
properties and therapeutic vulnerabilities, including increased sensitivity to clinically relevant CRT regimens. The
goal of work proposed here is to dissect the cellular mechanisms that contribute to the unique properties of NER
deficient tumors and to define the impact of NER deficiency on CRT response. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
association between mutations in ERCC2 and other NER pathway genes and clinical outcomes in a cohort of
240 MIBC patients treated with CRT on completed cooperative group trials. We will functionally interrogate the
impact of observed NER gene alterations in bladder cancer models and we will compare the activity of commonly
used CRT regimens in isogenic NER-proficient/deficient human bladder cancer preclinical models. In Aim 2, we
will define the impact of NER deficiency on immune cell subsets in the bladder tumor microenvironment in two
isogenic NER-proficient/deficient mouse bladder cancer models and we will investigate the contribution of CD8+
T cells to CRT response in the NER-proficient and NER-deficient models. We will also perform transcriptional
profiling of 190 clinical MIBC cases and will investigate the relationship among ERCC2 mutation status,
transcriptional signatures of immune infiltration, and clinical outcomes. In Aim 3, we will investigate CHK1
inhibition as a strategy to induce NER deficiency and increase sensitivity to cisplatin-based treatments in bladder
tumors with WT ERCC2. Together, these integrated genomic and functional studies will define the impact of
NER deficiency as a biomarker and therapeutic target in bladder-sparing treatment approaches for MIBC."
10918285,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
Genotoxic agents, including radiation therapy (RT) and cisplatin (CDDP), are treatments that damage cellular
DNA. RT and CDDP are the current standard of care in multiple solid tumors, including HNSCC. CDDP is the
most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in HNSCC proving superior to novel targeted agents in recent
large randomized trials. Despite this, high rates of treatment failure persist in patients who develop resistance
following this toxic chemotherapy. Treatment failure is uniformly fatal. However, no robust predictors of
acquired cisplatin resistance or tumor response exist. Given this critical unmet need, we have focused our efforts
on the assessment of tumor response using minimally invasive quantitative imaging (hyperpolarized magnetic
resonance imaging; HP-MRI) while patients are undergoing therapy. We showed that CDDP and other genotoxic
agents trigger measurable fluctuations in tumor cell metabolism detectable through HP-MRI with [1-13C]-pyruvate
in real time (confirmed by conventional biochemical assays). Genotoxic stress suppresses the apparent rate of
pyruvate conversion into lactate (kPL) via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a manner that correlates with anti-
tumor effectiveness. We therefore hypothesize that changes in kPL provide unique insight into metabolic
changes induced by cisplatin that can be used to optimize response to therapy in HNSCC.
 In Aim 1, we will characterize baseline HP-MRI parameters such as kPL across the spectrum of HNSCC
subtypes and validate the relationship between CDDP and associated shifts in carbon flux. We will also identify
metabolomic differences in HNSCC models that affect baseline values of metabolic imaging biomarkers and
modulate apparent changes induced by cisplatin. In Aim 2, we will integrate the dose-response data from Aim 1
to develop a predictive model of response to CDDP based on metabolic imaging parameters. We will use a
simple algorithm to adjust therapeutic dose based on HP-MRI data in animal models of HNSCC to maximize
tumor growth delay, and test whether thresholds suggestive of strong response can be used to select the more
effective treatment regimen when multiple regimens are tested in parallel. In Aim 3, we will conduct a first-in-
human evaluation of changes in HP-MRI to detect shifts in carbon flux following CDDP in HNSCC patients. We
will correlate changes in metabolic imaging parameters with the baseline metabolic phenotype of tumors as
determined from metabolomic analysis and direct measurements of tumor LDH. Successful completion of this
study will establish HP-MRI as a non-invasive imaging modality able to predict response to treatment,
which will be a noteworthy first step towards a precision oncology approach that we have been seeking for nearly
half a century. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing
and applying fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human illness and addresses directly
the recently published “Notice of Special Interest: Precision Imaging of Oral Lesions” (NOT-DE-21-010)."

Studying tumors in a spatial context will advance our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity and how the
complex interactions between cancer and surrounding non-cancer cells results in the growth of malignant
subclones, which promises to address outstanding questions in cancer biology and improve the diagnosis and
treatment of specific cancer subtypes. In both basic and translational cancer studies, the majority of biopsies
are preserved in the format of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, and a growing
number of FFPE specimens are newly archived every year. Accordingly, spatial omics profiling in archived
FFPE tissue can be invaluable for cancer research and potential novel biomarker or molecular regulators
discovery. In this project, we propose to develop a first-of-its-kind technology for spatially resolved co-mapping
of epigenome, transcriptome, and proteins in FFPE tissues at the cell level. Specifically, we will (Aim 1) develop
spatial epigenome sequencing to measure not only gene expression but also epigenetic underpinning of cell
type and state directly in FFPE tissues, (Aim 2) develop a novel deterministic barcoding strategy for joint
profiling of accessible chromatin or histone modifications, mRNAs, and proteins in the same FFPE tissue
section. This novel technology addresses the lack of capability for spatial multi-omics that can be integrated,
scaled, and applied to FFPE tissue mapping. As FFPE samples are widely available and represent the most
abundant format of archivable clinical tumor tissue samples, we envision that this work will open up new
opportunities to revisit the huge resource of clinical tissue banks to study the mechanisms of pathophysiology
and to discover new targets for diagnosis and treatment of human diseases."

More than 42% of adults in the United States live with obesity, a condition characterized by excess body fat
primarily within adipose tissue. Obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer,
and severe COVID-19 disease and has few widely effective non-surgical interventions. Obesity comorbidities
are believed to be triggered by chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, in part caused by infiltration of
macrophage cells (MΦs) with adipogenic phenotypes in the obese state. However, the pathogenic role of MΦs
is complicated by their diverse and antagonistic roles in adipose metabolism and homeostasis as these cells
have the capacity to promote both lipogenesis and lipolysis and promote both tissue hypertrophy and atrophy.
Previously, we showed that polysaccharide-based nanocarriers could efficiently deliver drugs to adipose MΦs
after intraperitoneal injection. We found that certain classes of these therapies potently modulate MΦ
phenotype, induce rapid body weight loss, and reverse diabetic phenotype in obese rodents without changes in
food intake. We now propose to develop an extended-release drug depot to deliver these MΦ-targeted
nanocarrier drug conjugates to adipose tissue in a translational format designed for high patient adherence.
Two primary technological products will be (1) biodegradable composite depots constructed from materials that
are efficiently and safely eliminated from the body and (2) translational imaging techniques to longitudinally
monitor drug depots in vivo.
In Aim 1, we will tune the composition, size, and shape of the depots to generate implants with translational
form factors, steady release over 6 months, and minimal foreign body response. We will also validate methods
to image and monitor depots by magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and fluorescence modalities. In Aim 2, we
will maximize drug loading and redesign the backbone of our targeted nanocarrier and drug linkers for efficient
excretion and high solubility. In Aim 3, we will determine mechanisms by which regional depots elicit systemic
physiological changes. In Aim 4, we will measure the long-term impact of lead candidate depots on preventing
or reversing obesity and obesity-induced diabetes. We will study the dependence of efficacy on sex, hormonal
status reflecting menopause, and genetic or dietary obesity origins. If successful, the drug delivery system may
provide an urgently needed non-surgical high-adherence strategy to treat patients living with obesity to safely
enhance weight loss and prevent or reverse the progression of comorbidities."

laboratory of Dr. Brian Kim. There, Dr. Ver Heul has studied basic mechanisms of itch to complement his clinical
interest in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), an itchy skin condition characterized by exaggerated mast cell
(MC) responses. He has demonstrated that the cytokine interleukin (IL)-33 enhances itch in a MC-dependent
manner and proposes to extend these studies to CSU. Thus, the primary scientific goal of this proposal is to
understand the role of IL-33 in CSU and itch.
Washington University is an ideal place to perform the proposed training and research, with outstanding
resources and expertise readily available. Dr. Brian Kim, the primary mentor, is an expert in neuroimmunology,
atopic dermatitis, and itch. Dr. Steve Brody, the co-mentor, is an expert in translational models of epithelial
biology. Both have strong records of continuous funding and training successful scientists. Dr. Ver Heul has also
assembled an advisory committee with expertise in immunology, neuroscience, functional genomics, and in vivo
microscopy, who will provide crucial scientific training and career guidance. He will take didactics in genomics,
microscopy, and scientific writing. He will have multiple opportunities to present his work locally and to the larger
scientific community. Dr. Ver Heul’s immediate objectives during the award period are to acquire requisite skills
to complete the proposed research, publish the results, and successfully obtain independent funding.
IL-33 is increased in a variety of allergic diseases including CSU, which affects 1% of the population. MCs are
highly responsive to IL-33, and exaggerated MC activation is a major contributor to CSU pathogenesis. Recently,
two distinct pathways by which MCs can be activated to cause itch were identified. One responds to allergens,
while the other responds to a variety of small molecules including neuropeptides and many common drugs
(known as basic secretagogues). Taken together with the demonstration that IL-33 enhances histaminergic itch,
Dr. Ver Heul now proposes to test the hypothesis that IL-33 broadly amplifies different forms of MC-mediated
itch responses. By completing the proposed aims, Dr. Ver Heul will define 1) how IL-33 enhances allergen-
mediated itch and 2) how IL-33 enhances basic secretagogue-mediated itch. The proposed studies determine
mechanisms of IL-33-enhanced MC activation in vitro and in mouse models of itch and extend these findings to
analyses of CSU patient samples. Fulfilling the aims will provide new insight into mechanisms of CSU and itch
and establish Dr. Ver Heul as an independent investigator in allergy and immunology."

Cerebral palsy (CP) results from a perinatal brain injury and is one of the most prevalent and costly pediatric
neurologic conditions in the United States. Individuals with CP frequently experience lifelong mobility challenges.
The modern treatment approaches being used to overcome these challenges place greater emphasis on the
neurological basis for how youth with CP plan their leg movements, execute motor actions, and integrate sensory
information. Despite this neuroscience-informed approach, these new therapies are still limited by substantial
knowledge gaps regarding how the aberrant sensorimotor cortical activity and/or spinal cord specifically affects
the gait of youth with CP.
Our ultramodern magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging results have revealed that cortical aberrations
play a substantial role in the uncharacteristic leg motor actions and sensory processes seen in youth with CP.
Furthermore, our high-resolution MRI pipelines have shown that the structural integrity of spinal cord tissue is
compromised in individuals with CP. From these experiments, we have inferred that the altered cortical dynamics
and spinal cord integrity likely impacts the ability of youth with CP to make feed-forward predictions and/or online
corrections to their leg kinematics during gait. However, this conjecture has yet to be fully established due to
physical limitations of the MEG/MRI recording environments. To move forward, we will use our extensive MEG
foundational work to develop new electroencephalographic (EEG) methods that have the scientific rigor and
flexibility to precisely quantify the sensorimotor cortical activity during real-time gait. Furthermore, we will utilize
cutting-edge neurophysiological tests to concurrently quantify how the spinal cord interneuronal dynamics are
modulated during gait. The Aims of this study will: (1) establish multimodal MEG-EEG neuroimaging proxies of
the aberrant sensorimotor cortical oscillations seen in youth with CP that are known to impact the extent of the
mobility deficits, (2) quantify the sensorimotor EEG cortical oscillations and spinal cord interneuronal dynamics
of youth with CP during gait, and (3) decipher if alterations in the sensorimotor cortical oscillations and spinal
cord interneuronal dynamics are better predictors of the mobility deficits seen in youth with CP relative to the
most commonly used clinical metrics. To achieve these Aims, youth with CP and neurotypical controls will
undergo a series of experiments that will use simultaneous MEG-EEG neuroimaging, EEG neuroimaging during
gait, and assessments of the spinal cord interneuronal dynamics during gait. Furthermore, the participants will
undergo a battery of clinical assessments (e.g., balance, spasticity, selective control, strength and sensation).
We foresee that the body of new knowledge gained through this project will set-the-stage for the design and
testing of innovative therapeutic protocols that target the specific neurophysiological deficits that are limiting the
mobility of youth with CP."

In response to PAR-19-269 “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic Data
(U01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”, our project unites experts in AD genomics, machine learning and AI (including
deep learning), large-scale data integration, and international data harmonization to work in a carefully-designed
Consortium Structure in close partnership with the NIH, ADSP, and NIAGADS. We will develop a suite of
complementary big data analytic approaches for ultra-scale analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) genomic
and phenotypic data. The vast data volumes now generated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project
(ADSP), National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI),
Accelerating Medications Partnership AD (AMP-AD), and UK Biobank (UKBB), far exceed the capacity of all
current analytic methods, which have not kept pace with the scale and speed of data collection. This vast amount
of genetic and phenotypic data mandates new and more powerful algorithms to: (1) store, manage, and
manipulate whole-genome sequences and associated data on an ever-growing scale; (2) discover novel AD risk
and protective loci by merging informatics and AD genomics databases; (3) relate whole-genome changes to
the ATN(v) biomarkers that now define biological AD. Our Ultrascale Machine Learning Initiative, or “ULTRA”
- will offer new AI and deep learning tools to discover features in massive scale genomics data - relating whole
genome data to biomarker features by merging all relevant data sources. Our team of experienced PIs will
coordinate efforts across the U.S. to create these large-scale data analytic tools. Our MPI team and 6 Core
Leads have decades of experience working together and with the AD community in pioneering machine learning
methods for AD genetics and neuroimaging, including leadership of international neuroimaging consortia across
the world. Dedicated Cores focus on Genomic, Imaging, and Cognitive Data Harmonization. Curated data will
then be efficiently imported into AI approaches and informatics pipelines that will allow the AD research
community to leverage ultra-scale, multidimensional genomic and phenotypic data from the ADSP, NACC, ADNI,
AMP-AD, and others. Our work is organized by a carefully-designed and coordinated Consortium guided by all
stake-holders, clinical leaders, and pioneering analysts in AD genomics and neuroimaging. Our ultrascale AI
tools will advance AD genomics research and will include efforts in training, and a dedicated Drug Repurposing
Core. This team effort will accelerate understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological mechanisms
of AD, yielding significant translational impact on disease and drug development."
10909949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent work suggests that mothers of children with disabilities are at increased risk for accelerated cognitive
aging. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in particular, may be especially susceptible to
atypical aging given their elevated rates of key risk factors for dementia relative to mothers of typically
developing children or children with other neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD is also a heritable condition, and
emerging research indicates similar effects of tauopathy in ASD and Alzheimer’s disease. Though it is not
known if mothers of children with ASD also have tauopathy as a result of their genetic liability, this possibility
may have an impact on atypical cognitive aging in this group. The theoretical framework from this research is
based on the Diathesis-Stress model, which posits that environmental or psychosocial factors (e.g., stress)
moderate the gene-phenotype relationship. Understanding risk for atypical cognitive decline in mothers of
children with ASD is important given the high prevalence of ASD in the population (1 in 54 children). Moreover,
a significant number of mothers of children with ASD (up to 65%) continue to be caregivers for their adult
children, resulting in increased stress, depression, loneliness, reduced social support, and poor sleep, all of
which are risk factors for dementia-related disease. This project will address gaps in the literature on cognitive
decline in mothers of children with ASD and associated risk factors. Aim 1 will compare the neuropsychological
profiles of mothers of children with ASD and mothers of typically developing children, as well as age effects,
using a comprehensive battery. Aim 2 will examine the effects of risk factors (i.e., stress, depression,
loneliness, reduced social support, and poor sleep quality) on neuropsychological test performance within
mothers of children with ASD. This project will provide insight into atypical cognitive aging among mothers of
children with ASD, which may have broader consequences on their children who continue to live at home and
depend on their parents as caregivers after high school. This research will be implemented in an ideal training
environment with a strong infrastructure for aging research at the University of South Carolina and with the
support of an experienced mentorship team with expertise in aging, neuropsychological assessments, and
Alzheimer’s and other dementia-related diseases. The training plan focuses on the development of the trainee
in: (1) theories, measurement, and interpretation of neuropsychological assessments, (2) trajectories of typical
aging and aging in dementia-related disease, and (3) professional development. The proposed study and
training plan will help the trainee pursue a line of research on the risk for dementia-related disease in mothers
of children with ASD."
10910062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated with major
morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce its health burden.
Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge gaps persist regarding the
impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including effectiveness of strategies to achieve and
maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies reduce USD recurrence. The Prevention of Urinary
Stones with Hydration (PUSH) study is a randomized clinical trial investigating the impact of increased fluid
intake and increased urine output on the recurrence rate of USD in adults and children. In this study 1,642
participants will be randomized to a control or intervention arm. Participants in both arms receive a “smart water
bottle”. The intervention arm involves an additional program of behavioral interventions, including financial
incentives, structured problem solving, and low touch interventions designed to improve adherence to a
prescribed fluid intake regimen. The primary endpoint is occurrence of a stone event during a two-year
observation period. The PUSH study is in its third year, and due to multiple challenges to recruitment of study
participants, follow-up of participants and data collection have not yet been completed. Additional time is needed
to ensure study completion and to accomplish all study goals. Although ureteral stenting is routinely performed
after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-operative complications, stents cause significant patient
discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only partly understood. The STudy to Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-
associated Symptoms (STENTS) is a prospective observational cohort study enrolling adolescents and adults
undergoing ureteroscopic intervention for ureteral and/or renal stones. Participants undergo detailed symptom
assessment using validated questionnaires, a psychosocial assessment, quantitative sensory testing for
evaluation of pain sensitization, and detailed collection of clinical and operative data. Biospecimens (blood and
urine) are being collected for future research. Recruitment to the STENTS study and follow-up of the participants
are expected to be completed on time. However, additional time and resources are needed for analysis of
collected study data. In Aim 1 of this application, the investigators will continue and complete participant
enrollment for the PUSH study, continue biospecimen collection for the NIDDK Repository, analyze the data,
and prepare and submit several planned manuscripts related to the study hypotheses. In Aim 2 of this
applications, the investigators will analyze the data from the STENTS studies, interpret findings, and disseminate
findings through peer reviewed publications."

10911133,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant nucleotide modification in the transcriptome, has the well-
established function of causing instability of modified mRNAs. Importantly, differentiation of hematopoietic stem
cells is one of the most-well studied scenarios in which m6A-modified mRNAs appears to be preferentially
degraded. Although this degradation process appears to be a highly regulated event to ensure cellular
commitment, a clear mechanism of how this event is regulated is missing.
My recent work demonstrated that the major mediators of m6A-mRNA degradation are the YTHDF (DF)
proteins. Thus, a major goal is to understand how these proteins are regulated to trigger m6A mRNA
degradation. My working hypothesis, which is supported by preliminary data, is the existence of a specific DF
phosphorylation-code regulating the DF ability to degrade m6A-mRNA. In this proposal, I will map this DF
phospho-code, identify the DF targeting kinases, and determine how DF phosphorylation affects the
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Overall this proposal may reveal how DF phosphorylation controls
m6A mRNA stability and its fundamental role during the differentiation commitment of the hematopoietic stem
cells."
10911254,"Implantable interfaces for neuromodulation is necessary to advance fundamental neuroscience research,
develop new treatments for neurological disorders, and create efficient breakthrough neuroprosthetics.
However, modern implants based on multi-electrode arrays suffer from low spatial resolution, high
invasiveness with complicated implantable procedures, the need for a chronic opening for connecting wires,
and substantial foreign body reaction, eventually leading to device failure. On the other hand, various groups
have developed nanoparticles-based transducers that can wirelessly modulate neurons with high precision
when actuated with external stimuli. Nevertheless, nanoparticles hold several disadvantages due to their small
size (resulting in neurotoxicity, migration, aggregation, etc.), restricted fabrication procedures, and limited
design or integration opportunities. Hence, minimally invasive and non-genetic technology that can enable
wireless neuromodulation with high spatio-temporal resolution and stable interface remains an unmet goal
till date.
Therefore, we propose to develop an innovative thin-film-based structure able to wirelessly influence the
neuronal membrane to induce or inhibit action potential propagation along a specific path of connected
neurons. These devices will be designed and produced with subcellular dimensions to be injected into the
neural tissue, diffuse, and wrap around axons and dendrites (creating conformable and stable neural
interface); hence, they are named nanoCUFFs. The nanoCUFFs will be composed of two types of polymers:
i) an azobenzene polymer for photo-induced reconfiguration of thin films rolled into microtubes,
accommodating single axons; and ii) a semiconducting polymer for transduction of light pulses into stimuli
for neuronal opto-modulation. Polymers allow creating soft, biocompatible, and conformable structures for
a minimal mismatch and maximal coupling with the biological tissue. Once the nanoCUFFs are produced
and characterized, we will verify their wrapping capabilities around axons and dendrites, neuromodulation
efficiencies as well as ability to influence distinct selected subpopulations of neurons (using micro-patterned
light) in neural cultures.
The ability to engineer the nanoCUFFs’ material composition and photo-induced effects on a thin-film
platform favors the future integration of nanoelectronics components for additional functionalities. For
instance, multiplexing and sensing devices could be developed for smart closed-loop neuromodulation. This
technology can simultaneously achieve ultra-low invasiveness, high-spatio-temporal precision, selectivity
and stable junction with cells and thus, is highly promising for not only fundamental neuroscience but also
novel therapeutics."
10911902,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant primary cancer of the liver, is 4th leading cause of cancer
deaths, and the fastest growing malignancy in the US. Advanced-stage HCC remains largely incurable due to a
dismal response rate (<20%) and therapeutic resistance. The current obesity epidemic has been associated with
the rising prevalence of metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and its inflammatory
component, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to HCC. MAFLD-HCC incidence is increasing
dramatically, underscoring an unmet medical need for new diagnostic and treatment strategies. Here, we
describe a novel tumor suppressor role of the Hypoxia-Associated Factor, HAF, in MAFLD-HCC. Both global
haploinsufficiency and hepatocyte-specific deletion of HAF in mice result in HCC with hallmarks of NASH
including severe steatosis with hepatocyte degeneration (hepatocyte ballooning), fibrosis, and increased
inflammatory cell infiltration. HAF loss in both mouse models or by siRNA transfection in HCC cells is associated
with decreased activation of the p65/p50 NF-κB transcriptional subunits, and in decreased levels of their
upstream regulators, TAK1 and NEMO. Endogenous HAF forms a complex with NEMO and TAK1, suggesting
that HAF modulates the NF-κB pathway by directly modulating the stability of these proteins, potentially through
HAF’s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. HAF knockdown was associated with increased spontaneous apoptosis,
whereas HAF overexpression protected cells against TNF-induced cell death, suggesting that HAF may play a
tumor suppressor role by protecting cells against death associated with liver inflammation (hepatitis) that can
lead to HCC. Indeed, HAF levels are suppressed by conditions prevalent during hepatitis such as hypoxia and
elevated TNF or TGF-β, whereas HAF are increased by DNA damage, suggesting that HAF may contribute to
NF-κB activation in response to genomic instability in pre-neoplastic hepatocytes. Significantly, HAF was highly
expressed in most cases of human hepatitis but was undetectable in 94% of human HCCs examined (65 cases).
Thus, our hypothesis is that HAF plays a novel tumor suppressor role in HCC by facilitating NF-κB activation
that promotes the survival of hepatocytes during hepatitis. Suppression of HAF by hypoxia or inflammatory
cytokines during hepatitis results in increased cellular turnover that drives progression to NASH and HCC. Our
overall goal is to identify new predictive/prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HCC, particularly those
relevant to MAFLD-HCC. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that HAF activates the NF-κB pathway by
modulating the stability of TAK1 and NEMO, and thus identify the molecular mechanisms regulating the HAF-
NF-κB axis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that HAF protects cells from excessive cell death during hepatitis,
thus preventing progression to NASH and HCC. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that HAF deregulation is
associated with progression to HCC by investigating HAF expression in > 500 patient samples, to determine the
association of HAF and its downstream targets to HCC initiation and progression or to treatment response."

10840385,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the initiating genetic events in tumorigenesis, germline variants in cancer predisposing genes perturb cell 
growth and differentiation and set the stage for malignant transformation. Accordingly, the study of cancer 
predisposing genes and their associated hereditary syndromes provides critical insights into normal physiology 
and cancer biology. By investigating families with autosomal dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and Bacute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we and others identified pathogenic germline variants affecting ETV6, 
the gene encoding the ETS variant 6 transcriptional repressor. Subsequently, we sequenced germline samples 
from 4,405 children with B-ALL and detected similar variants in 0.5% of patients. Further association studies 
revealed a significant 22.94-fold enrichment of pathogenic ETV6 variants in this ALL cohort compared to 134,187 
non-ALL controls in gnomAD (P= 2.2 × 10-16). These data firmly support our overall premise that pathogenic
germline ETV6 variants predispose to childhood ALL. To better understand how germline ETV6 variants 
promote leukemogenesis, we used in vitro assays to interrogate their effects on the functions of the encoded
ETV6 protein. Notably, each of the pathogenic ETV6 variants examined significantly reduced ETV6 transcription
repressor activity, impaired ETV6 DNA binding capacity and mis-localized ETV6 to the cytoplasm. In parallel, we 
generated a novel mouse model harboring a recurrent B-ALL-associated Etv6 variant (Etv6R355X). Preliminary 
studies of Etv6R355X/+ mice reveal significant perturbations in early B cell development, as well as hematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) number and function. Finally, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem 
cell (iPSC) lines harboring pathogenic ETV6 variants, which generate dysplastic megakaryocytes, similar to 
ETV6 variant positive patients. Based on these results, we hypothesize that ETV6 variants predispose to
ALL by perturbing key transcriptional programs that impair hematopoietic development. In this proposal, 
we will make use of our unique model systems to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize 
the hematopoietic compartments of humans and mice that do or do not harbor pathogenic germline ETV6
variants. We will examine whether WT and ETV6 variant-positive iPSCs or mouse hematopoietic progenitors
properly differentiate along various lineages. To establish how germline ETV6 variants influence gene expression
in developing hematopoietic progenitors, in Aim 2 we will use RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing to explore 
transcriptional landscapes and identify putative ETV6 target genes in mouse and iPSC-derived B progenitors
and HSPC harboring WT or variant ETV6. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform comprehensive whole genome and 
RNA-sequencing of B-ALL samples to elucidate the somatic genetic lesions that function in concert with germline 
ETV6 variants to drive B-leukemogenesis. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the leukemiapromoting effects of these second hits. This project will provide new insights into the influence of germline 
genetic variation on hematopoiesis and development of B-ALL, the most common childhood cancer."
10917942,"Project Summary:
The goal of this proposal is to extensively broaden the clinical applications of the unique anti-cancer biologic
drug L-asparaginase (ASNase) by developing a longer-acting next generation version of our novel variant, EBD-
300, currently in IND-enabling studies. ASNases are enzyme drugs that exploit a metabolic vulnerability of
specific tumor cells via systemic depletion of L-asparagine (Asn) from the blood, and they are critical in the
treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cure rates greatly improved upon incorporation of
ASNase into pediatric treatment protocols, however, adult ALL patients are largely precluded from ASNase
treatment due to the toxicity from current FDA-approved versions. The result is significantly lower overall cure
rates for adults with ALL. The side effects of current ASNases stem from two causes – one is their
immunogenicity due to their bacterial origin and the second is their off-target L-glutaminase (GLNase) co-
activity. To expand the use of this drug to adult ALL patients and other indications, there is a need for a superior
ASNase with (1) reduced immunogenicity, (2) devoid of GLNase activity, and with (3) long in vivo
persistence. To begin addressing this need, EbD developed EBD-300, the 1st mammalian ASNase (derived
from guinea pig and further humanized to reduce immunological risk) and the 1st super specific ASNase (zero
GLNase). In vivo studies demonstrated high efficacy of EBD-300 in ALL, with vastly superior safety compared
to the current 1st-line (Oncaspar) and 2nd-line (Rylaze) FDA-approved ASNases. The in vivo persistence (t1/2) of
EBD-300 is much longer than Rylaze, making it a promising candidate to become the preferred 2nd-line ASNase.
However, EBD-300 is not competitive with 1st-line Oncaspar/Asparlas because of its need for a higher and more
frequent dosing schedule. Notably, over 130 customer discovery interviews with KOLs in ALL revealed the strong
need for a long-acting EBD-300 variant to be able to break into 1st line. The work proposed here will engineer
and test next generation EBD-300 variants with long in vivo persistence, and such a long-acting variant will both
impact ALL patients and provide the ultimate ASNase for additional indications (where, until now, current
ASNases are simply too toxic for these adult populations). This includes blood cancers such as acute myeloid
leukemia and solid tumors, like liver and colorectal cancers, all of which have been shown preclinically to be
sensitive to ASNase. To achieve this goal, we will engineer EBD-300 with a novel half-life extension (HLE)
technology in a 3-step process. Step 1 will generate HLE EBD-300 variants and confirm that the modifications
maintain the required enzymatic properties for clinical efficacy. In Step 2, the top 3 variants passing stringent QC
will have their in vivo persistence evaluated. The top candidate will proceed to Step 3 to confirm its anti-ALL
power in mouse models. The feasibility of our approach to generate a long-acting EBD-300 variant has been
proven in our preliminary work. Success here will provide a novel ASNase to dramatically impact the
treatment of ALL and expand to other cancers that rely on blood Asn for proliferation and survival."
10922677,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG
expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. HD preferentially involves the basal ganglia- especially the striatum-
but also affects other brain regions and has no cure or disease-modifying treatment yet. Because of its gain-of-
function mechanism, strategies to lower mutant HTT are promising as first-ever disease-modifying therapies.
Most approaches are currently targeted at manifest HD when clinical outcomes can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness. However, as almost 50% of striatal volume has been lost at the time of onset, it would be
preferable to begin treatment in the premanifest period before massive loss of striatal volumes. An unmet
challenge is how to reliably evaluate therapeutic efficacy in the absence of clinical symptoms as outcome
measures. The clinical diagnosis of HD is based on the presence of movement disorders. However, functional
changes in the brain can precede motor onset by many years. Neurovascular abnormalities have been
reported in premanifest and early HD by us and others. We have reported significantly altered arteriolar CBV
(CBVa) in premanifest HD brains, when striatal atrophy was undetectable. We recently found that altered
CBVa occurred prior to striatal atrophy in an HD mouse model and that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mHTT
lowering restored CBVa in premanifest HD mice. Collectively, these data suggest reliable measures of
neurovascular changes might be valuable biomarkers in premanifest HD. CBV is strongly coupled with brain
metabolism, and cerebral metabolic abnormalities are increasingly considered as early neuropathological
events in HD. We found impaired response of cerebral metabolism to visual stimulation in premanifest HD
patients, correlating with the CAG-Age product (CAP) score, supporting that metabolic disturbances occur at
early pathogenic stage and may be another early biomarker for HD. In addition, the recent (re)discovery of
brain lymphatic vessels and CSF-lymphatic drainage system illustrates an important brain waste clearance
system. Our preliminary data implicate that impairment of elements of this system precedes striatal atrophy
and mHTT aggregation in HD mice. The objective of this project is to identify early brain functional changes
that rapidly respond to treatment in HD preclinical study by incorporating multimodal advanced MRI measures
and to develop sensitive biomarkers translatable to HD clinical trials, particularly in the premanifest period.
Aim 1. We will test the hypothesis that mutant HTT impairs cerebral metabolism and alters neurovascular
responsivity prior to brain atrophy and behavioral deficits in HD mice. Aim 2. We will assess glymphatic
function by measuring lymphatic flow dynamics and BBB permeability in HD mice. Aim 3. We will determine
the extent to which metabolic, vascular, and lymphatic MRI measures can monitor the effects of premanifest
and manifest treatment of HD mice with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HTT lowering."

The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced ""Odyssey"") program is a multi-
stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative formed to bring out the value of health data through large-scale
analytics. All our solutions are open-source. OHDSI has established an international network of researchers and
observational health databases with a central coordinating center housed at Columbia University’s Department
of Biomedical Informatics. As a collaborative, one of our greatest strengths comes from working together with
other stakeholders across the broader healthcare community. By connecting with those on the frontlines of
medical decision making, we can ensure our goals are aligned with the needs of patients, clinicians and
regulatory agencies. To engage with this broader audience, we propose holding an annual symposium with the
objective of showcasing OHDSI’s achievements and offering hands-on training for OHDSI tools and methods.
Furthermore, the symposium will provide a forum to discuss challenges facing large-scale observational research
with a broad range of stakeholders, and request external feedback on how OHDSI collaboration could further
foster an ecosystem designed to satisfy the needs of the healthcare community. This symposium will be a
continuation of our previous symposia which has been offered annually since 2015 and hosted a wide range of
stakeholder groups such as patients, clinicians, researchers, industry and government. At the event, OHDSI
collaborators will present OHDSI’s vision and demonstrate our commitment to open science by sharing results
from our most recent collaborative studies, carried out across our international research community.
Presentations will be interactive and provide participants tangible examples of how observational data has been
used to generate real world evidence about disease natural history and the effects of medical interventions. The
annual symposium will give participants an opportunity to provide input on the priorities and future direction for
how the OHDSI community should advance the research, development, and applications of observational
research. This input will ensure the evidence generated within the OHDSI community is designed to answer the
questions most important to patients, payers, providers and policy makers."

Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degrees provide access to rewarding, highly remunerated
careers, and the opportunity to contribute solutions to society’s problems. Unfortunately, Latinas and African
American women comprise less than 4% of the current STEM workforce. Gender stereotypes and a lack of
relatable role models, mentors, and early exposure to STEM have been suggested to deter middle school girls
away from STEM interests. This project will examine the effect of Seeds of Success, an out-of-school intervention
designed to inspire girls to consider careers in STEM by countering gender and race stereotypes through
relatable role models; promoting STEM self-efficacy through STEM workshops and activities; and encouraging
alignment between cultural and STEM identities through community-based STEM projects. A total of 160 girls in
grades 7-9 will be recruited every year to participate in mirror programs in Puerto Rico and New Haven, CT, two
populations with high percentages of underrepresented and underserved students. Girls will receive mentoring
from female STEM professionals from similar racial and ethnic backgrounds and will interact via webinars with
additional diverse STEM role models to learn more about STEM careers. In addition, girls will be exposed to
engineering, life sciences, and computer science concepts through online and in-person activities and workshops
that promote critical thinking. Finally, girls will be empowered to undertake STEM Ambassadors projects that
allow them to have an impact on their community through science. We hypothesize that the program will promote
gains in STEM interest, self-efficacy and identity—potentially benefiting future career decisions. Effect will be
measured with surveys administered before and after the program to participants and a control group. Longer-
term follow-up surveys will track sustained impacts on high school graduation, college entrance, and choice of
major. In addition to the 800 girls that the program will impact directly, at least 20,000 additional students and
members of the community will be impacted through the STEM Ambassadors projects and the female STEM
role model webinars that will be shared live and on Youtube. Thus, by implementing these culturally-relevant,
asset-based STEM engagement strategies, Seeds of Success will improve the STEM outcomes of girls in high-
need communities and retain the diverse talent we need in the 21st century."
10918705,"Project Summary
The nervous system was traditionally thought to act independently of an organism’s immune response and be
an “immune privileged site”. Increasing scientific evidence has shown that the nervous system is not immune
privileged but instead has a unique immune response that is critical for maintaining homeostasis and critical for
central nervous system (CNS) function. Much of the work in the field of neuroinflammation has focused on the
function of microglia, but little is known about the role of neurons in modulating neuroinflammatory responses
in the CNS. Five years ago, we discovered that the neuronal protein, alpha-synuclein(asyn), was critical in
protecting neurons from viral infection. We have extended these data to show that ayn modulates type 1
interferon (T1IFN) signaling. Asyn is known as a cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and is known to be
dysregulated in neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, and other diverse CNS diseases. Despite
the importance of asyn in CNS disease states, the functional role of asyn expression is not well understood.
We have discovered that asyn expression is necessary to support expression of specific interferon stimulated
genes (ISGs) in the brain during T1IFN signaling, independent of microglia activation. Using induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and CRISPR-mediated SNCA deletion to create asyn KO human dopaminergic
neurons, we found that viral growth in neurons is inhibited in the presence of asyn expression and that viral-
induced ISGs such as IFIT1, OAS1, and TRIM25 exbibit decreased expression in asyn KO neurons. We next
found that asyn KO neurons exhibit a broad loss of ISG expression following treatment with poly I:C or type 1
interferon (2) treatment due to loss of asyn-dependent STAT2 activation and asyn nuclear localization. Taken
together, our data show for the first time that asyn functions to support interferon responses in neurons. The
goal of this proposal is to determine the specific mechanism of asyn-dependent innate immune responses in
neurons. We hypothesize that asyn is a novel neuron-intrinsic regulator of the CNS innate immune response.
We will test our hypothesis in three aims. Aim 1 will use asyn KO and WT human neurons to define the specific
interactions between asyn, interferon signaling, and vesicle transport in neurons. Aim 2 will define the role of
neuron-intrinsic asyn production on the innate T-cell response in the brain using an inducible, nestin-Cre-lox
knockout of the asyn gene (Snca) in mice. Aim 3 will evaluate PD-specific and species specific changes in
asyn that may influence its native function in neurons. Taken together, the proposed studies will significantly
advance our understanding of neuron-intrinsic control of the innate immune response in the CNS and provide
novel insight into the underlying immunopathogenesis that contributes to diverse human diseases of the CNS."

The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para-
digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology
at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available
PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not
progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation
of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team
from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation
NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the
NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high
performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight
resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a
factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain.
The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel
phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small-
region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We
will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement
reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time,
Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and
correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and
geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data
with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with
machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for
attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate
specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the
dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of
pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening
new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal
is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and
applications."

Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the cellular environment has profound implications in biological processes
related to human health/disease. Many single-cell analytical tools have been developed over the years to reveal
the heterogeneity among cells, e.g., the spatial distribution of chemicals and ions. However, one missing piece
in the single-cell analysis is the ability to reveal quantitatively the spatial and temporal heterogeneity cellular
response to chemical stimulus. This is challenging because controlling the exact concentration of chemicals at
a specific location depends on the interplay between dynamics of mass transport in the complex cellular
environment and the reactivity of the molecules. Indeed, some physiologically important molecules, including
reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are highly reactive and have short lifetimes. A
tool for precision delivery of molecules, including these reactive ones, are necessary to quantitatively study their
effect at the single-cell level.
 Our research lab will focus on developing nanoscale precision delivery tools to quantitatively control the
delivery of molecules of biological interest, including those highly reactive ones. The strategy is based on a
functionalized nanopipette electrode that is capable of in situ generation of the molecule of interest
electrochemically with spatial and temporal control. This will be demonstrated by the delivery of nitric oxide (NO),
a reactive molecule whose transient concentration is important in neuron transmission, immune response, and
blood coagulation. Spatial and temporally resolved delivery is achieved by combining the electrochemical
chemical delivery system with nanoscale electrochemical imaging techniques. This delivery modality can be
extended to other reactive molecules, including H2S, CO, and ROS. In addition, we will develop a precision
delivery tool called digital delivery, where we will precisely control the number of biomolecules or other non-
biological entities being delivered, including proteins and nanoparticles, by counting their number during the
delivery in a resistive pulse fashion. Lastly, we will quantitatively map the spatially resolved rate of uptake of the
molecules being delivered.
 Ultimately, the precision delivery methods developed in our proposed research will enable quantitative
investigation of many fundamental biological and physiological questions related to the reactive molecules at the
single-cell level. For example, the tools can be used to reveal the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the
neuron response by precision delivery of neuron transmitters or their vesicles. The modality can also be applied
to quantitatively modulate or stimulate the inflammatory response at the single-cell level."
10927328,"Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the eye with an estimated prevalence of 80 million patients
worldwide by 2020, at least 6 to 8 million becoming bilaterally blind. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)
causing axonal degeneration of the optic nerve and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
which are the characteristic hallmarks of glaucoma. Clinically, the only method of slowing glaucomatous
vision loss is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), which is partially effective and doesn’t address
susceptibility to RGC degeneration. Current therapy for glaucoma includes use of prostaglandin analogs
based IOP lowering agents, however, about 10% of glaucoma patients don’t respond to these therapies.
Brimonidine, an α2 agonist, eye-drop lowers IOP and is also neuroprotective, however it causes many
side effects such as allergic reactions and corneal disorders. Along with IOP, age related decline in anti-
oxidant enzymes in ocular tissues contributes to the death of both RGCs and trabecular meshwork (TM)
cells, which is not addressed by available treatments. The nitric oxide (NO) system could potentially be
targeted to enhance the aqueous outflow by relaxing the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells to lower IOP.
Here, we propose to develop a robust hybrid NO donating and SOD mimetic compound encapsulated in
PLGA nanoparticle which will prolong the duration of lowering IOP and also have neuroprotective effects.
We have synthesized a novel bi-functional hybrid compound SA-2 with NO donor and SOD mimetic
functional groups. Our preliminary results demonstrated that, a single eye drop of PLGA encapsulated
SA-2 nanoparticles (SA-2-NPs) lowered IOP by 50% in a mouse glaucoma model. Additionally,
compound SA-2 is highly neuroprotective both in ex vivo hypoxic insult of adult rat retinal explants and
in in vivo mouse optic nerve crush model via intravitreal injection. Our goals are 1) to optimize the dose
via toxicokinetic study of SA-2-NPs and determine the efficacy to lower IOP in two animal models: a
mouse model of ocular hypertension (OHTN) induced by Ad5.TGFβ2 and in normotensive monkey eyes.
2) To delineate the biochemical mechanisms through which compound SA-2 protects both human TM
cells and RGCs from glaucomatous changes. 3) To assess the topically administered SA-2-NPs for their
ability to prevent RGC death in two models: a mouse model of optic nerve crush (traumatic injury) and a
mouse model of ocular hypertension (chronic injury). Successful completion of the above proposed
studies will provide information on the maximum effective dose of and frequency of dosing of SA-2-NPs
that will be further evaluated in laser induced OHTN monkey model as our future goal and eventually will
progress to human clinical trials. The results will have a major impact in the field with implications for
developing novel non-prostaglandin therapeutics that have both IOP lowering and neuroprotective
effects."
10924444,"ABSTRACT
HIV infects cells via a process of membrane fusion, mediated by the envelope
glycoprotein. Fusion peptides from gp41 are inserted into host cell membranes as part of
this process. Prior work has shown that HIV fusion peptides localize to phase boundaries
in membranes and that HIV viral particles preferentially fuse at such boundaries. These
phase, or ""raft"", boundaries are controlled by cholesterol and are likely responsible for the
cholesterol-dependence of HIV entry. Here, we test what consequences phase
boundaries have for fusion peptide biochemistry and HIV entry. We hypothesize that viral
mutants lacking this phase-boundary property will have impaired membrane fusion and
will no longer depend on membrane cholesterol. We also hypothesize that partitioning to
phase boundaries controls the conformational plasticity of HIV fusion peptides. We test
both of these hypotheses by designing mutant fusion peptides using molecular dynamics
simulation and then testing their effects computational, biochemically, and in HIV entry
assays. Since membrane phase behavior is highly dependent on cell state, a biochemical
understanding of how HIV proteins interact with lipidic phases will also advance our
understanding of how cellular activation or lipid modulation can affect HIV entry."
10924492,"Abstract: “Targeting cell-to-cell communication to prevent bystander damage mediated by viral reservoirs.”
 Soon after primary infection, HIV enters the CNS and causes long-lasting cognitive and motor
impairment in 30-60% of infected individuals, even in the current antiretroviral (ART) era. In the CNS, HIV
remains latent in a small population of microglia/macrophages and a smaller population of astrocytes. Our
human brain data indicate that long-term ART reduces the myeloid (microglia/macrophage) pool of viral
reservoirs (up to 23 years on ART). However, long-term ART did not reduce the astrocyte-infected pool.
Furthermore, chronic damage to uninfected cells was associated with glial viral reservoirs and amplified by
Connexin43 containing channels, gap junction (GJ) and hemichannels (HC), even in the absence of viral
replication. Our application focuses on astrocytes and the mechanism of bystander damage triggered by
viral reservoirs, even in the absence of replication.
Overall, our data indicate: First, a small population of latently infected astrocytes remain stable even
during long-term ART (up to 23 years in ART); Second, the few astrocytes with HIV-integrated DNA are
associated with localized inflammatory areas; Third, HIV-infected astrocytes survive apoptosis for extended
periods; Fourth, we demonstrated that few infected astrocytes could repopulate the entire body with the
virus and Fifth, we demonstrated that connexin containing channels, GJ and HC, amplify chronic
inflammation into neighboring uninfected cells by a mechanism involving compromised calcium/IP3
signaling, mitochondrial function, and inter-organelle interactions (ER, mitochondria and lipid bodies); and
Lastly, we demonstrated all these toxic mechanisms could be prevented by reducing GJ and HC
communication between viral reservoirs and surrounding uninfected cells.
 We hypothesize that “HIV-latently infected astrocytes used GJ and HC to amplify toxicity into
neighboring uninfected cells even in the current ART era.” The results obtained from this proposal will lead
to identifying potential therapeutic targets to limit the devastating consequences of NeuroHIV."

10916601,"Liver-related complications continue to pose a significant threat to the health of people living with HIV (PLWH),
despite the life-extending benefits of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) affects up to 50% of PLWH and can be caused by both HIV infection and cART. The risk factors for
NAFLD in PLWH are not fully understood, but hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and
gut microbiome changes are more common in this population.
This study aims to investigate the co-occurrence of NAFLD and HIV infection and their potential impact on brain
health. Our hypothesis is that PLWH with NAFLD are at higher risk of persistent blood brain barrier (BBB)
dysfunction, metabolite dysfunction, and microcirculation alterations compared to those without NAFLD. These
changes may result in more aggressive brain injury and poorer cognitive function, especially in older individuals.
To test this hypothesis, we will employ state-of-the-art, non-invasive MRI techniques to evaluate brain injury. Our
approach includes developing a novel deep neural network with compress sensing for high-quality reconstruction
of highly accelerated clinical chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), a molecular MRI technique used to
assess metabolic dysfunction. We will compare neuroimaging metrics of metabolite dysfunction, BBB
permeability, microcirculation, and neuroinflammation in PLWH with NAFLD versus those without NAFLD. We
will also investigate the association between these imaging metrics and blood biomarkers.
Additionally, we will assess whether NAFLD in HIV infection leads to reduced cognitive performance, mediated
by brain injury as measured by CEST and other imaging metrics. Finally, we will track longitudinal changes in
MRI metrics, blood biomarkers, and cognitive performance in PLWH with and without NAFLD and healthy
controls.
The significance of this research lies in several aspects. Firstly, proposed rapid and high-quality CEST imaging
at clinical 3T offers increased sensitivity to disease pathology compared to traditional methods. Secondly,
advanced MR techniques can help us better understand metabolic changes, microcirculation, and BBB
alterations caused by disease processes. Thirdly, by examining cross-sectional and longitudinal associations
between MRI metrics, blood markers, and cognitive scores, we can identify gaps in our knowledge of brain injury
and disease progression and their interaction with clinical variables. Fourthly, the use of deep learning models
in conjunction with multimodal features may aid in differentiating brain-related abnormalities of NAFLD from HIV,
as there is significant overlap in clinical and imaging manifestations. Lastly, the methods proposed in this study
may have implications for understanding other brain-related disorders."

investigator on the Harvard Medical School faculty at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital or Massachusetts General Hospital. A site director
at each hospital helps place students with the appropriate mentor. We have a diverse group of 30 Program
Faculty involved in research and career mentoring, retention, and assessment. In addition to their daily
research, students participate in a weekly core curriculum to introduce them to the breadth of kidney
biology in health and disease. This includes: 1) an introduction to the principles of renal physiology; 2) a
renal gross pathology session with autopsy specimens; 3) training for and performing a community
screening for kidney disease; 4) a visit to an outpatient dialysis center to appreciate the impact of kidney
disease and experience this current treatment approach for patients with kidney failure; 5) an opportunity
to observe the clinical work of a nephrologist or urologist; and 6) additional sessions on patient perspectives
and the contributions of research in the biotech/pharma industry to new therapeutic approaches. Students
present their work locally and then nationally at the NIDDK-KUH Summer Research symposium. There
are close ties with the Kidney Disease and Awareness Program (KDSAP). HSRPKM alumni have started
12 KDSAP chapters (52% of the current chapters) which enable longitudinal experiences with, and
increased peer awareness of, kidney health and disease. A year-round program of mentorship, career
development sessions, and networking helps sustain alumni interest in Nephrology and Urology. The

Footprinting (MRPF™) Platform,” is responsive to the ackowledged need for new and
improved tools for higher order structural analysis (HOS) of biopharmaceuticals and
membrane protein target studies. An emerging HOS analysis technique is radical foot-
printing (RPF). RPF involves the irreversible labeling of a protein’s exterior by reaction
with radicals with subsequent MS analysis to identify the outer portions of the protein.
 We have developed commercial solutions to perform Hydroxyl Radical Protein
Footprinting (HRPF) employing OH radicals known as the Fox® Protein Footprinting
System. A new RPF technique that relies upon trifluoromethyl (TFM) radicals created
by •OH attack of aqueous sodium triflinate has been developed. TFM protein footprinting
(TFMPF) is highly complementary to HRPF. When used together, HRPF and TFMPF
provide improved spatial coverage than either alone.
 In our phase I program, we created a facile means to assess effective radical
load during CF3 labeling experiments by creating an in-line fluorescence detector that
measured the photometric response of coumarin-based internal standard radical
dosimeters to •OH and •CF3 attack. In our Phase II program, we build upon our phase I
success to create a pre-commercial system that will enable selectable •OH or
simultaneous •OH and •CF3 labeling, with in-line radical dosimetry, and optimized data
processing software. In doing so, we will extend our products to also support TFMPF,
creating a powerful and impactful improvement to biopharmaceutical HOS.
 GenNext Technologies is the world’s only company commercializing instruments
and solutions for RPF HOS analysis. Our overarching goal is to convert the RPF process
from an academic research experiment into a broadly adopted and valuable HOS
analytical tool. We firmly believe that our proposal will significantly impact HOS analysis

predictive respiratory monitoring (CPRM), that stands to reduce morbidity and mortality due to respiratory
compromise, while reducing health care system costs. Current devices and systems (human and machine) for
respiratory monitoring are responsive by sounding a warning alarm when a patient reaches a threshold of a
physiologic parameter (i.e. SpO2, ETCO2) and the patient is currently or has been in distress. Technological
limitations have prevented the field from moving further in its ability to predict patient decline so that health
care providers (HCPs) are able to intervene and stop or correct respiratory decline. Linshom has developed a
simple, inexpensive solution for continuous monitoring of respiratory functions including RR, TV, MV, I:E ratio,
and apnea detection. Linshom's 510k FDA-cleared Continuous Predictive Respiratory Sensor (CPRS) solves
existing unmet needs mentioned above with a small, portable, and inexpensive sensor and monitor that tracks
RR, TV, MV, seconds since last breath (SSLB), and I:E ratio in real time. These parameters are crucial for
monitoring of patients suffering from both acute and chronic respiratory illness. Unlike other respiratory
monitoring technologies, Linshom offers an operating room-quality respiratory profile at the patient bedside,
which allows health care providers to promptly diagnose emerging respiratory decline and intervene with
appropriate medical care. Timely intervention should reduce morbidity and mortality and result in significantly
improved care for the patient and large savings for the health care system via reduction in rapid response
activation and ICU transfers. Linshom’s unique ability to provide TV (and thus MV) in the non-intubated patient
creates a profile of patient respiratory status previously not available outside of the OR or ICU (and only in
intubated patients).
In this Fasttrack SBIR we will i) Generate clinical data proving Linshom CPRM’s ability to detect (predict) a
respiratory depression episode (RDE) before current standard of care and devices, ii.) Determine optimal times
to set early warning alarms (maximizing sensitivity and specificity) such that HCPs can intervene sooner than
current practice and avoid morbidity and mortality due to respiratory failure, and iv.) Redesign the CPRS into a
miniaturized chip based device enabling the Linshom CPRM to reach more patients by enabling nasal cannula
(and eventually a home monitor) integration."

The foundation for cardiovascular health (CVH) is laid in early life by intergenerational interactions,
passed from parent to child, that have long-lasting biological and behavioral consequences. Lifestyle
interventions can promote CVH among mothers and their children over time. Academic partnerships
with home visiting organizations that reach families experiencing health disparities advance
intergenerational CVH equity. This study builds on a decades-long academic-home visiting
partnership between the research team at Washington University in St. Louis and Parents as
Teachers (PAT), an evidence-based home visiting program located in all 50 states. Most recently, our
partnered work demonstrated the effectiveness of Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home
(HEALTH), in which we successfully tested a lifestyle intervention to promote ideal weight and CVH
among pregnant and young mothers and their children. We now seek to advance this work with the
ENRICH Collaborative by rigorously testing the ongoing CVH impact of this implementation-ready
approach. During the UG3 planning phase (years 1-2), we will work with the ENRICH Collaborative to
identify a common CVH protocol informed by HEALTH. In the UH3 implementation phase (years 3-7),
we will rigorously test the ongoing impact on CVH of this implementation-ready approach for mothers
and young children, delivered over 3 years, beginning prenatally and continuing to 30 months post-
childbirth. The Hybrid Type 1 cluster-randomized pragmatic trial builds on this partnership (N=10 sites
in high burden St. Louis, Missouri, metro region; 750 mother-child dyads; study population with one or
more of the following characteristics associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease: Black
or Latinx, body mass index ≥ 30, and/or socioeconomic disadvantage). We will determine the effect of
HEALTH on maternal CVH as assessed by a composite score on the American Heart Association
Life’s Simple 7 over 3 years from enrollment (before 20 weeks pregnancy) to follow-up at birth, 6, 18,
and 30-months post childbirth; and on child CVH assessed by BMIz trajectory and diet, activity, sleep,
and parental influence from birth to 6, 18, and 30-month follow-up. We will apply expertise in
implementation science to ensure the intervention has equitable implementation and impact across
PAT and the ENRICH Collaborative. This significant study will further advance scientific
understanding and evidence-based practice on how to disrupt the impact of cardiovascular risk that
passes across generations to improve CVH equity. The innovation of this study is that it will rigorously
determine the impact of HEALTH on the transfer of lifestyle behaviors from mother to child, across
the childbearing continuum."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, with disparately greater impact
on racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income individuals. Risk for CVD begins very early in life as adverse
exposures during critical periods (fetal development, infancy, and reproductive years) shift the health trajectory
toward overt disease. Thus, efforts to promote and maintain cardiovascular health (CVH) from pregnancy onward
are crucial to reducing the intergenerational burden of CVD. In response to the Early Intervention to Promote
Cardiovascular Health of Mothers and Children request for applications (ENRICH RFA), we propose to leverage
two widely-available interventions to promote CVH in diverse, under-resourced pregnant women and offspring:
Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) and the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP). NFP is a home visiting
program in which nurses support first-time, under-resourced mothers from pregnancy to 24 months postpartum
to improve prenatal outcomes, child safety and developmental outcomes, and economic self-sufficiency. NFP is
available at >260 organizations nationwide, including our Denver Health partners who have delivered it to >2400
urban, under-resourced women since 2000. While NFP addresses some putative causes of compromised
maternal and child health, CVH has not been comprehensively addressed nor evaluated. Thus, we propose to
enhance NFP with CVH-focused programming adapted from the NDPP, a yearlong, evidence-based lifestyle
intervention that promotes healthy eating and activity to reduce weight, dysglycemia, and other CVD risks, which
we have delivered to >1600 diverse, under-resourced adults at Denver Health since 2013, including >340 young
women. By leveraging unique strengths of NFP (home delivery model, professional nursing support, impact on
social determinants of health [SDOH]) with those of NDPP (evidence-based content for CVH promotion), a
combined intervention (NFP-Heart) rigorously evaluated in the ENRICH program has great potential to improve
CVH outcomes in under-resourced populations. Our Colorado Nurse Family Heart Trial will evaluate NFP-Heart
versus usual care among 600 nulliparous women (and their offspring) recruited in early pregnancy from 10 clinics
in a safety-net, urban healthcare system. NFP-Heart will promote intergenerational CVH with programming
delivered from 20 weeks gestation to 24 months postpartum by home visiting nurses. Our specific aims are 1)
develop the local NFP-Heart and common ENRICH protocols, and conduct pilot studies to confirm feasibility and
acceptability; 2) evaluate the effect of NFP-Heart on maternal and offspring CVH metrics; 3) assess the degree
to which SDOH modify the effect of the NFP-Heart intervention on maternal and offspring CVH outcomes; and
4) examine the implementation of the NFP-Heart intervention and potential for sustainability using a mixed-
methods approach."

Despite the hostile environment of the bloodstream where the host immune system is highly active, schistosomes,
parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis that affects over 200 million individuals globally, have a
remarkable ability to thrive inside the vasculature for over several decades. While the tegument (outer skin) has
been shown to play an important role in parasite immune evasion, what remains a mystery is the mechanism by
which parasites neutralize large amounts of immune components that they ingest from the host blood. Our
recently published work reveals that the esophageal gland, an anterior accessory organ of parasite's digestive
tract, is essential for schistosomes to survive inside the bloodstream. It operates by lysing ingested immune cells
before passing them into the gut, preventing them from accessing the inner parasite tissues. Such observations
lead us to hypothesize that specific esophageal gland proteins block and/or degrade host immune components,
thereby ensuring parasite survival. The main questions that we are interested in are: What are the roles of
esophageal gland factors in degrading and/or blocking host immune components and how do such functions
contribute to parasite survival? What is the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in parasite immune
evasion? These will be investigated under three specific aims: 1) Define the esophageal gland cell types and
genes; 2) Determine the role of specific esophageal gland factors in immune cell lysis and parasite survival; and
3) Determine the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in host-parasite interaction. In the first aim,
we will systematically identify esophageal gland genes by comparing RNA-seq data between parasites with and
without the esophageal gland tissue. In the second aim, we will functionally interrogate identified genes using
RNAi coupled with an in vitro feeding assay, and determine the viability of candidate gene-deficient parasites
inside the mammalian host. Preliminary results from these aims reveal dozens of esophageal gland factors, two
of which appear to be essential for degrading host immune cells. Thus, in the third aim, we will determine the
activity of the two candidate proteins, identify their binding partners, and decipher the mechanism of host-parasite
interaction. Together, we expect to bring new insights to schistosomes' esophageal gland-mediated immune
evasion mechanism by identifying essential esophageal gland factors and their mode of action. The proposed
study is innovative since our findings will likely shift the paradigm of schistosome immune evasion, which has
been thought to be driven primarily by its tegument. Our study is significant since it bridges parasite
developmental and translational biology by identifying essential esophageal gland molecules and understanding
how they operate. These candidates may be exploited in the future as potential therapeutic targets that can
complement praziquantel in its limitations and collectively contribute to the fight against schistosomiasis."
10931111,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We investigate how neuronal primary cilia regulate energy homeostasis and how
their dysregulation causes obesity. Primary cilia are cell surface projections that receive
and transduce select intercellular signals. In humans, disruption of primary cilia function
causes ciliopathies, pleiotropic diseases of which obesity is a cardinal manifestation. The
most common monogenic cause of severe human obesity is mutation of MC4R, encoding
a hypothalamic GPCR that regulates energy homeostasis.
 In the initial funding period of this project, we have demonstrated that MC4R
localizes and functions at the primary cilia in vivo, and that its localization and function are
dependent on the MC4R-associated protein MRAP2. We also found that inhibiting
adenylyl cyclase in the primary cilia of MC4R neurons causes obesity. These findings
suggest that hypothalamic neurons use cilia to communicate through MC4R to regulate
energy homeostasis.
 Here, we build on these findings, and on new genetic and molecular tools we have
developed, to investigate how ciliopathies disrupt ciliary MC4R signaling, how the ligands
of MC4R regulate its localization to cilia, and how MC4R activity is transduced by the
cilium. Together, these experiments will illuminate how cilia signaling encodes long-term
energy homeostasis and how neurons use cilia to communicate non-synaptically."
10931161,"Obesity impairs glucose and lipid metabolism and increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Women
with obesity have ~1/2 the risk of CHD as obese men. The risk of CHD goes up with menopause, but by
mechanisms distinct from obese men. The protection conferred by estrogen signaling in females is lost with
diabetes due to undefined mechanisms. The liver plays an important part in estrogen-regulated metabolism. Our
goal is to therapeutically target the beneficial hepatic actions of estrogens in males and females and discover
the mechanisms by which diabetes interacts with liver estrogen signaling to put females at high CHD risk.
 In the last funding cycle of this project, we used mouse models and metabolic tracers to discover that estrogen
signaling through hepatic estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) protects against several key aspects of obesity-
associated metabolic disease. We showed that, 1) whole body and liver insulin sensitivity are improved; 2) fatty
liver is diminished by increasing fatty acid oxidation and increasing liver VLDL output; 3) atherosclerosis is
reduced by improving HDL’s cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory properties, and by increasing liver
cholesterol delivery (reverse cholesterol transport). While examining the pathways by which hepatic ERa confers
protection for females, we made the surprising observation that it has protective effects in obese males also.
Hepatic ERa in males, 1) decreases liver fat; 2) improves liver and whole-body insulin sensitivity; 3) improves
HDL cholesterol efflux capacity. The goal of AIM1 is to amplify the beneficial effects of the hepatic ERa in male
and female mice by defining approaches to therapeutically target estrogen signaling in the liver.
 Diabetic women have the same elevated CHD risk as diabetic men. We found that hyperglycemia induces
hepatic stress, negating the benefit of hepatic estrogen signaling. Whether hyperglycemia or some aspect of
glycemic control is the mechanism by which diabetes negates the protective effect of being female remains to
be determined. We will explore mechanisms for this important biology in AIM2. Our overarching hypothesis is
that targeted hepatic estrogen signaling will benefit glucose metabolism, fatty liver, HDL function, and
atherosclerosis in obese males and females. In contrast, hyperglycemia leads to accumulation of liver glucose
metabolites that activate Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein and counters the benefits of ERa.
 Our hypothesis is innovative because we propose that targeting ERa in hepatocytes will limit many aspects
of obesity-associated disease in both females and males without unfavorable estrogen actions on other tissues.
We will also define a critical mechanism for the sex-specific impact of diabetes on CHD risk factors in females.
 Our techniques are innovative because we are applying isotopic tracers and tissue-targeted, sex-based,
therapeutics to distinguish estradiol action and glucose metabolism at the liver from profound whole-body effects.
 Our studies are significant because we will use knowledge of sex differences physiology to develop targeted
treatments that benefit both sexes. We will define a pathway that links diabetes to severe outcomes in women."
10931162,"Project Summary
Insulin resistance (IR) is a major health problem in the U.S. It precludes type II diabetes and is often present in
patients suffering from obesity, both being major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Currently,
mechanisms leading to IR are not fully understood. ET-1 is a vasoactive peptide primarily released by
endothelial cells. It is increased in patients with obesity and associated with IR. ET-1 is elevated in response to
hypoxia, which occurs in individuals with obesity. It activates two receptors, ETA and ETB, which typically
oppose each other physiologically. Our preliminary data indicate that inhibiting ETB receptors in rodents, either
genetically or pharmacologically, improves insulin tolerance and reduces fasting blood glucose. This
improvement in glucose control is associated with an increase in plasma adiponectin and adipose adiponectin
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) mRNA. In addition, adipocyte specific ETB
gain of function mice have exacerbated glucose intolerance in response to high fat feeding, while adipocyte
ETB knockout mice have improved glucose and insulin tolerance compared to floxed control littermates. These
data suggest the adipose tissue as a possible target for ET-1 induced reduction in insulin signaling. It has been
previously shown that activation of ETB receptors on cultured adipocytes inhibits the anti-lipolytic effects of
insulin. Furthermore, blockade of ETB receptors improves insulin sensitivity in a rodent model of sleep apnea.
These data suggest that increased ET-1 observed in patients with obesity may promote IR via the ETB
receptor. Thus, we hypothesize that that obesity induced tissue hypoxia promotes ET-1/ETB receptor
activation in adipose leading to IR on adipocytes, PPAR-γ inhibition and reduced Adiponectin release
by adipocytes thereby causing IR in muscle and liver tissue. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize both in
vivo and in vitro techniques. First, using cultured adipocytes, we will determine whether activation of ETB
receptors inhibits PPAR-γ, reduces adiponectin secretion, and causes insulin resistance on adipocytes. Next,
we will used clinically approved inhibitors of ET-1 receptors in a model of diet induced obesity and IR, and we
will utilize two novel mouse models that were produced by our lab that allow us to over-express or knockout
the ETB. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be tested:
Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor activation directly inhibits insulin signaling on
adipocytes and reduces adiponectin production by inhibiting PPAR-γ.
Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor activation on adipocytes promotes insulin resistance
by inhibiting PPAR-γ and reducing adiponectin release in mice.
Specific aim 3: To test the hypothesis that ETB receptor blockade increases plasma adiponectin and improves
insulin resistance in obese mice."

Endogenous glucose production (EGP) is a crucial process that maintains blood
glucose levels under fasting conditions and is normally inhibited by both glucose and
insulin. Inappropriately high EGP is the major source of hyperglycemia in individuals
with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and contributes significantly to diabetes complications. Our
groups’ ongoing work suggests that central nervous system (CNS) signals play an
important role in regulating EGP. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the
ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) appear to mediate some of the suppressive effects
of circulating insulin and glucose on EGP, but this regulation is impaired in T2D and
diabetic rodents. We have observed that lowering free fatty acid (FFA) levels completely
restored the regulation of EGP by central KATP channel activation. Therefore, we
hypothesize that chronic lipid overload may contribute to the central signaling defects in
T2D. Thus, through complementary human and rodent studies we propose to expand
our understanding of how specific CNS signaling pathways regulate EGP through the
following specific aims: 1) To establish whether central regulation of EGP can be
restored by lowering FFA levels in patients with T2D, 2) To determine whether intact
hepatic innervation is required for restoration of central regulation of EGP upon lowering
FFA in individuals with T2D, and 3) To establish whether the impaired central regulation
of EGP in T2D is mediated by neuron-specific defects in KATP channel activation within
the VMH. Furthermore, we will determine whether lowering FFA levels contributes to
restoring central regulation of glucose production by reducing endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress in specific glucose-sensing neurons. Collectively, these studies should
provide mechanistic explanation(s) for the impaired central regulation of EGP in T2D
and help point toward novel therapeutic targets."

Endotracheal intubation is a critical, life-saving procedure, and every second counts. While the process of
endotracheal intubation is common, it is still considered a high-risk procedure performed globally. In the US
alone, there are 15M operating room intubations and over 1.5M critically ill adults intubated in settings outside
of an operating room each year. Failure to intubate the trachea (wind pipe) on the first attempt occurs in 20 to
30% of tracheal intubations performed in the emergency department (ED) or intensive care unit (ICU) and is
associated with an increased risk of life-threatening complications. Introduced in the early 2000s, video
laryngoscopy was developed to assist with difficult intubation, as an alternative to the traditional practice of
direct laryngoscopy. The video laryngoscope functions by means of a video camera situated at the distal end of
the laryngoscope blade. This blade is inserted into a disposable plastic `sleeve' to prevent cross-contamination
of bodily fluids and promote camera cleanliness during the endotracheal intubation procedure. When inserted
into the mouth, it provides an indirect view of the vocal cords on a separate monitor. This tool, widely utilized
for airway visualization, has gained increasing acceptance as a first-line intervention for intubation in
emergency scenarios. The current problem with video laryngoscopy, like any camera lens, is that the visual
field can become obscured when bodily fluids or solids adhere to its external surface. This issue is among the
most common causes for failed intubation in pre-hospital, EDs, and ICU settings. During an intubation
procedure, the operator must suction away bodily fluids with a separate suction catheter and often physically
remove the scope from the mouth to wipe the external camera lens clean. This occurs while the patient is not
breathing and potentially becoming increasingly hypoxic. Research indicates that the failure rate escalates to
60-75% by the third intubation attempt, underscoring the critical importance of securing the breathing tube on
the first attempt. IVOS Medical is a device company developing an improved video laryngoscope sleeve
named the Breathing Optimization and Suction System (BOSS) G4. The BOSS G4 is a single-use, one-piece,
sleeve, designed to fit over existing video laryngoscope camera systems. When tested on our controlled
vomiting manikin among 54 airway specialists, the BOSS G4 demonstrated statistically faster intubation by
securing the airway 12 seconds quicker, reduction in measured pulmonary aspiration by 37 mL, and achieving
a first-pass success rate of 98%. The goal of this Phase II research proposal is to continue Phase I
development and manufacture clinical-ready units under Good Manufacturing Practice, conduct a preclinical
study using human cadavers, and conclude with an in-human feasibility trial at the University of California,
Irvine Medical Center. Successful completion of this NIH SBIR Phase II, will lead to a commercial ready
process for manufacturing clinical-ready BOSS G4 units, for wide spread use. We anticipate that the positive
health and economic outcomes resulting from our efforts will benefit patients, hospitals, and our company alike."

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake has progressed slowly for gay, bisexual, and other men who have
sex with men (MSM) in the United States, a population disproportionately burdened by HIV. Addressing trauma
and related sequelae may help optimize PrEP uptake in this population, as MSM are disproportionately
exposed to trauma, particularly interpersonal violence, much of which is motivated by prejudice. Interpersonal
violence carries the highest conditional risk of any trauma exposure for developing posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), risk which is further amplified when the violence is motivated by prejudice. Substance use
often occurs in response to trauma exposure and may co-occur with PTSD symptomology. There is limited but
compelling evidence to suggest that violent trauma exposure, PTSD symptomology, and substance use may
negatively affect PrEP uptake. However, research with large MSM-only samples that examines these pathways
(with temporal ordering) is lacking, as are trauma-informed PrEP interventions for MSM.
This K01 will provide the candidate, Dr. John Mark Wiginton, with the expertise, skills, and opportunities
necessary to examine prejudice-motivated interpersonal violence and PrEP uptake pathways among MSM
using latent class mediation (Research Aim 1); apply these findings, along with qualitative data from
community-engaged research with local MSM and stakeholders, toward development of a novel trauma-
informed mHealth + peer support intervention (called BOUNCE) targeting PrEP and coping self-efficacy,
peer/social support, and resilience factors (safety, autonomy, trust, trauma awareness) to support PrEP uptake
among MSM (Research Aim 2); and conduct usability testing and a proof-of-concept pilot of BOUNCE to
assess feasibility, acceptability, and PrEP uptake.
Dr. Wiginton will utilize UCSD’s training infrastructure to build his professional independence and further
cultivate his competence to develop and test trauma-informed HIV prevention interventions tailored to sexual
and gender minorities, particularly those who are multiply-marginalized, to improve HIV disparities and broader
sexual health and psychosocial wellness in these populations. Dr. Wiginton seeks training to build his topical
and theoretical expertise in trauma exposure, PTSD symptomology, associated substance use, and health
behavior impacts (Training Aim 1); gain knowledge and experience conducting community-engaged research
(Training Aim 2); develop expertise in designing trauma-informed mHealth + peer support interventions
(Training Aim 3); build competence in early-phase clinical trial methods and approaches to evaluate behavioral
interventions (Training Aim 4); and foster personal and professional development skills (Training Aim 5). With
this award, Dr. Wiginton will gain not only exceptional training, but also valuable data, from which to build his
research independence with a competitive future R34/R01 to test BOUNCE more rigorously."
10925184,"Cancer targets fall into two major categories: oncoproteins that elicit tumor essentiality due to their direct role in
tumorigenesis or tumor maintenance (oncogene dependencies) and proteins that elicit synthetic lethality with
oncogene mutations but are not themselves mutated (non-oncogene dependencies). Unfortunately, clonal
selection and inherent cancer cell plasticity—as well as the ability of cancer cells to undergo adaptation and
reprogramming to drug resistant states, following treatment—are currently challenging the concept of
individual proteins as effective therapeutic targets for an entire tumor mass—especially if identified from
bulk tissue analyses. Indeed, despite several successes, only 5% – 11% of cancer patients benefit from
targeted therapy, based on progression free survival, often with no substantial overall survival differences; while
promising, immune therapy is also subject to selective response and relapse. To address these challenges, our
proposal will study a more universal class of mutation-agnostic, non-oncogene dependencies implemented
by tightly-autoregulated sets of Master Regulator (MR) proteins that we have called Tumor Checkpoint (TC)
modules. We have shown that MR proteins mechanistically implement a tumor cell’s transcriptional state by
canalizing the effect of mutations and aberrant signals in their upstream pathways. As such, within the context
of a transcriptionally-distinct tumor subtype, they represent largely mutation-agnostic dependencies. Our
proposal will thus focus on the elucidation and pharmacological targeting of MRs and TC-modules at the
single cell level, within molecularly distinct, yet co-existing tumor subpopulations. This will lead to design
of successful combination therapy approaches and will help elucidate and pharmacologically target mechanisms
of drug resistance and cell adaptation. To accomplish these goals, we will extend a highly successful, network-
based framework developed by our CTD2 Center, for the elucidation, validation, and pharmacological targeting
of MR proteins and TC-modules. Indeed, we have shown that genetic or pharmacological targeting of this new
class of tumor dependencies can induce collapse of TC-module activity and induce loss of tumor viability in a
wide range of malignancies, ranging from glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and neuroendocrine tumors, to prostate
and breast adenocarcinoma, among many others. In particular, analysis of 25 TCGA cohorts has identified 112
transcriptionally distinct tumor subtypes, each one regulated by a distinct subtype-specific TC-module, which
was independent of patient-specific mutations. These methodologies are especially relevant in rare, aggressive
tumors—including several pediatric malignancies—where cohort size may be too small to support correlative
analyses. Critically, these studies have led to the development of two NY/CA Dpt. of Health approved, CLIA-
compliant tests, OncoTarget and OncoTreat, whose predictions have spurred several clinical trials. These
approaches will be extended to elucidate TC-module dependencies and to develop drug sensitivity biomarkers
at the single cell level."
10921834,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 1.8 million people are newly infected with HIV each year, and despite decades of research since the onset
of the AIDS pandemic, we still do not have an efficacious vaccine. A major goal of vaccine design is the elicitation
of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which target highly conserved epitopes on the HIV Envelope
glycoprotein (Env) and block viral entry into host cells, thereby conferring protection against infection with a wide
variety of strains. One such conserved bNAb epitope is the V3-glycan patch, which is the focus of this application.
BNAbs arise naturally in some chronically infected patients as a result of prolonged antibody-virus coevolution
but have never been induced by vaccination in humans. A roadblock in previous vaccination studies was that
the heavy glycosylation of Env leads to concealment of bNAb epitopes, and as such, wildtype Env is not a viable
immunogen. To overcome this challenge, modified Envs have been engineered by removing several glycans in
an attempt to expose the underlying bNAb epitopes, and these have shown moderate success at stimulating
bNAb precursor B cells. However, these bNAb precursors generally have poor neutralization activity and thus
do not endow protective immunity. Attempts have been made to shepherd bNAb precursors into bona fide bNAbs
via immunization with a series of decreasingly engineered Env proteins, a concept termed sequential
immunization, though this has yielded inconsistent results. As such, the outstanding problem which this proposal
seeks to address is: how to boost V3-glycan-targeting bNAb precursors to guide their maturation into bNAbs with
high neutralization breadth and potency. An innovative two-pronged approach will be used to tackle this problem.
In Aim 1, the evolution of a bNAb precursor-like lineage will be rigorously dissected using an immunoglobulin
knockin mouse model. In Aim 2, antibody-virus coevolution will be studied in rhesus macaques immunized with
engineered Env immunogens and subsequently infected with a related chimeric Simian-Human
Immunodeficiency Virus. Together, the results will inform the design of novel immunogens and vaccination
regimens to elicit V3-glycan-targeted bNAbs in animals and potentially humans.
 This work will be performed by MD-PhD student Ashwin Skelly under the mentorship and guidance of Sponsor
Dr. Beatrice Hahn and Co-sponsor Dr. Amelia Escolano. The individualized training plan emphasizes gaining a
solid foundation in immunology and microbiology, developing written and oral scientific communication skills,
and engaging in clinical and professional development activities. The research will be conducted in the excellent
training environment of the University of Pennsylvania and the Wistar Institute, which are equipped with all the
cutting-edge resources and facilities needed for these projects including cores for flow cytometry, next-
generation sequencing, and bioinformatics. In sum, the vibrant research environment combined with an expert
sponsorship team will fully support completion of this proposal and facilitate Ashwin’s development into an
independent investigator capable of ultimately launching his own research program as a physician-scientist."

By 2030, more than 12 million Americans will suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart arrhythmia which
dramatically increases mortality and risk of stroke. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (sotalol, dofetilide) prescribed
to treat AF reduce both morbidity and mortality, but access to them is restricted by the hospitalization period
required to initiate them. During this time, patient’s hearts are monitored by ECG to observe post-drug effects of
6 consecutive drug dosages over 3 days on the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the ECG. This interval is the
primary determinant of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) risk; TdP is a rare but life-threatening fast ventricular rhythm
which can be provoked by AADs. SafeBeat Rx Inc. develops technology that allows low-risk atrial fibrillation
patients to reproduce this ‘drug loading’ procedure outside a hospital, and thereby start heart rhythm medications
safely at home by titrating drug effects to QTc changes – the SafeBeat Kit analyzes post-drug ECGs taken by
patients at home via a machine learning algorithm, and sends the data to the relevant physicians, who can modify
or continue drug dosages as required. One significant but unresolved problem is that heart rhythms have a strong
circadian variability, often of the same magnitude as drug effects themselves, which is not measured or modeled
during drug initiation. We hypothesize that a smartwatch with ECG measurement capabilities can be used to
differentiate these circadian effects from drug effects by taking several measurements a day. Specifically, (1)
circadian effects in AF patients can be measured with traditional cardiac telemetry models (2) a smartwatch can
reproduce this model and demonstrate clinically equivalent measurements, and (3) these measurements will be
straightforward and acceptable for patients. Having established these, a planned Phase II will continue with full
clinical validation sufficient to apply for FDA 510k clearance for a circadian-adjusted QTc model of drug safety
monitoring. SafeBeat Rx Inc. is the first company to offer an in-home, remote monitoring alternative to drug load
hospitalization. At maximal adoption, the annual US beachhead market of low-risk, early-adopting patients is
calculated at $1.7B for AF alone. The company has filed key IP around this proposition and has licensing
agreements with hardware companies to enable successful scaling to serve the growing AF population."

The Southeastern Center for Microscopy of MacroMolecular Machines (SECM4), at Florida State
University (FSU) will be a service center that will enable sample preparation and cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) imaging of specimens for high-resolution biomolecular structure determination.
The center will be led by Dr. Scott Stagg and Dr. Kenneth Taylor and will feature two staff members
with complimentary expertise. This will be the second generation of the SECM4. The first generation
provided high-resolution cryo-EM data collection for cryo-EM experts. In the new generation of the
SECM4, we are expanding the scope of the resource by offsetting the cost of collecting high-resolution
data on the microscope for all users with a very modest usage fee and also by offering a large number
of new services including cryo-EM specimen optimization, specimen preparation, specimen screening,
high-resolution data collection, routine single particle data analysis, and training for all aspects of cryo-
EM from specimen preparation to processing. We will target users in the greater Southeast to be clients
for the center, specifically focusing expanding into the underserved IDeA states that have not benefitted
from the current explosion in cryo-EM due to the extraordinary costs that serve as an entry barrier. Our
approach will enable exceptional economies of scale because we will: 1) enable users at universities
across the Southeast to gain entry the cryo-EM field without making multi-million dollar investments in
instrumentation, 2) by offering screening and specimen optimization services, we will address the
biggest bottleneck in cryo-EM right now, which is preparation of cryo-EM samples that will reconstruct
to high-resolution, 3) by offering in person training and offsetting the travel costs, we will enable
interested users to gain entry into the field of cryo-EM without having to seek out a collaboration with an

High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most aggressive OC subtype that accounts for 80% of OC-related
deaths. Rapid emergence of platinum (Pt)-resistance is the main reason for this mortality. Despite initial
response to surgery plus chemotherapy, tumors relapse and rapidly become chemoresistant in 80% of patients.
Although few genetic mutations have been associated with chemoresistance, in a large fraction of tumors, drivers
of the chemoresistance's rapid emergence are unknown. Here we propose that non-genetic mechanisms play
an important part in regulating cellular transition to a resistant state in high grade serous ovarian cancer. We
will tackle the emergence of Pt resistance from a global transcriptional reprogramming point of view. Our
published and preliminary findings support the hypothesis that Pt resistance emerges from therapy-induced
population-level epigenomic and transcriptional reprogramming. Through integrative analysis of epigenomes
and transcriptomes of multiple naïve and cisplatin-resistant isogenic cells, we identified resistant-state specific
super-enhancers and their target transcription factor networks (TFN). The first aim employs cutting edge
genomic mapping and manipulation technologies including single cell-level CRISPR-perturbations followed by
transcriptome profiling to identify which TFs and TF-combinations are necessary to reprogram naïve cells into
the resistant state. The second aim investigates a novel combinatorial target to achieve synthetic lethality with
carboplatin in HGSOC. The findings from this proposal will provide new mechanistic insight into the role of key
transcription factor network that govern platinum resistance in ovarian cancer."

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was uniformly fatal prior to the 1960s. Survival rates today
approach 95%, making ALL one of medicine's great success stories. As the number of survivors across the US
has increased, the focus of research has shifted to life after cancer. Research in ALL survivors has highlighted
problems in executive functions, representing mental functions governed by the frontal lobes. Most patients will
be cured prior to entering kindergarten, meaning that these neurocognitive problems potentially create a lifetime
burden. Indeed, research in long-term survivors of ALL show that neurocognitive difficulties affect scholastic and
vocational success, creating a profound and long-lasting burden on quality of life. While survivorship issues are
well-documented, research in young patients undergoing treatment is lagging. Our plan to assess
neurodevelopmental changes in patients during treatment will help pinpoint the timing and extent of neurotoxic
exposures in children treated for ALL, providing tangible opportunities to implement strategies of remediation
and prevention. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify markers of altered neurocognitive development
in ALL patients. We recently piloted a prospective study where young ALL patients completed neurocognitive
evaluations and non-sedated neuroimaging on two occasions occurring at a 6-month interval. Preliminary
outcomes highlighted the importance of evaluating growth trajectories in gaining insights into the etiology of
neurocognitive morbidity. In our pilot study decrements in executive functions (EF) were observed. We also
observed that frontal white matter growth was substantially slower in ALL patients relative to peers. And finally,
increased concentrations of neurofilament light, which is a marker of axonal damage, was associated with a
slower rate of change in frontal white matter volume in ALL patients. Based on our groundwork results, we
propose to evaluate early markers of abnormal neurodevelopmental trajectories in ALL patients undergoing
active treatment. We will employ a longitudinal design where newly diagnosed ALL patients between the ages
of 3-6 years old (n=30) will be compared to controls (n=30). Leveraging the power of a within-subject design,
participants will be assessed on three occasions occurring at major treatment milestones (180 observations
total). Using validated cognitive neuroscience paradigms, we will identify changes in discrete aspects of
executive function for aim 1. Non-sedated structural and functional neuroimaging will be used for the work
proposed under aim 2 to evaluate changes in brain volume, connectivity, and metabolism. Lastly, we will utilize
ultrasensitive digital assays for quantifying neurochemical markers of brain injury in ALL patients. Results from
this work will have impactful implications for understanding early neurodevelopmental changes in children
undergoing treatment for ALL, providing a framework for subsequent studies linking early markers to
neurocognitive outcomes in survivorship. Gaining insight into early neurodevelopmental change is invaluable for
future efforts aimed at curbing neurotoxicity of cancer treatment."

One of the most surprising discoveries from the Human Genome Project is that only about 1.5% of the genome
codes for proteins, whereas around 46% comprises transposable elements (TEs). Functional assessment of
how these ubiquitous TEs affect human development and health has posed a major challenge. While most TEs
are considered non-functional, or “junk” DNA, here I argue that TE-induced gene regulation is strongly
underestimated due to the historical tendency to explore TE functionality by studying individual TEs
independently of each other. I propose to provide a novel framework to study how interactions between the
hitherto “junk” TE sequences can regulate pre-mRNA splicing to affect gene function, and investigate whether
such a mechanism could substantially affect both human development and evolution, and help explain the
genetic etiology of human diseases. This proposal is inspired from my recent discovery that the interaction
between a pair of Alu retrotransposons may explain the long-sought genetic basis for the evolution of tail loss in
human and apes. Based on this work and my preliminary data, I will first use the Alu pair interaction in TBXT
gene as a model to demonstrate that the interaction between intronic TEs can profoundly impact human
development and health, and explain the etiology of a common genetic disease (Aim 1). Aim 2 proposes to test
the hypothesis that the isoform of TBXT induced by interaction of the Alu pair pleiotropically contributes to
strengthening of hindlimbs, thus directly testing the long-standing hypothesis that the tail-loss evolution in
hominoids is associated with bipedal locomotion evolution (Aim 2). Beyond the specific interaction of the Alu pair
in the TBXT gene, Aim 3 will develop an algorithm called TEILO (Transposable Element Interaction & Local
Organization) to systematically identify the functional TE interactions that affect gene function and human health
by modulating alternative splicing. This work promises to provide a new paradigm to studying the interaction
between TEs and its implication to human health and diseases."

Transmembrane adhesion proteins play an important role in molecular transport, signal
transduction, energy utilization and many other basic cellular functions. Their activity is
modulated by mechanical signals, that are typically sensed and transduced through changes in
conformation, function and biochemical interactions. Integrin transmembrane receptors respond
to mechanical forces from the microenvironment by changing conformation and ligand binding.
These changes regulate the assembly of adhesions between cells and the extracellular
environment and, in turn, control cell activity, including spreading and migration. However, the
molecular origin of these mechanisms remains largely elusive. The present research is focused
on determining the molecular origin of integrin mechanosensing and how it relates to cell motion
using multiscale modeling techniques. We will combine molecular dynamics simulations with
new coarse-graining methods and mesoscale stochastic approaches in order to identify the
conformational pathways underlying the responses of integrin to variations in the mechanics of
the microenvironment. Then, we will study how this conformational pathway regulates cell
motion. Results will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanochemical functions of
integrin, for future control of cells’ activity in several human pathologies."
10918287,"Project Summary- Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC),
evades hormonal treatment modalities, and patients with TNBC experience high rates of metastasis and have
a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is a critical need to find better approaches to treat TNBC. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)
represents an interesting target in this regard, as SIRT1 has been shown to be implicated in cancer as a
tumor suppressor, and in fact, SIRT1 mRNA and protein are significantly downregulated in TNBC. Previous
work has shown that decreasing SIRT1 in human TNBC cells promotes the generation of a secretome
containing soluble hydrolases and a large number of exosomes, a specific class of extracellular vesicles, with
unique cargo. Furthermore, the hydrolases and exosomes produced by TNBC cells depleted of SIRT1 were
shown to promote the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells by promoting cell survival, invasive activity, and
metastasis. Thus, it is important to determine whether decreasing SIRT1 expression or activity in vivo in
mouse models of breast cancer promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis. Additionally, the mechanism for
decreased expression of SIRT1 in TNBC is largely unknown, and a better understanding of SIRT1 regulation
will uncover changes in cancer-promoting pathways that make TNBC so aggressive. In this proposal, the
effects of decreased SIRT1 expression or activity on tumorigenesis and metastasis will be elucidated (Aim 1),
and the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory factors that decrease SIRT1 expression in TNBC
will be identified (Aim 2). In Aim 1, three distinct, yet complementary, mouse models of breast cancer will be
used to determine the effects of altered SIRT1 expression or pharmacologic modulation of SIRT1 activity on
cancer progression in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor growth, invasiveness, and angiogenesis,
as well as rate of metastasis. In Aim 2, precision nuclear run-on RNA sequencing (PRO-Seq) and small RNA
sequencing will be performed to elucidate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of SIRT1,
respectively. For this aim, a system of three human BC cell lines with varying levels of SIRT1 expression will
be used. Changes in transcriptional regulation and microRNA expression with PRO-Seq and small RNA-Seq,
respectively, will be determined by comparing across these three cell lines. Due to the highly aggressive
nature of and difficulty to treat TNBC, it is imperative to develop new therapeutic strategies that slow
tumorigenesis and metastasis. Through the outlined six-year training plan in Drs. Richard Cerione and Robert
Weiss’s labs, which have expertise in elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms and their effects in vivo
through mouse models, by determining the effects of low SIRT1 levels in mouse models of BC and the
regulatory factors that mediate this downregulation, this proposal holds promise for clarifying the role of
SIRT1 as a tumor suppressor in TNBC."

Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell neoplasm with poor prognosis but promising future treatment. Current
measurements of myeloma disease burden are suboptimal, and this limits clinical care. We have completed a
first-in-human trial of CD38-targeted immunoPET with the radiolabeled anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, 89Zr-
DFO-daratumumab, which very successfully visualized myeloma disease burden as never done before. This
proposal is a phase 2 clinical trial to identify clinically valuable applications of CD38-targeted immunoPET in
patients with multiple myeloma.
Our central hypothesis is that targeted imaging of CD38, which is expressed on the surface of virtually every
myeloma cell, will allow clinically valuable non-invasive immuno-PET imaging of patients with myeloma. This
would be a transformative strategy for the measurement of myeloma tumor burden, selection of therapeutic
agents, and monitoring of treatment response.
In the first aim of the study, we will determine the correlation between tumor uptake of 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab
with clinically standard laboratory and imaging measurement of myeloma, including patient serum M protein
concentration, percentage of plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, FDG PET/CT, and whole-body MR. Because
current approaches to assessing myeloma tumor burden are sub-optimal, developing a method to sensitively
visualize and localize myeloma could have a profound impact on patient care.
In the second aim of the study, we will determine if tumor uptake of 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab predicts response
to daratumumab-containing combination therapy. Not all patients respond to daratumumab therapy; thus, a
method of predicting response would be valuable for selection of therapy in individual patients.
In the third aim, we will determine if 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab imaging following daratumumab-containing
combination therapy can detect clinically significant residual disease. Detection of minimal residual disease
(MRD) following therapy continues to grow in importance as a prognostic marker and endpoint in myeloma
clinical trials. A method of visualizing and localizing residual disease would impact patient care, as well as
enhance trials of developing myeloma therapies.
The ultimate goal of this work would be the identification of clinically valuable applications for 89Zr-DFO-
daratumumab immunoPET and, if successful, advancement toward FDA approval of this agent."

Dementia is expected to impact 75 million people by 2030. It is inevitably considered progressive and irreversible
in nature and culminates into an advanced stage. However, paradoxical episodes of unexpected cognitive
lucidity (paradoxical lucidity [PL]) especially near the end of life have been reported anecdotally for years in
patients with advanced dementia. Although, little is known about PL, yet if confirmed systematically, its
occurrence may challenge current assumptions and highlight the possibility of a network-level return of cognitive
function. This may provide novel insights into the underlying neurobiology and delineate future therapeutic
possibilities. While, there is no definition of PL, and no systematic studies have assessed the epidemiology,
neurologic underpinnings, and phenomenology of PL in dementia, however, lucidity and/or consciousness with
phenomenological similarities to PL have been described during other brain states which are also not expected
to support lucidity. This includes severe cerebral ischemia in cardiac arrest (CA) (at times referred to as near-
death experiences [NDE]). Some data suggests these lucid death related episodes may correlate with surges in
electrocortical activity, which may in turn provide mechanistic insights and biological plausibility for PL in severe
dementia. We have pioneered research into NDE’s and found a similar phenomenology to PL in severe
dementia. Our team has conducted largescale multisite studies, including a current 20-site study of NDE’s in
1500 CA subjects with real-time biomarkers of electrocortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG). We
are proposing to test the hypothesis that patients with advanced end stage dementia with an estimated life
expectancy 7 days can be successfully identified and recruited into a study exploring episodes of PL at the end
of life. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the use of symptom diaries and video, audio and EEG monitoring will
be feasible and deemed not sufficiently intrusive to prevent its use for patients or their families at the end of life
in a larger prospective study.Through a multidisciplinary team, including the Visiting Nurse Service of New York’s
(VNSNY) hospice services we aim to systematically study the phenomenology, characteristics, and
electrocortical biomarkers of PL in dementia and create a measurement scale.The R21 phase aims are 1) To
obtain necessary and sufficient data to determine the safety and feasibility of using symptom diaries and real-
time video EEG monitoring for a future study of PL in advanced dementia 2) To obtain necessary and sufficient
data to design a prospective cohort study of PL in advanced dementia and its underlying cerebral electrocortical
biomarkers The R33 phase aims are to 3) Conduct a mixed methods prospective study of PL during end stage
advanced dementia 4) Create a definition and measurement scale for PL in advanced dementia and to 5) Explore
the potential electrocortical biomarkers of PL in advanced dementia."

Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a devastating disease representing 30% of newly diagnosed cancer cases
amongst females in the US (276,480 newly diagnosed cases in 2020) and the second leading cancer cause of
death in females. The challenge with BC is its heterogeneity in terms of molecular alterations. For example,
Stage I/II BC patients are typically subjected to molecular subtyping using expression analysis of a mRNA gene
panel, for example the PAM50 panel. The 4 major molecular subtypes include Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-
enriched, and Basal-like subtypes with each one associated with a certain treatment regimen to optimize clinical
outcomes for those patients. These tests are performed from a solid tissue biopsy to satisfy the mass
requirements of the molecular subtyping assay (100 ng of RNA). The assay to determine the molecular subtype
of the BC patients uses reporter probes and fluorescent dyes to provide high multiplexing capabilities, but
requires single-molecule fluorescence readout of mRNA/reporter probe assemblies stretched on a glass slide.
Liquid biopsy samples, for example extracellular vesicles (EVs), are an attractive alternative to solid-tissue
biopsies for managing cancer-related diseases. The attractive nature of liquid biopsies is the minimally invasive
nature of their acquisition and that they can report on the status of the primary tumor as well as metastatic sites.
However, a challenge with liquid biopsy samples is the limited mass of nucleic acid material they supply. For
example, 108 EVs secured from a Stage I/II BC patient would provide ~1.5 ng of mRNA.
In this R21 project, an innovative mRNA identification/quantification technology will be generated that can
accommodate the mass limits associated with liquid biopsy samples. The technology consists of a dual in-plane
nanopore sensor comprised of microfluidic and nanofluidic structures fabricated in a plastic, for example PMMA,
using replication-based techniques such as injection molding. The sensor consists of properly engineered input
microstructures to allow for high sampling efficiency to provide an exquisite limit-of-detection (<5 ng of RNA).
The nanofluidic elements consist of a nanochannel (50 × 50 nm, width × depth, length >5 µm) flanked on either
side by an in-plane pore (10 – 30 nm effective diameter). Using resistive pulse sensing (RPS), unique reporter
probes can be identified by their characteristic current transient amplitudes, temporal profiles, and/or dwell times.
In addition, because two pores are placed in series, the molecular-dependent electrophoretic mobility of the
reporter probes can be deduced, which will add an additional layer of identification information to expand the
multiplexing capability of the RPS readout (>27plex). The reporter probes consist of gene-specific sequences,
and a DNA backbone to which is hybridized RNA segments bearing 1 of 3 different proteins (avidin, streptavidin,
or neutravidin). The utility of the dual in-plane nanopore sensor will be demonstrated in a proof-of-concept clinical
study to molecular subtype BC patients using mRNAs sourced from EVs harvested from a plasma sample. The
EVs will be affinity selected from plasma using both epithelial and mesenchymal markers."

The Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) is a national sequencing initiative focused on identifying
genetic risk factors for AD. The project’s discovery phase includes whole exome sequencing (WES) of 10,061
unrelated non-White Hispanic individuals of European ancestry (NHW-EA) cases (N=5,096) and controls
(N=4,965), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 584 NHW and Hispanic/Latino (HL) familial samples. The
'Discovery Extension Phase' of the project added WGS on ~430 additional familial samples. The ADSP Follow-
Up Study 1.0 (ADSP-FUS 1.0) Phase focused on examining candidate variants from the discovery phase, and
identification of novel variants through combined analysis of diverse datasets, is ongoing. Its aim is to sequence
existing cohorts with unrelated AD cases that 'encompass the richest possible ethnic diversity' as well as highly
valuable set of autopsy confirmed cases and controls. In total we have already included in FUS over 50,000
samples for sequencing including >4,700 autopsy confirmed cases and controls, >9,400 HL ancestry cases and
controls and > 8,300 African Ancestry (AA) cases and controls. In this ADSP-FUS 2.0 application, which focuses
on the PAR-21-212 goal to increase diversity cohorts in the ADSP with WGS, we are proposing sequencing,
QC and phenotype harmonization of an additional ~16,000 individuals (~12,000 HL ancestry, 500 autopsied
NHW-EA, ~3,400 AA and ~170 Asian ancestry individuals) that will both increase our power to find effects and
will also enhance our ability to find genetic effects in underserved groups. Additionally, these datasets will
become an invaluable resource for the AD research community at-large."
10909859,"Genomic instability and dysregulated epigenetic control are now both recognized as hallmarks of cancer,
although the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. Both lead to abnormal gene expression, and
gains and losses of function that can promote oncogenesis. Tumor suppressor genes are often repressed by
hypermethylation of CpG sites. Cancer genomes are also frequently globally hypomethylated.
Hypomethylation of gene-regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites and enhancers, may
cause lineage-inappropriate “ectopic” gene expression, and activation of oncogenic pathways. Highly
expressed genes specific to cancer cells make attractive positive biomarkers that may be useful in diagnostic
tests, or new targets for therapy. Negative biomarkers resulting from loss of gene expression in cancer are
problematic due to their indirect nature and nonspecificity. In contrast to the role of hypermethylation in
cancer, the impact of hypomethylation is very understudied. Sezary syndrome (SS), an aggressive, leukemic
variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a good model for studies of cancer-associated
hypomethylation because it is one of the most heavily hypomethylated cancers. SS, which has 6-8 fold higher
incidence in the Veteran population, is marked by frequent mutations in epigenetic modulators, including
enzymes involved in methyation and demethylation of DNA. We recently published a gene expression profiling
study of malignant T cells in SS using high resolution microarrays, and identified a number of highly
overexpressed genes specific to SS T cells (SS-HEG), that could function as positive biomarkers. We have
also published our discovery that promoter hypomethylation is associated with overexpression of PLS3,
GATA6, and TWIST1 genes in SS T cells, and that DNA methylation can regulate PLS3 gene expression. To
more fully explore the effect of DNA methylation changes that may drive ectopic gene expression in SS, we
have recently obtained genome wide DNA methylation profiles for SS T cells. Our preliminary data shows that
additional SS-HEG are significantly hypomethylated in SS T cells, suggesting that DNA hypomethylation may
contribute to overexpression of these genes. Additional preliminary data indicates that DNA methylation may
also contribute to ectopic gene expression in mycosis fungoides (MF). MF represents more than half of CTCL
cases, but malignant T cells in MF are limited to the skin. For several coordinately overexpressed and
hypomethylated genes in SS, CpG hypomethylation was also increased in T cells eluted from MF tumors.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that altered DNA methylation supports pathogenic and ectopic
gene expression in early and progressing MF/SS. This will be addressed with the following specific aims.
Aim 1. Identify key epigenetic drivers of ectopic gene expression in SS. Paired transcriptome sequencing and
genome-wide DNA methylation assays will map differential methylation and gene expression in SS T cells from
the same subject to identify biomarkers of advanced disease. Aim 2. Identify SS-HEG that are useful
biomarkers of disease severity in MF. DNA methylation profiles of SS and MF tumor-eluted T cells will be
compared to identify SS-HEG differentially methylated in both lineages. Selected SS-HEG will be examined in
lesional T cells eluted from early and late MF to identify stage-associated biomarkers. Aim 3. Identify SS-HEG
that drive MF/SS progression. SS-HEG will be examined longitudinally in progressors and non-progressors. A
novel facet of our approach will be to conduct RNA sequencing on both resting and activated T cells, so DNA
methylation may be correlated to both basal gene expression and the permissiveness of activation. The
conclusion of the proposed experiments will yield useful gene expression and DNA methylation biomarkers
that could enable earlier diagnosis of CTCL in Veterans. This could prevent years of inappropriate therapy for
Veterans suffering from CTCL. The research plan will also produce mechanistic insight into CTCL
pathogenesis, and generate an experimental model for studies of skin-derived MF T cells."

10909730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is an Administrative Supplement for a parent Beeson K76 Career Development award that will address
the unmet need for patient-specific decision support tools for surgical interventions in older adults and provide
a platform for Dr. Carolyn Seib to become a leader in geriatric surgery. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is
a common endocrine disorder in older adults that is associated with serious long-term morbidity, including
osteoporotic fractures, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Parathyroidectomy can prevent these
morbid sequelae. However, increased surgical risk associated with advanced age and frailty, in addition to the
competing risk of death prior to achieving benefit from surgical intervention, raises the question of whether the
risks of parathyroidectomy outweigh long-term risk reduction in this group. Identifying older adults likely to
benefit from surgical interventions, such as parathyroidectomy, while preventing overuse in this vulnerable
group, is critical to improve patient-centered care. There is no standardized methodology for developing
surgical decision support for older adults that incorporates individualized risk prediction and stakeholder input
to facilitate patient-centered decision-making. Therefore, this coordinated research and training proposal aims
to: 1) compare the effects of parathyroidectomy vs. medical management on the incidence of fractures, kidney
stones, and CKD in older adults with PHPT; 2) develop and validate predictive models for the perioperative
risks of parathyroidectomy and long-term risks of fractures, kidney stones, and CKD specific to older adults
with PHPT; and 3) design and test with stakeholder feedback a PHPT decision support tool that describes the
tradeoffs of parathyroidectomy vs. non-operative management. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Seib will obtain
training in comparative effectiveness and predictive modeling, qualitative and mixed methods research, and
implementation science, which will support Dr. Seib’s transition to research independence. Upon completion of
this research, Dr. Seib will have a user-tested risk/benefit calculator that will form the basis of a decision
support tool to improve patient-centered treatment recommendations for older adults with PHPT. In addition,
this research will establish a framework for developing patient-centered decision support that can be applied to
other conditions to promote appropriate surgical management of older adults. This proposal is significant
because it directly addresses the gap in decision support tools for PHPT and other surgically managed
conditions in older adults. This project is innovative because it proposes a paradigm shift to incorporate
geriatric principles to individualize treatment decisions in older adults with PHPT to optimize clinical outcomes.
At the end of the proposed research, Dr. Seib will have the data and skills necessary to successfully pursue
R01 funding for a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to test this decision support tool and apply
this methodology to other conditions with surgical treatment options that affect older adults."
10909842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aortic dissection (AD) is a devastating cardiovascular disease known for its rapid propagation and high morbidity
and mortality. Diagnosis of the initial presentation of AD is a challenge because the symptoms are similar to
those of many other health problems. In the absence of intervention, AD results in a mortality rate of up to 90%,
with most of these deaths occurring within 48 hours of the onset of AD. AD is among the top 20 causes of death
in the US, with 20-40% of patients die even before reaching hospital. There is a clear problem in our ability to
manage AD patients in their crucial initial stage of development and to develop strategies for a timely treatment.
 AD usually initiates at a focal region that shows disrupted microarchitecture and compromised mechanical
properties. Once dissected, the mechanical behavior of the separated aortic wall tissues become greatly affected,
suggesting that layering discontinuity may play a role in triggering AD. Considering these distinct mechanical
processes, we expect that understanding the evolvement of the focal and layering abnormalities may provide
useful insights into the development of early diagnostic and intervention. The goal of this proposed research is
to advance our understanding of the important role of local tissue mechanical properties and microstructures of
the arterial wall in in the initiation and progression of AD.
 Large elastic arteries consist of concentric layers of elastic lamellae with inhomogeneously distributed
elastic and collagen extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers. Our recent studies revealed several previously
unrecognized findings, which provide strong evidence that ECM inhomogeneity is physiologically important. The
overarching hypothesis of this proposed research is that the evolvement of inhomogeneity in local mechanical
properties and ECM microstructure, both along and across the arterial wall, are triggering factors of AD. We will
test this hypothesis using state-of-the-art quantitative ECM imaging, noninvasive local mechanical property
mapping, discrete-finite element modelling, and tissue testing and validation with three aims: Specific Aim 1: To
establish mappings of local ECM structure and mechanical properties of human thoracic aorta with sub-millimeter
resolution. Specific Aim 2: To investigate the depth- and region-dependence of aortic layer delamination. Specific
Aim 3: To create a computational model that incorporates ECM structural inhomogeneity and local wall
mechanical properties to predict the propensity of AD.
 The knowledge we gain from this research is expected to provide insights into biomechanical markers useful
for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. The new biomechanical markers considering local structural and
mechanical inhomogeneities will identify the origin and propensity of AD with direct clinical impact on the
developments of new early diagnostics and interventions."
10909847,"Senescent cells (SnCs) represent an alternative cellular fate resistant to apoptosis that accompanies and characterizes the aging process. Many of these cells, including immunosenescent cells, manifest a highly pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype that may contribute to a vicious cycle of inflammation following an initial stimulus, such as an acute infection, ultimately leading to organ failure and sepsis. Sepsis represents the leading cause of in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality, and older patients suffer disproportionately poor outcomes, both initially and longer term. Novel senolytic drugs such as fisetin, a flavonoid natural product, effectively reduce senescent cells, inflammation, and organ failure in preclinical models of sepsis. However, dosing, drug target engagement, and biological and clinical efficacy remain unknown in human patients. The overarching goal of this project is to advance the science surrounding the therapeutic potential of senolytics in sepsis. To achieve this goal, we will conduct a multi-center adaptive, dose-finding, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized control trial with three aims. The first aim is to determine the optimally effective dose of fisetin to reduce SnCs in older admitted patients with an acute infection. We will enroll older patients with acute infection not yet requiring mechanical ventilation or vasopressors and randomize to one of several doses of fisetin or placebo using clinically relevant, bolus dosing and test the short (7 day) and medium term (28 day) effect on peripherally measured SnCs. The second aim will test the effect of treatment on peripherally measured inflammation, with a particular focus on pathways affected by SnCs and relevant to sepsis. Finally, the trial will measure the effect on organ failure at 1 week using validated measures and using a Bayesian paradigm to determine the predictive probability of success of a definitive Phase 3 trial. The anticipated impact of this research is high. This project will promote understanding of the relationship of SnCs to sepsis pathophysiology, determine if fisetin effectively modulates these inflammatory pathways in aging individuals, and establish whether further research investment in a definitive trial is warranted."

Despite major breakthroughs over the past few years in our basic understanding of the cellular and molecular
changes that lead to cancer, many key steps in carcinogenesis and changes in early cancers that promote
invasion and metastasis, still remain poorly defined. Rigorous training of future young investigators in cancer
biology will be essential in our quest for a deeper understanding of carcinogenesis and for the development of
better methods of early cancer detection, improved diagnosis, and effective new cancer treatments. The
Training Program in Cancer Biology (TPCB) is a multidisciplinary program across all cancer subtypes that
capitalizes on the unique strengths and training opportunities at CU Anschutz, including world renowned
research in functional genomics, experimental therapeutics, steroid receptor signaling, stem cells and organ
specific cancers (in particular lung, breast and blood). Our goal is to provide interdisciplinary training at the
cutting edge of cancer research to best prepare our trainees to compete in a biomedical research environment
increasingly focused on translational applications of basic research. Our training plan consists of laboratory
training, didactic activities, attendance at scientific conferences, professional development and career
mentoring, development of communication skills, and exposure to the clinical perspective. Based on feedback
from trainees and faculty, for this renewal we have added new training components, including mandatory
mentor training and training in rigor and reproducibility. The renewal also includes expanded opportunities for
training in quantitative biology and bioinformatics, and expanded clinical/translational and career development
opportunities. The co-PIs of this training program have been leaders in Cancer Biology training at the
University of Colorado Cancer Center and the Graduate School during the past 10 years. Resources from the
Cancer Center, the Graduate School, and individual departments are committed to support the training
program. The infrastructure of the Cancer Center is particularly important as it provides core resources
available to training faculty that are therefore available to the trainees. The proposed program will include pre-
doctoral training through the graduate training program in Cancer Biology, which is housed in the Graduate
School, and post-doctoral training for PhD and PhD/MD scientists. A total of 38 training faculty were selected
based on their scientific expertise and track record of mentorship. The first cycle of this T32 grant was highly
successful, with all slots competitively filled. For the second cycle of this grant, we propose to support 4
postdoc and 4 predoctoral trainees each year. We will select trainees from external and internal pools based
on their research and academic records and commitment to cancer research. We are committed to providing
comprehensive training at all levels so as to best prepare our trainees for successful careers in biomedical
science inside or outside academia."
10909850,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long term goal of the proposal is to determine the role of pulsatility during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
for preserving endothelial function and preventing organ injury after cardiac surgery. More than 400,000 people
undergo cardiac surgery in the United States each year which allows them to live longer and more fulfilling lives,
but if the surgery is complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) mortality increases up to 10-fold. Dr. Clendenen is
a Cardiothoracic Anesthesiologist dedicated to improving clinical outcomes after cardiac procedures and this
K23 proposal is designed to provide him with the structured mentorship and training necessary to become a
leader in innovative clinical trials designed to improve patient outcomes. He has developed a collaborative
mentorship team led by Dr. Adit Ginde who is an Emergency Medicine Physician and national PI for a large
PETAL network clinical trial with 3,000 participants, with co-mentorship provided by Dr. Sarah Faubel, an expert
in renal disease research, and Dr. Kristen Jablonski Nowak, a recognized leader in endothelial function.
Methodological advisors include Dr. Alex Kaizer (Biostatistics) and Dr. Kerrie Moreau (Vascular Biology). This
proposal leverages the collective expertise of an established mentorship team and the unique environment at
the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center that incorporates a tertiary referral center for cardiac surgery
in the setting of a large public research University. These ample resources will allow Dr. Clendenen to address
key barriers to reducing morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery with an adaptive clinical trial comparing the
incidence of AKI after cardiac surgery with pulsatile versus non-pulsatile CPB. He will accomplish this by
determining the effect of pulsatile CPB on post-operative endothelial function in a prospective observational
cohort (Aim 1), determining the timing of endothelial dysfunction and renal injury after cardiac surgery in the
same cohort (Aim 2), and determining the optimal level and efficacy of pulsatility during CPB to prevent AKI with
an adaptive seamless phase IIa/IIb clinical trial (Aim 3). These specific aims require Dr. Clendenen to develop
expertise in assessing clinical endothelial function and AKI risk and designing and completing an adaptive clinical
trial. He will accomplish this with a focused career development plan including coursework on clinical trial design
and biostatistics alongside structured training in assessing endothelial function to measure the effects of CPB.
Completion of the proposed project will provide the necessary mentorship, training, and experience required to
allow Dr. Clendenen to become a leader in adaptive clinical trials to improve outcomes after cardiac surgery."
10911060,"There is convincing evidence for both inflammatory and autoimmune phenomena to be involved in the
pathogenesis of PAH. However, both the triggering and the disease sustaining mechanisms remain elusive.
Based on emerging evidence in other diseases, including arthritis, kidney disease, and cancer, generated
by Co-Investigators on this project, it has become clear that the Complement system, when dysregulated,
can become a potent instigator of inflammation-driven tissue injury. Our recently published data
demonstrated, we believe for the first time, that the immunoglobulin-driven activation of the complement
cascade, specifically its alternative pathway, in the pulmonary perivascular areas is a critical mechanism
initiating pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative processes in experimental hypoxic PH (a form of “sterile
inflammation”). We also demonstrated that the activated complement cascade and immunoglobulin G (IgG)
deposition are persistent determinants of the disease. The present proposal builds on these findings and
comprises both mechanistic and translational arms. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the role of immunoglobulins
and complement in initiation of pro-inflammatory processes in PH. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the role of
immunoglobulins and complement in the sustained progression of vascular injury and the disease process. In
a potentially highly translational Aim 3 we will test the efficacy of targeted (local) complement inhibition in
experimental PH using a novel complement inhibitor, human fusion protein termed TT32, which can be used
to target local activated complement signaling."
10911063,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammation is central to PH pathogenesis, as a clear trigger of human and experimental disease including
autoimmune scleroderma and schistosomiasis infection. Blocking inflammation prevents PH in pre-clinical
models, including schistosomiasis and hypoxic sterile inflammation. However, targeting inflammation faces
significant challenges, as no therapies have yet been proven to be of clinical benefit. Potential mechanisms
that limit this therapeutic approach include: non-targeted immunosuppression suppressing both deleterious
and protective pathways; patient-to-patient heterogeneity resulting in only some subsets of patients benefiting,
without biomarker identification; and a variable contribution of inflammation to vascular pathology over the
disease course. Our research group, working within the context of this PPG submission, is uniquely poised to
interrogate mechanisms that link innate and adaptive immunity in PH. We focus on the interplay between
complement, monocytes and macrophages in innate immunity, and CD4 T cells in adaptive immunity. Our
body of work has demonstrated that Type 2 adaptive immunity driven by Schistosoma exposure (the cause of
schistosomiasis, a major PAH etiology), triggers an innate immune response with recruitment of Ly6c+
monocytes, resulting in perivascular thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) expression, leading to latent TGF-β activation
that drives the vascular pathology. We now propose to leverage clearly defined antigenic triggers and
mechanistic intermediate and endpoints in Schistosoma-PH to interrogate how complement activates adaptive
and innate immunity resulting in vascular remodeling. We will study mechanisms underlying disease
persistence versus recovery, focusing on potential dual roles of complement and activated TGF-β as initially
inciting of PH, and subsequently suppressing Schistosoma-triggered inflammation and PH as the antigenic
burden is cleared. Our third Aim is translational, investigating the peripheral blood immune cell phenotype as it
relates to complement and TSP-1 in subjects schistosomiasis, idiopathic and scleroderma-associated
pulmonary arterial hypertension, supporting the overall rigor and impact of our studies. Hypothesis: As an
innate trigger of adaptive immunity, complement activation is necessary for Type 2 inflammation, monocyte
recruitment, and activation of TGF-β by TSP-1, initially contributing to PH and later helping in the resolution of
Schistosoma-induced inflammation and PH. Specific Aim 1: To determine that complement is necessary for
Type 2 inflammation-driven PH. Specific Aim 2: To determine that complement-dependent TSP-1+ monocyte
recruitment contributes to both the initial development and subsequent resolution of Schistosoma-triggered
inflammation and PH. Specific Aim 3: To determine that peripheral blood complement levels correlate with
leukocyte and cytokine signatures in humans with schistosomiasis, scleroderma and idiopathic PAH. Our
overall goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets to safely and effectively target underlying disease drivers in
PH, to meaningfully impact the disease course."
10911064,"There is growing evidence of the role of inflammation as a trigger and enhancer of pulmonary vascular
remodeling in pulmonary hypertension (PH). This PPG focuses on the role of complement as a trigger of
pulmonary vascular disease and PH. The overall guiding concept for Project 3 is the key angle of disease
heterogeneity at multiple levels: at the whole diseased human lung level, lesional level in a diseased lung, at
the level of similar lesions among IPAH lungs, and animal models of PH. It is the central goal of this Proposal to
provide the significance of the mechanistic studies developed in Projects 1,2, and 4.
Our central hypothesis is that key molecular fingerprints including RNA expression and cellular combined
with extracellular proteomes can be used to define molecularly specific pulmonary vascular lesions in
PAH. These profiles will reflect prolonged activation of complement and the subsequent remodeled
perivascular environment. We rely on a comprehensive approach based on interrogation of human diseased
and control lungs, and plasma of a large cohort of well characterized IPAH patients and controls (Aim 1), robust
models of severe PH (Aim 2), and mechanistic investigations in the bovine model of hypoxic PH (Aim 3), using
high throughput approaches of genomics, proteomics, and immune localization at the lung tissue level.
Specifically, AIM 1 will test the hypothesis that there is evidence of complement activation in IPAH pulmonary
vascular lesions, which are related to specific proteomic and genomic fingerprints; AIM 2 will Identify shared
molecular signatures established from the human IPAH as compared with the bovine and rat SU5416 models of
PH, with a focus on prioritization of therapeutic strategies targeting complement and extracellular matrix
remodeling; and, AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that blockade of complement in a large animal model of PH will
lead to decreased proinflammatory microenvironment and normalization of the pulmonary vascular proteome.
This proposal is highly significant as it addresses the key aspect of molecular heterogeneity among pulmonary
vascular lesions and among patients, and animal models; it serves to provide a central translational angle to
mechanistic studies in Projects 1,2, and 4 as it seeks to identify complement activation markers in diseased
human tissue and robust models of disease. Moreover, it will provide evidence linking complement blockade in
reverting a PH proinflammatory phenotype and PH proteome. Project 3 introduces highly novel approaches,
including the assessment of the proteome and transcriptome at the lesional level, high throughput
immunofluorescence imaging at the tissue level, and novel approaches to block complement."
10911069,"PROJECT 4 (ESI) examines the mechanisms by which complement activated platelets drive endothelial
activation and monocyte/macrophage proinflammatory differentiation and recruitment, promoting vascular
remodeling in pulmonary hypertension (PH). Accumulating data from both human and animal studies by our
laboratory and others demonstrate a role for platelets in the initiation and progression of PH, however what drives
platelet activation and how platelets mediate vascular remodeling in PH has not been addressed. Project 4
utilizes several novel and innovative in vivo and in vitro approaches employing genetic and pharmacologic
methods to examine the role of complement mediated platelet activation in two murine models of PH to test the
overall hypothesis that complement-mediated activation of platelets induces endothelial activation and drives the
recruitment and proinflammatory activation of monocytes to the pulmonary vasculature promoting pulmonary
vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Complement-mediated platelet activation may occur in
inflammatory conditions via complement anaphylatoxin activation of platelets. Whether anaphylatoxins activate
platelets and drive platelet activation in PH is unknown and is the focus of aim 1. Endothelial dysfunction is
central to the pathogenesis of PH, and endothelial cells from patients and animals with PH demonstrate
increased expression of proteins which promote platelet-endothelial adhesion. While the mechanisms for platelet
recruitment and adherence to the endothelium is well described in hemostasis and thrombosis, it is poorly
understood in inflammatory conditions and has not been evaluated in PH. The goal of aim 2 is to determine the
mechanisms of complement mediated platelet activation to platelet endothelial adhesion and how platelet
adhesion to the endothelium promotes endothelial activation in experimental PH. Monocyte and macrophage
recruitment and accumulation within the perivascular/adventitial space is a consistent feature of pulmonary
vascular remodeling associated with PH in both humans and all animal models, however the mechanisms driving
these processes remain poorly understood. Aim 3 will investigate the mechanisms by which complement
activated platelets support the recruitment and activation of blood borne monocytes to the pulmonary vasculature
promoting pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. The overall objective of these studies
is to determine whether complement activated platelets drive endothelial and monocyte activation promoting
pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, setting the stage for future studies targeting the platelet immune
response with novel currently available therapies."

Knowledge and confidence in entrepreneurship are increasingly important skills possessed by those pursuing
careers in the biomedical research workforce. Entrepreneurship has emerged as “the most potent economic
force” and can be an avenue to increase the number of research innovations that cross the bridge from bench
to bedside. However, gender and underrepresented minority (URM) gaps in entrepreneurship have been
documented, with reports of only 3-8% of women-founded firms receiving venture capital and only 1% of
companies being founded or co-founded by African Americans. In fact, in the United States, only 11.8% of
inventors are women. Through the STEM-Coaching and Resources for Entrepreneurial Women (CREW)
Program, our goal is to address the disparity in gender in innovation and entrepreneurial activities and increase
the number of women, including URM women, who participate in entrepreneurial activities. One unique aspect
of our approach is complementing mentoring with coaching, as coaching has been shown to be four
times more effective than training/mentoring alone. Specifically, we will train coaches in behavioral coaching
and establish teams of coaches as well as entrepreneurial experts who will serve as mentors. We will enhance
entrepreneurial skills through one-on-one and group coaching for women researchers. We will train nascent
entrepreneurs in topics germane to innovation and entrepreneurship and establish a climate of innovation. We
will also facilitate institutional and systemic change by disseminating our findings via focused communications
and interactions among all participants, ultimately establishing an entrepreneurial network. We will leverage the
expertise of our Advisory Committee, the commitment and support of our leadership and regional institutions.
Our program evaluation will use the RE-AIM framework. We will assess how our program increases the number
of women who participate in entrepreneurial activities through multi-method program evaluation including
assessments of the program’s ability to reach a diverse population, satisfaction with program offerings, and
changes in entrepreneurship outcomes. Evaluations of program activities will be completed using REDCap
questionnaires. Validated coaching, entrepreneurial, and satisfaction/experience measures will be utilized.
Overall, our approach will increase the number of women who are entrepreneurs and increase the level of
entrepreneurship in South Carolina. Because the coaching component takes a holistic approach by encouraging
women to craft a vision for their work and life, it provides value that will last beyond their current projects and
beyond entrepreneurship activities. We plan to establish a manual with our best practices for implementing
similar programs at other institutions, thus exerting an impact on a national level."

Fractures and resulting morbidity, mortality and costs are a large and growing burden among older men. The fracture rate increases exponentially after age 65, and the average age of hip fracture is >80 yrs. Fracture risk in later life is strongly influenced by long term declines in bone density, structure and strength, and during this period skeletal change accelerates. 
The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) is an ongoing, prospective study of risk factors for osteoporotic fractures in older men. The study continues to follows men who were initially enrolled in 2000-2. MrOS is best phenotyped cohort of the oldest men – now in the 9th and 10th decades of life – when fractures are a major threat to maintaining independence. More than 20 years ago, we began to obtain serial DXA measures and complete clinical phenotyping. 
At baseline, hip and spine CT scans (N=3695) were obtained to assess bone structure and strength. Similarly, HR-pQCT (XtremeCTII) scans were obtained in a large number of men (N=1831) in 2014-6. Thus, MrOS remains the unique source of data and discoveries about musculoskeletal aging in men, and is uniquely suited to address several key clinical and mechanistic knowledge gaps regarding skeletal fragility in older men. The study’s comprehensive bone imaging, its long follow-up and the very old age of the cohort provide unparalleled opportunities to generate novel information needed to design effective approaches to reduce the burden of fractures in older men. 
The overarching goal of this project is to provide continuity in the organization of the study, continue the infrastructure for the MrOS project, allow for continued follow-up of the participants, and support the collection of limited study measurements. 
The specific aims of this project are to support the ongoing MrOS infrastructure. These include to 1) continue follow-up for MrOS participants for fractures, falls, mobility limitation and death; 2) collect repeat HR-pQCT scans in a subset of active MrOS participants; and 3) maintain the scientific organization for study communications; publications and ancillary review; and the public data release infrastructure. 
These aims will provide the critical framework required to address future scientific goals, such as characterization of the circumstances of fractures in the oldest old; quantification of change in peripheral bone microarchitecture by HR-pQCT and identification of determinants of that change; and determination of the utility of hip and spine CT based CT-FEA measures to predict fracture risk in older men."
10911023,"Diabetes (DM) complications are the major cause of its morbidity, mortality, and costs. MVP009 has
advanced understanding of the underlying genetics. Since DM care does not take advantage of progress in
genetics, we propose to use genetics to support both clinical translation and mechanistic discovery.
 In MVP009, we utilized highly specific phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
(i) heart failure (HF) with preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction; (ii) hypoglycemia – severe (emergency visits)
and incidental (outpatient visits); (iii) kidney disease; and (iv) eye disease. We also found that although typical,
“juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D)” excludes military service, at least 10% of Veterans with presumed T2D
in MVP may have “adult onset T1D” – largely unrecognized. We now propose to extend these findings.
 Consistent with the Precision Medicine in Diabetes Consensus Report, our Aims target precision in
(i) diagnosis (genetic T1D vs. T2D), (ii) treatment [combining genetic with traditional risk factors (RF)], and (iii)
prognosis (epigenomic contributions to complications) – to incorporate genetics so that care can be more
accurate and individualized, and identify mechanisms that can lead to discovery of new treatments.
 Aim 1: Assess the contributions of T1D and T2D genetic loads to the clinical characteristics
and disease trajectories of people presumed to have T2D. We will model multiethnic genetic risk with T1D
and T2D polygenic risk scores (PRS, with multiethnic data from large recent studies); each MVP Veteran will
have both a T1D and a T2D PRS. Outcomes will include incident DM, and the disease trajectory: age and BMI
at onset, time to insulin Rx, and ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. We will evaluate the utility of the PRS to
identify Veterans with DM who would benefit from definitive T1D testing and/or early use of insulin.
 Aim 2: Assess the combined contributions of genetic/nongenetic RF to development of
complications. (SubAim a) Identify effect modifications between RF and complications. Genetic
interaction analyses will include lifestyle, demographics, and comorbidities (e.g., blood pressure, HbA1c), as
modifiers of the risk of complications conferred by disease loci and PRS. We will use both hypothesis-testing
approaches for known loci and PRS, and hypothesis-generating approaches (using genome-wide G×E
modeling) to examine interactions associated with diabetic eye disease (DED), kidney disease (DKD), HF, and
hypoglycemia, and causal associations using state-of-the-art Mendelian Randomization (MR), including
multivariable and mediation MR. (SubAim b) Develop and test predictive models. We will use summary
statistics from the MVP GWAS and the literature, to develop separate PRS using the “best practice” recent
method, for DED, DKD, HF, and hypoglycemia, and PheWAS with the PRSs to elucidate previously unknown
RFs. Utilizing the PRS, PheWAS, information from SubAim (a), clinical RF, and treatments, we will develop
genome-informed predictive models that will be evaluated in eMERGE and more recent MVP participants.
 Aim 3: Identify epigenomic markers and molecular systems underlying DM complications.
Epigenomic changes regulate gene expression, can mediate environmental and physiologic effects, and have
been associated with T2D and related glycemic traits. We hypothesize that differential methylation will also be
associated with DM complications. Methylation information using the EPIC chip (>850,000 sites) will be
available on >30,000 Veterans, and can be imputed in other Veterans, allowing epigenomic and multi-omic
methods such as aggregation analysis and epigenome-wide association studies to (i) identify associations with
the complications of DM as well as hypoglycemia, and (ii) identify the genes and pathways involved.
 Impact: The genetics of diagnosis, G×E, epigenomics, and predictive models should both aid
translation – to identify risk in individuals, and help personalize treatment to reduce DM complications and
hypoglycemia – and support discovery of new therapies to mitigate the underlying processes."
10911903,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Alcohol is the most prevalently used substance among gay and bisexual men (GBM). Additionally, alcohol is
inextricably linked to GBM culture and often used as a precursor or enabler of sexual activity. Alcohol-involved
sex often involves engaging in sexual behavior that places persons at higher risk for HIV seroconversion such
as condomless anal sex. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV-seroconversion, but
recommended medication formulations are daily pills with moderately high levels of adherence to be most
effective. Substance-using GBM have been shown to have lower levels of adherence compared to non-using
GBM, but scant research has investigated the impact that alcohol consumption has on PrEP adherence.
Therefore, the proposed study will collect pilot data to investigate the effects of alcohol use and misuse on
PrEP adherence. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Westmoreland will describe patterns
of alcohol use and sexual behavior among PrEP-using GBM, identify the role that alcohol use plays in daily
PrEP adherence using multiple methodologies to collect aggregate (e.g., 30 day) and detailed (e.g. ecological
momentary assessment (EMA)) data, and contextualize PrEP non-adherence related to alcohol consumption.
In Aim 1, Dr. Westmoreland will use baseline qualitative and quantitative data to describe patterns of alcohol
use and sexual behavior. She will also use the narratives from qualitative interviews to add to the growing
literature surrounding barriers to PrEP uptake and engagement in the PrEP care continuum. In Aim 2, Dr.
Westmoreland will use multiple sources of data—i.e. quantitative surveys, timeline follow-back interviews
(TLFB), diary entries collected twice-weekly for 10 weeks (i.e. EMA data), and dried blood spot (DBS)
specimens for alcohol and PrEP adherence monitoring—to quantitatively identify the role that alcohol plays in
daily PrEP adherence. By using multiple data collection techniques, she will also be able to pinpoint and
validate estimates of alcohol use and PrEP adherence. In Aim 3, Dr. Westmoreland will use qualitative data
from follow-up interviews to contextualize PrEP non-adherence related to alcohol consumption. Additionally,
she will use these follow-up interviews to help characterize participants’ perceived changes in risk over the
follow-up time period that could lead to deviations from daily PrEP use. Dr. Westmoreland will build on her prior
training as a STI and HIV epidemiologist to expand her expertise into alcohol research and develop new
analytical skills needed to conduct impactful sexual behavior research. These skills will include collecting and
analyzing qualitative data; working with EMA, TLFB, and DBS data; implementation science, grant-writing, and
scientific communication. Through methods coursework and workshops, alcohol-focused workshops and
seminars, mentorship, and professional meetings, Dr. Westmoreland will gain the skills she needs to apply for
her first R01 grant and pursue a career in HIV prevention research as a tenure-track principal investigator."

Despite major progress in malaria reduction in Latin America from 2005-2015, malaria cases have again
increased to nearly one million in the last few years, with 75% of these cases reported in Venezuela and Brazil.
We emphasize that ecological variables (such as ecotones and land use classes) that impact the primary
neotropical vector Anopheles darlingi (in Brazil and Venezuela) and the regional vector An. albitarsis s.l. (equal
in importance to An. darlingi in Venezuela) are largely unquantified or unidentified, constituting a major
information gap. The premise of the proposed study is that human-modified landscape types (riverine, mining,
agricultural) in persistent malaria hotspots differ significantly in measurable determinants of transmission
(ecological, entomological, socioeconomic). Quantification of these determinants in landscape types in
Venezuela and Brazil is essential for malaria surveillance to facilitate local targeted interventions to most
effectively reduce transmission. Coupling these measures with landscape genomics, we propose to identify
and quantify, in a spatially explicit way, landscape features affecting microevolution of malaria vectors. This will
provide new insights into local vector adaptation in heterogeneous landscapes, and will help determine why
neotropical malaria hotspots persist, at times over multiple years, in certain geographic locations. We
hypothesize that the ecological drivers of abundance, proliferation and survival in An. darlingi and An. albitarsis
s.l. will differ significantly due to unique ecological signatures (niches) of each species. We anticipate that our
findings will provide new information about differential habitat suitability that can be applied throughout the
broad and largely overlapping distributions of An. darlingi and An. albitarsis s.l. Polymorphism discovery
through whole genome resequencing, integrated with measures of entomological and socioeconomic factors
that intensify human-vector contact, will reveal the evolutionary genetic basis of factors promoting vector
proliferation and connectivity among vector populations, allowing for more effective vector surveillance. A key
remaining issue in our understanding of the role of An. darlingi landscape genomics in malaria transmission is
whether gene flow contributes to rapid adaptation and colonization of deforested/degraded habitats throughout
the Amazon Basin. We will employ landscape genomics at a regional scale in both Brazil and Venezuela to
test whether An. darlingi maintains genetic connectivity or is isolated by resistance across ecotones
punctuated by high forest cover. Whereas population genetic surveys based on RADseq or individual genes
can detect overall population structure, whole genome sequencing studies have shown that these limited
surveys may miss important patterns of ancestry, gene flow and evidence of adaptation (Anopheles gambiae
1000 Genomes Consortium 2017). Herein we present an integrated approach to identify and quantify
ecological, entomological and socioeconomic drivers of malaria transmission, based on multi-scale analysis of
An. darlingi and An. albitarsis s.l. collected under natural field conditions."
10912027,"Project Summary:
 The goal of this F30 proposal is to characterize novel pathways of T-cell activation that contribute to
cardiac fibrosis and systolic dysfunction in heart failure (HF), and simultaneously train to be a successful
physician scientist. HF is a leading cause of death worldwide, and consists of irreversible cardiac fibrosis,
progressive loss of cardiac function, and cardiac inflammation. While both local and systemic inflammation have
been observed in patients with HF, no anti-inflammatory therapies have successfully been used in HF,
highlighting the need for a deeper mechanistic study of the cardiac inflammatory response. Damage associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) signal myeloid cells to promote antigen presentation to T-cells, which infiltrate the
heart and participate in cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. DAMP signaling converges on two adaptor proteins:
Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β
(TRIF), which initiate both independent and overlapping pro-inflammatory pathways. MyD88 and TRIF, along
with DAMP receptors, are also expressed in T-cells, implying T-cell DAMP sensing can impact T-cell activation
in an antigen-independent manner, termed “bystander activation.” However, the significance of bystander T-cell
activation in HF and mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. My lab has shown that reconstitution of
T-cell deficient mice (Tcra-/-), normally protected from HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), with
type I helper T-cells (Th1) in the onset of TAC partially restores cardiac fibrosis. Mechanistically, this is dependent
on Th1 cell adhesion to and activation of cardiac fibroblasts. I surprisingly found that reconstitution of Tcra-/- mice
with Myd88-/- Th1 cells resulted in significantly higher numbers of cardiac T-cells and enhanced cardiac fibrosis
than WT Th1 cells. I also found that Myd88-/- and Trif-/- Th1 cells showed opposite effects on T-cell effector
functions and survival. In two specific aims, I will test the central hypothesis that DAMP signaling through MyD88
and TRIF differentially regulates T-cell effector functions and contributes to cardiac fibrosis and systolic
dysfunction in HF. In SA1 I will investigate whether signaling through MyD88 and TRIF differentially contributes
to T-cell activation and cell survival and the mechanisms involved. In SA2 I will characterize the contribution of
T-cell MyD88 and TRIF to cardiac fibrosis and systolic dysfunction in experimental HF in vivo, and the specific
mechanisms of cardiac fibroblast activation in vitro. Successful completion of these aims will uncover novel
mechanisms of T-cell mediated cardiac fibrosis in HF, while supporting a tailored training plan that integrates
clinical and research training to prepare me for a career as an independent physician scientist."

 A wide range of vascular catheters provide access to the blood stream enabling administration of
therapies, nutrition, and removal of toxins and metabolites. Approximately 135 million critical vascular access
procedures are performed in US hospitals annually. When not maintained consistently microbial infections and
thrombotic occlusions affect catheter lumens compromising performance and posing risk to the patient’s life.
These catheter complications are challenging to manage and expensive to treat.
 Only a few products on the market address intraluminal complications of vascular access devices.
Infection prevention products such as antimicrobial end caps, drug eluting antimicrobial connectors and coated
catheters are limited by the lack of long-term protection (rapid depletion of active agents), and/ or only offer
localized protection of the hubs/ports. Heparin locks leak at the catheter tip and are replaced by blood making
them ineffective and heparin coated catheters fail to prevent long-term thrombus formation. One product that is
used to reverse thrombotic occlusion is CathFlo®. However, it is expensive (~$90/dose), requires long wait times
(2-4h) to restore patency and, is used only after a lumen is occluded and not in preventative mode. The applicants
have developed a unique product that combines both anti-infective and anti-thrombotic technologies to effectively
reduce intraluminal infections and thrombotic occlusions in vascular catheters. If this novel technology is
commercialized successfully, it will be the first product on the market with both functionalities.
 The goal of the proposed feasibility studies is to develop an optimal design for this early-stage concept
and study its performance in appropriate preclinical models. Preliminary design optimization studies will be
conducted to select a technology configuration with superior performance with respect to the dual functionalities,
namely antimicrobial and anti-thrombotic. In vitro models will be employed to evaluate the antimicrobial
performance and the anti-thrombotic occlusion properties of designs will be assessed in an in vitro blood flow
model. Biocompatibility and mechanical testing of the proposed technology will also be conducted using relevant
standards. Appropriate sample size and controls (including uncoated catheters, antimicrobial end caps, coated
catheters and CathFlo®) will be employed in the proposed studies. Demonstration of feasibility in Phase-I will
set the stage for further commercialization of this technology."

Cellular therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases offers a novel treatment option with possible
increased efficacy and decreased toxicity. We are performing the first multi-center double blind placebo
controlled dose escalation trial of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for standard of care refractory lupus. This
Phase II trial is based on promising data from open label trials in China and our own Phase I trial. Response
rates very from 65-75% in reports from China while we saw an SRI-4 response in 5/6 patients we treated with
umbilical cord derived MSCs. There are nine US centers participating in the MiSLE trial. Due to impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to reach our goal of 81 patients during a previously funded NIAID U01
grant that expired in March, 2023. Sixty two of the 81 patients are either randomized or treated as of now. We
were meeting our benchmarks of 1.98 patients per month until a COVID induced shutdown the trial for months.
We are recruiting patients at this rate again. In the trial to this point, we have had no safety signals, no issues
with infrastructure and patients meeting the primary study endpoint of the SRI-4. This is a critical trial to finish
to definitely show if there is a treatment effect of MSCs in lupus and to delineate the mechanisms by which MSCs
impact disease. In the Phase I trial we found marked impacts on extra follicular derived B cells. We are seeing
similar trends in preliminary analysis of the Phase II trial, though we are blinded as to treatment group. We have
introduced novel methods of multi-parameter statistical analysis to enhance detecting a treatment effect. In
mechanistic studies we will complete the analyses of B and T cell subsets, receptor diversity and epigenetics
over the course of the trial. Based on the development of new technology, we will perform CyTOF on
mononuclear cell populations, Cite Seq single cell analysis and plasma microbiome assays. These assays will
be performed at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 24. We have sufficient stored samples to perform the proposed assays. This
highly impactful trial will provide important insight into changes over time of key immune mediators of lupus,
perhaps allowing pre-treatment identification of patients most likely to respond to MSC treatment."
10931350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This K23 award will solidify the applicant’s capacity to conduct independent patient-focused,
multicomponent dietary supplement clinical trials for mental health conditions. This proposal focuses on
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. ADHD is a central element in an early causal pathway
to future depression, anxiety disorders, substance misuse, job and relationship failures, chronic health problems,
suicide, and premature death. It is, therefore, a major public health priority. Perhaps the most impairing single
feature of ADHD, which cuts across disorders and remains difficult to treat, is extreme emotional dysregulation
(anger, moodiness, and irritability). The candidate has conducted clinical trials in children and adults with ADHD
and emotional dysregulation that have shown benefit for a multinutrient dietary supplement containing all known
vitamins and essential minerals. Limiting the reach and generalizability of this promising intervention, previous
studies have included a majority of white, non-Hispanic participants; imprecise behavior change data; and limited
examination of the multinutrients’ mechanisms of action. This proposal addresses these key issues. Aim 1
proposes a community-based, qualitative study using focus groups with Black and Hispanic parents to elicit their
priorities concerning their child’s mental health and barriers to participation in research. Aims 2 and 3 propose
a feasibility and acceptability study (pilot clinical trial) of the intervention in Black and Hispanic children. The
study design will be informed by focus group feedback. Aim 2 tests real-time parent-reported behavior change
in their child based on a targeted problem identified by the parent. Aim 3 tests the at-home biospecimen collection
of blood and urine to initiate an examination of immune and neurotransmitter biomarker signals. Career
development areas align closely with the research aims, and include training in community engagement and
mixed methods to identify mental health priorities of diverse communities; mediator/moderator models and
neuroimmune factors that affect mental health in order to initiate biomarker investigation; and professional
development including leadership and grant writing skills. Career development will occur at a resource-rich
academic medical center. The application is bolstered by an interdisciplinary mentor team of intellectually,
racially, and ethnically diverse individuals. While this proposal focuses on ADHD and emotional dysregulation in
children, the applicant’s training and proposal results are expected to generalize to CIH research broadly, as the
NCCIH prioritizes increasing research participant diversity and examining biomarkers for mechanistic signals.
This K23 will provide the applicant with the training and preliminary data to be competitive for an R01 study of
the promising multinutrient intervention using refined data and biospecimen collection methods in a larger,
diverse sample while testing biomarker hypotheses, building on the award findings. This application will enable
the applicant to advance a larger program of research investigating multicomponent CIH interventions for patient
populations with emotional dysregulation across mental health diagnoses."
10906183,"AgRP neurons: circadian control and interactions with the HPA axis
AgRP neurons play a key role driving feeding. They are activated by feedback signals reporting low energy
stores, and their activation promotes the seeking and eating of food. Remarkably, they are also regulated by
feedforward cues that anticipate future needs and outcomes. The central role of AgRP neurons is further
highlighted by their ability to cause many of the adaptive physiologic responses to fasting. Given the primacy
of AgRP neurons, it is important that we understand how they are regulated, what processes they control, and
how they bring about such control. With this in mind, this grant pursues the following two Aims:
Aim 1: To study SCN / circadian feedforward activation of AgRP neurons and feeding. In this Aim, we
extend the concept of feedforward anticipatory regulation by determining if the SCN engages AgRP neurons to
proactively schedule daily feeding and prevent future energy deficits. While it is known that feeding is under
circadian control, and that this is important because mis-timed feeding causes disease, it is entirely unknown
how the circadian system does this. To investigate SCN control of AgRP neurons, we have developed the
unique ability to continuously monitor AgRP neuron activity in vivo over many days, while simultaneously
monitoring rhythms in feeding, body temperature (Tb), locomotor activity (LMA), and in other neurons. Using
this approach, we have found that: i) AgRP neuron activity oscillates with a 24 hr cycle (peaking later in the
day, falling later in the night) in both light/dark and constant darkness conditions, ii) that peaks and troughs in
AgRP neuron activity are in-phase with SCN neurons, and iii) that with “jet lag” (6 hr advancement of the light
cycle), the AgRP neuron rhythm re-entrains gradually over 8 days in parallel with rhythms in feeding, Tb and
LMA. Based on this and optogenetic stimulation studies, we propose that the SCN, by inhibiting an intervening
GABAergic neuron, activates (disinhibits) AgRP neurons, and that this causes circadian control of feeding.
Aim 2: To investigate reciprocal interactions between AgRP neurons and the HPA axis. In this Aim, we
examine reciprocal interactions between AgRP neurons and the HPA axis. First, we follow up on our discovery
that corticosterone directly activates AgRP neurons by establishing the electrophysiologic, transcriptional and
epigenomic mechanism for this activation. Also, we determine if activation of AgRP neurons by corticosterone
causes the metabolic consequences of Cushing’s syndrome and chronic stress. Second, we extend the role of
AgRP neurons in causing brain-based adaptations to fasting by establishing their role in driving the HPA axis.
We have discovered that AgRP neurons potently activate PVHCrh neurons and the HPA axis, and we propose
that they do this by inhibiting GABAergic “gateway” neurons that connect AgRP neurons to PVH-Crh neurons.
Finally, linking Aims 1 and 2, we simultaneously assess rhythms in AgRP and PVH-Crh neurons, and
investigate if SCN regulation of AgRP neurons drives circadian control of the HPA axis, or vice versa."
10906362,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the cell surface regulate most physiological processes and are
important drug targets with ~34% of all prescribed drugs targeting them. Classically, upon agonist stimulation,
GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins, causing downstream signaling throughout the cell. In order to
terminate G protein signaling, cells have devised a specialized desensitization mechanism that includes receptor
phosphorylation by GPCR kinases and subsequent recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs) to the phosphorylated
receptors. The GPCR–βarrs interaction both blocks the G protein-binding site at the receptor core and promotes
receptor endocytosis. Recently, however, we discovered that some GPCRs interact with βarrs exclusively
through their phosphorylated C-terminal tails. Since βarrs do not block the G protein-binding site in this `tail'
conformation, the receptor can associate with βarrs and G proteins simultaneously to form GPCR–G protein–
βarr `megaplexes.' The assembly of these megaplexes allows the receptor to continue to stimulate G protein
signaling while being internalized into endosomes by βarrs. Thus, the existence of the core and tail GPCR–βarr
complex conformations suggests that βarrs act as spatiotemporal master regulators of G protein signaling: When
bound to the receptor core, βarrs regulate the duration of G protein signaling whereas βarrs control the cellular
location from where G proteins are activated from when associated with the receptor C-terminal tail. As the
underlying properties that promote these two complex conformations remain elusive, my research objectives
over the next 5 years involve determining these molecular driving forces on a general scale. Our preliminary data
suggest that phosphorylation site clusters located within the receptor C-terminal tail are required for the
association with βarrs in the tail conformation. Therefore, we plan to establish whether the presence of these
phosphorylation site clusters correlates with the capacity of GPCRs to engage in mechanisms that lead to
sustained endosomal G protein signaling. In regards to the GPCR–βarr core conformation, the fingerloop domain
(FLD) of βarrs inserts itself into the transmembrane core of most GPCRs via its hydrophobic tip and receptor-
specific residues. To characterize this interaction on a general scale, we will examine whether these receptor-
specific βarr-FLD residues correlate with G protein subtype coupling of different GPCRs. Finally, βarrs modulate
the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which terminate Gs-cAMP signaling. However, our preliminary data
raise the possibility that this modulation occurs specifically by βarrs in the core conformation. Therefore, we will
apply a combination of cell biological, biochemical, and proteomics approaches to examine whether modulation
of PDEs and other desensitization mechanism is mediated specifically by distinct βarr conformations. My vision
with this research program is to elucidate how GPCR signaling is regulated spatiotemporally by βarrs, which
may lead to differentiated physiological responses. The knowledge acquired here will be used to design new and
innovative therapeutics that specifically target GPCRs in time and space."

10926849,"ABSTRACT – BIOSPECIMENS AND PATIENT REGISTRY CORE (CORE B)
The goal of the Biospecimens and Patient Registry Core (Core B) is to provide the Mayo Clinic SPORE in 
Ovarian Cancer investigators with high quality patient clinical data, DNA, RNA, blood products, and tissues 
(normal and malignant) from consented patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma 
and suitable controls, and to make these resources available for future studies. The Mayo Clinic has a strong 
tradition of ethically sound support of research that links tissue acquisition and patient data records. Paraffin 
embedded tissues, histological slides, and associated patient charts from surgeries performed since the first 
decade of the 1900's are maintained in Mayo’s Tissue Registry and the Mayo Archives. Core B interacts with 
i) the Pathology Research Core of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, which provides expertise, collaborative 
support, and service for immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, tissue microarray construction, and digital 
imaging; ii) the Biospecimens Accessioning and Processing Core, which is the primary site of accessioning 
and standardized processing of blood and frozen tissue collected explicitly for research from all three Mayo 
sites; and iii) the Cytogenetics Core, which has expertise in establishing, validating, and scoring fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. Core B is integrated with these existing tissue-oriented Cancer Center 
shared resources and other scientific Cores of this SPORE to provide a coordinated, centralized, dedicated 
program for standardized collection, accessioning, processing, morphologic classification, and genomic 
annotation of biospecimens so that these can be studied in the context of patient data from fully consented 
patients. Thorough clinical annotation is required to maximize the potential use of tissue specimens in 
translational research; therefore, risk factor questionnaires, clinical records, and pathology review are 
incorporated into the Core. Research services, including pathologic review of tumor histology, tumor sectioning 
and quality control, blood processing, construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs), immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
and FISH, will be provided as needed to SPORE investigators. Core B is closely coordinated with the 
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C) to provide seamless linkage of clinical annotation with research 
specimens for data management and analyses. In Years 6-10 of Mayo Clinic SPORE in Ovarian Cancer 
funding, Core B distributed 4326 ovarian tumor tissues, 511 TMA slides, and 3628 germline DNA samples. In 
addition, Core B undertook a systematic evaluation of common ovarian cancer susceptibility genes in all stored

Project 1: Shaping the Microenvironment by DPEP1 Facilitates Adenoma Progression
Project 1 aims to examine how shaping the microenvironment by DPEP1 facilitates adenoma progression. This
will be a basic project. We propose that dipeptidase-1 (DPEP1) marks those adenomas with the potential to
progress to colorectal cancer (CRC) through an active bi-directional communication with neutrophils. DPEP1
has two functions: dipeptidase activity and recently identified neutrophil-binding activity. Our hypothesis is that
DPEP1, largely through its neutrophil-binding activity, marks adenomas with a predilection for progression. We
have found that DPEP1 immunoreactivity is detected in 27% of colorectal adenomas but this increases to 72%
of CRCs, consistent with DPEP1 marking the small subset of adenomas that progress to CRC. Utilizing human
specimens, a unique Transwell co-culture system of adenoma organoids and freshly isolated neutrophils isolated
from healthy volunteers, and an informative mouse model, we will test if DPEP1-expressing adenomas more
effectively communicate with neutrophils and create a neutrophil-enriched microenvironment, increasing the
likelihood that these adenomas will progress. Exosomes have attracted a great deal of recent attention as a rich
source of cargo that may serve as cancer biomarkers. We have found that DPEP1 is released in exosomes from
CRC cell lines and that it highly enriched in a subset of exosomes that contain known CRC biomarkers, CEA
and EPCAM. Of interest, neutrophils also release small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) that contain neutrophil
elastase in a form that cannot be inhibited by elastase inhibitors, and thus it is especially potent in degrading the
extracellular matrix, a key step in cancer invasion. We will also use a unique neutrophil reporter mouse to monitor
onset and perdurance of neutrophil infiltration, along with the properties of these neutrophils, in an inducible,
stem cell-driven mouse model of colonic adenomas.

10926864,"Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a public health problem, affecting over a million people each year globally
and, in the United States, consistently ranks in the top 2-3 causes of cancer-related death in men and women
despite the wide adoption of colonoscopy. Metachronous pre-cancers are also high following polypectomy.
However, only a small percent of colon pre-cancers (conventional adenomas or sessile serrated lesions)
progress to CRC, and we lack both molecular markers to identify these individuals and an understanding of the
mechanisms fostering pre-cancer. The large disease burden of CRC, co-localized with the densely populated
colon microbiota, and the recognition that many CRC risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity, carnivorous diet) modify
the colon microbiota has spurred investigations into ‘if and how’ the microbiota contributes to CRC pathogenesis.
Accrued data now strongly support the hypothesis that the microbiota is a key environmental contributor to colon
carcinogenesis. Nonetheless, little is yet known about ‘if and how’ the microbiota contributes to colon pre-
cancers. Our preliminary data identify Escherichia coli that release the non-ribosomal, metabolite genotoxin,
colibactin, known as pks+ E. coli (Ecpks), as strongly associated with detection of colon pre-cancers. Further,
colibactin is reported to induce specific mutational signatures in colon epithelial cell DNA, in particular, mutations
in APC, a CRC driver gene particularly important in adenoma development. Notably, these Ecpks mutations
have been associated with CRC. In our COLON MAP study, we have also identified that sessile serrated lesions
which account for a large proportion of interval CRC, are likely a result of microbial insult. However, it remains
unknown whether Ecpks contributes to SSL development and progression. The few previous human studies,
including our preliminary studies, are based on a cross-sectional design. Thus, to address this gap and
understand the temporal sequence, we will also include a longitudinal design and human colonoids models to
test our core hypothesis that a subset of Ecpks associate with and contribute to driving human pre-cancer
progression. We will use a wide array of iterative approaches and conceptual and experimental integration of
this project with Projects 1 and 3 and the cores of this U54. Our specific aims in this translational project are: 1)
To evaluate the association of Ecpks colonization with human colorectal pre-cancers with greater progressive
vs. lower (“indolent”) potential using in-hand human cohorts, clinical predictors, and longitudinal data; 2) To
examine mechanisms associated with pre-cancer colon lesions stratified by disease state (indolent or
progressive) and Ecpks status using whole exome sequencing, single cell RNAseq and multiplex
immunofluorescence (MxIF) approaches; and 3) To identify Ecpks virulence determinants associated with
progressive (vs indolent) colon pre-cancer and disease mechanisms using human colonoid models. Together,
our studies have the potential to accelerate noninvasive, cost-effective CRC screening and surveillance for a
critical subset of individuals at increased risk for sporadic CRC."

Project 3: Co-Evolution Mechanisms of Pre-Cancer-Immune Interactions in Shaping Adaptive
Cytotoxicity and Myeloid-Derived Suppression
The pre-cancer-to-cancer transition is a critical juncture in colorectal cancer (CRC) biology that has clinical value
in prevention and surveillance. This transition is characterized by an “evolutionary arms race” where the body’s
immune system seeks to eliminate the tumor while the tumor cells evolve mechanisms to suppress and evade
the immune system. The small number of human pre-precancers that transition into cancer precludes effective
predictive modeling of critical genetic and microenvironmental factors that drive these alterations. Herein, we will
leverage regional intratumoral heterogeneity, due to asynchronicity of evolution, with spatially resolved profiling
technologies on human tumor specimens to build trajectories of pre-cancer transition into malignancy. We will
model two pathways of pre-cancer transitions, the conventional pathway driven by mutations in the WNT
pathway and the serrated pathway characterized by an immunogenic microenvironment. Our previous pre-
cancer atlas describes a dichotomy between stemness in tumor cells and cytotoxic T cells in the
microenvironment between these two pathways. Thus, we hypothesize that pre-cancers gain stemness to enable
epithelial mechanisms to suppress a cytotoxic immune environment, resulting in malignant evolution. In Aim 1,
we will use spatially resolved DNA sequencing to map genetic evolution of pre-cancer cells with selective
pressures conferred by neoantigen-specific adaptive immunity. In Aim 2, we will use integrative spatial multi-
omics to interrogate tumor mechanisms to modulate immune cell communication networks during progression.
By combining novel technologies with data-driven systems modeling, we will shed light on the complex interplay
between human tumors and their microenvironment that shape their transition trajectories into malignancy."

CRC persists as a heavy burden in the United States and throughout the world with over 1.93 million new
cases and 0.95 million deaths in 2020. Our study is designed to identify autonomous and non-autonomous
attributes of the early adenoma and the surrounding colon that drive adenoma progression to malignancy. In
this project, we mimic in mice a primed colon with pre-existing mutant clones (Aim 1) or overloaded with
senescent cells (Aim 2) to determine whether these altered states enhance adenoma formation and
progression. Such attributes can be detected with modern technology, so individuals could be screened to
determine their personal risk of developing CRC. We propose that adenomas emerging from a primed colon
can have a multi-ancestral origin being derived from multiple progenitors. Interactions among intermingled
clones could alter gene expression in the participating clones in a manner that favors adenoma progression
(Aim 3). Such interactions could potentially be disrupted with new chemopreventive agents or repurposed
common drugs. Thus, individuals having a primed colon and consequently at a high risk of CRC could be
identified, surveilled more frequently, and potentially treated to prevent cancers from forming"

While the technological enterprise of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generates a host of biomarkers of the
tumor environment, in particular for breast cancer, precious few (and typically only first-order markers) have
been tested beyond single site studies with single workflow processing. To address both the need for advanced
tissue characterization and multi-site translation, we propose a multi-site study of intravoxel incoherent motion
(IVIM) MRI in breast cancer to determine its maximum translational prognostic benefit. The IVIM model, which
includes separate markers of tissue cellularity, vascular volume, and micro-vascular flow, has been successfully
applied in a range of cancers, including breast cancer by the project teams of this proposal. This project will
determine inherent variability of the technique with hardware variation (3 vendors) and software platforms (6
packages), in a 5 site retrospective analysis of clinical breast cancer IVIM data. We will then conduct a
prospective two-site IVIM longitudinal study of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to determine the
best pre- or mid-treatment biomarkers to predict therapeutic response. At each stage, performance will be
evaluated both within each site and in the combined cohort, with the goal of identifying biomarkers that are both
useful and broadly translatable."
10924711,"Project 3 Summary
An unresolved and important question is whether estrogen’s protective effects on the brain and cognition are
attenuated or reversed during diseases such as hypertension. The goal of our overall Program Project is to
address this critical gap using preclinical rodent models of healthy and unhealthy aging to understand
estrogen’s impact on female cognitive aging. The experiments proposed in Project 3 contribute to this goal by
comparing the impact of estrogen on vascular health in models of healthy versus unhealthy aging and
complement the other Research Projects in both concept and approach. Our overall hypothesis is that
cardiovascular disease alters the estrogen receptor profile, disrupting the integration of estrogen’s
molecular signaling pathways and attenuating estrogen’s cardiovascular effects and downstream
protection from Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. Aim 1 will determine the impact of
cardiovascular disease on the vascular response to hormone therapy. This aim utilizes the same middle-aged
Long-Evans rat model of postmenopausal hypertension and cognitive decline as Project 1 led by Dr. Jill Daniel
and builds upon our previous co-authored publication. Aim 2 will establish whether altered estrogen receptor
expression impacts the response to estrogen. These experiments utilize transgenic ERE-luciferase mice along
with mice lacking either ERα or GPER to grasp how cardiovascular disease alters each of these signaling
pathways to reduce estrogen’s protective effects. Aim 3 will assess the impact of hypertension versus arterial
stiffness on female cognition, dendritic plasticity, and neurovascular coupling and determine which
antihypertensive provides the greatest protection to the brain. This aim was designed in collaboration with Co-
Investigator Dr. Ricardo Mostany and utilizes his Thy-1 mouse line to directly assess central mechanisms that
are associated with cognitive decline. The successful completion of the aims proposed in Project 3 will address
critical gaps in our knowledge on the impact of menopausal hormone therapy, enable the development of novel
methods for early detection and prevention of cardiovascular disease-induced cognitive decline, and provide
innovative strategies for improving menopausal hormone pharmacology to protect from Alzheimer’s disease
and vascular dementia."
10924712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Better understanding is needed regarding the mechanism of HIV pathogenesis to the developing brain in
individuals receiving longstanding antiretroviral therapy (ART). Despite the use of ART, brain abnormalities
occur in people living with HIV, especially among individuals with perinatally-acquired HIV (pHIV) where
abnormalities are frequently prevalent. Myelin water imaging (MWI) is generally regarded as the most rigorous
approach for noninvasive, in-vivo measurement of myelin content. Noninvasive neuroimaging tools can assess
the effectiveness of ART in preserving brain health and possibly lead to improvements in therapy. During the
past three decades, it has been demonstrated that one-dimensional (1D) MR Spectroscopy (MRS) enables the
study of only selected cerebral metabolites due to limited spectral dispersion even with 3 Tesla MRI scanners.
Recently, our group, using the home-developed two-dimensional (2D) localized correlated spectroscopy (L-
COSY) sequence combined with the prior-knowledge fitting (ProFit) algorithm showed that several cerebral
metabolites can be quantified non-invasively in the prefrontal dorsolateral white matter region of perinatally HIV-
infected youth and healthy children including novel metabolites such as glutathione (GSH), aspartate (Asp) and
scyllo-inositol (sI). However, there were limitations due to the requirement of a 27 ml voxel and longer acquisition
times. Hence, a novel five-dimensional (5D) echo-planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (EP-JRESI)
sequence was recently implemented by our group where two spectroscopic dimensions were combined with
three spatial dimensions to study the cerebral metabolite changes in pediatric HIV, with findings reported recently
(5R21NS086449-02). However, a total duration of approximately 25 minutes of scan time was necessary. Using
a modified rosette trajectory that densely samples both central and peripheral k-space, further
acceleration and robustness to motion can be accomplished in MRSI and MRI as compared to other non-
cartesian trajectories like radial, which will minimize patient discomfort by significantly reducing the
scan time. Hence, the proposed study will test the following hypotheses: 1) The accelerated 5D rosette
trajectories-based J-resolved Spectroscopic Imaging (ROSE-JRESI) and MWI with compressed sensing (CS)-
based reconstruction will shorten the total acquisition duration, improving its clinical applicability while the 5D
ROSE-JRESI data will also offer improved spatial resolution. 2) In the brains of pHIV young adults, decreased
axonal myelination is present even in virally suppressed individuals correlating with worse neurocognitive
performance (gross motor impairment) and altered metabolites. We propose two specific aims: 1) To optimize
5D ROSE-JRESI and 3D MWI on a 3T MRI scanner, and further optimize the CS-based reconstruction of the
5D MRSI and 3D MWI data using home developed MATLAB codes; 2a) To acquire multi-voxel 2D J-resolved
spectra and 2D spectroscopic images of different cerebral metabolites in perinatally-HIV-infected and healthy
adults (ages 20- 40 years); 2b) To record myelin water fractions of the brain and to correlate MWI measures with
metabolite ratios, neuropsychological test scores and other HIV disease variables."
10924587,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ADAM10 is a membrane-anchored endopeptidase that cleaves a range of membrane proteins at membrane-
proximal external sites, and thus causes the shedding of their ectodomains. We now find that HIV-1 virions
selectively incorporate considerable amounts of the active form of ADAM10. Our data indicate that ADAM10
cleaves the HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41 within the membrane-proximal external region (MPER),
which leaves behind a C-terminal fragment (CTF) and causes the shedding of the gp41 ectodomain from
virions. Interestingly, Nef protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10, and thus increases the amount of virion-
associated Env glycoprotein. Furthermore, Nef-deficient HIV-1 replicates strikingly faster in the absence of
ADAM10, including in primary human CD4+ T cells. Additionally, we find that ADAM10 potently inhibits the
propagation of Nef-deficient strains bearing primary Envs from different HIV-1 clades, and that ADAM10
inhibits HIV-1 replication through its catalytic activity.
 To understand the role of ADAM10 in HIV-1 spreading, we propose to examine its effects on virus
infectivity and transmission, including the possibility that cellular ADAM10 substrates are involved. We also
propose to examine whether the suppression of gp41 cleavage by ADAM10 is a core function of Nef, and
whether it depends on the engagement of the clathrin adaptor AP-2.
 Interestingly, we have obtained a revertant with a point mutation in the gp41 MPER, the putative site of
ADAM10 cleavage, that fully rescued a Nef-deficient HIV-1 in the presence of ADAM10. We propose to test
the hypothesis that the MPER mutation protects gp41 from cleavage by ADAM10 because it alters the N-
capping propensity of the mutated residue. We also intend to examine whether the sensitivity of gp41 to
cleavage by ADAM10 correlates with the accessibility of the MPER in the unliganded Env spike.
 ADAM10 is regulated by TSPANC8 tetraspanins, which form complexes with ADAM10 and are thought
to determine its substrate specificity. We thus plan to determine the roles of individual TSPANC8 family
members in the cleavage of gp41 by ADAM10, and to explore whether Nef protects gp41 by altering the
repertoire of TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes. We also plan to explore the possibility that Nef suppresses the
ADAM10-mediated cleavage of gp41 by reducing the exposure of phosphatidylserine, which is known to
activate ADAM10. Interestingly, this possibility is suggested by recent evidence that the Nef targets SERINC3
and SERINC5 are lipid scramblases that promote phosphatidylserine exposure on virions.
 The proposed studies have the potential to yield fundamental new insights into what constitutes a novel
mode of HIV-1 neutralization through the incorporation of a host protease. Of particular significance would be
the identification of specific TSPANC8/ADAM10 complexes as being responsible for the cleavage of gp41, as
this would offer the prospect of inactivating HIV-1 through agonists that selectively target these complexes."

It has been argued that keratinocytes at the interface of the body with the outside world have developed
specialized mechanisms to fulfill the need to nimbly respond to an ever-changing array of challenges with rapid
and reversible gene activation. Our past studies support the hypothesis that signaling information pertaining to
skin environmental insults is rapidly translated at repressed enhancers of stress response genes into chromatin
changes leading to their temporary induction. We have shown that the Mi-2β/NuRD complex sets a chromatin
environment that restricts transcription at genes that will be induced in keratinocytes by stress signals, holding
them silent but poised for rapid activation. Our studies highlight a dynamic switch between chromatin remodelers
that restrict gene expression and early response factors that support transcriptional activation. The mechanisms
that support this temporal switch and their contribution to response memory are investigated.
In Aim 1, we study how Mi-2β/NuRD is tethered to stress response loci in homeostasis, removed during
the stress response, and returned during resolution. We test whether Mi-2β/NuRD is targeted to these loci
by stable association with TFs, using both unbiased approaches and a focused approach on the AP1 complex.
We characterize post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of Mi-2β/NuRD or functionally associated TFs during
the early stress response, and test whether these have functional consequences on and off chromatin. We ask
how changes in the composition of the AP1 complex composition at target loci contribute to Mi-2β/NuRD complex
displacement and return, and whether enduring changes in TF occupancy at the loci or PTMs contribute to
epigenetic memory of the stress response. We examine how specificity is achieved by examining Mi-2β target
loci that are regulated by different TFs that do not respond to stress signaling.
In Aim 2, we investigate how histone modifications and higher order chromatin conformations contribute
to induction, repression, and reactivation of stress response genes in keratinocytes. We test for changes
in local histone modifications and TF recruitment at stress response genes and whether these contribute to the
memory of the response, defined as accelerated kinetics and increased magnitude of the response upon
rechallenge. We examine long-distance interactions between stress response enhancers, affiliated promoters,
and CTCF architectural sites, whether these are already present prior to stress, if they actively form in response
to it, and whether changes are maintained at some loci to alter activation thresholds as a mechanism of
epigenetic memory. Targeted manipulation of Mi-2β/NuRD and AP1 complex occupancy at specific loci is
employed to test their role in directing chromatin contacts and histone modifications at rest and during the
response. We also examine the heterogeneity of chromatin accessibility among basal cell precursors, its
heritability within clones, and the contribution of changing clonal composition of the basal layer to the evolution
of the epigenetic memory of prior inflammatory insult."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of death among older adults. Its high prevalence, amounting to one
third of all seniors, warrants new research directions on the pathogenesis of AD that can unlock new treatments.
Studying AD in the context of emerging allergic diseases presents a key opportunity in this regard. Emerging
allergic diseases to food allergens present an important public health problem whose ramifications may extend
beyond the gastrointestinal tract to other organ systems, including the brain. This project capitalizes on
pioneering work by the study team on “alpha-gal syndrome” (AGS), by exploring how neuroinflammatory profiles
relate to tick-induced allergy to mammalian meat in patients sensitized to the carbohydrate allergen, galactose-
alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). The proposed work builds on the idea that tick bites promote systemic
inflammatory processes that could adversely impact the brain. This notion is bolstered by recent data, including
that of the study team, to support a link between sensitization to alpha-gal and cardiovascular disease. The
central hypothesis is that patients with IgE to alpha-gal develop inflammatory profiles that promote
neuroinflammation. Given that AGS is an antigen-driven disorder, we further posit that T cells are pivotal to this
process. The project leverages an extensive set of existing specimens and data from highly characterized
cohorts spanning the spectrum of sensitization to alpha-gal, as well as a unique comparison group of chronically
inflamed patients suffering from post-acute sequelae of severe COVID-19 illness. The approach in Aim 1A will
define neuroinflammatory states using an unsupervised integrative approach across hundreds of serum samples
from patients with alpha-gal sensitivity. This will include assaying canonical and candidate biomarkers of AD
using ultrasensitive assays, in conjunction with a broad set of cytokines and chemokines, and then defining
discrete inflammatory states using cluster analyses. Longitudinal assessments will be performed in a subsample
of 100 patients with IgE to alpha-gal who return for a follow up visit at 3-10 years after their initial visit, in order
to monitor the development of neuroinflammatory profiles in relation to change in IgE and decline in
neurocognitive function. Profiles will be validated using samples from patients with AD and in COVID-19 patients
with neurocognitive sequelae. In Aim 1B, deep T-cell profiling using spectral flow cytometry and machine
learning methods will be used to elucidate complex T-cell signatures that constitute “functional networks”
governing neuroinflammatory states that are defined in Aim 1A. Establishing a new paradigm for the
immunopathogenesis of AD will identify novel avenues for exploring the interaction between AD and allergic
disease, and ultimately aid in the design of new therapies for this devastating disease."
10931194,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The incidence of
T1D is rising, especially in young children. Although significant progress has been made to predict who is at risk
for developing T1D, there are no effective therapies to prevent this disease. Both genetic and environmental
factors contribute to the risk of developing T1D. Certain major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte
antigen (MHC/HLA) class II haplotypes dominantly protect against the development of T1D, and we recently
discovered that protective MHCII molecules shape early-life microbial communities which in turn impact immune
system development to prevent T1D. Modeling microbial protection from T1D in NOD mice may provide critical
insights to support our long-term goal of developing microbiota-based therapies to prevent T1D in humans. Due
to the complexity and high levels of variability of the intestinal microbiome, determining the specific microbial
strains that drive immune system development and function is problematic. The development of gnotobiotic mice
with defined adult microbial communities has been an important advance in the field because they simplify the
complexity and variability of the system and allow for well-controlled, mechanistic studies. However, a gnotobiotic
mouse model to study pediatric disease is lacking. We developed a new gnotobiotic mouse model of the early-
life microbiome which we call Pediatric Community or “PedsCom”. PedsCom is a consortium of 9 bacterial
strains isolated from the intestine of pre-weaning diabetes-protected Eα16/NOD mice. Remarkably, this 9-
microbe community robustly induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) and confers protection from T1D to diabetes-
susceptible NOD mice. We hypothesize that specific PedsCom microbes work in concert to prevent T1D
by providing microbial antigens and metabolites that induce peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) during
a critical early life window of immune system development. Aim 1 examines the timing, localization, and
metabolites produced by specific PedsCom members which drive pTreg cell development and prevent
autoimmunity. Aim 2 examines the mechanisms by which pTregs are induced by PedsCom microbes and their
protein antigens and whether pTregs whose TCRs recognize specific microbial antigens mediate protection from
T1D. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical information on which early-life microbes induce
pTregs, and the degree to which microbial antigens and metabolites work together to generate a diabetes-
protective immune system. In addition, PedsCom mice are an innovative tool for investigating early-life host-
microbiota interactions."
10931207,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are especially at risk for missed diabetes visits
and suboptimal self-care behaviors, as evidenced by their poor glycemic control with very high A1c levels.
Further, diabetes distress is common in AYA with T1D and contributes to their suboptimal self-care behaviors
and outcomes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends routine screening for diabetes distress
and, when identified, referral for diabetes education or mental health treatment. Persons experiencing diabetes
distress are at increased risk for missed medical appointments and deficient diabetes self-management. This is
concerning because, without intervention, diabetes distress does not remit and either remains stable or
intensifies over time. Further, AYAs may not adequately access or use advanced diabetes technologies due to
perceptions of possible increases in self-care burden and diabetes distress when, in fact, such technologies
could aid in their efforts to enhance self-care and improve glycemic control. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop practical and widely accessible interventions that target diabetes distress, self-care, and glycemic
control and include face-to-face and remote visits to facilitate uptake. In the proposed 2-year randomized
clinical trial, we will implement and assess the impact of a behavioral/psychoeducational intervention to reduce
diabetes distress, increase acceptance of self-care behaviors (with or without diabetes technologies), and
improve glycemic outcomes in AYAs with T1D. As a group, AYAs with T1D represent the subpopulation of all
persons with T1D across the lifespan that has the poorest glycemic control, reaching a peak mean A1c value
>9% at age ~19. AYAs with T1D often experience diabetes distress, which is linked to poor glycemic control,
making them ideal participants for the proposed study. We will recruit 180 AYAs (ages 14-25) with T1D
duration of at least 1 year and suboptimal diabetes control (A1c 8-13%). Participants will be randomly assigned
to a usual care control condition or the intervention group. The intervention group will participate in monthly
intervention sessions with a study interventionist during the first year. Of the monthly sessions, 4 will focus on
improving glycemic outcomes in face-to-face sessions and 8 will focus on reducing diabetes distress in remote,
virtual sessions to limit study burden (and in recognition of paradigm changes in care delivery during SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic). To ensure adequate recruitment and retention, the control group will receive a delayed
intervention and participate in the monthly sessions during the second year of the study. Both groups will use
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 14 days every 3 months and complete surveys every 6 months. A1c
will also be measured centrally every 6 months. We will compare the two groups on the primary glycemic
outcome of percent time-in-range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL assessed by CGM and on the secondary outcomes of
diabetes distress and A1c from baseline to 1 year. We hypothesize that the intervention group will have an
improvement in percent TIR, diabetes distress, and A1c compared with the usual care control group."
10931212,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of serious metabolic abnormalities, such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Data obtained from studies conducted in humans and rodents have suggested that “metabolic inflexibility” is critically involved in the pathophysiology of such metabolic abnormalities. The mechanism(s) responsible for obesity-induced metabolic inflexibility is not clear but could involve altered metabolic activity in white adipose tissue (WAT). In the current funding cycle of this grant, we have focused on studying adipose tissue NAD+ biology and conducted a series of studies that demonstrate the causal relationship between defective WAT NAD+ metabolism and metabolic inflexibility. We found: 1) loss of NAMPT, a key NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme, impairs cellular insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, and adrenergic-stimulated lipolytic activity in WAT; 2) adipocyte-specific Nampt knockout (ANKO) mice have multi-organ (skeletal muscle, liver, WAT) insulin resistance, hypoadiponectinemia, impaired adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body energy metabolism, and impaired fuel selection to hypercaloric and hypocaloric challenges; 3) a novel molecular link between NAD+ metabolism and Caveolin-1 (CAV1), a key regulator of whole-body metabolic flexibility; 4) dietary restriction and exercise, well-known enhancers of metabolic flexibility, stimulate NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis in WAT; and 5) consistent with our rodent data, people with obesity have decreases in WAT NAMPT expression and NAD+ concentration. Based on these findings, this renewal application will test the hypotheses that NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis regulates CAV1 and mitochondrial function in WAT, key effectors of metabolic flexibility and glucose metabolism, and that defective WAT NAD+ metabolism is a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for obesity-induced metabolic inflexibility. In Aim 1, we propose to generate two novel mouse models, mice overexpressing NAMPT selectively in visceral WAT (using the novel AAV system) and tamoxifen-inducible ANKO (iANKO) mice, and evaluate metabolic responses to high-fat diet feeding and lifestyle modification (dietary restriction, exercise). In Aim 2, we propose to use in vitro systems and explore four mechanisms (lysine acetylation of CAV1, PPARG, sirtuins, and redox metabolism) that link NAD+ metabolism with CAV1 and mitochondrial function. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose to determine the potential clinical relevance of the studies we conducted in the mouse model (Aim 1) and cell culture systems (Aim 2). Specifically, we will evaluate the effects of two potential “NAD+ enhancers”, namely lifestyle modification (low- calorie diet ± supervised exercise training) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation (250 mg/day, 8 weeks), on WAT NAD+ metabolism, CAV1, and mitochondrial biology in overweight people. The anticipated results obtained from this proposal will provide novel insight into the importance of adipose tissue NAD+ biology in regulating metabolic flexibility and glucose metabolism."
10931218,"Type2 diabetes is caused by an inability of insulin-secreting β-cells within the islets of Langerhans to secrete
sufficient insulin to compensate for increased insulin resistance. Many factors within the islet microenvironment
including local and systemic elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased circulating free-fatty acids, and
elevated glucose can contribute to a subsequent decline in β-cell mass and function. Yet, the mechanisms by
which these factors disrupt β-cell function are poorly understood. β-cells within the islet do not function
autonomously: extensive interactions occur between β-cells and with other endocrine cells that control the
regulation of insulin secretion. Previously, we and others established a critical role for gap-junction mediated
electrical communication between β-cells that coordinates the dynamics of electrical activity, [Ca2+] elevations
and insulin release. The overall goal of this research program is to understand the physiological role and
regulation of gap junction channels in regulating islet function and the contribution of gap junction dysregulation
in diabetes to islet dysfunction and diabetes progression. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated that
gap junction channels and coordinated [Ca2+] were disrupted early in the progression of type2 diabetes in both
animal models and human diabetes, and that PKCδ played a key role in mediating this disruption. We further
demonstrated that elevated gap junction coupling could be protective against β-cell death, suggesting a potential
therapeutic target. However very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of
gap junction channels within the islet and what signaling mechanisms may underlie the disruption to gap junction
communication in diabetes progression. The overall hypothesis guiding our work to address this open question
is that diabetogenic conditions disrupt transcription and post-translational trafficking of gap junction channel
proteins; and targeting these pathways can retain proper inter-cellular communication, islet function and
ameliorate diabetes progression. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct two specific aims: 1) Determine the
role for excitability dependent Cx36 gap junction formation in healthy conditions and diabetes, and 2) Understand
the mechanisms underlying Cx36 gap junction trafficking and function in healthy conditions and diabetes. By
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying gap junction regulation within the islet of Langerhans, we
will be able to identify means by which gap junction communication and coordinated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion
can be recovered in type2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. This will be important for ameliorating islet dysfunction
and improving glucose control to prevent the decline in β-cell function and mass in type2 diabetes."
10918281,"Abstract: While great deal is understood about mechanisms of sensory transduction from the skin, relatively
little is known about this process from the muscles. As peripheral injuries resulting from repetitive
ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) are a major health issue that affects millions of people in the United States, this gap
in knowledge precludes us from identifying specific therapies for muscle pain or altered cardiovascular
responses to exercise in the context of ischemia. Peripheral I/R occurs in blood disorders such as sickle cell
disease, and in cardiovascular disorders such as peripheral vascular disease. Males and females display
different features of myalgia and exercise pressor reflexes (EPRs) under conditions of reduced peripheral
perfusion. The major goal of this study is to determine the sex specific molecular mechanisms of muscle
afferent sensitization that may underlie the transition from acute to chronic ischemic myalgia. Pilot data in
murine models of repetitive I/R injury suggest that peripheral sensitization in males is regulated by increased
DRG gene expression that is modulated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor 1
(GFR1) in muscle nociceptors. In females, afferent sensitization, pain-related behaviors and altered EPRs
after repeated I/R injury may be regulated by increased interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL1r1) dependent gene
expression. We hypothesize that the prolonged effects of successive I/R injuries are mediated by GDNF
related peripheral sensitization in males and IL1 induced sensitization in females. Aim 1 will determine if
myofiber produced GDNF and DRG upregulation of GFR1, regulate the observed changes in muscle afferent
response properties, pain-related behaviors and altered EPRs after dual I/R in males. We will use muscle fiber
specific GDNF ablation or our novel in vivo siRNA-mediated knockdown of genes in single peripheral nerves in
conjunction with our ex vivo muscle afferent recording preparations or assays of pain-like behaviors and EPRs.
Aim 2 will utilize a similar approach except we will determine if macrophage produced IL1 or DRG
upregulation of IL1r1, regulate the novel changes in female muscle afferents or behaviors after successive I/R.
Finally, Aim 3 will use ex vivo recording and pain-related behavioral analyses to determine if expression
differences in AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1) or the ras family member, RAN, modulates the
sex specific effects of successive I/R injuries between females versus males. Each of these aims will be
complemented by analysis of DRG and muscle gene expression. The studies outlined here will also provide a
novel direction in muscle neurobiology research that will go well beyond the incremental expansion of current
reports. Results will enable us to identify unique sex dependent mechanisms associated with muscle afferent
sensitization that underlie acute to chronic ischemic myalgia development after I/R injury. This may lead to the
formulation of more appropriate treatments for musculoskeletal pain or altered EPRs associated with ischemia/
reperfusion that target the proper receptor(s), primary afferent subpopulation(s) or peripheral target tissues."
10918283,"Project Summary
Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of
genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health
and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck
in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this
project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop
innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical
data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative
biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.
 Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been
largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical
advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable
collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with
theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations
required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in
cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge
proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data
sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive
information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of
protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent
tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve
superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes,
and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.
 To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our
tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting
organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community
guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational
methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of
sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and
collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the
molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic."
10919188,"Problem: Treatment options for late stage metastatic cancer are limited. External beam radiotherapy (XRT) is
generally effective, but limited against widespread disease or tumors adjacent to radiosensitive tissue.
Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT), a therapeutic modality with origins in radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer,
has become an effective alternative to chemo- and biologic therapy. RPT is complementary to XRT. It exploits
pharmaceuticals that bind to tumor cells to deliver targeted radiation. It targets metastases while providing a
radiation boost to tumors. Combining XRT with RPT (e.g., as opposed to chemotherapy) allows a precise
determination of potential toxicity to normal organs since both modalities involve radiation whose effects on
normal tissues can be quantified and predicted by treatment planning.
 Our solution to treating widespread metastases is to commercialize enhanced dosimetric tools that will make
combination XRT and RPT (CXRPT) a routine cancer treatment. We will assess safety and feasibility of CXRPT
in thyroid cancer patients who are not likely to be effectively treated with radioiodine alone and who are good
candidates for CXRPT. Radiopharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry, LLC (Rapid) will provide the methodology
and software for CXRPT; Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine will implement CXRPT.
Specific aims:
1. Conduct a phase I clinical trial of CXRPT in differentiated thyroid cancer patients.
Establish safety of CXRPT, provide a rationale for a larger multi-arm trial that will demonstrate greater efficacy
over current treatment.
2. Implement the CXRPT methodology in a cloud-based software package, 3D-RD-X; validate results from the
cloud-based package against the localized package.
3. Obtain data needed for eventual FDA clearance of 3D-RD-X.
Aims 2 and 3 are essential steps towards generating a commercially viable software package that will enable
widespread implementation of CXRPT.
 This proposal will introduce a novel treatment combination applicable to every cancer for which RPT exists
or may be developed. The investigative team is already highly collaborative. Rapid’s founders have previously
implemented advanced dosimetry for thyroid cancer patients and have a long record in this area. This proposal
will enable a fundamentally new treatment paradigm that leverages widely available radiotherapy treatment with
ongoing development of novel RPTs. We expect widespread implementation and commercial interest once we
have demonstrated feasibility and provided the software tool to implement this treatment approach."
10919195,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of The Ohio State University (OSU) Connecting Underrepresented Populations to Clinical Trials
(CUSP2CT) is to increase the referral and accrual of racial/ethnic minorities to NCI's National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN) prevention/control and treatment trials at the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC).
This research is grounded in the socioecologic model developed by the Centers for Population Health and Health
Disparities (Warnecke, et al. Am J Public Health 2008) and utilizes the theoretical model, Accrual to Clinical
Trials (Paskett, et al. Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2003). The OSUCCC serves the catchment area of the state of
Ohio where over 95% of our patients with cancer reside. Working closely with the OSUCCC Center for Cancer
Health Equity (CCHE), OSUCCC National Outreach Network, community partner organizations, community
providers in the OSUCCC referral area, James Hospital Network sites, NCI Community Oncology Research
Program (NCORP) sites in Ohio, and the OSUCCC Clinical Trials Office, our goal will be accomplished by
completing the following specific aims: 1) Conduct a baseline assessment of referral patterns and accrual of
racial and ethnic minorities to clinical trials at OSUCCC by cancer disease group (breast, gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, thoracic, hematologic, and others) and examine factors at the system (i.e., eligible clinical trial
protocol, clinic context and culture), provider (trial discussed with patient), and patient level (agreed or refused
participation) that influence referral and accrual (Phase I); 2) Implement a multi-level intervention in a stepped
wedge design in referring practices in 9 counties with high counts of minority cancer cases in the OSUCCC
catchment area using the Accrual to Clinical Trials framework (Paskett, et al. Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2003), in
Phase II. The intervention will include an outreach component, directed at community members and community
practices, and an in-reach component, involving patients, providers, and the hospital system (at both referral
centers and the OSUCCC) that directly addresses problems identified in Phase I; and 3) to evaluate the impact
of the intervention on referral (primary outcome) and accrual patterns (secondary outcomes) in Phase III to
clinical trials. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be used. Dissemination of the key findings of our
multi-level intervention is a high priority of this project."
10919196,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even with the latest digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) systems, breast cancer screening continues to suffer
from poor specificity. Only about 5% of women called-back from screening are ultimately found to have a biopsy-
proven cancer. Clinical DBT systems suffer from anisotropies in image quality since the scanning motion is
restricted to one direction (left-to-right). We built a next-generation tomosynthesis (NGT) system that is capable
of scanning in the shape of a “T”. With phantoms and mastectomy specimens, we have shown that this design
mitigates cone-beam artifacts, tissue superposition effects, and anisotropies in super-resolution. As the next step
in our research, we will perform a pilot study with volunteers, recruiting women referred for diagnostic imaging
or biopsy as well as women having abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Projection images will be
acquired in such a way that we can generate reconstructions from two scanning methods (conventional and T).
Each scanning method will be analyzed separately by radiologists in different reading sessions. We will mitigate
potential concerns about radiation exposure by restricting the study to one view (cranial-caudal) instead of two
views. We have put together a team with a unique set of strengths, including the developers of the NGT system,
three radiologists, two statisticians, and experts in density and texture analysis. This proposal is divided into two
specific aims. (Aim 1): Assess radiologists' performance in a pilot study of the NGT system with volunteers. We
will investigate whether the T scan brings down the call-back rate of screening without reducing sensitivity.
Radiologists will also rate the overall probability of malignancy, and these scores will be analyzed in combination
with clinical follow-up data to show that radiologists' ability to characterize findings is improved with the T scan,
specifically by using jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) methods.
(Aim 2): Perform quantitative analysis of the 3D breast outline segmentation, texture, and density. With breast
phantoms, we have previously shown that the breast volume is overestimated in the conventional scan and is
calculated more accurately in the T scan. We aim to show that the same result holds in human subjects by
calculating volume differences between the two scanning methods. Additionally, we will analyze power-law noise
and higher-order non-Gaussian texture measures as surrogate metrics of detectability and tissue superposition
effects, which we expect to be improved by the T scan. Finally, we will analyze whether percent density
calculations differ between the two scanning methods since we expect fewer out-of-plane artifacts in the T scan.
Although the new method of scanning is not being used as part of the volunteers' medical care, the overall impact
of this study is to demonstrate improvements in specificity and thus the potential to minimize the number of
diagnostic imaging exams and biopsies, lower healthcare costs, and minimize the total radiation dose combining
screening and diagnostic imaging. Women with dense breasts will especially benefit from this new design since
dense tissue can obscure findings in a conventional DBT scan, making them harder to characterize."
10909967,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) include a range of maladies caused by chronic alcohol exposure
during pregnancy. It is documented that approximately 2% to 5% of children born in the United States have
FASD. Clinical studies have shown children and adults with FASD often show hyperresponsiveness to stress
and are vulnerable to psychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders. The neurobiology of these emotional
disturbances are not well understood, but studies utilizing animal models of fetal alcohol exposure have shown
that prenatal or early-postnatal ethanol exposure in laboratory rats and mice disrupts the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis function and its physiological response to stress and promotes anxiety-like behaviors.
Both prenatal ethanol exposure and postnatal ethanol exposure induce hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin
neuronal death and reduce levels of proopiomelanocortin and its peptide product β-endorphin, as well as the β-
endorphin peptide's inhibitory control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. Replenishment of β-
endorphin neurons via neuronal transplantation prevents stress and behavioral problems in fetal alcohol-
exposed
animals, indicating that β-endorphin deficiency is a significant contributor to the stress and behavioral
abnormalities in these animals. The mechanism by which β-endorphin neurons experience apoptosis following
fetal alcohol exposure is not well understood. There are several preclinical and clinical evidences that
suggest microglia, one of the immune cells in the central nervous system, play a major role in the regulation of
alcohol-induced neuronal damage. Recent studies show that inflammatory cytokines can be released in
association with small extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, from microglia. These exosomes are comprised
of a lipid bilayer, transmembrane proteins, and cytosolic components derived from their host cells. However,
the role of microglial exosomes in alcohol-induced neurotoxicity has not been well studied. In this proposal, we
propose to determine if microglia use exosomes to induce ethanol-induced β-endorphin neuronal death and
stress axis functions. We also propose to use proteomic and genomic measurements to identify if ethanol
treatment during the postnatal period increases levels of chemokines, complements, and microRNAs in
microglial exosomes. Additionally, we propose to identify the exosome biomolecules that have apoptotic effects
on β-endorphin neurons. Together these studies should establish how prenatal ethanol modifies contents of
proteins and genes within exosomes to induce β-endorphin neuronal apoptosis that may lead to stress axis
hyperresponsiveness and increased anxiety behavior. Additionally, the proposed studies may identify a novel
therapeutic approach to prevent some of the neurological problems that occur in FASD patients."
10909973,"Two primary features of visual coding—spatial frequency and contrast perception—are abnormal in
neurophysiological and behavioral measures of amblyopia. Mounting evidence indicates that interocular
inhibition may drive amblyopic deficits, and this has led to the employment of varying gain control models to
explain abnormal binocular interaction amblyopia. Psychophysical measures of contrast perception are
commonly used to validate these models; however, a single gain control model has been unsuccessful in
explaining amblyopic performance. This 5-year mentored training award seeks to address this problem by using
novel neuroimaging and visual psychophysics to investigate whether spatial frequency and contrast deficits in
anisometropic amblyopia are indeed secondary to interocular inhibition. Each aim of the study corresponds to
specific training goals, which will map to competency in four main areas: (1) fMRI experimental design and
model-based analyses; (2) computational modeling of both neuroimaging and psychophysical data; (3) clinical
research design incorporating the use of fMRI, psychophysics, and computational modeling in clinical
populations; and (4) career development. Such training will transform the applicant into an independent
translational clinical scientist who can utilize both neuroimaging and psychophysics to examine underlying
deficits in pediatric vision disorders. Training will be implemented at the reputable environments of Boston
Children’s Hospital, Boston University, and Harvard Medical School with the expert guidance of Dr. Sam Ling
(primary mentor), Dr. David Hunter (co-mentor), and Dr. MiYoung (advisor). Specifically, the mentor team will
train the applicant to design, implement, and analyze measures of population spatial frequency tuning and
contrast response in participants with anisometropic amblyopia. This work will enhance our understanding of
interocular inhibition and spatial frequency and contrast-dependent deficits in amblyopia. Our data will guide and
constrain models of binocular interaction in amblyopia. Furthermore, this additional neural characterization of
the response of the amblyopic visual system to unbalanced dichoptic stimuli will explain variability in the efficacy
of alternative therapies and identify new treatments that specifically target deficits in spatial frequency and
contrast coding of the amblyopic eye. Through this training, the candidate will gain considerable mentorship and
training in advanced neuroimaging techniques to quantify binocular visual function in amblyopia, providing a
foundation to build a career as an independent clinician-scientist."
10909974,"The long-term sequelae of brain injury are being increasingly recognized, and are a major focus of current
research. While severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has immediate and obvious consequences, even mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and repetitive subconcussive injury can lead to devastating complications,
sometimes decades later. Brain injury plays a significant role in the health of a large number of veterans,
especially those from recent conflicts (Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom) and can
cause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms that include parkinsonism, psychiatric symptoms, and
dementia.
 A number of reports have documented an increased prevalence of parkinsonism in those who have
previously suffered brain injury, but the clinical and neuropathological characteristics of parkinsonism in these
individuals is poorly understood. Until recently, parkinsonism related to TBI was presumed to be due to
Parkinson’s disease (PD), with an associated characteristic pattern of abnormal accumulation of alpha-
synuclein protein. More recent evidence, however, suggests that TBI-related parkinsonism may be clinically
and pathologically distinct from PD. Some cases of parkinsonism related to TBI, for example, have been
associated with atypical clinical and pathological features related to abnormal synuclein deposition, or with
clinical features and a distinct pattern of abnormal deposition of tau protein characteristic of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy. Other cases have shown overlapping clinical or pathological features of more than one
neurodegenerative disease.
 In this proposal, we will examine the role that brain injury plays in the development of parkinsonism in
veterans. We will recruit subjects with parkinsonism, with and without a history of head injury who are followed
by the co-PIs in the neurology clinic at the James J. Peters VAMC. The nature, frequency, and severity of the
head injury will be defined by medical record review combined with a validated prospective brain injury
questionnaire. Subjects will undergo rigorous characterization of neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive
symptoms, including measures of severity of parkinsonism, atypical motor and non-motor features, and
environmental exposures (such as Agent Orange and cigarette smoking). We will analyze these data to
characterize the features of parkinsonism in veterans with a history of brain injury. In addition, we will measure
TBI-related serum biomarkers (including neurofilament light chain and tau levels) that have been associated
with neurodegenerative disease severity, to determine the relationship between these biomarkers and clinical
presentation.
 Subjects from this cohort will be recruited for brain donation; tissue from brains collected prospectively
will then be studied in combination with existing postmortem brain tissue from parkinsonism and TBI cases in
the Mount Sinai Brain Bank. Brain injury history from postmortem subjects will be determined through review of
medical records and interviews of family members. All post mortem brain tissue will undergo qualitative and
quantitative analysis focusing on alpha-synuclein and tau, the key proteins involved in PD, CTE, and other
forms of degenerative parkinsonism. In each case we will examine the distribution and severity of deposition of
these and other proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as beta-amyloid, and
neurotransmitter markers, and correlate them with the clinical features and brain injury history. We anticipate
that TBI-related parkinsonism will be associated with more severe and atypical clinical features, more widely-
distributed neuropathological changes, and atypical patterns of abnormal protein deposition. These findings will
shed light on the chronic neuropathological processes underlying degenerative parkinsonism associated with
brain injury."

10910091,"SUMMARY
In response to the burgeoning worldwide obesity pandemic, the rate of obesity-associated colorectal cancer
(CRC) remains an enormous public health burden. The metabolic determinants of CRC are complex and
remain under debate. Ceramides are pathogenic lipids that signal a state of nutrition excess and accumulate in
organs that are not suited for fat storage, driving insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Our preliminary data also
demonstrate that ceramides are critical intermediates linking nutritional inputs like fatty acids to intestinal stem
cell proliferation. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of ceramide metabolism in the development of
CRC and to identify pharmacologic and dietary strategies to intervene upon ceramide metabolism for cancer
prevention. Our central hypothesis is that ceramide metabolism is a key component of metabolic
dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a transdisciplinary collaboration, utilizing epidemiologic and clinical
cohorts and animal experiments, to conduct synergistic analyses and interventions to address our hypothesis.
In Aim 1a, using a rigorous discovery-replication design, we will characterize a ceramide-based CRC risk
score in serum from participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)
(n=1260cases/1260 controls), and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer cohort (n=1234
cases/1234 controls), and identify a dietary pattern strongly linked to ceramides. In Aim 1b, we will determine
the effects of medical and surgical weight loss and changes in body composition on the ceramide CRC risk
score in our ongoing Utah Bariatric Surgery Cohort. In Aim 1c, we will measure the association of genetically
predicted levels of circulating ceramides with risk of CRC using data from 57,873 CRC cases and 67,087
controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of CRC Consortium (GECCO), and test for gene by dietary pattern
interaction. In Aim 2, we will determine whether systemic or tissue-specific reduction of ceramides affects CRC
development. We will impede ceramide synthesis by inhibiting dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) action
genetically (Aim 2a) and pharmacologically (Aim 2b), and via a serine or time restricted dietary pattern (Aim
2c), to test for effects on gut, liver and adipose depots and colorectal tumor incidence in an azoxymethane
mouse model of CRC. The study leverages a new class of DES1 inhibitors that lower tissue ceramides and
ameliorate the pathogenic consequences of obesity. The proposed study fills a major gap in evidence for
understanding how ceramides contribute to the metabolic dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a fully
translational approach integrating epidemiologic associations between ceramides and colorectal malignancies
and preclinical studies testing the utility of ceramide-lowering interventions on cancer endpoints. Findings will
have important implications for understanding the biologic mechanisms underpinning obesity-associated
metabolic dysregulation in CRC and for identifying new targets for CRC prevention."

 Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in many tumor types, breast cancers have
shown limited responses. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) are critical to initiate anti-tumor immunity and for
efficacy of ICB, and are known to be defective in breast cancers. Importantly, APCs need to be activated through
pathways such as the CD40 pathway in order to promote anti-tumor activity rather than immune tolerance. We
demonstrated that CD40 agonists synergize with Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) which is a growth factor that promotes
differentiation of DC1 cells which are important for antigen presentation, and anthracycline chemotherapy to
eradicate triple negative breast cancers in mouse studies. Based on this, we hypothesize that combining
chemotherapy with a CD40 agonist and Flt3L enhances antigen presentation and increases long-term
adaptive immunity, thereby improving triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) disease control. In order to
test this hypothesis, I propose:
Aim #1: To assess safety, clinical activity, and immunologic efficacy of CD40 agonist in combination with Flt3L
and anthracycline chemotherapy (triplet therapy) in patients with metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) and identify
biomarkers of response and resistance. I will be Lead Principal Investigator on a phase 1 pilot trial of CD40
agonist + Flt3L + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with mTNBC. Longitudinal tissue samples will be
collected and analyzed to study pharmacodynamics, biomarkers of response, and resistance mechanisms.
Aim #2: To discover mechanisms of response and resistance to triplet therapy using syngeneic and humanized
mouse models, including tumors reflecting different TNBC subtypes. 4T1-HA syngeneic model will be used to
study how different agents in the CD40 agonist + Flt3L + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin regimen contribute to
response and what immune cell types are mediating response, with a focus on CD8 T cells and DC1 cells. We
will additionally study how underlying TNBC subtype impacts response to triplet therapy using syngeneic murine
and humanized patient derived xenograft models.
 Results of this work will guide future development of this combination in TNBC and other solid tumors.
 I am an Assistant Professor at UT Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center and the principal investigator
on this proposal. I am a breast medical oncologist focused on improving outcomes of breast cancer patients
through immunotherapy. To most effectively advance the field, I plan to integrate clinical investigation of agents
stimulating antigen presentation with patient tissue based translational science and preclinical studies. To
supplement my background in immune monitoring, this proposal details a training plan under the mentorship of
translational breast cancer expert Dr. Carlos Arteaga and cancer immunologist Dr. Yang-Xin Fu. This is further
supported by an expert advisory committee, relevant coursework, and the resources and supportive environment
of UTSW to help me transition to independence as a physician scientist focused on breast immuno-oncology."

Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is a disorder in language learning and use that affects 7% of the
population. Grammatical difficulties are a hallmark characteristic of this disorder during childhood. Long-term
academic and quality of life outcomes are poor. The development of broadly adoptable techniques to
remediate comprehension and production of complex syntax prior to attainment of fluent reading would
increase access to the academic curriculum earlier and improve long-term outcomes of individuals with DLD. It
is unlikely that recast therapy, the current standard of care, is delivered effectively within the constraints of
current service delivery approaches and reimbursement models. Thus, there is a need to either demonstrate
that recasts are a superior intervention method worthy of the effort required for faithful implementation, or to
identify and develop an alternative approach that is feasible for administration to children older than 3 who are
not yet fluent readers. Illustrated syntax stories i.e., specially constructed stories loaded with the target
grammatical form that can be read aloud by a caregiver, could be that more feasible approach. Literacy, while
not universal, is more accessible than recast therapy to a broad range of adults and high rates of input can be
rapidly and consistently provided. This approach has previously been shown to increase the production and
comprehension of passives, reported speech, and conjoined clauses in typical preschoolers and school age
children. Our own preliminary data suggests that illustrated syntax stories could also be effective for children
with DLD. Here, we carry out a randomized controlled trial, enrolling 140 children with DLD between the ages
of 4 and 7 who score below 40% correct on the use of passives and object relative clauses. Children receive
one of four possible treatments (recasts at home, recasts in the lab, syntax stories at home, syntax stories in
the lab) for one grammatical structure for 10 weeks and then outcomes are re-assessed for both the treated
and untreated structures. Comparison of the two different treatment approaches in the lab under dose
controlled conditions informs us as to the mechanism of action for language learning. Specifically in Aim 1, we
contrast interactive, feedback-based learning (recast therapy) with concentrated systematic exposure
(illustrated syntax stories). In Aim 2, we consider the influence of the delivery mechanism on the ultimate dose
delivered when treatment is provided by caregivers. We ask whether there is sufficient difference between the
two delivery methods in terms of the dose provided by caregivers such that it cascades down to affect child
outcomes. Combining outcomes data with quantitative information about the degree of fidelity and adherence
and qualitative information reasons for these behavior patterns (Aim 3) will provide critical information about
the circumstances under which these treatments can be provided effectively. These data will be interpreted
within the Theoretical Domains Framework to better understand barriers and enablers of treatment
implementation and to inform future work to scale-up the most effective approach."

10909896,"Background: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal
tract that are associated with a poor quality of life. There is no cure for IBD, and most people require lifelong
immunosuppressive medication and also frequently need surgery. The cause of Crohn’s disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), the two most common forms of IBD, are unknown but it is widely accepted that they
develop in genetically susceptible individuals in response to environmental factors for which the most compelling
evidence is the microbiome. Traditionally regarded as diseases of Northern European (EUA) and Ashkenazi
Jewish ancestry the prevalence of IBD is rapidly rising in minority populations such as Hispanic and African
American populations who have been under-represented in research. The objectives of our study include: the
delineation of the genetic architecture of IBD in Hispanics populations; describe the gene-microbiome
interactions in Hispanics; an understanding of the underlying molecular causes of lack of response to the most
widely used biologic therapies in IBD; and importantly, work that will determine some of the functional effects
of these genetic variants. We will achieve these objectives by addressing the following specific aims. In aim 1
we will decipher genetic architecture of IBD and investigate host-microbiome interactions using a biomarker-
based inference approach. In aim 2 we will use advanced technology investigating gene and protein expression
in individual cells in the lining of the gut to identify signatures associated with response to medication. In aim 3
we will use human intestinal epithelial cell culture systems to screen for function of new IBD susceptibility genes.
Research Design: in collaboration we will build the largest collection of IBD subjects of Hispanic ancestry and
use state of the art genetic approaches to identify genetic signals associated with development of IBD. We
anticipate that some of these signals will overlap with those we’ve observed in EUA subjects and others will be
unique to the Hispanic population. Since there is significant admixture of Native American ancestry in the North
American population, we anticipate that we will also identify some genetic signals that are ‘peculiar’ to Native
Americans. There have been few studies investigating host-microbiome interactions in Non-EUA populations
and we will address this by investigation serum markers that are surrogates for the microbiome thereby allowing
us, for the first time, to investigate interactions between genetic variation and the microbiome in Hispanic
populations. In parallel we will look at gene expression signatures in biopsies from the gut to determine the
molecular signature that underlies a very important clinical issue of non-response to our most effective
medications. Finally, we use model systems to determine the functional consequences of the genetic variants
that we have identified. We will due this using the very large bank of cell lines that we have already collected
and use innovative approaches to convert these to gut-like epithelium organoids. The cell lines will be prioritized
based on the genetic variants that we discover in our large genetic studies including the Hispanic studies."

Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated
with major morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce
its health burden. Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge
gaps persist regarding the impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including effectiveness
of strategies to achieve and maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies reduce USD
recurrence. The Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) study is a randomized clinical trial
investigating the impact of increased fluid intake and increased urine output on the recurrence rate of
USD in adults and children. In this study 1,642 participants will be randomized to a control or
intervention arm. Participants in both arms receive a “smart water bottle”. The intervention arm involves
an additional program of behavioral interventions, including financial incentives, structured problem
solving, and low touch interventions designed to improve adherence to a prescribed fluid intake
regimen. The primary endpoint is occurrence of a stone event during a two-year observation period.
The PUSH study is in its third year, and due to multiple challenges to recruitment of study participants,
follow-up of participants and data collection have not yet been completed. Additional time is needed to
ensure study completion and to accomplish all study goals. Although ureteral stenting is routinely
performed after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-operative complications, stents cause
significant patient discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only partly understood. The STudy to
Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS) is a prospective observational
cohort study enrolling adolescents and adults undergoing ureteroscopic intervention for ureteral and/or
renal stones. Participants undergo detailed symptom assessment using validated questionnaires, a
psychosocial assessment, quantitative sensory testing for evaluation of pain sensitization, and detailed
collection of clinical and operative data. Biospecimens (blood and urine) are being collected for future
research. Recruitment to the STENTS study and follow-up of the participants are expected to be
completed on time. However, additional time and resources are needed for analysis of collected study
data. In Aim 1 of this application, the investigators will continue and complete participant enrollment for
the PUSH study, continue biospecimen collection for the NIDDK Repository, analyze the data, and
prepare and submit several planned manuscripts related to the study hypotheses. In Aim 2 of this
application, the investigators will analyze the data from the STENTS studies, interpret findings, and
disseminate findings through peer reviewed publications."
10910025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As a nation, we have made tremendous advances in cancer prevention and control. However, these advances
have not accrued evenly across society. New directions in population health, genetic screening and precision
medicine may hold promise to promote health equity through risk identification and disease preemption, leading
to potentially transforming cancer morbidity and mortality. To be at this cutting edge of scientific discovery and
translation, we require more, and better prepared, STEM-H (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and
health) professionals trained in cancer and health focused careers. The long-term goal of this program is to
increase the biomedical and behavioral research workforce by providing specialized and experiential curricula
that highlights team-oriented population sciences. In order to contribute to this goal, the overall objective of this
initiative is to implement a cancer research education program, “Cancer Research—Scholarship and Training
Experiences in Population Sciences” (C-STEPS). This program is designed to facilitate and support
undergraduate students in their completion of a degree in a STEM-H field and to facilitate their selection of, and
application to, graduate or professional schools, while encouraging their interests in research careers. C-STEPS,
a 10-week summer cancer research experiences program, consists of 4 integrated components: 1) inquiry-based
research seminars, 2) skills-based, student-tailored, mentored research experiences, 3) development of career
plans, and 4) team-building activities. We will recruit cohorts of 10 undergraduates nationally for participation in
C-STEPS. We will solicit applications from students intending to pursue graduate or professional education in
STEM-H disciplines. Students will participate full-time from mid-May through August, guided by faculty and
research mentors with expertise in cancer control and population sciences (i.e., cancer risk prediction and risk
reduction, cancer screening, cancer outcomes, and survivorship). C-STEPS builds on existing resources at the
University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center. Specific aims are to: 1) Provide foundational
understanding, through inquiry-based research seminars, of current and emerging innovations in cancer
prevention and control and of collaborative team science through team-building activities. 2) Provide skills-based
mentored research experiences. 3) Provide specific opportunities to implement STEM-H career planning in
collaboration with and through personalized coaching from faculty, and “peers” (UNM STEM Gateway
undergraduates and returning C-STEPS alumni in Years 2-5) and “near-peers” (graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows); including preparation of individual development plans, which foster career development. C-STEPS will
increase the number of undergraduates pursuing graduate or professional schools, and ultimately research
careers thereby addressing a national priority for well-trained STEM-H professionals in cancer and health
focused careers."

clinical samples. However, the integration of genomic measurements into healthcare is outpacing the training
of physicians and scientists, and many are ill-equipped to use this information to improve the health of patients.
Thus, it is imperative to train the next generation of physician and scientist leaders in Genomic Medicine. We
propose to renewal our post-doctoral training program in Genomic Medicine focuses on translational medicine
and informatics and is led by Drs. Jason Moore, Edward Rose Professor of Informatics, and Director of the
Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics, and Katherine Nathanson, Pearl Basser Professor of BRCA-Related
Research, and Deputy Director, Abramson Cancer Center. We provide a foundation for training in Genomic
Medicine, applicable to both MD and PhD trained fellows, recognizing that each may enter the program with
different skill sets and experiences. It essential to provide all fellows with a strong background framework so
that they can develop exciting and relevant projects in Genomic Medicine. Trainees enroll in a two-year
program, including didactic courses, clinical and laboratories rotations, interactive learning experiences and
research training. We require a balanced portfolio of courses, which cover the latest advances in genomics,
focused on the role of genomics in disease processes, quantitative sciences, including biomedical informatics
and biostatistics, scientific writing and ELSI issues. The 39 trainers were selected based on their expertise in
Genomic Medicine and come from multiple departments, which is further enlarged with clinicians experienced
in the provision of Genomic Medicine. The trainees are dually mentored in a research project by a balanced
team (e.g. clinician and basic scientist) experienced in Genomic Medicine. Trainees participate in clinical
rotations designed to give them experiences that range from the generation of massively parallel sequence
data to data analysis to reporting back the results to patients. Trainees also participate in interactive activities,
including a journal club, research in progress presentations, clinical genetics rounds and retreats. The
combination of coursework, experiential clinical rotations, participation in interactive activities, and mentored
research experience prepares our physicians and scientists for careers in Genomic Medicine. Over the past
five years, 14 individuals were accepted (42% of applicants) into the Genomic Medicine program - eight
physicians, six scientists, from 10 different departments and divisions at Penn Medicine (nine) and CHOP
(five). Nine (64%) of our trainees were women and three (21%) reported coming from underrepresented
populations. We have been privileged to attract an exceptionally strong and diverse set of trainees and
anticipate continuing to be able to do so. We request continued support for the entry of three trainees a year in
the Genomic Medicine T32 post-doctoral training program at the University of Pennsylvania."

 Fentanyl is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the United States. The majority of
fentanyl-related overdoses are caused by illicit fentanyl and/or fentanyl analogs, either alone or
in combination with other narcotics. Rapid identification of fentanyl as the contributing drug is
crucial for clinical management of overdose patients, who may undergo respiratory depression in
minutes. Even in the case of adulteration of fentanyl with any other opioid, the detection of fentanyl
is important for the appropriate dosage and frequency of naloxone. Despite the clinical and public
health needs, there is currently no rapid and instrument-free fentanyl detecting diagnostic cleared
by FDA. Central clinical laboratory screening tests rely on expensive instrumentation and report
results hours after urine sample is submitted for testing. Mass spectrometry-based methods for
fentanyl are only available from selected hospital labs as lab-developed tests, and report results
days after sample is collected. Neither existing method is useful for immediate clinical
management, nor widely accessible to the populations who are most affected by fentanyl and
emerging drug threats. Current commercially available fentanyl strips do not have the sensitivity
to meet the clinically meaningful 1 ng/mL cutoff required by FDA. Instanosis has developed a
rapid screening strip called InstaStrip-Fentanyl that uniquely meets the 1 ng/mL cutoff requirement.
The entire test is completed in 3 simple steps within minutes. After urine collection, the user
transfers urine to a reagent tube, mixes, then places the strip into the tube. Visual results can be
read in 5 min. We have reached agreement with FDA in a presubmission meeting on proposed
510(k) regulatory pathway and studies required for clearance. In this fast-track proposal,
Instanosis proposes to finalize the development and commercialize InstaStrip-Fentanyl as the
first 510(k)-cleared, rapid, instrument-free and high sensitivity over-the-counter (OTC) fentanyl
screening test. In Phase I, Instanosis will work on finalizing the test design with cutoff of 1 ng/mL
under Quality Management System (QMS) and conduct clinical validation. In Phase II, Instanosis
will partner with an FDA-registered contract manufacturer to manufacture three different test lots,
conduct verification and validation studies, including analytical, accuracy flex and method
comparison studies. We will also enroll users in an OTC usability study to evaluate and document
the usability of the device. These studies will generate data for 510(k) submission. After
completion of the fast-track project, the immediate next step is the submission of 510(k)
application to FDA for OTC clearance, to allow marketing and distribution in both the professional
healthcare and consumer markets. Although the project focuses on fentanyl, the infrastructure,
resources and workflow built during this project will serve as a blueprint for Instanosis to rapidly
adapt to diagnostics for other emerging drug threats, which are being developed in our pipeline."
10909957,"Pathological aggregation of tau and the preponderance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) or other inclusions
containing tau are defining histopathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many neurodegenerative
diseases collectively known as tauopathies. A major focus of research has been the understanding of the
propagation of pathological tau in AD patient brains that follow neuronal networks. Despite the knowledge
acquired, the cellular mechanism involved in tau propagation, the nature of the tau species involved in the
spreading and the precise seeding/template remains unclear. Considering the preponderant role of tau
propagation in the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies, we performed an unbiased quantitative Mass
Spectrometry based study to determine the specific tau species involved in the spreading and the proteins that
specifically interact with this “tau-seed”. Bassoon (BSN), a large scaffolding protein of the presynaptic active
zone, was identified as a significant interactor of the tau-pathological-seed isolated from a mouse model for
tauopathy, as well as from AD and PSP postmortem samples. Prior research in AD and PSP patient samples have
linked BSN with both tauopathies. Therefore, the main goal of this proposal is to determine and dissect the mechanism by which BSN functions as a scaffold to stabilize and facilitate the spreading and neurotoxicity of a tau-pathological-seed. By introducing a series of biochemical, molecular, histological, electrophysiological, behavioral, imaging, bioinformatics and Mass Spectrometry based strategies together with mouse model, cellular culture and human postmortem tissue, this proposal will 1. evaluate the role of BSN in tau pathogenesis in vivo, 2. determine the mechanistic base of BSN in tau aggregation, propagation and synaptotoxicity in neuronal systems and 3. test if BSN's association with tau-pathological-seed is strain specific in human brains from a diverse set of tauopathies. Gaining a better understanding of the contribution of BSN on the formation, stabilization and propagation of a pathological tau-seed is highly significant since it may provide important information that will increase our understanding on the mechanism(s) involved in tau propagation, the precise nature of the tau-seed involved in this process and its role in the neurodegeneration associated to AD and other tauopathies."

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among nursing home (NH) residents with HIV is less than optimal; in
the literature 21% of people with HIV had no ART from their NH, which is in contrast to the 87.5% adherence
among community dwelling older people with HIV. ART maintains viral suppression, prevents worsening of
chronic conditions and early mortality, and stopping ART is rarely indicated. Therefore optimal ART adherence
in the NH setting can only be achieved by understanding facilitators and barriers both documented in claims
and perceived by older people with HIV. This mixed methods study will assess ART adherence during the
community-to-long-stay-NH-transition period in three aims: Aim 1 will identify person-level, and NH-level,
factors associated with changes in ART adherence in socioeconomically diverse Medicare and Medicaid special
needs plan (SNP) claims. Aim 2 will assess perceptions and experiences of long-stay NH residents with HIV
through qualitative interviews and Aim 3 will examine concordant and discordant factors associated with ART
adherence by triangulation of Aims 1 and 2. Quantitative analyses will use two databases 1) Medicare 5%
enhanced sample; 2) claims from a New York City-based Medicaid HIV SNP. Logistic and linear regression
with generalized estimating equations will examine the change in ART adherence from the 6 months prior, to
the first three months after achieving NH long-stay status (1-year continuous enrollment). Subsequently,
qualitative interviews will focus on perspectives and experiences of people living with HIV aged 50+ with
regard to facilitators and barriers to ART adherence while they were a long-stay NH residents. Recruited
through two organizations, interviews will be semi-structured and analyzed with NVivo software using
inductive and deductive theory building through grounded theory analysis and until thematic saturation is met.
Triangulation using reconciliation and initiation techniques will address discordance between quantitative and
qualitative findings. The results will provide nuance beyond administrative claims data by including social
determinants and life course experiences (e.g., housing instability). This work will expand Dr Mui’s skills to
include Medicaid SNP data, qualitative and mixed-methods research. She will be supported by four co-mentors
with expertise in geriatrics, secondary data and qualitative and mixed-methods research, and health policy, in
addition to formal training through Northeastern University and related resources. This career development
award will complete Dr. Mui’s skills for researching hard to reach populations thereby helping establish her as
an independent researcher and leader in HIV and aging. It will also be foundational to future R01 research to
analyze healthcare utilization and health outcomes associated with ART adherence in the NH."

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a prototypical genodermatosis caused by biallelic loss-
of-function mutations of COL7A1. These mutations lead to a lack of type VII collagen (C7) in the skin and
mucosal membranes, resulting in a complex phenotype of blistering, fibrosis, pseudosyndactyly, joint
contractures, esophageal strictures, corneal abrasions, malnutrition, autoimmunity, anemia, and squamous cell
carcinoma. Despite tremendous efforts over the last decade to establish curative measures for this severe and
potentially fatal disorder, there are as yet no therapies that reliably supply C7 protein to the multiple sites
affected by generalized severe RDEB. To address this, we propose to gain a more mechanistic understanding of
how to restore the integrity of COL7A1 without causing collateral damage to the rest of the genome, and of how
the specialized tropism of cells works to deliver intact, functional C7 throughout the body. In order to
accomplish these goals and to overcome the limitations of current gene and cell therapies, we will investigate
the following questions: [i] Is base editing superior to CRISPR/Cas9-editing for correction of COL7A1
mutations? Because base editing does not cause double-strand breaks in the way that classic gene editing with
DNA nucleases does, it avoids genotoxic stress. [ii] Are skin-specialized cells, such as ABCB5+ mesenchymal
stromal/stem cells (MSCs), superior to alternative sources of MSCs in expression of C7 levels adequate for
cross-correction of C7 deficiency in RDEB? We will evaluate skin-specific stromal cells, such as mesenchymal
stromal cells expressing ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (ABCB5+) surface protein, derived
directly from skin or indirectly from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which have had COL7A1
restored to function with base editing. [iii] Do COL7A1-edited human ABCB5+ MSCs mediate wound healing in
a preclinical murine model of RDEB? Using our murine model of RDEB that accepts human xenografts, we will
quantify the value of base editing-corrected ABCB5+ MSCs and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs.
We propose to define the conditions conducive to wound healing in this severe blistering genodermatosis by
using powerful tools for studying and manipulating the information bases of biological systems (i.e.,
programmable deaminases for base editing-mediated gene therapy; induced cell lineage conversion; and skin
tropism). We will aim for personalized cell therapy for individuals with generalized severe RDEB, with the idea
that our findings may provide insights into ways to manage other genodermatoses, as well as treatment of
mucocutaneous ulcers, and chemical and thermal burns. Our proposal is equally motived by wanting a better
understanding of the biological mechanisms in injured skin and by needing to improve the lives of people with
RDEB through reducing the risks and maximizing the benefits of potential novel gene and cell therapies."

The techniques of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing and the ability to generate induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a sample of a patient’s blood have placed medicine on the brink of a
revolution in our ability to treat, and perhaps even cure, a broad range of genome-based diseases. Over
the past four years the Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center (now the UTSW Wellstone MDSRC) has made tremendous strides
toward the translation of this technology to benefit patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and
ultimately, other forms of muscular dystrophy. The mission of the Training Core has been just as
impactful as it is essential to train a new generation of clinicians, physician-scientists, and basic scientists
who are able to apply these evolving technologies in the service of muscular dystrophy patients and their
community. The objective of the training core is to enhance the educational environment of the Wellstone
network in order to recruit, train, and maintain the next generation of transformative investigators focused
on addressing the challenges of muscular dystrophy. Our approach focuses on five elements: (Aim 1)
To enhance the training environment of the UTSW Wellstone Center and promote trainee career
advancement, (Aim 2) To recruit new trainees to muscular dystrophy research, (Aim 3) To mentor
trainees in the process of obtaining funding support for the next step in their careers, (Aim 4) To organize
research meetings involving Wellstone trainees, and (Aim 5) To organize training activities that benefit
the overall muscular dystrophy research community. To accomplish these goals, we’ve built on the very
successful program developed over the past four years of funding, that has both complemented and
leveraged the strengths of existing training programs here at UTSW."
10917933,"There is concern regarding the quality of animal cells grown in tissue culture for scientific studies. It is
reported that many laboratories use misidentified cells or cells unwittingly contaminated with
mycoplasma microorganisms. In addition, as cell populations are passaged for extended periods, elusive
epigenetic changes may arise that can go unnoticed and alter experimental results. Finally, in research
involving isolating a specific cell type from primary tissue, small subpopulations of unwanted cells may
overgrow and replace the cells of interest. The failure of researchers to detect these problems and
changes can lead to erroneous experimental results, wasting valuable time and research funds.
The proposed SBIR research aims to develop an innovative instrument to assist researchers in detecting
these subtle yet critical issues before they jeopardize research efforts. The Cell Assurance Monitor
(CAM) is based on a technology where cells are cultured upon electrodes carrying weak AC signals. By
monitoring the complex impedance of these electrode substrates at multiple AC frequencies, several
parameters related to cell morphology and behavior can be discerned.
In past studies, impedance measurements did not fully leverage their multifaceted nature. However, in
feasibility studies with Cornell University, multivariate statistical analysis has been used to show the
ability of the impedance data to both identify different cell lines and detect mycoplasma infections.
In the SBIR project, impedance data will be recorded at multiple laboratories using groups of cell lines
having similar visual morphology. Multivariate statistics, where several impedance variables are reduced
to a limited set of features, will be extended to discover the most discriminating features for describing
these challenging clusters of cells. Research studies will also continue to investigate the efficacy of the
method to detect mycoplasma infection. Other studies will commence to study the succession of
different subpopulations in primary tissue isolates and the epigenetic changes occurring with cells
grown to high passage numbers.
With this statistical information, software algorithms will be developed for automated data acquisition
and statistical analysis yielding a visual feature space where each cell variant will have a defined
position. Electronics tailored to retrieve the required data and electrode arrays will be designed and
fabricated, and the completed instrument beta tested using our existing customer base.
The CAM is not intended to replace well-established techniques to determine cell identity or detect
mycoplasma contamination. Instead, this new tool would provide a frequent, quantitative, and
affordable means to complement routine microscopic cell morphology checks to spot cell changes that
could jeopardize research results."

10922724,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Many rural communities are medically underserved and experience persistently elevated rates of colorectal
cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality relative to declining national rates. Routine screening reduces population
CRC mortality, yet its impact is reduced because many adults who have an abnormal screening result with
fecal testing do not receive diagnostic follow-up with colonoscopy. Rural residents and healthcare providers
face unique barriers to screening follow-up including fewer providers who offer colonoscopy and longer travel
distances to obtain healthcare. Rural Southern Illinois is a region with high poverty, slow economic growth,
isolated households, widely dispersed medical care, and high CRC mortality. To reduce disparities in CRC
mortality in rural areas where fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) is a common first-line screening strategy, we
must identify effective, sustainable, and disseminable strategies to improve follow-up of positive screening
tests. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine have collaborated with Southern Illinois
Healthcare, a rural not-for-profit health system, since 2015 to identify cancer prevention and control priorities
and reduce disparities. From 2017 to 2018, we conducted a formal pre-implementation assessment of CRC
screening and follow-up processes to identify feasible and promising evidence-based interventions and
strategies for improvement. Based on our substantial and specific preliminary data, we propose the following
Aims: Aim 1. Implement a multilevel intervention of follow-up of abnormal colon cancer screening tests
in primary care clinics across rural Southern Illinois. Using a stepped wedge trial design and cluster
randomization, we will implement the multi-level intervention in 18 clinics. We will intervene at three levels
(patients, providers/clinical teams, clinics) and evaluate implementation outcomes per Proctor's evaluation
model using interviews, surveys, and field notes. Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of the multilevel intervention
on follow-up of abnormal screening test results in rural primary care settings in Southern Illinois. Our
stepped-wedge design will allow us to test the impact of the multi-level intervention on rates of screening
follow-up. We measure outcomes at three levels. Patient: After positive FIT, receipt of referral and completion
of colonoscopy. Primary Care Provider: Receipt of positive FIT results and referral for follow-up. Clinic-level:
Patients with positive FIT complete colonoscopy. We will assess change in CRC screening rates and
investigate interactions between and across levels. Data for primary outcomes will come from the healthcare
system's ongoing patient registry that draws from electronic medical records and lab records. The co-
construction of this proposal between university researchers and health system stakeholders enhances the
potential for significant and sustainable change for effective and efficient screening and early detection. There
is a critical need for real-world strategies that can function within rural community health systems to improve
health and reduce disparities."
10922731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Young men who have sex with men (YMSM; age 18-34) are disproportionately burdened by HIV. Minority stress and its “downstream” effects in YMSM, including mental health issues, sexual risk behaviors, and suboptimal HIV testing, contribute to the syndemic risks surrounding HIV. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), adapted for HIV prevention among YMSM and internet-based delivery to maximize reach and engagement, could offer an innovative and scalable method to address this public health issue. Consistent with NCCIH’s scientific priority in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion across Lifespan, the current project aims to develop an internet-delivered MBI for HIV prevention among distressed, high-risk YMSM. Specifically, this K23 will provide support for an early phase, exploratory clinical trial by adapting mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and conducting a feasibility trial among YMSM. Candidate: Dr. Sun is a clinical scientist with a research background in HIV prevention and mental health concerning minority populations and marginalized communities. In recent years, she has pursued clinical and research development in mindfulness. Building on her prior work, she is applying for a five-year K23 Career Development Award to obtain training, mentorship, and research experience to become an expert in adapting and evaluating internet-delivered MBI to address HIV-related health disparities and an independent investigator capable of R01 funding. Mentoring: A stellar team of senior investigators serve on the advisory panel. Drs. Don Operario and Judson Brewer are co-primary mentors, who have complimentary expertise in HIV prevention for MSM and internet-based MBI for behavioral health. Three co-mentors bring expertise in internet-based HIV intervention with young adults (Dr. Larry Brown), mindfulness for population health (Dr. Eric Loucks), and stress physiology (Dr. Audrey Tyrka). Research: Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, the proposed project aims to (1) adapt MBSR for distressed, high risk YMSM and internet-delivery using focus groups with YMSM (n=30) and stakeholders (n=16), (2) refine the intervention protocol by administering adapted materials to distressed, high risk YMSM (n=18) and stakeholders (n=16) via theatre testing, and (3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted iMBI for HIV prevention by randomizing 40 distressed, high-risk YMSM to the iMBI (n=20) and a Health Education condition (n=20). The study will examine recruitment and retention, intervention adherence (e.g., attendance, at-home practice), completion of assessment (HIV testing, sexual risk behaviors, hair sample collection, mental health, minority stress and coping), and acceptability of the intervention. Trainings: Dr. Sun will receive training in MBSR, intervention adaptation and implementation for YMSM and internet-delivery, and a biopsychosocial-based understanding of stress through coursework, seminars, workshops, directed readings, and mentored research. Guided by an excellent mentorship team, these training and research experiences will establish the candidate’s career as an expert in HIV-related behavioral health and iMBI for minority health. The candidate is institutionally supported by Brown University School of Public Health."
10922793,"Abstract
Neurostimulation, including invasive methods like deep brain stimulation (DBS), is an increasingly
important approach to treating mental illness. It offers the possibility of directly targeting specific circuits to
reverse circuit dysfunctions that underpin mental disorders. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of brain
stimulation is still unreliable. DBS, for instance, has extraordinary results in the hands of expert academics, but
has not passed a well-controlled US-based clinical trial. The critical barrier is that it is very difficult to study
or optimize DBS’ mechanisms of action in psychiatric illness. Animal studies would be ideal for refining
stimulation strategies, but the primary species for modeling mental illness are rats and mice. The most
promising DBS treatments act on circuits that lack true rodent homologues. We and other investigators
have shown that, at multiple brain targets, effective DBS alters neural activity distally, especially in lateral
prefrontal cortex (LPFC), which is only found in primates. Non-human primates (NHPs), especially macaques,
which have strong LFPC homology to humans, would thus be an excellent model for understanding how DBS
works. Macaque studies have yielded major insight in other DBS applications such as movement disorders.
In this project, we demonstrate an approach to modeling DBS in non-human primates by focusing on
cognitive control. Cognitive control is the ability to regulate one’s own cognition, such as withholding a habitual
response in favor of a more goal-aligned option. It is disrupted in depression, obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD), and emerging DBS indications like addiction. Co-PI Widge recently showed that DBS at a well-studied
target, the ventral internal capsule/ ventral striatum (VCVS), acts in part by improving cognitive control.
That improvement appears to involve PFC activity changes. The challenge is that it is not clear why or
through what pathways VCVS DBS improves cognitive control, and thus we lack the ability to optimize the
effect. We propose to answer that question by stimulating individual tracts and gray matter nuclei that comprise
the VCVS DBS target, in rhesus macaques performing a standard cognitive control task (the Flanker task).
During stimulation, we will record single units and local field potentials from multiple PFC structures, identifying
mechanisms by which VCVS DBS exerts pro-cognitive effects. Aim 1 maps these mechanisms relative to
cortico-thalamic tracts in the internal capsule, while Aim 2 extends that mapping to cortico-striatal tracts and
striatal nuclei. These studies are possible through a unique clinical, engineering, and neuroscientific
collaboration. Co-I Johnson has developed methods for “steering” electrical neurostimulation to preferentially
target structures surrounding a DBS electrode, allowing circuit-targeted neurostimulation without the use of
viral/genetic manipulations. His expertise supports our team’s capabilities in macaque cognitive neuroscience
(contact PI Hayden), clinical DBS (Widge), and striatal anatomy (co-I Heilbronner)."
10922796,"The field of cancer diagnostics is in a rapidly expanding growth phase that goes hand in glove with the precision
medicine revolution. However, the rapid pace at which new technologies are entering the marketplace makes
rigorous evaluation via controlled studies infeasible for all but a relative few. This means that while we typically
have some data about diagnostic test performance, we frequently lack evidence regarding the outcomes that
drive clinical and policy decisions. The Research Program outlined in this application will tackle this data-
evidence divide using the tools of modeling and analytics. Modeling is an increasingly accepted discipline for
integrating knowledge about the process by which diagnostic performance drives outcomes. Analytics is the use
of statistical learning techniques to fill in the knowledge gaps and to propagate uncertainty from model inputs to
outcomes. The Principal Investigator has built a leading research program in modeling and analytics for evidence
generation in cancer policy. Among many methodologic and substantive contributions, her work has informed
prostate cancer screening guidelines from national policy panels, established best practices for estimation of
overdiagnosis, and produced specific directions for screening high-risk populations including Black men. The
Research Program outlined in this application will harness the modeling and analytics skillset developed by the
Principal Investigator over nearly three decades to build a framework and tools for evidence generation around
cancer diagnostics. The application details a sequence of projects for two technologies that are generating
intense current interest with wide-ranging practice implications and serious evidence gaps: Multi-cancer early
detection testing, and PSMA-PET/CT for newly diagnosed and recurrent prostate cancer. The MCED work will
deepen our understanding of performance characteristics, provide guidance regarding a defensible test
confirmation strategy, project benefits and harms of different MCED strategies and offer new ideas for
shortcutting the typically lengthy process of cancer screening trials. The PSMA-PET/CT work will develop an
approach for updating treatment benefit estimated derived from trials that included a mixture of patients with
unknown PSMA status and will project lives saved of treatment reallocation on the basis of PSMA-PET.CT result.
The tools and processes developed for modeling these technologies will be applicable to other new diagnostics
that emerge during the lifetime of the Research Program. The modeling work will be accompanied by a sequence
of real-world analytics projects to assess dissemination of and disparities in uptake of novel diagnostics and their
consequences for healthcare utilization and costs. This work will establish collaborations with new real-world
data partners and materially expand the Principal Investigator’s skillset to encompass a greater competency in
medical informatics. The successful execution of the Research Program will improve our understanding of how
novel cancer diagnostics impact clinical and policy relevant outcomes so that these technologies can be used
wisely and equitably to improve care for all cancer patients."

Brain metastasis accounts for significant morbidity and mortality of many cancer types, the two most common 
being  lung  and  breast  cancers.  This  devastating  complication  is  initiated  by  a  rare  subset  of  the  circulating 
tumor  cells  (CTCs)  shed  into  the  blood  stream.  The  crossing  of  the  blood-­brain  barrier  (BBB)  by  CTCs  is  the 
first  critical  step  that  initiates  brain  metastasis.  Thus,  understanding  how  CTCs  can  breach  the  BBB  is  critical 
for  developing  means  to  predict,  prevent,  or  treat  brain  metastasis.  Our  recent  study  using  ex  vivo  expanded 
CTCs  isolated  from  breast  cancer  patients  identified  a  transmembrane  surface  receptor,  SEMA4D,  promotes 
brain metastasis by enabling CTCs to cross the BBB via binding to its ligand PLXNB1 on the brain endothelial 
cells  (BECs).  Our  preliminary  data  now  show  that  SEMA4D  stimulation  leads  to  YAP/TAZ  signaling  in  tumor 
cells,  a pathway  well  known  to  promote  cell  motility  and  migration, and  recently  implicated  in  the development 
of  brain  metastasis.  Therefore,  we  hypothesize  a  role  for  “reverse  signaling”  through  the  SEMA4D 
cytoplasmic  tails  to  activate  YAP  signaling  for  synergizing  with  SEMA4D-­PLXNB1  tethering  to  the  BECs  to 
breach  the  BBB.  We  will  utilize  our  unique  resources  of  patient-­derived  CTCs,  and  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  BBB 
transmigration  assays  to  test  our  hypothesis.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  dissect  the  detailed 
mechanisms linking SEMA4D to YAP signaling, and the role for YAP in SEMA4D-­mediated BBB transmigration. 
Delineating  the  combinatory  effect  of  SEMA4D  and  YAP  signaling  will  allow  us  to  design  potential  therapeutic 
approaches  to  prevent  SEMA4D-­mediated  brain  metastasis.  Such  knowledge  will  also  provide  a  mechanistic 
basis for identifying additional BBB transmigration initiators that could act similarly through receptor tethering to 
BECs  and  subsequent  activation  of  YAP,  which  could  have  a  broader  impact  on  identifying  predictive

10922840,"This SBIR Phase IIB project expands the GripTract product line to include a model for upper gastrointestinal
(GI) endoscopy procedures and conducts clinical trials in the lower GI at Columbia University and Cleveland
Clinic. A preclinical study of the lower GI model in the corresponding Phase II project demonstrated: (a) fewer
perforations, (b) lower procedure time, and (c) lower learning curve than control. GripTract is a press-cap on
the distal end of the endoscope, with integrated fingers connected to proximal controls. It allows a clinician to
manipulate tissue during complex polypectomies without occupying the endoscope’s working channel.
Public Health Problem: Cancers of the GI tract accessible by endoscope – esophagus, stomach, and intestines
– account for > 80,000 deaths and $20B in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Clinicians struggle to safely
resect large (>2 cm), complicated polyps (e.g., flat sessile lesions) prone to recurrence and malignancy.
Recurrence rates of standard piecemeal resection, which are associated with residual polyp and risk of
reseeding of malignant lesions, increase from 3% for <2 cm polyps to 85% for polyps >2 cm. In one Japanese
study, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enabled en bloc removal of large polyps in 84-95% of cases
and had a low 0-2% tumor recurrence rate. Difficulty retracting tissue is a significant factor impeding
widespread use of ESD. The few available retraction products are expensive, difficult to use, may require a
special endoscope, or may not work in all GI regions. GripTract is a cost-effective endoscopic accessory that
allows less experienced clinicians to learn ESD more quickly. This will enable wider adoption of ESD, reducing
the number of patients having invasive surgical or piecemeal resection, and reducing morbidity and recurrence.
Phase IIB Hypothesis: En bloc resection offers high curative and low recurrence rates. By reducing the
procedure time, the learning burden, and the incidence of adverse event (AEs), GripTract will enable more
physicians to deliver better treatment (en bloc resection) at lower cost. Aim 1: GripTract Upper GI
Model Development. Acceptance Criteria: Upper GI Model that fits gastroscopes with distal end diameters 8.9-
10.5 mm and lengths from 1030-1100 mm. Aim 2: GripTract Upper GI Model Verification and Validation
(V&V) and FDA 510(k) Submission. Acceptance Criteria: All tests passed in V&V. FDA 510(k) for Upper GI
model. Aim 3: GripTract Lower GI Model Clinical Preparation & Ex Vivo/In Vivo Training. Acceptance Criteria:
All devices produced for training and clinical studies. IRB submission and approval at clinical sites for the FDA-
cleared Lower GI GripTract models. At each site, Clinicians (3/3) meet training specifications (i.e., resection
and perforation criteria) with at least 4 resections each in ex vivo and in vivo preclinical models in preparation
for the clinical study. Aim 4: Grip-Tract Lower GI Model Multi-site Randomize Clinical Study. Acceptance
Criteria: GripTract successfully demonstrates defined endpoints related to safety, dissection duration/speed,
and clean resection margins in statistically powered clinical study. GripTract to Standard ESD cost comparison."

Health Equity (CAIRHE) is to help COBRE-supported, other Montana State University (MSU), and
local/regional investigators pursue multidisciplinary biomedical research by providing facilities, instrumentation,
analytical services, and consultation and training on biomarker assessments for diet, lifestyle, mental/emotional
health, and chronic disease. Conducting validated and culturally relevant biomedical research addressing
social determinants of health is a key research challenge in the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) state
of Montana, which lacks a medical school and is home to Indigenous and rural populations that face significant
health disparities. To address this need, CAIRHE established the TBC in COBRE Phase I to strengthen the
biomedical research capacity of its early-career investigators, both current and future, and to support
translational interventions and clinical trials that address health equity. Beyond CAIRHE investigators, the TBC
also supports the Center’s close IDeA program collaborator at MSU, Montana INBRE, as well as other public
health and biomedical researchers at MSU, and local and regional clinical, industry, and non-academic entities.
The use of validated biomarkers is important in translational public health research, including community-
based research, because it provides objective evaluation of lifestyle behaviors and linkages to chronic disease
and other health outcomes. Within a multidisciplinary, community-based health equity center composed largely
of social scientists, the TBC’s analytical support of early-career investigators pursuing translational research on
social determinants of health is highly innovative and unique at MSU. COBRE Phase III funding will allow the
Core to continue to provide subsidized support to CAIRHE pilot project leaders, with the goal of advancing their
research toward R01-level applications. Moreover, Phase III funding will allow the Core to continue building
and broadening its fee-based clientele including former CAIRHE project leaders, other MSU investigators, local
and regional research partners, and affiliate institutions throughout the Montana INBRE network. This
continued growth of fee-paying clientele is essential to the long-term sustainability of the Core. To meet these
objectives, the Core will continue to pursue the following three Specific Aims: 1) Provide and maintain state-of-
the-art laboratory instrumentation; 2) Provide lab analytical services for conducting biomarker assessments;
and 3) Provide biomarker research consultation and training to investigators. An effective Core is an
indispensable part of the Center’s overarching aim to be the state and regional leader in multidisciplinary,
community-based health equity research, thereby improving the health of Indigenous and rural communities.
Ultimately a strong Core will accelerate the mitigation of health disparities linked to lifestyle and socioeconomic
factors in underserved communities in Montana."
10929569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Unintended pregnancies, which are unwanted or mistimed pregnancies, result from either not using
contraception or improper use of available contraceptives. These pregnancies have a significant impact on
healthcare costs and the families in which the unintended pregnancies occur. A promising strategy to reduce
unintended pregnancies and subsequent costs is to increase the contraceptive options available to men.
Contraline has developed an injectable, long-lasting, vas-occlusive hydrogel called ADAM. ADAM is injected into
the vas deferens to block sperm from traveling from the testicles to the ejaculatory duct. Although ADAM has
shown safety and efficacy in a First-in-Human trial, initial studies have shown that the next generation of ADAM
(ADAM Air) can reduce manufacturing and procedural complexities, and enable on-demand reversibility should
a patient desire their fertility be restored. ADAM Air is an aerogel, or dehydrated version of the ADAM hydrogel.
As a result, ADAM Air is implanted into the vas deferens, rather than injected; however, within minutes, the
aerogel absorbs fluid and swells to become a highly effective occlusive hydrogel. The initial formulation of ADAM
Air displays >20% terminal swelling and >200% swelling force than ADAM, all while maintaining ideal mechanical
properties for vas occlusion. Moreover, the first generation of ADAM induces azoospermia at implant lengths of
≥ 15 cm, making on-demand reversal prior to implant degradation difficult. ADAM Air can be manufactured at a
variety of diameters and lengths (i.e., <5 cm) making on-demand reversal safer and more reliable. In this SBIR
proposal, we will develop three optimized formulations of ADAM Air to screen for enhanced occlusive
performance and commercial potential. The ADAM Air formulation that demonstrates superior physicochemical
properties will be selected and undergo preliminary biocompatibility studies in vitro and in vivo (rabbit model).
After establishing initial biocompatibility, implant delivery and reversal feasibility will be tested and optimized in
a human cadaver model. After completion of Phase I, Contraline will perform GLP compliant FDA IDE-enabling,
starting with detailed mechanical and chemical characterization of ADAM Air. Next, the full suite of
biocompatibility studies will be executed based on FDA requirements. Finally, in vivo canine studies will be
performed to evaluate ADAM Air implantation and reversal safety and efficacy. Upon completion of these aims,
Contraline will have demonstrated the overall feasibility of using an aerogel for male contraception, the first
product of its kind. ADAM Air will be shown to be safe, effective, and reversible across a variety of benchtop, ex
vivo, and in vivo models. This will allow Contraline to submit an IDE application to pursue a First-in-Human
clinical trial for ADAM Air. Following completion of the First-in-Human trial, a pivotal trial will be initiated to support
FDA approval. These aims will lead to the development and FDA approval of the first long-acting, reversible
contraceptive for men, which will significantly reduce unintended pregnancies and provide men and couples with
more contraceptive options."

Emerging data have linked the gut microbiome to colorectal adenomas, the established early lesions in
colorectal cancer (CRC) and de facto targets during screening colonoscopy. However, deficit in our knowledge
of the basic science of the gut microbiome and the specific driver mechanisms for inducing adenoma formation
and progression has impeded translation. We hypothesize that the microbiome is an adenoma nonautonomous
inducer of colorectal “priming,” the term we use in this application to refer to molecular/cellular alterations
critical for adenoma formation and progression. The near-term objective of this proposal is to define whether
and how the microbiome and the primed colon act in concert to drive adenoma formation. The long-term
objective of this proposal is to develop microbiome-based strategies for precision prevention of adenomas and
ultimately CRC. In Aim 1, we will identify interdependencies of the microbiome and the primed colon. We will
leverage insights from a novel, validated metagenomic analysis. Using gnotobiotic mice, we will study
interactions between a primed colon, tumorigenic gut bacteria, and tumorigenesis. We use analytic approaches
such as mediation analysis to quantify the extent to which the microbiome and a primed colon each mediate
the other’s tumorigenic effects. In Aim 2, we will identify the adenoma-associated gut microbiome features that
characterize aggressive vs indolent adenomas in humans. We will analyze a unique cohort of longitudinally
monitored adenomas through deep sequencing, in situ bacterial imaging, rigorously defined genetic/molecular
profiles generated in Project 1, and machine learning to identify adenoma-associated microbiome features that
interact with primed colon attributes to drive adenoma progression. In Aim 3, we will determine if microbiome-
induced senescent fibroblasts drive progression behavior in adenoma cells in ex vivo adenoma organoids
through specific CRC-associated senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. Using primary
colon fibroblasts derived from gnotobiotic mice colonized with a CRC-associated bacterial consortium, we will
assess oncogenic effects on adenoma progression behavior in an ex vivo organoid model. We will determine
whether tumorigenic effects of the microbiome are mediated through induction of the senescent colon primed
state, and we will mechanistically test roles for candidate CRC-associated SASP factors in driving progression
behavior of adenoma cells in ex vivo human adenoma organoids. Our findings could serve as the basis for
biology-backed, intervenable, precision prevention of adenomas and ultimately CRC."

The UNMCCC Fluorescence Microscopy & Cell Imaging Shared Resource (Microscopy) supports basic and 
translational cancer research by providing state-of-the-art instrumentation and software for quantitative, multi scale, and multi-modal fluorescence imaging, to UNMCCC members and non-member users. Faculty Director 
Diane Lidke, Ph.D. (CMO) supervises the Resource, which is operated by Michael Paffett, Ph.D., a full-time 
staff with broad expertise in fluorescence microscopy instrumentation. The UNMCCC Research Administration 
manages the Resource, which provides access to 11 commercial instruments for fluorescence, phase or 
brightfield imaging, as well as multiple software platforms for image analysis. In addition, CCC members have 
access to the Super-Resolution Core, directed by Keith Lidke, Ph.D. (CMO) that houses cutting-edge and 
developmental instrumentation for single molecule, super-resolution and hyperspectral imaging. The Super Resolution core is further supported by Michael Wester, Ph.D. who is an expert in single molecule image 
analysis. This partnership provides UNMCCC members with technologies not available at other Cancer Centers
and the opportunity to develop new imaging and analysis approaches to specifically address outstanding 
questions in cancer biology. The expense and significant expertise required to purchase, maintain and operate 
such a diverse suite of instrumentation, is prohibitive for most users and underscores the value added by the 
Resource. Microscopy actively facilitates and disseminates information about new cellular imaging technologies 
by maintaining an up-to-date web page and by giving presentations at UNMCCC meetings and retreats.
Resource faculty and staff also contribute to multiple education activities, including courses focused on 
microscopy that attract graduate students and postdocs from UNMCCC member labs. Reservations, billing and 
usage are tracked through a centralized on-line system. During the previous 5-year project period, 59 UNMCCC 
member laboratories from three UNMCCC Research Programs used the Resource, resulting in 67 publications. 
In the previous period, UNMCCC members were responsible for 61% of total Resource usage by billing and 
were supported by 132 peer-reviewed grants and 8 UNMCCC pilot projects."
10926957,"SUMMARY
Accomplishment of the translational and basic science aims of each Translational and Basic Science of
Adenomas Center (TBAC) project will depend on reliable access to the biospecimens, analytic and data services
that will be provided by the Translational Pathology and Data Analysis Core (TPDAC). The TPDAC facilitates
the utilization of existing resources/facilities in the University of Wisconsin (U WI) Department of Pathology &
Laboratory Medicine Translational Research Initiatives in Pathology (TRIP) Laboratory and Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) along with faculty expertise in the U WI Departments of Pathology &
Laboratory Medicine, Radiology, Oncology and Biostatistics. The complementarity between the populations at
two public research institutions will allow intra- and inter-TBAC investigators to access biospecimens that will not
only advance our knowledge of early colonic lesions, but also ensure adequate representation of patient diversity
in our studies. In addition, TBAC U54 Project studies require analytic resources that use innovative technologies,
such as Digital Spatial Profiling, Single cell Seq, and multispectral imaging. The availability of technology and
expertise in the UW TRIP Lab permits quantitative analysis of multiple molecular targets at single-cell resolution
in a single tissue section. Finally, the commitment of the TPDAC ensures consistent implementation of big data
analysis and statistics to enhance the TBAC’s translational goals, which include providing high-dimensional
datasets for cross-TBEL collaborative studies. Under U54 support, the TPDAC will contain the expertise needed
to help identify, optimize and implement the newest technology for early colon lesion research.
 The TPDAC draws upon elements from biospecimen science, research pathology, imaging and data analysis
services units at U WI, UWCCC, FHCRC, and Univ of Washington. The additive and complementary expertise
and resources at the two research institutions will be capable of providing investigators of early colonic lesions
in all of the TBAC Projects with a wide array of pathology and analytic services to support translational and basic
research. The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1) To collect, organize, and distribute annotated polyps and imaging data from computed tomography
colonography (CTC) to facilitate research in early colonic lesions.
Aim 2) To support multi-omics analysis of nonadvanced and advanced colonic adenomas and matched normal
colon samples from the ColoCare and GiCaRes cohorts.
Aim 3) To support spatial and molecular profiling projects with a comprehensive array of pathology services and
analytic tools.
Aim 4) To support analysis and integration of high dimensional data generated from multi-omics studies."

The UNMCCC Biostatistics Shared Resource supports basic, clinical, population/community, and translational 
cancer research by providing cost-effective, full service biostatistical support for researchers with interests 
spanning the full range of research activities in the UNMCCC. Faculty Director V. Shane Pankratz, Ph.D. 
(CCPS) supervises the Resource, which is operated by statistical faculty and staff. Administrative support is 
provided by the UNMCCC Research Administration. The Resource provides an array of statistical support to 
researchers in the UNMCCC, including the provision of statistical expertise in study designs and data types 
arising across the cancer research continuum, the provision of protocol reviews to the Protocol Review and 
Monitoring Committee (PRMC) and others, assistance in the development of new research projects, support in 
conducting and monitoring ongoing research projects through the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC), and other means, the provision of analytical support for research studies, and access to specialized 
statistical software. Members of the Resource work closely with the Analytical & Translational Genomics and the 
Bioinformatics Shared Resources to enhance the acquisition of knowledge from NGS and other genomic data. 
Requests for the support of new projects are made through a simple on-line system, and Resource members 
collaborate closely among themselves and with other researchers to monitor work flows and ensure timely 
completion of research projects. The current goals of the Resource are to: 1) provide members of the UNMCCC 
Research Programs with biostatistical support in the development and conduct of clinical trials and laboratory and population-based research projects, and the analysis of data from these projects, 2) provide a statistical 
resource to UNMCCC members that supports projects requiring only a short-term and limited level of 
biostatistical input, 3) ensure study integrity, high data quality, and patient safety in all research conducted within 
the UNMCCC through the scientific review of clinical research protocols, including formal participation in the 
PRMC, and through the monitoring of clinical trials conducted within the UNMCCC via participation in the DSMC 
and 4) enhance the research capacity of UNMCCC members by providing educational opportunities and by 
disseminating information on available resources, technologies, and services. The Resource Director and other 
Resource members work closely with UNMCCC research programs to identify biostatistical support needs and 
to develop collaborations between statisticians and other researchers. During the past 5-yr project period, 70
UNMCCC members across all three UNMCCC Research Programs used the Resource to carry out 181 projects, 
with 98 published or in-press manuscripts. In the reporting year of July 2018 – June 2019, UNMCCC members 
were responsible for 100% of total Resource usage and were supported by 23 peer-reviewed grants."

10926968,"ABSTRACT – Data Core
The Data Core will centralize data-related services across research projects for the P01 Program Project, 
“Improving Provider Announcement Communication Training (IMPACT),” at the University of North Carolina. 
The IMPACT Program Project will make a significant contribution to cancer prevention by developing new 
evidence on effective strategies to improve provider communication and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine 
uptake. Drs. Justin Trogdon and Nisha Gottfredson will be the co-leads of the Data Core. The Data Core’s 
functions include managing a national primary care team survey, cleaning and standardizing effectiveness data 
across research projects and providing statistical support for randomization and analysis. The three Specific 
Aims of the Data Core are as follows. Aim 1 is to develop, oversee, and manage the national primary care 
team survey. The Data Core will survey 2,500 primary care team members: 1,500 HPV vaccine providers 
(physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) and 1,000 registered nurses and medical assistants 
involved in adolescent vaccination. The Data Core will be responsible for coordinating and integrating survey 
measures for use across projects, collaborating with the survey subcontractor to oversee survey 
implementation, and managing and preparing data for use by the research projects. Aim 2 is to facilitate 
access to, and standardize the structure of, large vaccination datasets generated by research project 
randomized clinical trials. The Data Core will be a central hub for managing, harmonizing, storing, and 
distributing randomized clinical trial vaccine outcomes data that will be used to evaluate intervention impact 
across Projects 1 through 3. The Core will also provide the resulting data to Project 4 to support budget impact 
and cost-effectiveness modelling. Aim 3 is to provide statistical and methodological support to research 
projects. The Data Core team will connect project investigators with appropriate statistical and study design 
expertise to design and consult on analyses as needed by the research projects. The Data Core activities will 
result in a national primary care team survey, high-quality, standardized data and appropriate and rigorous 
statistical analysis in an efficient manner that will increase the collective scientific impact of the P01 Program 
Project. The Data Core addresses the IMPACT Program Project theme by helping the research projects to 
build capacity for HPV vaccine communication interventions among primary care teams in healthcare systems."
10927421,"Project Summary
The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate specific crosstalk mechanisms between the integrated stress
response (ISR) and circadian timekeeping, two fundamental biological processes in neurons. Circadian rhythm
regulates neuronal differentiation, plasticity, and tissue regeneration and its disruption contributes to a variety of
human health problems. Circadian clock genes are widely expressed in almost all cells. To function properly, the
cellular clock must integrate and synchronize with cellular physiology and metabolism. ISR is a conserved
intracellular signaling network for cells to respond to stressors and restore homeostasis. Little is known, however,
on whether and how ISR integrates with the circadian clock, which forms a major gap in our understanding of
homeostatic integration in neurons. Our recently published work indicates that ISR may be a conserved
mechanism that couples cellular stress response to circadian timekeeping. Based on the published work and
unpublished preliminary data, here we propose to test the overall hypothesis that ISR interacts with the
mammalian circadian clock: ISR regulates fundamental clock properties including entrainment and
circadian period, whereas the clock controls ISR response based on the time of day. We will leverage our
expertise and unique mouse models to test the hypothesis using a combination of molecular, cellular, and
behavioral approaches. Aim 1 will define a role for the ISR inhibitor IMPACT (imprinted and ancient gene protein)
in regulating photic entrainment of the circadian clock. Aim 2 will identify a role for unfolded protein response
and PERK (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) in circadian timekeeping. Aim 3 will elucidate
eIF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2)-dependent translational control mechanisms in the circadian
clock. The proposed work is innovative, because it utilizes new mouse genetic tools to address conceptually
novel questions regarding the crosstalk mechanisms between ISR and the clock. The contributions are expected
to be significant, because it is expected to uncover mechanistic links between the two fundamentally important
cellular processes. Importantly, ISR frequently goes awry in complex brain disorders, which are often associated
with disrupted daily rhythms in patients due to unknown mechanisms. As ISR can be targeted by FDA-approved
drugs, understanding its role in circadian physiology may offer new opportunities to regulate the body clock
function and to treat clock dysfunctions in these diseases."

CANDIDATE: The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Zeglis at Hunter College of CUNY.
Her proposed research will provide a strong foundation for independent research career following the K99 phase
of this grant. Her long-term career goal is to establish a robust program in environmental pollution research
utilizing molecular imaging. To achieve this, she has developed a career plan that will (1) broaden her technical
and scientific skills (2) strengthen her presentation and communication skills, and cultivate her professional
relationships, (3) enrich her mentoring skills, and (4) prepare her for the transition to independence.
RESEARCH: The proliferation of micro- and nanoplastics in the environment is increasing at an alarming rate.
Micro- and nanoplastics have been found to be persistent and ubiquitous pollutants in a variety of environments,
including sea water, fresh water, soil, sewage, and air. In light of this harrowing phenomenon, the evaluation of
the possible health effects of microplastic (<5 mm) and nanoplastic (<100 nm) pollutants has emerged as an
unmet scientific need. The over-arching goal of this investigation is to study the biodistribution and health effects
of micro- and nanoplastics in mammals using a sensitive and quantitative molecular imaging technique: positron
emission tomography (PET). The exquisite sensitivity of PET is major advantage of this strategy, as it will
facilitate the non-invasive tracking of micro- and nanoplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations. The
specific aims are: 1) To determine the bioaccumulation and bioretention of radioplastics in mice after pulmonary
and oral exposure, 2) To quantify the bioaccumulation and bioretention of radioplastics in pregnant mice after
oral and pulmonary exposure, and 3) To quantify the pro-inflammatory effects of micro- and nanoplastic exposure
via non-invasive approaches.
ENVIRONMENT: Hunter College is known for its highly collaborative environment to facilitate interdisciplinary
research efforts such as those proposed in this application. The candidate is mentored by Dr. Zeglis, a
recognized inorganic radiochemist with groundbreaking work in preclinical investigations of
radiopharmaceuticals. In addition, she is co-mentored by Dr. Stapleton, an environmental toxicologist who has
done pioneering and innovative contributions to the plastic research. Hunter College provides a rich set of
collaborative, technical and scientific resources to execute the research and career development proposed here."
10927222,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a renewal K12 application for the Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical Oncology to
continue a training program for clinical translational research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSK). Over the first funding period of our K12 program we have established and executed a uniquely
universal training program which extends to all MSK departments engaged in cancer research. The program
solicits applications from senior fellows moving into junior faculty positions and junior faculty within the first 3
years of their appointments at MSK as well as similarly qualified candidates from other regional training
programs recruited through aggressive advertisement and solicitation of program directors. During the initial
funding period we restricted eligibility to candidates with an MD or DO degree alone. However, based on
recommendations from our K12 external advisory committee (EAC), in this renewal application we have
expanded eligibility to further include candidates holding combined MD/PhD and DO/PhD degrees. This
program provides 3 years of junior faculty funding to selected scholars, and aims to help scholars transition
into becoming independent clinical and translational investigators. Applications for this program will be
reviewed by experts in the field both from within and outside of MSK. Reviewed applications are further
evaluated by the K12 internal advisory committee (AC) which will select the 3-4 best applicants annually.
Additional matching institutional funding has allowed and will continue to allow the program to support a
maximum of 4 new scholars annually with up to 12 scholars funded at any given time during the funding
period. Applications from scholars selected by the advisory committee will subsequently be evaluated by an
established K12 educational committee (EC) who will design a personalized curriculum for each selected
candidate. This curriculum will include a pre-established core curriculum requisite for all scholars with
additional elective courses derived from available courses offered by the Louis V. Gerstner Graduate School of
Biomedical Science. Significantly, over the first K12 funding period we have successfully established a
Master's program in Clinical and Translational Cancer Research within the graduate school. All scholars will
have the option to obtain sufficient credits through additional elective courses to be awarded this degree.
Through written questionnaires K12 scholars will be asked to review the program and provide a progress
report annually. In order to further assess the progress and function of the K12 program, scholars will provide
written evaluations of their mentors as will mentors provide written evaluations of the scholar's progression on
a biannual basis. Collectively these written evaluations will be utilized by the K12 program to assess the
scholar's progress, the mentor's fitness, and the overall performance of the program. The program and
scholar progress will be evaluated biannually by the K12 AC as well as the EAC which will include for the EAC
one onsite visit during the annual K12 research symposium."
10927228,"Abstract: All cancer cells need to maintain telomere length for immortality. While most cancer cells reactivate
telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, to elongates telomere from an RNA template, about 10-15% of cancer
cells are telomerase-negative and adopt a homologous-recombination based alternative lengthening of
telomeres (ALT) pathway. ALT cells exhibit many abnormalities in nuclear organization, including the formation
of nuclear bodies called APBs for ALT telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, clustering
of telomeres within APBs, and the formation of RNA foci on telomeres with a long non-coding RNA called
telomere repeat-containing RNA (TERRA). These unique features are used as biomarkers for ALT diagnosis
and can be attractive therapeutic targets because of reduced side effects on healthy cells that do not share
these features. However, how these features contribute to telomere maintenance and ALT cancer cell growth
remain elusive, due to the lack of conceptual model as well as experimental tools to monitor and control their
assembly and function in live cells. Based on our observation that APBs exhibit liquid behavior and long non-
coding RNAs can phase separate with RNA-binding proteins, we propose a liquid-liquid phase separation
model for the assmembly and function of these ALT specific features. We hypothesize TERRA phase
separates with its interacting proteins to nucleate APB liquid droplets. The liquid nature of APBs droplets (also
called condensates) would promote coalescence of APBs to drive telomere clustering. Meanwhile,
condensation of APB droplets can concentrate DNA repair factors, providing opportunities for telomeres to use
one another as repair templates to elongate within APBs. To test our hypothesis, we developed a state-of-the-
art optogenetic approach to control APB assembly. We demonstrate that liquid phase separation underlies
APB assembly and coalescence of APB droplets indeed drives telomere clustering. Building on our ability to
control telomere clustering and APB assembly and by collaborating with experts in super resolution
microscopy, nuclear mechanics, chromosome organization and ALT cancer, we will investigate how DNA
repair factors are recruited to and organized in APB condensates for ALT telomere DNA synthesis (Aim 1) and
how telomere clustering leads to unique genome organization and gene expression in ALT cells (Aim 2). We
will then extend our optogenetic tools to control RNA and dissect TERRA contributions in ALT (Aim 3). Results
obtained by manipulating cultured ALT cells will be confirmed by characterizing ALT tissue or creating de novo
ALT phonotypes in primary human cells. Our results will provide mechanistic understanding on how protein
and/or RNA phase separation contributes to ALT cancer, which will offer the potential to develop strategies
specifically targeting these unique phase separation processes, rather than the existing molecules that shared
by heathy cells, for ALT cancer treatment. Such therapies are also beneficial for treating telomerase-positive
cancer as these cancer cells can escape telomerase inhibition and adopt ALT for telomere maintenance."

The Vision Science Training Program (VSTP) has its home in the Stein Eye Institute (SEI), University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Medicine, and has been continuously active for more than 40 years.
During this period the VSTP has trained nearly 140 scientists, a large portion who have gone on to distinguished
careers in vision science. The Program covers the training of both predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows, and
takes place in the laboratories of 17 faculty mentors. These vision scientists possess expertise in a wide range
of disciplines and hold academic appointments in 11 departments at UCLA. Applicants for predoctoral
fellowships first enter UCLA through one of several graduate programs, and they complete the curriculum
associated with that program. After a year of rotations, the predoctoral candidates join the laboratory of a VSTP
mentor. Applicants for postdoctoral fellowships apply directly to the VSTP lab of interest. All trainees that are
members of VSTP labs and of the ophthalmology community at large are invited to participate in the curricular
offerings of this program. These offerings are collectively designed to provide experimental and conceptual
training in vision science, as many of the trainees have no prior experience in vision science. All fellows are
required to take Fundamentals of Vision Research, a quarter-long course organized and taught by VSTP
members. Additionally, fellows are integral members of the scientific environment at SEI through attendance
and participation in a number of events, including the weekly Vision Science Seminar (Distinguished Lecturer)
Series, the Vision Science Journal Club, and the Annual Vision Science Retreat held in Lake Arrowhead. A
more recent focus of the VSTP is the stronger integration of basic and clinical science. Several offerings will
help bridge the gap between these two research focuses by facilitating interactions between the scientists and
the clinicians, including the Annual UCLA Stein Eye Clinical and Research Seminar and Translational Grand
Rounds. Such experiences will help trainees to place their research into the context of visual health and disease.
The VSTP has also instituted formal training in expository writing. An NRSA F31 or F32, and K99/R00
Pathway to Independence grant writing workshop is offered to all SEI trainees in VSTP labs to provide formal
training in how to craft and submit an effective NIH research proposal. Given the interdisciplinary nature
of vision research, the overall goal of the VSTP is to bring together faculty with a wide range of expertise
(including anatomy, biochemistry, biophysics, chemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, cell
biology, and developmental biology) to provide interdisciplinary experimental and conceptual training to
predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates seeking to develop careers in vision science. Funding of the VSTP
will permit the SEI to carry on its critical mission of training the next generation of first-rate basic and clinical
vision scientists."
10925078,"The aging population accounts for nearly 50% Veterans, but only 18% of non-Veterans. This large population
of aging Veterans is susceptible to age-related skeletal muscle wasting known as sarcopenia. Importantly, there
are no FDA-approved drugs for treating sarcopenia. Consequently, identifying cost-effective interventions to
treat sarcopenia is a major public health challenge for Veterans. At the cellular level, one of the important
contributors of sarcopenia is dysfunction of the satellite cells or muscle progenitor cells (MPCs), leading to the
impaired ability to form new muscle fibers. Physiologically, muscle-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an
important inducer of myogenesis by activating the expansion of satellite cells and MPCs that precedes muscle
formation. However, owing to PGE2's rapid degradation in vivo, one strategy to increase the abundance of
PGE2 is to block the negative regulator of PGE2 known as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-degrading enzyme (15-
PGDH). Through our previous space-based drug screening studies aboard the International Space Station to
study muscle formation using engineered muscle tissue, we identified a small molecule inhibitor of 15-PGDH
(SW033291) that has profound effect in enhancing muscle formation in vitro. However, successful clinical
translation of this drug will require site-specific and sustained delivery of SW03329. Furthermore, since exercise
is recommended to combat sarcopenia, the potential synergistic benefits of drug therapy and exercise have yet
to be evaluated. Therefore, the objective is to develop a biomaterials-based strategy for site-specific and
sustained release of SW033291, and then to test the efficacy of drug delivery with rehabilitative exercise for
treating sarcopenia in aged mice. The overarching hypothesis is that biomaterials-based delivery of SW03329
with rehabilitative exercise will improve muscle function and muscle mass in a murine sarcopenia model. Specific
Aim 1 is to develop a microsphere-based sustained release system for SW033291, and to validate the efficacy
of SW033291 to promote muscle formation and contractility in vitro. We hypothesize that the biocompatible
microspheres will support sustained drug release, leading to enhanced muscle formation in MPCs. We will
employ an established poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-carboxyl (PLGA-PEG-COOH)-based
microsphere delivery system to achieve a range of sustained release concentrations. MPCs will be cultured in
expansion media for 5 days either in the presence or absence of the drug-laded microspheres. For up to 5 days
after exposure to the microspheres, MPCs will be assessed for cell cytotoxicity, and the conditioned media will
be assayed for PGE2 levels using a PGE2 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. To study the efficacy of drug
exposure on myotube formation, the cells will be immunofluorescently stained to visualize myotubes using
skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain. The degree of myotube contractility in response to 1 Hz electrical
stimulation will be quantified as a measure of in vitro function. These studies will demonstrate the in vitro
potential of microsphere-based SW03329 release on muscle formation in vitro, as well as establish a dosage
range that is not cytotoxic. Specific Aim 2 is to test the therapeutic efficacy of sustained release SW033291
treatment with rehabilitative exercise in a murine model of sarcopenia. We hypothesize that localized delivery
of sustained release SW03329 will improve muscle force generation and muscle myofiber size in aged mice,
and rehabilitative exercise will further amplify the benefits of drug therapy. Aged mice will be randomized to
receive unilateral intramuscular injections of drug-releasing microspheres or blank microspheres to the tibialis
anterior muscle. After implantation of the drug, the animals will be randomized to be receive treadmill exercise
or remain in static conditions for 4 weeks. Muscle physiology at 4 weeks after microsphere implantation will be
quantified by force generation and gait analysis. Muscle structure will be further histologically assessed for
myofiber cross-section area. The critical preliminary data generated from this study will establish the feasibility
of this approach, paving the way for further drug development and therapeutic testing towards clinical translation."
10924772,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The AIDS pandemic took a life every minute in 2021 and the UNAIDS estimated that over 1.5 million new
infections occurred, marking the smallest annual decline in new HIV-1 infections since 2016. Today almost 29
million of the world's 38 million HIV-infected people have access to life-saving combination antiretroviral drug
therapies (cART) drugs, according to UNAIDS. Despite the absence of a cure that would completely eliminate
replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses in the body, cART suppresses plasma viremia in infected individuals to
undetectable levels, however viral load rapidly rebounds upon cART interruption, requires lifelong administration,
and can have undesirable side effects. This indicates an additional therapeutic agent is needed to eliminate HIV-
infected cells and remove the viral reservoir. The major obstacle that impedes HIV-1 eradication in cART-treated
individuals is the establishment of long lived and proliferating, latently infected cells. A lack of HIV-1 transactivator
of transcription (tat) protein is important in maintaining latency in resting CD4+ T-cells and therefore the HIV-1
tat protein is not readily available during the initial reactivation of provirus. Moreover, the HIV-1 tat protein is a
potent activator of HIV-1 gene expression and is essential for integrated viral genome expression, which
represents an opportunity for the HIV-1 tat protein to be used as a molecular tool. The Gardner lab has expertise
in using gene therapy strategies for HIV prevention and cure approaches. The lab has traditionally used adeno-
associated virus vectors for delivery and expression of HIV-1 entry inhibitors and broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs). We have recently started expanding our gene therapy repertoire to include virus-like particle (VLP)
delivery of therapeutic protein cargos in HIV-1 cure strategies. VLPs are known as viral “empty shells” that
maintain the same structural properties of virions without any genome, therefore these constructs are considered
very efficient as therapeutic delivery systems. VLPs can also be modified to target specific cell types, while
having good cell penetrating properties to mediate cargo passing the cell membrane allowing for release of
proteins of interest into cells, making the VLP an ideal tool for intracellular delivery of proteins3. Therefore, VLPs
can be applied to improve HIV-1 cure strategies. In aim 1, we will use VLPs to deliver the HIV-1 tat protein as a
latency reversing agents (LRA). This aim will utilize a shock and kill strategy, first with VLPs to transport the HIV-
1 tat protein as a LRA (the “shock”) and secondly these reactivated cells will be targeted for elimination with
AAV
vectors that express
bNAbs (the “kill”). Additionally, in aim 2, we will utilize VLPs to deliver Cas12k fused to HIV-
1 integrase (VLP-Cas12k) to target integration of a transgene cassette into an integrated HIV-1 provirus within
CD4+ T-cells triggering apoptosis and immune-mediated clearance. Through these experiments, I will be able to
be able to demonstrate that VLPs can effectively be used to as a way to deliver a LRA and as a novel strategy
to eliminate HIV-1 latently infected cells."
10915751,"7. Project Summary
There is strong evidence of co-morbid pathologies (α-synuclein, amyloid β, tau) in age-related dementias that
cause synergistic contributions to neurodegeneration such that patients exhibit a more severe and rapid disease
progression. Simultaneous treatment of multiple proteinopathies commonly occurring in these patients (a largely
ignored strategy) will be required to effectively treat ADRDs such as LBDs, which account for up to 25% of all
dementias in patients older than 65 years. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for these
patients. Synapse loss is the principal cause of memory and cognitive decline in various dementias and occurs
significantly prior to neuronal loss. Our scientific premise is that effective treatments for LBD needs to mitigate
synapse loss caused by α-Syn, Aβ, and tau activation of a well-known PrPc/NOX dependent mechanism
involving actin/cofilin-rod formation that leads to disruption of cytoarchitecture followed by rapid loss of dendritic
spines and synapses. Chemokine receptors of the innate immune system are also present on neurons and in
our recent R43 we showed that two of their antagonists (both approved drugs) exert a negative allosteric effect,
likely via physical interaction in membrane rafts, to suppress PrPc/NOX activation and subsequent synapse loss.
This novel finding strongly suggests chemokine receptor antagonists as potential treatments for mixed-
proteinopathy dementias. Our R43 results show that RAP-103, a CCR2/CCR5 antagonist, prevents and reverses
both α-Syn and Aβ rodent and human synapse loss in vivo at pM doses and prevents cognitive deficits in an α-
Syn transgenic animal model. In order to broaden the treatment targets to include tau effects we will conduct a
definitive study of RAP-103 effects on LBD mixed-proteinopathy relevant biomarkers, disease markers, synaptic
damage markers and correlate those with cognitive performance and restoration of functional synapses in
Tg4510 tau/α-Syn mice. At 6 months, when animals show cognitive impairments, we will administer RAP-103
by oral dosing for 8 weeks, then determine performance in the Morris Water Maze test of spatial memory and
learning. We will collect the brains to determine the effect of RAP-103 on oligomeric tau, pThr231 tau, multimeric
total α-Syn and pSer129 αSyn, inflammation in microglia and astrocytes, cytokine and chemokine expression,
and synapto-dendritic loss in in cortex and hippocampus. Immunoreactive area, density, mean signal, mean size
and integrated optical density (IOD) of all objects with all markers will be blindly quantified by objective
measures. We will determine the effect of RAP-103 on functional synapses determined from electrophysiological
measurements in CA3 to CA1 region of hippocampus (ex vivo brain slice) from TG4510. The studies will provide
go-no go quantifiable inflection points to decide further development. We have completed initial animal safety
studies and have received a pre-IND meeting date with the FDA to get comments on our first-in-human clinical
plan in healthy normal volunteers. Successful completion of the Aims will support an IND for a proof-of-concept
phase 2 study in an ADRD indication."
10930045,"Abstract
Fabry disease, an uncommon disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A, leads to
intracellular accumulation of its substrates, mainly globotriaosylceramide (GL3), causing severe multi-organ
complications. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the current standard treatment for patients with Fabry
disease. However, some cells, including kidney podocytes (PC), cardiac myocytes (CM) and vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC), are relatively resistant to ERT, this creating residual risks in a substantial proportion of
ERT treated patients for serious complications, such as stroke, heart and renal failure. While cardiovascular
complications are the most common, and renal complications the next most common, cause of death in Fabry
disease, the pathophysiology of the lesions underlying these complications is poorly understood and requires
further studies. Such studies need access to large number of patients and biopsies and detailed clinical
information, these being common roadblocks in the study of rare diseases. The Lysosomal Disease Network
(LDN) has created a unique opportunity of networking among the investigators studying such rare diseases.
Using our extensive network of collaborators inside and outside of LDN as well as our own rich cardiac, renal,
and skin biopsy collections, we are extremely well poised to study the natural history and ERT treatment
outcomes of the key lesions of cardiovascular and renal complications of Fabry disease through novel
morphometric approaches that we have developed. These validated specific and quantitative approaches will
allow us to describe the relationships between these lesions and cardiac and renal function. We will also study
skin arteriolar VSMC including in patients with concomitant renal biopsies in order to determine if a less
invasive approach will provide vital organ information regarding these important cells in less accessible tissues.
In addition, we will study the effect of ERT on GL3 clearance from cardiac myocytes and cardiac, renal and
skin VSMC so as to determine factors influencing the effectiveness of ERT. These studies are highly likely to
provide reproducible and sensitive structural endpoints for future Fabry disease clinical trials exploring new
treatment approaches. In addition, we will assess tilt table variability of heart rate and blood pressure
response, as well as electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of ventricular depolarization/repolarization in order to
detect the presence and severity of dysautonomia in Fabry disease and, in pilot studies, to test whether these
dysautonomia and ECG parameters can predict the development of cardiac events/dysfunction in Fabry
patients. These unique cardiac and renal projects are highly likely to lead to new insights furthering our
understanding of Fabry disease and to new clinical trial strategies."
10930047,"The mucopolysaccharidoses are monogenic, heritable disorders of lysosomal malfunction that cause
progressive multi-system organ damage. Early on, it was thought that the physical manifestations of MPS
commenced in childhood, but we now know that glycosaminoglycan deposition begins in utero and that
treatment beginning early in life, even infancy, does not ameliorate the burden of disease. Importantly, while
the primary effects of disease vary by genetic subtype—for example MPS I, II, and III come with a significant
cognitive impact, while MPS IV and VI, have central nervous system involvement that does not include
cognition—all of the MPS disorders, regardless of central nervous system burden, comprise significant skeletal
and organ deficits that results in lifelong disability; and that this disability exists regardless of treatment.
Current therapies have shown some effect in ameliorating the devastating brain disease, but have had little
somatic effect—especially as it relates to skeletal (bone) and cardiac (valve) involvement. As treatment
options for the MPS conditions continue to grow, and expand to include gene therapy, a systematic, thorough
categorization of disease effect across the lifetime individuals with MPS is more relevant than ever. Adding to
the need for early, longitudinal, descriptive data is the advent of newborn screening for MPS I to the panels in
several states. Those identified via a newborn screening present a unique opportunity to collect data from
individuals with MPS I beginning at birth. This data, in conjunction with that collected by our research team
over the last 10 years, provides the richest, most complete dataset available against which to measure new
therapy. Adding to the dataset in the ways described here, will lead to specific recommendations on how to
proceed therapeutically, after a diagnosis (via newborn screening or otherwise) for any MPS condition. The
Lysosomal Disease Network structure allows us to incorporate data from Centers of Excellence geographically
dispersed across the US and Canada to collect cross-tabulated data from the widest possible patient
population that: 1. Quantifies abnormalities and rates of progression in neurodevelopment by disease subtype,
2. Characterizes social, emotional, and behavioral profiles; correlated with treatment by disease subtype, 3.
Determines abnormalities in brain morphometry and white matter microstructure to define developmental
pathways by disease subtype, 4. Quantifies the burden of physical disability across organ systems and how
those disabilities impact development and psychosocial function, 5. Assess the full impact of MPS on skeletal
and cardiac systems across treatment modalities, and 6. Identify the incidence pattern of disease expression of
infants with Hurler syndrome identified by newborn screening, and how current stem cell transplant leads to
disease-related morbidity and mortality. Every aim presented will be evaluated in context with each other to
provide detailed, multi-dimensional data designed to define systematic burden as a measure for future therapy."
10930053,"The goal of our Administrative Core (AC) is to establish the scientific administrative structure we will need to
support our work on this U19 project, and to interface with the PRECISE Centers as envisioned in RFA-NS-22-
018. In order to achieve our ambitious goals, we have established a team of experts that is spread across three
research sites. These include a group of investigators at UTD led by Dr. Price, investigators at MDACC led by
Dr. Dougherty and investigators at UW led by Dr. Curatolo. Despite the geographical and institutional spread,
our groups have already been productively working together for several years. We will grow our collaborations
by developing an administrative framework for tissue recovery, quality control and banking, resource sharing,
research reporting, financial disbursements, intellectual property, conflict resolution, and tracking milestones.
Our first aim will be to establish our administrative structure. This PRECISE HEAL mechanism requires progress
reports and achievement of milestones on a yearly basis. The continuation of funding will depend on our ability
to hit these milestones. A Project Manager, under the supervision of the Project Director (Dr. Price), will be
tasked with assembling reports and coordinating meetings of the collaborative group on a monthly basis to
monitor progress and achievement of milestones. The second aim will have the objective of advancing our
understanding of the molecular basis of pain in humans. To meet this challenge, we will establish an
administrative structure to promote transparent scientific reporting and the establishment of standard operating
procedures (SOPs) that allow for the robust replication of our methods and use of our data at sites around the
world. The third aim will be to establish administrative support for cooperation between PRECISE Centers and
institutions. The goal of this core will be to create an administrative structure that will allow us to meet our
scientific milestones, creating a state-of-the-art research center for the molecular characterization of the first
neurons and synapses of the human pain pathway."
10930055,"There are clear differences between mouse and human nociceptors that have profound implications for the
development of pain therapeutics that target the peripheral nervous system. Our spatial sequencing experiments
reveal a distinct set of cell types in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG). In this research project, we will
compare DRG tissues from organ donors and surgical patients with chronic pain. We will include a range of ages
across the adult life-span in both men and women in an ethnically diverse population. In addition to the DRG, we
will also examine the spinal cord. We have already conducted SPLiT-seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis of
dorsal and ventral horn from a select number of organ donors demonstrating the viability of both techniques. Our
data shows that like the DRG, there are clear species differences in the spinal cord highlighting the importance
of this discovery work. In our first aim we will use spatial sequencing and SPLiT-seq technologies to precisely
define the cell types of the human DRG. We will use organ donor and pain patient DRGs to define how cellular
transcriptomes change with pain, and if the changes covary with sex and age. SN ATAC-seq will identify
transcriptional states and regulatory elements in human DRG. In our second aim we will use the same
technologies to map the cell types of the human dorsal horn. We will strive to use the combined DRG and spinal
cord data to understand how DRG neuron subtypes are likely to connect to subsets of dorsal horn neurons. We
will fully characterize the human neurons that comprise the spino-thalamic tract. Finally, in our third aim we will
use ribosome profiling on human DRG and spinal cord to gain new insight into translational events in these
tissues. Long-read sequencing will be used to map RNA modifications and splicing in a set of mRNAs that are
critical for pain. Our work will create a comprehensive atlas of the transcriptome, epi-transcriptome, and
translatome of neurons that comprise the first synapses in the pain pathway, including in chronic pain conditions."
10930061,"Work with human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cords has been transformed by collaborative
efforts with organ transplant recovery agencies. Over the past years, we have developed an expansive
collaboration with organ transplant agencies enabling recovery of more than 60 sets of DRGs and spinal cords
from organ donors. This collaboration has led to several co-authored publications and the development of new
methods to recover additional nervous system tissues from surgical patients at hospitals involved in this project.
A key question in the pain field is whether human nociceptors change their molecular makeup when a patient
develops persistent or chronic pain. We will use the unique resources of this core to directly answer this question,
and generate datasets to answer new questions for the pain therapeutic discovery field. Our first aim will build
on our existing work with organ donors to create administrative and scientific protocols for tissue recovery. A key
milestone will be the recovery of DRG, spinal cord and peripheral nerves from 50 organ donors per year. In our
second aim we will expand our unique access to DRGs from pain patients that are recovered during relatively
rare surgeries. To facilitate more of this type of research throughout the country, and enhance access to these
valuable tissues, we will create IRB templates, hospital compliant standard operating procedures (SOPs) and
other key administrative and scientific methods to enable the proliferation of this type of research. Finally, in our
third aim we will leverage our deep experience with RNAscope technology to compare expression of a group of
markers that vary in cellular expression (low, mid, and high expression) to understand exactly how tissue
transcriptomes might change depending on donor timeline and other factors. This will allow the field to
understand how to make comparisons across study types. This core will create an expansive resource of tissue,
technical methods and administrative proficiency that will enable important discoveries for the field, and the
expansion of the use of human nervous system tissues for basic pain research far beyond the walls of the
collaborating laboratories in this Center."
10930064,"This proposal aims to realize the vision of a “molecular encyclopedia” of pain-associated genes and cell types in
the human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG), peripheral nerve, and spinal cord. The mission is to build data
infrastructure and provide computational research support that will be needed for us to achieve our Center’s
research goals and to effectively make our data accessible to all our cores, other PRECISE Centers and the
broader community. This will facilitate discovery for diverse types of researchers. The first aim will be for the
Core to provide standardized workflows for the creation and management of the raw data (including sequencing,
tissue imaging, and functional datasets), along with associated metadata, and processed data. We will work
closely with the Tissue Procurement and Processing Core to maintain records and de-identified metadata around
the tissues collected and the data that will be generated. The second aim will be to create standardized workflows
and pipelines to process bulk, single-cell/nucleus, and spatial RNA-seq (and associated ribosome footprinting
and ATAC-seq) that will perform quality control (following ENCODE and GTEx standards), identify different cell
types, their gene markers, and differentially expressed genes for clinical phenotype and demographics-based
cohorts (from human DRGs, peripheral nerves, and spinal cords). Finally, the Core will develop algorithms
(provided as software tools and scripts) to retrieve specific information and test specific hypotheses from different
datasets in conjunction with each research project and to meet the scientific milestones of this grant. We will
also develop tools to analyze data from multiple assays in our Research Projects, as well as from other PRECISE
Centers in an integrative fashion. The work conducted in this Core will allow us to meet the proposed goals of
this Center and fully characterize peripheral and spinal pain pathways across different tissues, chronic pain
conditions, age, and sex. Our impact will also go beyond our Center as we plan to make our data and pipelines
accessible to other researchers, facilitating collaborations, and integration of other datasets."
10930051,"Lysosomal diseases are under-recognized conditions, often leading to significant diagnostic delays that place
undue burden on families. Improvements in biochemical and genetic technologies continue to further the
technology available in the field and have contributed to the advancement of techniques such as newborn
screening and DNA analysis. However, even as the technical tools and diagnostic implements have improved,
the investment in, and improved knowledge of, those individuals who diagnose childhood disease has tended
to lag behind. The result is that while interest in—and ability to treat—lysosomal conditions has improved
dramatically over the past two decades, the path to diagnosis has not become significantly altered. Further,
the fostering of those with an inherent interest in lysosomal conditions—and rare diseases in general—can get
lost in the practicalities of medical training.
In order to support the educational goals of those with an interest in lysosomal disease, the Lysosomal
Disease Network’s Career Enhancement Core will create interest in and expand knowledge related to careers
in rare disease research through the training and development of new investigators with an interest in
lysosomal diseases. The LDN will provide fellowships for qualified (postdoctoral level) individuals annually by
means of a competitive application process. LDN Fellows will be provided a stipend that allows them to pursue
a clinical research project in the field. Fellows will be expected to present the results of their research project
at a relevant scientific meeting and publish in a peer reviewed journal."
10922474,"Project Summary
Data-driven drug discovery (D4) is the combined utilization of the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm
with high-throughput omics technologies and machine learning. D4 has the advantage of being unbiased, similar
to phenotypic-based drug discovery. In addition, D4 allows for gaining mechanistic insights as omics
technologies allow for comprehensive measurement of 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features,
which enables deep characterization of diseases and compound/genetic perturbations. The predominant data
type for D4 has historically been transcriptomics and, more recently, image-based assays have been utilized.
Other biomolecular features (i.e., proteins and metabolites) are considered closer to the phenotype, but technical
challenges in data generation and analysis, as well as the lack of standardized pipelines have precluded the
systematic use of these data types. Sinopia Bioscience and Omix Technologies have combined their strengths
in systems biology data analysis, AI/ML, and LC-MS/MS based metabolomics to develop a unique metabolomics-
based drug discovery platform that has allowed for systematic metabolic characterization of a chemical library
consisting of ~3,300 small molecules, covering more than 1,000 drug targets. Our preliminary results
demonstrate that metabolomics is more sensitive, reproducible, and predictive of properties of small molecules,
such as the molecular target, adverse drug reactions, and chemical structure, than transcriptomics. However, for
a D4 platform to be successfully applied, standardized methods are required to generate robust and information-
rich profiles of metabolism that can be compared between experiments. Whereas for gene expression such
methods have been developed and benchmarked, multiple key challenges remain for metabolomics data. In this
grant, we will address these challenges. We will develop computational methods for generating and comparing
profiles and test them using computational benchmarking test cases and prospective experimental validation. In
Phase II, we will expand the platform by increasing the number of compounds and diseases profiled, integrate
metabolomics-based D4 with gene expression data, develop software for off-the-shelf application, and apply the
platform in the fields of oncology and/or inflammation. The platform will ultimately be commercialized through
pursuing internal drug development opportunities and/or in partnership with biotech/pharma collaborators."
10923735,"ABSTRACT
Older Hispanic/Latino adults living with dementia face inadequate access to formal care and tend to rely
heavily or solely on family members for dementia care and assistance. Access to evidence-based resources
and support for family caregivers is critical to improving care and outcomes for a loved one living with
dementia. However, these resources and support are lacking for Hispanic/Latino caregivers. To address these
barriers to health equity in dementia care for the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population, Ceresti will develop an
approach for deploying its proven Caregiver-Enabled Care Program (CECP) to Spanish-speaking caregivers of
patients with dementia. CECP is a non-medical digital population health intervention that leverages data,
predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence to engage and support unpaid/informal caregivers. This is
accomplished via personalized education, proactive coaching, and remote monitoring, all delivered via a
dedicated tablet shipped to the caregiver's home at no cost to the caregiver or person with dementia. In a
previous clinical study of a 6-month version of CECP in a cohort of 164 English-speaking caregivers of persons
with dementia, caregivers sustained longitudinal engagement in their CECP (96.7% month-to-month continue
rate) and engaged in education, coaching and assessment for more than 40 min/week. After engaging at this
level, caregivers improved their mental health, reduced their loneliness, and were highly satisfied with their
CECP. For the proposed study, our central hypothesis is that Spanish-speaking caregivers will engaged at
levels that are comparable to those of English-speaking caregivers of dementia patients who have enrolled in
our English-language CECP. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll 135 Spanish-speaking caregivers of
dementia patients participating in a Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) into a 6-month study
of our Spanish-language CECP. At the end of this study, we expect to show that caregivers who enrolled in our
Spanish CECP sustained comparable longitudinal and weekly engagement as English-speaking caregivers.
These outcomes are important because sustained longitudinal and high-intensity engagement is a core pillar to
effective population health; in this case, more engagement increases caregiver knowledge, skills, and
confidence in caring for a loved one with dementia. Successful implementation of our Spanish-language CECP
will be an important contribution towards achieving health equity for Spanish-speaking families living with
dementia. Our findings will show that the highly scalable approach of using AI-plus-human validation to
develop a Spanish-language CECP can deliver equivalent engagement to our proven English-language CECP.
This crucial demonstration of the feasibility of our approach will position us favorably for future studies aimed to
show the efficacy, scalability, and commercialization potential of our Spanish language CECP and our potential
to implement our approach in other languages.

10925739,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE FUNDED PARENT AWARD
Acetaminophen (APAP)is one of the most commonly used analgesics in the world, and overwhelmingly
perceived to be safe. This perception has contributed to ubiquitous exposures during gestation and among
newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. These exposures occur during critical windows of human
development where pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrating safety are lacking. Alarmingly, clinical data
support the hypothesis that the developing lung may be adversely affected by perinatal APAP exposures. The
toxicity of APAP is dependent on its conversion by the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme CYP2E1 the
mitochondrial toxin N-acetyl-para-benzo-quinone imine (NAPQI). Our preliminary data demonstrate that
pulmonary CYP2E1 expression peaks during the saccular stage of development and is limited to the
myofibroblast. Additionally, we show that postnatal APAP exposures induce Cyp2e1 expression in the late
saccular/early alveolar stage lung. Consistent with CYP2E1 expression, we show that the developing lung is
susceptible to APAP-induced injury. These preliminary data have led us to develop the following hypothesis: The
saccular/early alveolar stage lung is susceptible to APAP-induced injury due to developmentally-
regulated pulmonary CYP2E1 expression. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that in utero APAP exposures during the saccular stage of lung development injure
pulmonary myofibroblasts and disrupt alveolarization. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that postnatal APAP
exposures during the late saccular/early alveolar stage induce lung CYP2E1 expression causing oxidative stress
and increase sensitivity to injury. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that inhibiting TLR9/NFκB innate immune
signaling will attenuate APAP-induced newborn lung injury. Our collaborative team bridging developmental
pulmonary biology, physiology, immunology and mitochondrial/oxidative stress biology is well positioned to fill
critical gaps in our understanding of the developmentally-regulated, cell-type specific CYP2E1 expression and
APAP-induced lung injury. These studies will help determine the safety profile of APAP to inform both maternal
use and newborn exposures while identifying therapeutic targets to limit adverse effects.

10925780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal outlines plans to collect and share biospecimens with the Biospecimen Exchange for
Neurological Disorders (BioSEND) repository, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
(NINDS) biomarker repository. This administrative supplement would build on the aims of a recently awarded
R01 which will evaluate potential microbiome-gut-brain mechanisms in prodromal and symptomatic Lewy body
diseases. The R01 will be recruiting a unique study cohort, which includes participants with idiopathic rapid eye
movement (REM) Sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). REM Sleep Behavior Disorder is one of the earliest and most
specific indicators of Lewy body diseases, providing a prodromal cohort to evaluate early disease mechanisms.
Additionally, we will be enrolling two symptomatic cohorts, a Parkinson’s disease cohort (PD) and Dementia with
Lewy body disease (DLB) cohort. These cohorts provide an opportunity to conduct a novel evaluation of the
presence of a bloom in sulfate reducing bacteria/dysbiosis and intestinal permeability. We will determine if these
are present early in the disease and are associated with known disease processes (increases in α-synuclein,
midbrain degeneration and clinical outcomes). The R01 project will evaluate these key mechanisms through the
collection of urine, blood, and stool biospecimen samples in addition to advanced MRI and a breath test. This
administrative supplement would support sharing of these biospecimens with BioSEND, which banks
biospecimens for more than 50 different studies. The repository is developed to support high quality data
collection and banking, providing specimens available to researchers around the world. The administrative
supplement will support the implementation of study specific manual of procedures already developed by
BioSEND to facilitate sharing of biospecimens. BioSEND’s goal is to make it easy for researchers to identify the
samples they need for their research through online biospecimen catalogs that can be queried by approved
researchers. The administrative supplement would support sharing of this unique cohort with investigators
around the world. This will increase the R01 project’s likelihood to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the
study of Lewy body diseases."
10922556,"Abstract – MainSquare Co. (dba “Teleo”) is developing a HIPAA-compliant virtual therapy room for children that
transforms how clinicians deliver psychotherapy to children remotely, improving client engagement over standard
video conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom). One in 5 children have a mental health disorder. Remote teletherapy
can help by enabling more accessible, convenient, and lower-cost care for children. Given these advantages,
mental healthcare providers are permanently adopting telehealth. As of September 2022, 88% of mental health
treatment providers offered Telehealth, versus 39% in April 2019. Unfortunately, clinicians working with children
remotely experience low in-session engagement. Today, 50-70% of children end treatment early due to low
engagement and the median number of sessions attended is one. Low engagement is tied to worse clinical
outcomes in children and reduced revenue for health systems due to no-shows, treatment drop-out, and therapist
distress / provider turnover. In-session engagement – active involvement in an intervention – is associated with
improved outcomes for depression, anxiety, and substance disorders
Teleo improves client engagement by 1) integrating evidence-based therapy tools, worksheets, activities, and
games – from Teleo or providers – into a single virtual space with video conferencing, eliminating platform
switching and streamlining use of evidence-based practices (EBPs); 2) making interventions more interactive
through new two-way mirroring technology, eliminating screen and link sharing, and making previously one-sided
activities highly collaborative; and 3) making virtual environments personalizable to each client. Teleo is in pilot-
use by dozens of early-adopting clinicians. Of these, 83% say Teleo improves engagement with clients; 42%
say Teleo improves clinical outcomes; 88% would be disappointed without Teleo. Teleo is in pilot with the largest
community mental health provider to youth Medicaid populations in CA and cleared IT / compliance a large
community health system (6,000+ child psych patients / month). Teleo has commercial interest from 40 other
organizations. This STTR funds otherwise impossible empirical validation called upon by early partners.
In Phase I, Teleo will conduct user experience focus groups and interviews to solicit qualitative feedback from
both clinicians and patients. Based on feedback, the product will be iterated upon and then utilized in a pilot
randomized control trial (RCT) with 42 subjects over 4 sessions to evaluate the potential for Teleo to improve
pediatric patient engagement in teletherapy relative to standard video conferencing. In Phase II, Teleo will
perform R&D to improve clinician acceptability, clinical workflows, and client engagement. Again, the product will
be evaluated in an RCT but this time vastly expanded to include 156 subjects over 12 sessions with broad patient
diversity. Engagement and clinical outcomes, as well as practice performance and value-based outcomes, will
measured in Teleo and compared to standard-of-care. The resulting empirical evidence will substantiate whether
Teleo enhances pediatric behavioral health, promoting trust, credibility, and adoption in the commercial market."
10918769,"ABSTRACT
Aggregation of -synuclein throughout the neuron, including at synapses, is a pathological hallmark of
Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and variants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Synaptic aggregation of -synuclein is strongly associated with cognitive deficits and dementia in PD
and DLB. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
give rise to -synuclein-induced synaptic deficits and to develop strategies for reversing them. While it
is generally agreed that -synuclein accumulation at synapses impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the
underlying mechanisms remain unclear, preventing the development of treatments for improving
synaptic function in PD and DLB. Over the last decade, we developed and implemented lamprey
reticulospinal synapses as a new model for studying how -synuclein accumulation impacts synapse
structure and function. Our lab was the first to discover that acutely introducing excess -synuclein to
synapses, mimicking increased expression in PD and DLB, inhibits synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This
result was subsequently corroborated at mammalian synapses. We then discovered that different
molecular species of -synuclein (e.g. monomers vs. dimers) cause distinct impacts on endocytosis,
emphasizing the need to understand how each species affects synaptic vesicle trafficking and the
underlying mechanisms. Experiments proposed in the parent award will significantly advance the field
by: determining how post-translational modifications of -synuclein alter its effects at synapses (Aim 1);
identifying how -synuclein oligomers purified from human PD and DLB brains affect synapses (Aim
2); and examining the underlying mechanisms with selective inhibitors of -synuclein membrane
binding and oligomerization (Aim 3). Experiments proposed in this post-baccalaureate diversity
supplement application expand the Aims of the parent award to include the impacts of these -
synuclein variants on synaptic mitochondria. The project is significant because it will substantially
increase our understanding of the impacts of excess -synuclein on synapses and local mitochondria,
including pathology-associated strains."

The AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) was established in 1995 and has been at the forefront
of the clinical evaluation of interventions for the treatment and prevention of malignancies in
people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH). AMC also studies the biology of
cancers and precancerous lesions in PLWH in the context of its clinical trials, providing new
insights on further improving the treatment and prevention of cancer. The AMC has conducted
over 100 clinical trials, surveys and laboratory studies involving over 8700 patients with HIV-
associated cancers and precancerous lesions since its inception, including application of
precision therapeutics and immunotherapy, impacting the standard of care for PLWH and
cancer. AMC has established a network of 42 core clinical trial sites in the United States, Africa,
and Latin America uniquely qualified carry out its mission, created a network of translational
scientists and their research laboratories that support AMC clinical trials, and developed a
career enhancement program that has fostered a new generation of physicians and scientists
with unique expertise in HIV-associated cancers. Expansion of AMC to clinical trials sites in sub-
Saharan Africa and Latin America is designed to address regions of the world where the
epidemic of HIV and cancer has grown substantially, thereby amplifying the potential clinical
impact of its work to a global scale. AMC has also actively engaged PLWH and cancer survivors
in its scientific planning and community outreach in order to identify the needs of the community,
and disseminate information about AMC and its completed and ongoing research. The
participation of many of the key clinicians and clinical researchers, laboratory scientists, and
community representatives has made AMC the principal clinical trials group in the world
dedicated to improving the treatment and prevention of cancers in this population. We propose
to continue and expand our domestic and international clinical trials work in these areas,
including the ANCHOR trial; ANCHOR is a large randomized study investigating the role of
routine screening for and treatment of high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial lesions, with the
goal of preventing development of invasive anal cancer and the morbidity and mortality
associated with its diagnosis and treatment, thereby establishing new diagnostic and
therapeutic paradigm."
10953962,"Velcrin compounds kill cancer cells expressing elevated levels of PDE3A and SLFN12 by inducing complex
formation between these two proteins. Velcrin-induced PDE3A-SLFN12 complexes are heterodimers comprised
of two PDE3A proteins and two SLFN12 proteins. We hypothesize that the sole function of complex formation
in velcrin response is to dimerize SLFN12, and that SLFN12 dimers are the active form of the SLFN12 RNase,
resulting in cytotoxicity mediated by degradation of the SLFN12 substrate, tRNA-Leu-TAA. We will test this
hypothesis with the experiments outlined in this proposal. First, we will determine whether expression of high
concentrations of SLFN12 can induce tRNA-Leu-TAA degradation and cytotoxicity in the absence of PDE3A.
Second, we will take a loss-of-function approach and determine whether a point mutation at the SLFN12
homodimer interface, I131Q, can inhibit SLFN12-mediated cytotoxicity with or without velcrin treatment. Third,
we will take a gain-of-function approach and assess whether FKBP-mediated chemically-induced
homodimerization of SLFN12 results in tRNA-Leu-TAA degradation and cytotoxicity in the absence of PDE3A or
velcrin treatment. The ultimate goal of this research is to determine whether SLFN12 dimerization can be
leveraged to create an entirely new cancer therapeutic modality. If we find that dimerization of SLFN12 is
necessary and sufficient for RNase activation, we envision developing a new type of small molecule that will

10916787,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is caused by a mechanical insult to the head and often results in prolonged or
permanent brain dysfunction. TBI represents a major health and socioeconomic problem; in the U.S. over 2.8
million are affected annually. Even so-called “mild” TBI – otherwise known as concussion – may induce
neurophysiological deficits affecting learning, memory, and concentration that do not resolve in up to 15-20% of
patients. There are currently no approved treatments to improve recovery from TBI. Through previous extensive
neuropathological examinations, we have shown that mild TBI is associated with subtle changes in synaptic loss
or gain and neuronal hypertrophy occurring concomitantly with migration and activation of microglia – the
resident immune cell of the central nervous system. We have also detailed persistent changes to microglia
morphology in distinct white matter and gray matter regions after a single mild TBI. The objective of this proposal
is to establish the function of microglia and the overall neuroinflammatory response in secondary
pathophysiology for a range of TBI severities, with a particular focus on the role of hyper-ramified microglia on
responses to repeat TBI. To accomplish these objectives, we will utilize our porcine model of closed-head
rotational-acceleration-induced TBI, which closely replicates human head injury biomechanics that cannot be
reproduced in small animals. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effect of mild or moderate injury severity on TBI
pathology through transcriptomic profiling and immunohistochemical protein expression. In particular, RNA
sequencing will be performed to examine neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory pathways followed by
immunohistochemistry to provide regional context to neuronal loss and immune cell activation, amongst other
pathologies. In Aim 2, animals will perform a battery of neurobehavioral tasks to assess spatial memory and
working memory. We will then create a statistical model to correlate the extent of behavioral and cognitive deficits
with transcriptomic and neuropathological changes post-TBI. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the effect of repeat
TBI on neuroinflammatory states. We will subject pigs to a second TBI at either a timepoint shown to present
maximal elevations in hyper-ramified microglia or a timepoint where the density of this microglial phenotype has
returned to baseline. Changes in gene expression, neuropathology, and behavior will be assessed. Our
hypothesis is that repeat TBI during a period with elevated levels of hyper-ramified microglia will result in
excessive synaptic pruning/loss, exacerbated neuronal hypertrophy, and elevated deficits in hippocampal-
dependent cognitive tasks. Across these aims, we will use established methodologies to generate
comprehensive genomic, pathological, and cognitive profiling of clinically relevant TBI and create open access
datasets that other TBI researchers can interrogate against rodent and human model systems. Overall, the
current proposal is a critical step in identifying inflammation-related degenerative pathology that may underlie
the cognitive, behavioral, and motor dysfunction that millions of Americans experience as a result of TBI."
10921289,"Abstract
 High tone pelvic floor dysfunction (HTPFD) is a major contributor to chronic pelvic pain, affecting up to 15%
of women in the United States. Intravaginal Electrical Stimulation (IES) and focal muscle vibration (FMV) can
play pivotal roles in managing muscle pain through distinct mechanisms. IES involves applying low-level
electrical currents to stimulate nerves, which can reduce pain perception by disrupting pain signals' transmission
to the brain and promotes the release of endorphins, providing short-term relief for muscle discomfort. FMV
employs mechanical oscillations to target muscle fibers, enhancing blood flow and relaxing muscle tension. This
process can alleviate muscle soreness and aid in recovery after exercise, making it effective in both pain
management and performance enhancement. By combining the benefits of IES and vibration in a wearable,
intravaginal device for women with HTPFD, individuals with muscle pain can discreetly access a multifaceted
approach that addresses pain perception, circulation, and muscle relaxation for pain relief. Bold Type proposes
development of an intravaginal, wearable device called “Violet” to provide pelvic floor muscle vibration
and electrical nerve stimulation therapy for patients with HTPFD on an “as needed” basis throughout
the day.
 Bold Type specializes in developing connected, wireless medical devices. Our team has decades of product
development experience with expertise in medical devices, quality, and regulatory affairs. We have developed
proprietary hardware and software development kits that allow us to design and implement medical devices
efficiently by leveraging reusable subsystems that are designed and documented to comply with FDA
regulations. Building off these resources we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Develop the Violet Device
to: (1) provide on-demand intravaginal electrical stimulation (IES) and vibration therapy to provide pain relief,
and (2) measure and track intravaginal temperature, motion, and position; 2) Develop the Violet software (mobile
app and embedded software) to track symptoms, wirelessly control the device, and extract data; and 3) Perform
formative usability and preliminary validation testing on a group of 15 healthy women.
 Completion of these three aims will preliminarily confirm the following: (1) that patients can insert, retain, and
remove the Violet device without unacceptable discomfort; (2) that patients can feel the IES and vibration
stimulation and adjust their settings; and (3) that the system can accurately measure temperature, motion, and
body position and transfer data to a mobile device. Successful completion of these aims will prepare the way for
a Phase 2 project where a commercial grade system will be developed under FDA design controls and validated
in a longitudinal study to evaluate efficacy and achieve FDA clearance."
