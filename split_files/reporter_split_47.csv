Reward neurocircuitry relies in part on endogenous neuropeptide signaling to integrate complex, multivalent
information and influence behavior. Opioid addiction can result in neuropeptide imbalances in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a brain region critical for processing reward. Signaling by neuropeptides derived from VGF
(non-acronymic) may be dysregulated by exogenous opioid exposure with repeated withdrawal. The
neuropeptide precursor VGF and its derived peptide TLQP-62 serve important functions in experience-
dependent plasticity in the nervous system, and VGF transcripts are upregulated in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc) after drug exposure and withdrawal. My preliminary data demonstrate that knocking out VGF in the NAc
eliminates the behavioral changes typically evoked by opioid exposure and withdrawal in mice. Because these
behavioral adaptations are proxies for neuroplasticity in reward circuitry, we hypothesize that VGF is necessary
for synaptic plasticity in the NAc. The objective of this work is to interrogate the function of VGF and its derived
peptide TLQP-62 in facilitating synaptic plasticity in the NAc, and to understand its contribution to withdrawal-
evoked behaviors. First, I will measure the effect of exogenous TLQP-62 on synaptic transmission in the NAc
using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices. Past work in other regions of the
central nervous system have shown that TLQP-62 potentiates excitatory transmission. We therefore hypothesize
that TLQP-62 will augment excitatory glutamatergic transmission into the NAc. I will then use RNA in situ
hybridization to map endogenous VGF transcripts in the NAc and identify in which neuronal subpopulations it is
expressed. Finally, I will evaluate the effect of endogenous VGF on withdrawal-evoked behavior adaptations. I
will combine transgenic mice and viral vectors to conditionally knock out VGF expression from the NAc and use
a model of spontaneous oxycodone withdrawal before performing a battery of behavioral assays to determine
the locomotor, social, and sensory impact of VGF in the NAc. With these methods, spanning physiology,
neuroanatomical mapping, and behavior, we will build an understanding of the function of VGF and TLQP-62 in
the NAc and the role they play in opioid exposure and withdrawal. Beyond identifying a novel target for treating
opioid use and withdrawal, the interdisciplinary techniques used in this proposal will examine the basic science
mechanisms of clinically urgent questions, laying the groundwork for a career planted at the intersection of
clinical need and basic research."
10826054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Death rates have decreased across many cancer types owing to improved early detection and treatment
methods, but remained largely stagnant for ovarian cancer over the last four decades. High grade serous
ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is the most common and deadly subtype, accounting for almost 70% of all
ovarian cancer cases and 70-80% of deaths. HGSOC likely develops from secretory cells of the fallopian tube
epithelium (FTE) and neoplastic transformation typically produces highly metastatic tumor cells that are p53
mutant and homologous recombination defective. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a fundamentally
important process for removing damaged and malignant cells and evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer.
The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is controlled by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which are often dysregulated in
cancer cells to confer a survival advantage. We have recently detected an upregulation of the BCL2L1 gene,
which encodes pro-survival protein BCL-XL, in HGSOC compared to normal fallopian tube epithelium. This
upregulation produces a dependency on this pro-survival protein that may be targeted therapeutically. For my
F31 research proposal, I hypothesize that HGSOC cells have increased pro-survival protein expression,
particularly BCL-XL, to buffer against the increased pro-apoptotic signaling that is associated with neoplastic
transformation, which can be therapeutically targeted to increase tumor cell death. I propose to test this in
three aims: 1) ascertain apoptotic regulation and pro-survival protein dependence in pre-malignant and
malignant stages of transformation; 2) use HGSOC patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models to assess
the efficacy of combining pro-survival protein targeting drugs with first-line chemotherapeutics to enhance
tumor cell death; and 3) elucidate how hormone and follicular fluid exposure affects apoptotic regulation in
fallopian tube epithelial cells in an air-liquid interface culture. The training plan for this proposal is designed to
give me the mentorship, experience and skillset needed to obtain a postdoctoral position and ultimately
transition into an independent research career working in the field of gynecological cancer biology. Being
mentored by my sponsors, Drs. Kristopher Sarosiek and David Christiani, and working with close collaborators
that specialize in ovarian cancer research will allow me to learn the necessary laboratory techniques and gain
subject matter expertise in apoptosis, ovarian carcinogenesis, cancer therapeutics and environmental health
as it relates to cancer risk. The Science Advisory and Career Mentoring committees that I have established will
provide further guidance in my growth as a successful, independent scientist. I will publish manuscripts and
attend conferences to present my findings and hone my written and verbal scientific communication.
Ultimately, this F31 will provide me with the training and expertise necessary for a career in cancer research
and potentially an opportunity to positively impact the lives of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer."
10826065,"SUMMARY: In fish and amphibians the retina is able to fully regenerate from a variety of insults but this ability
is progressively lost in higher vertebrates, with modest regeneration in birds, and essentially no regeneration in
mammals. MÃ¼ller glia (MG) are responsible for retinal regeneration and due to the remarkable regenerative
capacity of zebrafish, many studies have used this model to uncover the molecular underpinnings of retinal
regeneration. In zebrafish, retinal damage first stimulates MG to adopt a gliotic state, but this is transient and
they subsequently reprogram into a stem cell-like state, re-enter the cell cycle and generate multipotent
neurogenic progenitors that then give rise to new neurons. In mammals, including humans, the initial MG gliotic
response to damage is similar to that in zebrafish, but MG fail to reprogram or generate new neurons. Instead,
gliotic responses persist and MG proliferate and eventually form a glial scar. Recent studies have demonstrated
that ectopic expression of a key pro-regenerative gene identified in zebrafish, ascl1, in MG of the adult mouse
retina, along with inhibition of histone deactylase (Hdac) activity, stimulates a MG regenerative response.
Regeneration correlated with increased chromatin accessibility at critical pro-regenerative loci and when
combined with other published studies, suggest that the epigenetic landscape regulating the expression of pro-
regenerative genes during the injury and regenerative responses is a key regulator of the ability of MG to
reprogram and stimulate regeneration. Our knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of retinal regeneration is
limited and this is a critical knowledge gap in the field. Indeed, given that regenerative responses can be
stimulated from normally non-regenerative MG in the mammalian eye, understanding the epigenetic regulation
of retinal regeneration could be transformational in supporting the development of new therapeutics aimed at
restoring neurons lost to retinal degenerative diseases and retinal injuries. We have focused on the epigenetic
regulation of retinal regeneration, using the zebrafish MG reprogramming and regeneration model. We have
generated strong preliminary data supporting a critical role for Brd proteins during MG-dependent retinal
regeneration and more specifically, a role for Brd4 during MG reprogramming. We have identified genes
regulated by Brd activity and developed and validated novel transgenic tools for manipulating Brd activity and
Brd-dependent gene function in MG with spatial and temporal precision. We hypothesize that Brd-mediated
regulation of gene expression in MG is a key regulator of MG reprogramming and MG-dependent retinal
regeneration. Experiments in this proposal test this hypothesis by determining the roles of specific brd proteins
during MG-dependent retinal regeneration and identifying the gene regulatory networks in which they function.
When completed, the results of this study will be of high impact in identifying and validating Brd-dependent genes
that could be useful on their own in stimulating reprogramming or regenerative responses from mammalian MG
or, in combination with other factors, enhance reprogramming and regenerative responses from mammalian MG."

Since the early 1980s, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) have maintained the highest rates of
commercial cigarette smoking of any racial/ethnic group in the US. Currently, 27% of AIANs smoke cigarettes.
Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, they have 6 times higher rates of developing smoking-related cancers.
AIANs are only half as likely to quit smoking compared to other races/ethnicities. The result is that commercial
cigarette smoking accounts for half of all deaths among AIANs nationwide. A major cause of these
longstanding inequities is the lack of access to efficacious smoking cessation interventions among AIANs.
Compounding the barrier of lack of access to smoking cessation interventions is the barrier of lack of research
on the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions for AIANs. Despite having the highest smoking prevalence
of any racial/ethnic group in the US for over 40 years, a mere 0.3% of all full-scale smoking cessation
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on AIANs. Regarding accessibility, a smartphone application
(âappâ) has the potential to deliver a low-cost smoking cessation intervention with wide geographic reach to
AIANs and in regions of the US with smoking rates as high as 57% in this group (i.e., Northern Plains).
Regarding efficacy, our preliminary data provides promising evidence for our Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT)-based smartphone app, called iCanQuit, to help AIANs quit smoking. We compared the
iCanQuit app with the NCIâs QuitGuide app among the AIAN subsample (N = 165 recruited from 32 US states)
enrolled in our full-scale RCT. This secondary analysis of AIANs showed descriptively higher rates of smoking
cessation at the 12-month follow-up (30% for iCanQuit vs. 18% for QuitGuide; OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 0.90, 4.26,
p = .089). While encouraging, analyses were exploratory, non-significant, and not a substitute for a full-scale
efficacy test. To address weaknesses of prior research, a fully-powered comparative efficacy RCT of iCanQuit
vs. QuitGuide focusing nationwide on AIANs who smoke is now needed. Thus, the goal of this project is to
conduct a nationally recruited and fully-powered two-arm RCT comparing iCanQuit (n = 388) to QuitGuide (n =
388), in order to determine: (1) the efficacy of iCanQuit relative to the QuitGuide app for biochemically verified
30-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 12 months post-randomization and (2) whether iCanQuitâs (but
not QuitGuideâs) 12-month smoking cessation outcomes are significantly mediated by improvements in core
ACT-based processes. This study will be the first full-scale RCT of a digital intervention for helping AIANs
nationwide stop smoking. Qualitative interviews with (1) a subsample of iCanQuit participants to thematize
testimonials of their experience with iCanQuit and (2) AIAN members from our study Community Advisory
Board (CAB) will guide our plan for broadly disseminating iCanQuit to AIAN adults nationwide. Positive results
would improve health equity by providing a highly accessible and efficacious intervention with potential for
sustainability and broad dissemination for AIANs nationwide."
10826069,"Project Summary/Abstract
Loss of mitochondrial homeostasis significantly decreases cellular health and causes many age-based and
metabolic diseases. Cells are equipped with a number of pathways that remodel mitochondrial during stress.
Mitochondrial-Derived Compartment (MDC) formation is a recently discovered mitochondrial remodeling
mechanism that is activated in response to many metabolic stresses in both yeast and mammals. MDC structures
are large (1Âµm diameter) multi-bilayer structures that are generated from the mitochondrial outer membrane and
selectively sort mitochondrial proteins for degradation. Following their formation, MDCs are broken down by
mitochondrial fission and targeted to the vacuole through bulk autophagy pathways. MDCs form in response to
amino acid-associated stresses such as cellular aging, translation inhibition, vacuolar/lysosomal deacidification,
and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) inhibition. However, it remains unclear what the function of MDCs is within cells
and how these structures promote mitochondrial adaptation.
 In addition to amino acid stress, I recently found that acute glucose starvation is a novel and potent
inducer for MDC formation in S. cerevisiae. This proposal will characterize the mechanism of glucose starvation-
induced MDC formation and determine how their formation facilitates mitochondrial adaptation during a transition
from fermentative to respiratory metabolism. Preliminary studies have shown that glucose starvation-induced
MDCs are not dependent on amino acid availability, and these MDC structures are also delivered to the vacuole
through autophagy. Also, a change from fermentative to a non-fermentable carbon source triggers MDC
formation. The scope of metabolic perturbations that activate the MDC pathway appears far more generalized
to many components of central metabolism. I hypothesize that glucose starvation induces MDC formation
by altering the TCA cycle or mitochondrial energy constituents (ATP, NADH) paired with the activation
of nutrient signaling pathways. Additionally, given the conditions in which MDCs form, I hypothesize
that this pathway is critical for the transition of mitochondria from a fermentation state to an elevated
oxidative phosphorylation metabolism. These hypotheses will be tested in two aims, which will 1) determine
the mechanism by which acute glucose depletion or carbon source switching activates MDC formation, and 2)
test the requirement of MDC formation in maintaining viability and promoting metabolic adaptation during carbon
source transitions. This innovative study will expand the mechanistic understanding of the MDC pathway as a
remodeling mechanism that is significant to many metabolic transitions. In addition, the completion of these
studies and career development activities outlined in the application will provide me with the necessary training
to complete my graduate studies and transition to the next stage of my research career."
10827035,"Project Summary
The primary pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine
(DA) pathway, which underlies the motor impairments of PD. At present, the most common pharmacological
treatment for PD is DA replacement using L-DOPA, a precursor for DA synthesis. Unfortunately, although L-
DOPA and related pharmacological approaches treat symptoms, they do not alter disease progression.
Moreover, dyskinesia is a common side effect of long-term L-DOPA administration. New approaches are
therefore long overdue. Clinical and basic science research has shown that exercise, an adjunct, non-
pharmacological treatment strategy can be beneficial for patients with PD. Our preliminary data from young male
(10 week) and aged (12 month) female and male mice show that voluntary wheel running exercise boosts
stimulated DA release in ex vivo striatal slices from runners (freely rotating wheel) compared to age-matched
controls (locked wheel). These exercise studies were conducted in collaboration with Co-Investigators Moses
Chao and Adam Mar. These studies also revealed an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in
the dorsal striatum of young male runners vs. controls. Implicating a causal role for BDNF, exercise-induced
enhancement of DA release was lost in BDNF+/- mice, which have low levels of BDNF. Proposed experiments in
this project will answer key questions using healthy, wild type (WT) mice, including whether axonal DA release
in vivo is enhanced after exercise as seen in ex vivo slices, and whether exercise also boosts somatodendritic
DA release in midbrain slices. The role of BDNF in all exercise-altered parameters will be assessed by comparing
data from WT and BDNF+/- mice. Given that striatal DA release is enhanced by exercise in both sexes, but with
some differences, all experiments will assess sex as a variable. In Aim 1, we will determine the influence of
voluntary exercise (30 days) on striatal DA uptake in ex vivo slices and on axonal DA release in vivo using
GRAB-DA with fiber photometry. In Aim 2, we will test the hypotheses that voluntary exercise boosts
somatodendritic DA release and enhances striatal neuron plasticity in WT mice of both sexes, but is without
effect in BDNF+/- mice. Motor tests will be conducted in all cohorts to enable comparison of exercise-altered
physiology and motor performance. Aim 3 will assess benefits of exercise in a new genetic mouse model of PD:
Parkin R275W mice. These mice were developed in the Sassone Lab in Milan using CRISPR/CAS9 to express
the R275W mutation of PARK2, which is associated with early-onset PD. R275W mice show motor deficits and
DA neuron degeneration at 12 months; preliminary data show that 30 days of exercise boosts striatal DA release
in 12 month-old R275W mice, and that this is associated with motor improvement, even in this small pilot cohort.
Overall, this project will provide novel mechanistic insight into processes that are enhanced by exercise, and
could point to new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease, as well as for other disorders that show
improvement with exercise."

Drexel University is a prestigious, highly diverse R1-level institution built upon a strong
history of interdisciplinary collaborations across its many departments and campuses.
Drexel University recognizes that state-of-the-art research core facilities are central to the
success of individual research operations and the overall research mission of the
University. Flow cytometry remains the gold standard for high throughput analysis cells at
the single cell level, a critical approach when evaluating heterogeneity in cellular
microenvironments. Conventional flow cytometers however are limited by which
fluorescent proteins they can detect and the number of concurrent proteins that can be
evaluated simultaneously. Spectral flow cytometers are revolutionary in their ability to
simultaneously detect and distinguish between fluorescent proteins previously deemed
as incompatible with conventional flow cytometers. Drexel University is requesting funds
in support of a BD Biosciences Symphony A5 Spectrally Enabled flow cytometer with 5
lasers, 48 fluorescence and 2 scatter channels, and a high-throughput sampler (HTS)
system to support deep profiling of cellular heterogeneity in mouse and human samples.
This flow cytometer will become the flagship cytometer of the newly created Flow

10861803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Project 1 of the Emory Lung Cancer P01 application focuses on interrogation of metabolic dysregulation in LKB1-
mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to overcome immunotherapy resistance. LKB1, which is inactivated in 25%
of LUAD, plays an important role in regulating cell metabolism. Elevated glutamine metabolism is critical for
cancer progression, but the mechanism by which glutaminolysis is upregulated and contributes to immune
escape is still elusive. We found that glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), the crucial enzyme in glutaminolysis
pathway, induces CamKK2, which substitutes for LKB1 to activate AMPK to manage energy homeostasis and
promote metastasis in LKB1-deficient lung cancer. Through kinase inhibitor profiling, we found that focal
adhesion kinase (FAK; focus of Project 3) phosphorylates GDH1 at Y135 and activates GDH1 specifically in
LKB1 mutated LUAD. To investigate the link between GDH1 signaling and antitumor immunity, we performed
immune profiling and demonstrated that GDH1 contributes to promotion of activated regulatory T cells and
attenuation of tumor infiltrated CD8 T cells in vivo. Replenishing energy metabolism in LKB1 mutated lung cancer
with GDH1 loss by reactivating AMPK reduced the enhanced T cell survival in vitro. Through a genomic profiling
of immune checkpoint factors, we also found that GDH1 promotes expression of programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1) and poliovirus receptor (PVR), and their potential transcription factor CREB was found to be activated
by GDH1-CamKK2-CamK4 signaling. Furthermore, GDH1 loss resulted in increased protein expression of
stimulator of interferon genes (STING; focus of Project 2). Inhibition of GDH1 using our novel GDH inhibitor R162
attenuated lung cancer progression and rendered LKB1 mutated LUAD cells vulnerable to activated primary
immune cells. Moreover, R162 in combination with PD1 inhibitor further induced cancer cell death compared to
single agent treatment, suggesting GDH1 as a promising target to overcome immunotherapy resistance.
 Thus, our central hypothesis is that FAK activates GDH1 by Y135 phosphorylation specifically in LKB1-
mutant LUAD and provides immunotherapy resistance through metabolic, transcriptional, and protein stability
regulation. Thus, GDH1 represents a promising anti-cancer target in combination with immunotherapy agents
targeting PD-L1/PVR signaling. Three specific aims are proposed: (1) To decipher the mechanism by which
FAK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of GDH1 promotes cancer progression in an LKB1-dependent
manner; (2) To determine how GDH1 confers immunotherapy resistance by providing metabolic, transcriptional,
and protein stability advantages through AMPK, CREB, and STING; and (3) To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
of targeting GDH1 in combination with ï¡-PD-L1/ï¡-TIGIT-based immunotherapy. Along with Project 2 (STING)
and Project 3 (FAK), accomplishing the goals of our project is expected to develop novel GDH1-targeted
therapeutic approaches to enhance the response of LKB1-mutant LUAD to immunotherapies."
10861806,"SUMMARY
Project 2 of the Emory Lung Cancer P01 application focuses on the dissection of suppressed anticancer
immunity mechanisms involving STING in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with LKB1 mutations for translational
gains. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US with limited therapeutic options. While
molecularly targeted therapies are effective in patients with defined mutations such as those in EGFR and ALK,
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have brought hope for additional patients and have revolutionized cancer
therapy to stimulate the host immune system to destroy tumors. Unfortunately, the majority of lung cancer
patients show poor response to such ICIs. In particular, LUAD patients with LKB1 mutations have no targeted
therapies and are unresponsive to ICIs. Thus it is urgent to understand the tumor-immune interactions in such
LKB1-mutant LUAD and develop new therapeutic approaches to overcome immunotherapy resistance. It
appears that the immune suppressed state of LKB1-mutant LUAD is associated with the silenced STimulator of
INterferon Gene (STING), a cytosolic DNA sensor that regulates innate immunity. Thus, strategies to reverse
STING expression may re-establish the tumor-immune microenvironment and re-sensitize tumors for effective
treatment with STING agonists or ICIs. We discovered that birinapant, a small molecule antagonist of Inhibitor
of Apoptosis Protein (IAP), can restore STING expression, reactivate STING signaling, and enhance immune
effector cell killing of LKB1-mut LUAD cells. In further support of this revised application, our new data showed
that birinapant exhibited potent in vivo immune-dependent anti-tumor activity selectively in immune competent
LKB1-mutant mouse model. These results led to our central hypothesis that LKB1 loss is associated with STING
downregulation through aberrant IAP functions, and pharmacological targeting using IAP inhibitors may restore
STING expression and re-establish immune response pathways in LKB1-mut LUAD for enhanced therapeutic
efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a combination of cell, mouse, and patient tumor tissues from
Core 2 and Project 3 clinical trials 1) to examine the molecular mechanisms by which IAP inhibitors induce
STING expression in LKB1-mut LUAD cells; 2) to determine the therapeutic effect of IAP inhibitors and STING
agonists in LKB1-mut tumors; and 3) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IAP inhibitors in combination with a
PD-1 blockade agent in LKB1-mut tumors. We will examine the impact of the IAP-STING axis in the context of
GDH1 (Project 1) and FAK hyperactivation (Project 3) to improve mechanistic understanding of LKB1 immune
response signaling. Accomplishing the goals of the proposal, we aim to deliver preclinical evidence for using IAP
inhibitors, such as birinapant, alone or in combination with STING agonists or ICI to treat lung cancer patients
with LKB1 alterations."
10861807,"Project Summary
Project 3 of the Emory Lung Cancer P01 application focuses on focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in LKB1-mutant
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) for the clinical development of combination therapy to enhance the efficacy of
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). The tumor suppressor LKB1 is the 3rd most frequently mutated gene in lung
adenocarcinoma. This tumor subgroup is resistant to ICI therapy and is not amenable to molecularly targeted
therapies. Our goal is to develop novel therapeutic regimens that will benefit patients with LKB1-mutant lung
cancer. We discovered that LKB1 regulates LUAD cell motility and represses FAK to oversee cell adhesion,
invasion, and collagen remodeling. Our clinically relevant Lkb1-mutant genetically engineered mouse model
(GEMM) showed that FAK is activated in collective invasion packs (CIPs) of cancer cells at the invasion front of
the primary tumor, with a similar phenotype as in lung cancer patients. These collective invasion packs are
surrounded by heterotypic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and contain a densely remodeled collagen
matrix. Our initial pre-clinical trial with this mouse model indicated that these tumors are exquisitely sensitive to
FAK inhibition monotherapy. Importantly, FAK inhibitor therapy increases CD8+T cell infiltration and enhances
ICI in pancreatic cancer. Our pilot study revealed synergy between FAK inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody in
preventing tumor growth and metastasis in a new metastatic syngeneic model. Here, FAK inhibition eliminates
collective invasion packs, surrounding CAFs, and restores STING expression (a focus of Project 2), increasing
CD8+ T cell infiltration to CIPs. These data lead to the central hypothesis that LKB1 inactivation in LUAD
represents an acquired tumor vulnerability that can be synergistically targeted with a FAK inhibitor in combination
with ICI therapy. We propose that FAK inhibition disrupts the heterotypic CAF:tumor-cell interaction within the
collective invasion packs, resulting in increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration. To test this, we will conduct a Phase II
clinical trial with the FAK inhibitor in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (pembrolizumab) in patients with
LKB1-mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma. We will also evaluate the underlying mechanism using our
GEMM and syngeneic model to determine if pharmacologic FAK inhibition enhances the response to ICI,
resulting in CD8+ T-cell recruitment to collective invasion packs. Along with Project 1 (FAK regulated
glutaminolysis and immune checkpoint regulation) and Project 2 (restoration of STING to enhance ICI), the
successful completion of this project will accelerate the implementation of a novel combination therapy approach
specially tailored toward lung cancer patients with LKB1-mutant tumors."

 Malaysia's HIV epidemic is rapidly expanding with recent evidence suggesting accelerated sexual
transmission, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM): 10% in 2008 to 54% in 2016. Biobehavioral
surveys suggest high HIV prevalence in MSM being nationally (21.6%) and in Kuala Lumpur (43%). This growing
epidemic in MSM is associated with condomless sex (CS), STIs, and high usage of substance (particularly
amphetamine-type stimulants; ATS). In Malaysia, both substance use and homosexuality are criminalized,
making MSM dually bear the burden of social stigma and discrimination, including in healthcare. Consequently,
they are marginalized from traditional, venue-based HIV prevention services, which undermines
recommendations by international agencies. To address stigma and discrimination, mHealth (mobile technology
to promote health) strategies can deliver prevention messages and guide health decisions anonymously, and thus
hold great promise for MSM, especially those using ATS. They can overcome barriers along the HIV prevention
cascade that now includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Combined with strong training and mentoring, the
proposed projects directly address this need through the conduct of two formative studies. First, information
about MSM's preferences of various attributes of PrEP delivery programs, including segmentation of ATS-using
MSM, will be assessed. Then, building on the first study, the candidate will develop and test an mHealth-based
intervention to overcome barriers along the prevention continuum, including HIV testing, co-occurring sexual
and drug risk behaviors and PrEP uptake among Malaysian MSM. Findings from these related projects will
provide the candidate with the necessary skills and competencies to develop and test an innovative and tailored
primary HIV prevention intervention for MSM. This K01 application for Dr. Shrestha is well-suited to advance
the career of the candidate by virtue of his training in intervention design, delivery, and placement, his high
productivity in public health research, and his evolving experience with research in the Malaysian context. Over
5 years, he will achieve new skills and experiences to achieve his professional goals and objectives to: 1) gain
experience in decision science with advanced quantitative and qualitative skills to become an independent
investigator in HIV, substance use, and mHealth intervention for vulnerable populations; 2) develop expertise
in mHealth intervention development, testing, implementation, and dissemination that will address specific
barriers to HIV prevention services in MSM, especially those with substance use disorders; and 3) develop an
independent career path focusing on HIV prevention in MSM using mHealth strategies. To achieve these goals,
he has assembled a stellar interdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in HIV, substance use, intervention
design, decision science, advanced biostatistics, and mHealth research. Under their guidance, he will complete
relevant didactic work and attend seminars and conduct research to apply the skills needed to become an
independent researcher in mHealth-based HIV prevention among MSM."
10856096,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Microbial infections account for nearly one-sixth of all human cancers. Oxidative stress generated by cancer-
causing pathogens can drive tumor formation, yet very little is known about the cellular targets of oxidative
stress that contribute to cancer development during infection. At the molecular level, one of the primary
consequences of oxidative stress is the site-specific oxidation of proteins containing redox-sensitive cysteines.
Cysteine oxidation can regulate important cellular functions such as proliferation, metabolism, and other
tumorigenic processes. However, almost nothing is known about the cysteines that are oxidized during
infection, in part because they are difficult to study. Unlike DNA oxidation, post-translational oxidative
modifications cannot be detected by DNA sequencing, transcriptional profiling, or even conventional proteomic
analyses. Consequently, methods traditionally used to study hostâmicrobe interactions overlook signaling
events that could potentially be targeted to prevent disease. To address this challenge, we have developed
and validated a chemical proteomic strategy that can detect specific sites of oxidative modification on host
proteins in infected cells. We use chemical probes to quantify proteome-wide changes in thiol reactivity, which
decreases upon oxidation. Using this approach, we identified cysteines in several host proteins that become
less reactive when human gastric cells are infected with the cancer-causing pathogen Helicobacter pylori.
Notably, we discovered an infection-induced oxidation site on Cys219 of the host protease legumain that
accelerates tumor growth. The proposed research program will extend these findings by (1) uncovering the
molecular mechanisms by which infection-induced oxidation sites influence host protein function and
localization, with the goal of defining cysteine oxidation as a new mechanism of cancer pathogenesis during H.
pylori infection; and (2) leveraging our approach to identify specific oxidation sites that promote cancer
signaling in vivo. Our long-term goal is to establish a platform for the discovery and functional characterization
of oxidized cysteines in the context of infection. We will test three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will define the
molecular mechanisms linking Cys219 inactivation to defective legumain processing and intracellular
trafficking. In Aim 2, we will use metabolic labeling and nucleoside recoding chemistry to establish whether
oxidation of the ribosomal protein uL14 on Cys125 inhibits translation. In Aim 3, we will develop a quantitative,
tandem mass tagging-based approach to functionally map novel sites of cysteine oxidation induced by a
cancer-promoting bacterial protein in vivo. By providing mechanistic insights into how specific oxidation sites
affect tumorigenic processes, and discovering additional candidates for characterization, the overall impact of
this proposal will be to build fundamental understanding of how reactive cysteines shape cancer signaling and
thereby inform the development of new strategies for perturbing these pathways during infection."

This proposal seeks continued funding support for the Tetrahymena Stock Center, which serves as the primary
resource for the preservation and distribution of genetically defined strains of Tetrahymena thermophila for
researchers in the United States (U.S.) and world-wide. This NIH-supported Stock Center stores and makes
available over 2000 strains to researchers, facilitating innovative studies by the current generation of scientists.
The grant also supports Tetrahymena Genome Database, the main repository of genomic information for this
organism. The overall outcome of the Centerâs activities is the expansion of knowledge of biological processes
that underlie human health and disease. The aims for the Resource component are to 1) continue to act as a
repository accepting new strains and making live cultures of T. thermophila available to interested
users at reasonable cost. Ensuring the secure maintenance of the resource for the dissemination of T.
thermophila strains and useful plasmids remains the primary focus for the resource. We will evaluate our
current practices and implement changes to improve its operations. The overall impact will be to make the
central functions of the Stock center more efficient and able to better serve an expanding user base; 2)
integrate large collections into the Stock Center. During the next funding period, we will place specific
emphasis on preserving larger collections of a few long-established laboratories to ensure that they are not lost
to the research community. In addition, we will integrate an array of gene tagging/expression vectors into the
repository for distribution to the broader research community and advertise these along with strain engineering
services, which is attractive to those with limited resources and/or experience in strain development; 3)
increase the visibility of Stock Center resources and streamline data curation. We plan improvements to
our web portal to make the discovery of resources more transparent. To better communicate with users, we will
produce an electronic newsletter twice a year, which is expected to increase traffic to the website and requests
for resources. We will also mediate the development of a micropublication pipeline to speed the dissemination
of research findings by investigators, including those at the baccalaureate level; 4) improve the informational
function of the resource by curating new genomic information into Tetrahymena Genome Database
(TGD). TGD is a primary source for gene and genomic information of ciliates used in research. To maintain this
key function of the resource, we will update gene annotations, add new gene expression data to TGD to
facilitate new research, and increase linkages to common databases to make our resources more findable.
Furthermore, we will increase the analysis tools available to ciliate researchers by partnering with Dr. Ting
Wang (Washington University in St. Louis) to display ciliate genomes on the WashU epigenome browser.
These improvements to the Stock Center resources will greatly increase the research capacity of investigators
using ciliates to make significant discoveries."
10850070,"Curation and Informatics: Summary / Abstract
This proposal seeks continued funding for the Tetrahymena Stock Center to enable maintenance of the
Tetrahymena Stock Center and Tetrahymena Genome Database (TGD) together to create a comprehensive
resource providing both physical samples (e.g. cell line) and curated information, enabling a wide range of
scientific investigations. In this renewal application, we will implement several new innovations related to
resource curation to facilitate biological and biomedical research. A major goal of this work is to increase the
findability of physical resources by improving the interconnectivity between the two components of this
resource. We will also focus on evaluation of our operations and practices, information that we will review with
our external advisory committee, to ensure that we are most efficiently serving our research community. The
overall aims of our curation activities are to 1) improve curation of stocks by assigning RRID designations to
new acquisitions and use bioinformatics to link genes associated with specific stocks to human disease-
associated genes. In addition, we will post accurate DNA sequences of plasmid DNA resources. The goal is to
increase findability and usability of these physical resources; 2) increase the interoperability of genomic
data at TGD by updating the current gene annotations based on recent curation, expanding the quality and
quantity of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, and adding links to gene annotations at common bioinformatics
data and protein feature resources; 3) consolidate and display gene expression data sets. We will develop
guidelines that will help researchers format and submit their expression data files to TGD so that they can be
placed in datahubs and displayed on the Tetrahymena genome browser or the WashU epigenome browser; 4)
increase the capacity of web portals to gather assessment data. Improvements to the Stock Center
website are planned that will allow us to monitor usage, improve transparency in the stock ordering process,
and capture user information and thereby allow the Stock Center to better serve the research community. By
improving these genome resources and assisting researchers with analysis pipelines, the Stock Center can
provide the highest level of support to the research community."

This Phase II Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) proposal will sustain and enhance an
interdisciplinary research Center within the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) focused on fundamental molecular
and cellular signal transduction mechanisms in the cardiovascular system. Core A, the Administrative and
Faculty Development Core, is described here. Core A will manage the COBREâs administrative, fiscal, and
scientific activities. Core A will be directed by Dr. Scott Earley, Professor of Pharmacology, the Principal
Investigator and COBRE Director. Dr. Earley is an accomplished investigator with an established track record of
NIH funding, publication in high-quality journals, and committed to mentoring young scientists. The following
goals have been established for Core A during Phase II: 1) Provide scientific leadership and develop an
administrative structure for the Center; 2) Execute an aggressive Faculty Development Plan to provide
personalized, one-on-one mentoring for the COBREâs Research Project Leaders (RPLs). The Faculty
Development Plan is designed to transition the RPLs from early career investigator status to fully independent

Select and recruit new RPLs to replace those who graduate; 4) Establish an effective Pilot Projects Program to
fund the development of new research projects; 5) Establish and coordinate an effective Advisory Committee;
6) Plan for the long-term sustainability of our Center; and 7) Implement a formative and summative evaluation
strategy for the COBRE, the RPLs, and the Research Cores with specific milestones. Completing these goals
will sustain and enhance the Nevada COBRE in Molecular and Cellular Signal Transduction in the
Cardiovascular System as an internationally recognized, sustainable multidisciplinary research Center
investigating the regulation of cardiovascular function during health and disease."
10850203,"Project Summary
Genetically modified animals are fundamental for biomedical discovery, but breeding, genotyping, and
maintenance of multiple transgenic lines is burdensome for junior investigators and their small laboratories.
Further, most labs lack the specialized equipment and in vivo techniques needed to fully characterize the impact
of genetic modification on essential cardiovascular functions. Therefore, the goal of the present proposal is to
establish a new Transgenic Animal Genotyping and Phenotyping Research Core (Core B) as a centralized facility
to provide these resources to support the research of the COBREâs Project Leaders and the COBRE
cardiovascular research group. The specific aims of Core B are to (1) establish and operate a centralized facility
for maintaining genetically modified animals used for the investigation of molecular and cellular signal
transduction pathways in the cardiovascular system; (2) establish and operate a facility that provides services
for evaluating the cardiovascular phenotype of genetically modified animals; and (3) advise, train, and provide
technical support for the use and characterization of transgenic laboratory animals. Briefly, Core B will supply
the Project Leaders with access to a wide range of ready-to-use transgenic, knockout, and genetically encoded
biosensor mice useful for the study of molecular and cellular signal transduction within the cardiovascular
system. In addition, Core B will provide Project Leaders with a suite of in vivo techniques for characterization of
the cardiovascular phenotypes of their animal models. These services include telemetric monitoring of blood
pressure, heart rate, hemodynamics, and locomotor activity; echocardiography for evaluating cardiac function;
and indirect calorimetry for measurement of metabolic and behavioral parameters. Successful completion of this
proposal will alleviate the burden of maintaining and characterizing transgenic animal models. As such, Core B
is vital for the rapid progress of the Project Leaders and their successful transition to independence. Furthermore,
establishment of Core B in the greater Nevada area will provide a solid infrastructure and facility for the
development of a highly competitive Cardiovascular Research group."

 Periodontitis and Type II Diabetes (T2D) are co-occurring diseases and among the most prevalent
chronic illnesses in the United States with an estimated 46.5% of adults suffering from the former, 9.4% adults
suffering from the latter, and 62.3% of diabetic adults older than 65 burdened by both. T2D, characterized by a
state of chronic systemic inflammation, can lead to periodontitis via dysregulated host immune responses and a
positive feedback loop between systemic inflammation and oral dysbiosis. The observation that periodontitis
adversely affects glycemic control, insulin resistance, and diabetic complications like neuropathy, cardiovascular
disease, and even death is well accepted, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Periodontitis has emerged
as a potential modifier of the gut microbiome, whose role in regulating systemic and metabolic health is
increasingly being recognized. Multiple studies point to gut microbiome dysbiosis as a contributor to metabolic
disorders, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Combined with
evidence oral dysbiosis is associated with gut microbiome compositional changes, and, that oral microbes make
up gut microbiome signatures in T2D, rationale exists for the oral-gut microbiome axis as a link between
periodontitis and diabetes. The goal of this NRSA F30 proposal is to evaluate the effect of periodontitis, and its
associated mouth microbiome dysbiosis, on metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome important to metabolic
disorders and T2D. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that periodontitis alters the gut microbiome
vis oral-to-gut strain transmission to contribute to metabolic dysfunction and inflammation in T2D. The purpose
of Aim 1 is to determine if microbial specific strain-level genetic variation and oral dysbiosis are associated with
functional changes in the gut microbiome. The purpose of Aim 2 is to test oral-to-gut strain transmission as a
mechanism by which periodontitis alters the gut microbiome, and contributes to poor outcomes related to T2D.
Using subject-matched plaque and feces samples, the oral and gut microbiomes will be characterized at strain-
level resolution, and metabolic profiles will be reconstructed for each microbiome. The experiments outlined in
this proposal will determine the role of specific oral strains and oral-to-gut strain transmission in contributing to
the pathologic systemic effects of periodontitis seen in T2D. This work will take place at the University at Buffalo,
School of Dental Medicine, in the laboratory of Dr. Patricia Diaz, who is an expert in microbiome research. The
training plan is tailored for development as a physician-scientist in the field of infectious disease, and will include
clinical preceptorships in infectious disease and endocrinology in order to gain cross-disciplinary experience,
reflecting the research goals of this proposal. These longitudinal clinical preceptorships will be with successful
physician-scientists, who also will be directly involved in the proposed research, thereby providing integrated
mentorship over the course of the fellowship."
10847851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last two decades there have been tremendous advances in in vivo neurophotonic technologies, which
allow neuroscientists to visualize molecular, cellular and systems-level brain physiology and functions. For the
last ten years, these technological efforts have been greatly facilitated by the BRAIN Initiative. However, this fast
growth has widened the gap between the developers and the neuroscience community in need. This is because
to properly use these novel tools, it is important to understand the underlying physical principles and have the
practical skills in data collection and quantitative statistical analysis. Furthermore, each technique comes with its
limitations, and understanding these limitations is critical for avoiding unconscious bias. The adoption and
utilization of these neurophotonic technologies is, by nature, an interdisciplinary enterprise, forged between
neuroscience, engineering, and the data sciences. As such, it also represents an ideal discipline around which
to build a new training paradigm that incorporates team science, interdisciplinary thinking, communication, and
business understanding. The mission of our Neurophotonics Research Training Program is to create the
preeminent neurophotonics training program that will produce the next-generation of investigators capable of
rigorously and creatively developing and applying photonics methods across a wide array of neuroscience sub-
fields to advance our understanding of the brain in health and disease. Our trainees will gain the foundational
knowledge of the field that will permit them to continue to grow with the field after their training, and efficiently
translate their breakthroughs from the academic lab to real world applications. Our training program will fully
support the broad range of exciting careers open to scientists today. In addition to building a field-defining
neurophotonics curriculum, combining technical training, computational / data analysis, and critical thinking skills,
we will provide robust training in the professional and operational skills required for success in this highly
interdisciplinary field."

We propose to continue a Jointly Sponsored Predoctoral Training Program in Neurosciences that is the major
source of support for early year students in the Ph.D. Program in Neurosciences at Harvard University. The
goals of this interdepartmental Ph.D. program, established in 1982, are (1) to organize the neuroscientists at
Harvard Medical School, its affiliated hospitals, and Harvard College into a single training faculty cohort; and
(2) to train research scientists and teachers who are interested in mental health, diseases of the nervous
system, and fundamental mechanisms of the brain. The training program is designed to provide talented
trainees with a broad and thorough background in neuroscience; to train them in quantitative and statistical
methods in experimental design and analysis; and to mentor them in performing original and rigorous research
in important areas of neuroscience. During the first year, students are provided with initial preparation in
quantitative approaches to scientific endeavors. This is followed by a year-long course, The Discipline of
Neuroscience, which provides integrated and rigorous training in concepts central to our understanding of the
development, function, and diseases of the nervous system at the levels of cellular signaling, circuit
computations, and behavior generation. All students take an additional course in quantitative/statistical
approaches to Neuroscience, as well as a neuroanatomy course and two electives. Students also rotate
through three different laboratories during the first year. Following the coursework, laboratory rotations, and a
preliminary examination, students begin full time, mentored dissertation research. During the program,
students are also involved in other ongoing training activities including journal clubs, seminars, retreats, skill
workshops, and data presentation. There are currently 130 graduate students enrolled in the Program in
Neuroscience; we are requesting support for 14 students, divided between the first and second year of
graduate education. There are 153 faculty in the Program in Neuroscience; the 82 faculty who are currently
most actively involved in graduate education are training mentors on this proposal. Considerable effort has
gone into making this program a highly interactive group with extensive formal and informal contacts between
students and faculty, as well as in enhancing the diversity of the student body in the Program. Graduates of
this program go on to distinguished careers in biomedical research and make substantial contributions to a
growing understanding of neuroscience."
10848009,"SUMMARY
 In this application, we used untargeted metabolomics as discovery platform to structurally identify and
characterize an unknown metabolite whose levels in plasma in a Discovery Cohort are strongly associated with
incident risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and major adverse cardiovascular events
(MACE = myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or death). Extensive chemical structural elucidation efforts
revealed the âanalyteâ was in fact a pair of rarely studied structural isomers that serve as terminal metabolites
of NAD+ metabolism, namely 2PY and 4PY. Vitamin B3 is niacin (nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide), and is
integrally linked to both NAD+ and cellular energy metabolism. This proposal integrates nutrition and
metabolism data in both health and disease. It also explores mechanisms of micro-nutrient processing
(NAD+/niacin) and its impact on metabolism, pathophysiological pathways and disease outcomes.
Preliminary data indicate the terminal metabolite, 4PY, but not its structural isomer 2PY, is clinically associated
with CVD risks, and preliminary cellular and disease model studies suggest 4PY directly fosters vascular
inflammation and heightened thrombosis potential. We will use a variety of approaches to explore the
metabolism, biology and (patho) physiological links between 4PY and CVD relevant phenotypes. Our studies
also suggest that a specific genetic variant, coupled with dietary tryptophan, can give rise to both enhanced
4PY levels, and vascular endothelial cell activation, pro-inflammatory gene programs, and heightened
atherosclerosis and thrombosis potential. The present studies have significant potential public health
importance for many reasons. They identify a new potential contributor to residual CVD risks independent of
traditional risk factors. They also call for reassessment of the safety of cereal fortification, a practice
institutionalized in the US since WWII. Finally, the present studies may help explain the âniacin paradoxâ
wherein large doses of niacin used to lower LDL cholesterol, failed to match expectations in clinical trials based
on the degree of LDL lowering."

 The botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most lethal toxin known to man, with a lethal dose of only 1
ng/kg of body weight. The neurotoxin acts on neurons causing irreversible termination of
neurotransmission resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis diagnosed as botulism. Botulism is a serious illness
that can lead to respiratory failure and death. The intentional use of the extremely deadly neurotoxin as a
biological weapon is a major concern. Coupled with limited treatment options, there is an urgent need for
therapeutics to treat BoNT intoxication. The goal of this project is to create new molecules that are
therapeutically sound leads for the treatment of botulism.
 Previously, we have discovered the dipeptide scaffold as a potent source of BoNT inhibitors via
enzymatic inhibition assay and X-ray crystallography. This is the first reported example of dipeptides as a
BoNT inhibitor. We propose that the dipeptide is an excellent scaffold for BoNT inhibitor design and will
create dipeptides with potent inhibitor activity and optimize the pharmacokinetic properties. The aims of
this proposed research are 1) Synthesize dipeptide libraries to study BoNT inhibition; 2) Evaluate the
dipeptides as BoNT inhibitors through enzyme inhibition assays; 3) Examine pharmacokinetic properties
of the dipeptides by performing cell permeability and metabolic stability studies. Based on the results from
aims 2 and 3, structural improvements will be made to the peptides to allow for the synthesis of 2nd and
3rd-generation dipeptides that are enriched with potent inhibitors, which have excellent cell permeability
and metabolic stability. Overall, the proposed research will deliver true therapeutic lead compounds with
potent inhibitor activity with promising pharmacokinetic profiles. This work will provide a novel scaffold that
will be a sound therapeutic lead for the treatment of botulism. Undergraduate student researchers will
perform all aspects of the proposed research. Research laboratory experiences will be transformative for
undergraduate students and help improve their career trajectory. The research described will provide
undergraduate students with laboratory training that will be valuable for their future careers in biomedical
research."

Implicit bias is a well-documented contributor to healthcare disparities that lead to poorer health
outcomes, higher infant mortality rates, and chronic disease in racial and ethnic minority populations.
There exists a clear and critical need to reimagine how we approach engineering training to improve
cultural competency and facilitate patient-centered, economical solutions accessible by all people
regardless of race and socioeconomic status. Barriers to paradigm change are entrenched in the ways in
which we equip clinicians to care for patients and train engineers to create solutions for clinicians. Our
long-term goal is to establish an interdisciplinary, team-based approach for training engineers and
clinicians to identify and address barriers to medical care and efficiency. The short-term objective of this
proposal is to establish a two-year community-centered medical device innovation program that leads to
creative, interdisciplinary problem-solving. The program foundation is supported by three specific aims. Aim 1.
Establish a pedagogy that fosters creativity and flexibility in problem-solving of community-based medical
needs through multidisciplinary clinician-engineering design teams. Aim 2. Emphasize impactful, financially
sustainable, and commercializable solutions based on community need as a model for improving accessibility
to care for historically marginalized groups. Aim 3. Improvement of recruitment and retention of students from
underrepresented groups to increase the diversity of the biomedical engineering workforce pipeline. The
program will recruit 75% of students from underrepresented groups in STEM. Design teams formed by
engineering and nursing students will be exposed to the continuum of the design arc through community-
centered, patient-centered needs finding, courses in medical device design and regulation as well as
considerations for product development and entrepreneurship. Importantly, design teams interdisciplinary
training focuses on identifying medical need through direct observation and immersion into the
community medical system. The design and entrepreneurship experience of the students from problem
identification to medical device commercialization will be supported by the biotech incubator
Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center, a Medical Device Development Steering
Committee, and the Center for Community Research and Engagement. The programâs effectiveness in
training students to identify and address barriers to medical care and efficiency, learning of the material,
changes in behavior, and program implementation will be assessed by the Center for Program
Evaluation. The proposed program will immediately and directly impact the training and development of
the biomedical engineering and nursing workforce through multi-disciplinary collaboration and clinical
immersion to facilitate patient-centered design thinking."
10851193,"ABSTRACT
While obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is linked to metabolic syndrome, the results from
randomized clinical trials with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, a treatment for OSA, are
inconclusive regarding therapy effects on glucose metabolism and cardiovascular disease.
Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and ambulatory blood pressure monitors (ABPM) are
increasingly used to elucidate the effects of OSA on glucose metabolism and blood pressure,
however, there is a large gap between the complexity of data from wearable devices and
commonly used crude summary measures (e.g., glucose time in range, 24h blood pressure
mean). Without advancements in algorithms that provide better characterization of temporal
features in CGM and ABPM data, the adverse effects of OSA on glucose metabolism and blood
pressure will likely remain underappreciated, and elucidating the heterogeneity of treatment
effects with PAP therapy will remain difficult. Our proposal is motivated by data from a randomized
clinical trial on the effects of PAP therapy on glycemic measures and blood pressure of patients
with concurrent type 2 diabetes and OSA. Conventional CGM and ABPM summaries lack
sensitivity to differentiate control and treatment groups and detect heterogeneity in treatment
effects. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop novel statistical and machine learning
methods to fully exploit CGM and ABPM data for precision phenotyping of glycemic and
cardiovascular measures. To achieve our objective, we propose the following: (1) To address the
limited statistical power of existing methods for characterizing features of the glycemic state, we
will develop a distributional data analysis framework for CGM-based glycemic measures that will
incorporate global and local temporal characteristics. (2) To address the limitations of existing
methods for ABPM data due to the separate analysis of each blood pressure modality (systolic,
diastolic) and oversimplified division of time into the night (0-6 h) and day, we will develop a tensor
data analysis framework for ABPM data that will integrate all concurrent measurements (systolic,
diastolic, mean arterial pressure, heart rate) aligned by the full 24h time period. We will develop
software to enable the broad application of proposed algorithms to other studies that collect CGM
and ABPM data. Completion of these aims will provide the necessary algorithmic and
computational tools to test whether behavioral interventions and new pharmacotherapeutic
agents improve the glycemic status and blood pressure in population subsets, including those
with prediabetes and hypertension. Reducing the metabolic and cardiovascular risk burden has
unquestionable relevance for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
10851194,"Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal is to fund a complete refurbishment of the McLean Hospital 9.4 Tesla
/ 400 mm Agilent pre-clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging system. This system is the largest active shield pre-
clinical magnet in the world (there is a passive shield prototype magnet in Hefei, China) and provides scanning
and spectroscopy for a range of subject species by using insertable gradient coils: a large gradient, ID = 260
mm; a middle gradient, ID = 115 mm; and a small gradient, ID=60 mm. This instrument has been productive
since it was first installed in 2008 in studying a variety of species from mice through macaques for both
morphometric imaging scans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in rodents
and in non-human primates. This proposal is to refurbish and upgrade the system, bringing it to state-of-the-art
technology so it is ready for the next decade of its service to the McLean Hospital research community.
There are three motivations for upgrading this MR system at this time. First, its electronic equipment and gradient
coils are 15 years old and are in need of replacement. Connectors and components within the electronics, are
expected to fail in the next few years due to normal usage; the gradient coils are made of epoxy and subjected
to strong vibration during scanning and need replacement before mechanical failure. These are common needs
for MR systems with upgrades normally spaced 10 years apart. Second, this system was originally built by
Varian, but was acquired by Agilent, who now provides technical support. Agilent has discontinued its MRI
product line, and service and parts will cease to be available over the next few years â this application is for an
upgrade to Bruker AVNEO electronics, which will then end our dependence on Agilent and instead will benefit
from the full support of Bruker Inc. and offer a future development path. This upgrade is necessary for the system
to continue operating. Third, due to its age, our 9.4T lacks many of the more advanced acquisition methods
necessary for fMRI and MRS such as MPRAGE sequences, parallel acquisitions with RF array coils for fMRI,
and two-dimensional, J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (MEGAPRESS) to name a few. The need for state-of-
the-art hardware and acquisition methods drive this upgrade. The unique magnet upon which the system is
based is in like-new condition and will last another 10-15 years or longer.
Relevance: The McLean 9.4T scanner is one of the most capable systems in the US for pre-clinical scanning,
providing imaging and spectroscopy for a wide range of species from mice to macaques. This upgrade will keep
this scanner at the forefront of the field and will open up new opportunities for rapidly translating discoveries
made in other animals to humans."
10850219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major cause of cancer related deaths is due to the metastasis of malignant cells from the
primary tumor to other tissues. Aberrant activity of the regulatory Rho family GTPases has been
identified as one of the underlying biochemical processes for initiation of this cell migration to
occur. In our laboratory we developed the small molecule inhibitor MBQ-167 and in collaboration
with the Dharmawardhane laboratory (University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus), we
showed that it is a dual inhibitor of the activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 with IC50
values of 103 nM and 78 nM, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated that MBQ-167
reduces tumor growth and metastasis in in vivo experiments in mice. As co-founders of the spin-
off company MBQ Pharma, we contributed to its pre-clinical development, and combined with its
lack of toxicity in different animal models, an IND-application for first-in-human was approved by
the FDA for its use in phase 1 clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer patients.
We have recently developed novel more potent inhibitors, of which CPV-337 seems especially
interesting. It is 3 to 5 times more potent than MBQ-167 both in cytotoxicity to cancer cells and in
Rac inhibitory activity. Based on evidence on the mechanism of action of MBQ-167 as an inhibitor
of nucleotide binding, as well as molecular docking analysis, we hypothesize that the increased
activity of CPV-337 originates via (reversible) covalent binding to the Cys19 residue of Rac. The
successful recent FDA approvals of covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors inspired us to develop novel
covalent Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors. In the first aim, we will evaluate the binding of CPV-337 to Rac via
protein NMR and use the results in the design of novel covalent Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors. In the
second aim we elaborate on the knowledge that a major active metabolite of the leukemia drug
6-mercaptopurine is 6-thioguanosine triphosphate (6-thio-GTP). This metabolite has previously
been shown to covalently bind to Cys18 of Rac. An immediate precursor of 6-thio-GTP via the
ProTide concept, or a precursor with an alternate covalent binding group, could provide novel
inhibitors of Rac. Both aims will result in novel small molecules with increased potency and
selectivity, better solubility, and improved biopharmaceutical properties, and potentially can be
developed into novel anticancer therapies."

The goal of this project is to develop a broad-spectrum dry powder inhalation teixobactin-lipopeptide
hybrid aimed at preventing and treating lung infections caused by bacterial `superbugs'. The successful
use of any antibiotic is compromised by the potential development of resistance to that compound from the
time it is first used. The world is facing an enormous and growing threat from the emergence of pan-drug
resistant (PDR) bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics. New antibiotics with 1) novel mechanisms
of action and 2) against which bacteria cannot easily develop resistance are urgently needed to treat lung
infections caused by the PDR Gram-negative pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-positive strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Teixobactin is a recently discovered new antibiotic that possesses a
novel mechanism of action (MOA), albeit, a narrow spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The
most notable property of teixobactin is that it is the first and only antibiotic that bacteria cannot easily develop
resistance against. We have developed novel teixobactin-lipopeptide hybrids that are superior to native
teixobactin as they retain this key anti-resistance property and in addition have a broader-spectrum,
with potent activity against PDR Gram-negatives, as well as PDR Gram-positives. Our preliminary data
show that our teixobactin-lipopeptide hybrids delivered as a dry powder inhalation have significantly improved
efficacy for the treatment of lung infections by virtue of their unique MOA, no detectable resistance, high local
exposure in the lungs with low systemic exposure and low toxicity. Importantly, the hybrids displayed superior
in vivo efficacy compared to treatment with the combination of the individual compounds or each compound
per se. This is a significant development in the field as the teixobactin-lipopeptide hybrid represents
the first-in class broad-spectrum `resistance-proof' dry powder inhalation antibiotic for the treatment of
PDR bacterial lung infections. Our internationally recognized track records in antibiotic discovery,
pharmacology, anti-infective dry powder formulation, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and state-of-the-art
facilities for antimicrobial development provide extremely strong support for this project. The proposal will
employ a purpose designed funneling approach to identify a lead candidate (plus one back-up) that is active
against PDR Gram-negative strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae and Gram-positive
strains of MRSA and S. pneumoniae for preclinical development and IND-enabling studies."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent public health problem that disproportionately
hurts Mexican and Central Americans (M/CA). Weight loss through behavioral changes in diet and physical
activity can lead to reductions in liver fat, injury, and fibrosis, but is rarely successfully achieved. Targeted
behavioral weight loss interventions may improve the outcomes of M/CA patients with NAFLD. However, little
is known about the personal, cognitive, and social factors that, if changed, may lead to improved weight loss
rates and avert complications. The objective of this proposal is to identify the barriers to health behavior
change experienced by M/CA patients with NAFLD and to adapt and test a weight loss intervention to address
their needs.
Dr. Maya Balakrishnan is a clinician investigator with a strong foundation in clinical hepatology and
epidemiology that has positioned her to advance toward her goal of improving NAFLD outcomes among
minority communities. Through this NIMHD K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Career Development Award, Dr.
Balakrishnan will obtain experience in developing, implementing, and testing behavioral interventions, with a
special focus on weight loss among M/CA patients with NAFLD. She will train in qualitative methods to gain an
in-depth understanding of patientsâ experience with weight loss behaviors. She will gain experience in the
adaptation, implementation, and testing of behavioral interventions in the context of health disparities.
With her inter-disciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Balakrishnan intends to use the Harris County NAFLD Cohort,
a unique cohort of predominantly M/CA patients with NAFLD, as the source of data and participants for her
proposed aims. Among M/CA patients with NAFLD, she will 1) identify the personal, cognitive and socio-
structural barriers to weight loss behavioral change (Aim 1), 2) adapt the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention for
their needs through feedback from patients and expert stakeholders using an Ecological Validity Model (Aim 2)
and 3) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention among M/CA patients with NAFLD
(Aim 3).
Dr. Balakrishnan has the full institutional support of leaders at Baylor College of Medicine and its vibrant and
nurturing research environment. The training plan and research strategy in this K23 application will afford Dr.
Balakrishnan the time, mentorship, and foundational data necessary to successfully transition into an
independently funded investigator."
10881994,"Small molecule ligands that activate the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (NR4A2) hold promise as neuroprotective therapeutic agents or adjuvants to aging-associated neurodegenerative and dementia disorders characterized by a loss of neuron function including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nurr1 activating ligands show functional efficacy in animal models of AD and PD. However, although nuclear receptors are considered to be ligand-dependent transcription factors, Nurr1 is thought to function independent of binding an endogenous ligand that is produced and present in cells. Several synthetic ligands that activate Nurr1 transcription have been reported, but most have not been validated to directly bind Nurr1 and their mechanism of action remains unknown, which has stunted efforts to optimize Nurr1 ligands for AD and PD. Furthermore, Nurr1 regulates transcription as a monomer and as a Nurr1-RXR heterodimer. Synthetic RXR ligands that activate transcription of Nurr1-RXR heterodimers also display functional efficacy in animal models of AD and PD. However, it remains poorly understood how RXR and RXR-binding ligands impact the function of Nurr1-RXR on the structural level. In this project, we will address these knowledge gaps using mechanistic studies to deï¬ne how small molecule ligands impact Nurr1 and Nurr1-RXR activation on the molecular, structural, and cellular levels using NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry coupled to hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX-MS) and chemical crosslinking (XL-MS) and small angle X-ray scattering along with biochemical and cellular functional assays. These data will inform the design of new and improved Nurr1 activating ligands to determine if direct targeting of Nurr1 or indirect targeting via RXR is a viable option for AD and PD treatment"

Molecular mechanisms of nucleic acid recognition and maintenance in meiosis and innate immunity
 I am a biochemist and structural biologist with a strong interest in the molecular mechanisms of genome
maintenance. Since starting my own laboratory in 2011, I have made major contributions in the areas of
chromosome organization and recombination in eukaryotic meiosis, in particular defining the molecular
architecture and assembly mechanisms of the meiotic chromosome axis. My laboratory also determined the
structure and mechanism of TRIP13, an ATPase regulator of HORMA domain signaling proteins in mitosis,
meiosis, and DNA repair. As an Associate Professor and Vice Chair of the UC San Diego Biomedical Sciences
graduate program, I contribute significantly to graduate teaching and advising. I am also active in the broader
scientific community, having participated in grant review for NIH, graduate fellowship review for NSF, and
having served on an NIH Center for Scientific Review workgroup in 2019-2020.
 My laboratory's work over the next five years will focus on a diverse but conceptually related set of
questions in genome maintenance and protein-nucleic acid recognition. Our primary interest is in meiosis, the
specialized two-stage cell division program that gives rise to haploid gametes and is crucial for sexual
reproduction in eukaryotes. Building off our work defining the architecture of the chromosome axis, we will
determine how the axis interacts with and controls the activity of DNA-binding cohesin complexes, and how the
axis recruits and controls recombination proteins to drive the formation of inter-homolog crossovers. Next, we
are pursuing collaborative projects to understand the structural basis for sequence- and structure-specific RNA
recognition in two contexts. With Gene Yeo (UCSD), we are developing a new generation of programmable
sequence-specific RNA binding proteins to target and degrade disease-associated mRNAs in diverse diseases
from cancer to neurodegeneration. With Matt Daugherty (UCSD), we are determining how IFIT proteins in the
mammalian innate immune system cooperate to specifically recognize viral RNAs and inhibit their translation.
Finally, my laboratory has begun a new effort aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms of novel
bacterial defense systems in which canonical genome-maintenance machines have adapted to new roles. In
our first work in this area, we have found that the condensin/cohesin-like MksBEFG system protects its
bacterial hosts from plasmid transformation by specifically recognizing and cleaving closed-circular DNA.
 I am fascinated by molecular machines, particularly those that maintain genome integrity in the face of
constant internal and external assault. My research program is aimed at understanding the molecular basis for
genome maintenance in diverse contexts, and in exploring how the proteins responsible for genome
maintenance have adapted to new roles throughout evolution."

There is increasing evidence for a profound and persistent impact of childhood stress and trauma on adverse
behavioral and physical health outcomes across the lifespan. However, progress toward elucidating
mechanisms of risk and novel prevention and intervention efforts to promote resilience is limited by the small
number of investigators trained to conduct translational, developmentally-informed research focused on
childhood stress, trauma, and resilience. The proposed postdoctoral research training in childhood Stress,
Trauma, and Resilience (STAR T32) takes a broad approach to stress, adversity and traumas experienced by
children and families and their impact on biobehavioral mechanisms and health outcomes across development.
The STAR T32 is an intensive research fellowship designed to prepare PhD and MD postdoctoral fellows to
conduct cutting-edge, translational, developmentally-informed research on childhood stress, trauma and
resilience, and would be the only NICHD-funded training program within Brown Medical School. The T32 will
enroll 12 postdoctoral fellows (2-3 per year) for two-year terms over the five-year award. Fellows will have a
PhD in a behavioral health-related field (psychology, public health/epidemiology, neuroscience) or an MD in a
related specialty (psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency medicine). The program embraces an apprenticeship
model where fellows work closely with one of a broad base of exceptional faculty mentors conducting
innovative, NIH-funded, translational research in STAR-related areas often involving diverse, underserved and
disadvantaged populations. Mentors include PhDs and MDs with a breadth of research interests and
transdisciplinary expertise from psychology and psychiatry to public health, pediatrics and emergency
medicine. Fellows will also obtain focused didactic training covering four critical STAR domains: (a) exposures
and trauma, (b) pathways and mechanisms, (c) health behaviors and outcomes, and (d) interventions and
community partnerships to promote resilience. They will also obtain rigorous foundational training in research
design and statistics, grant-writing, responsible conduct of research, professional development, and cutting-
edge methodological approaches. The program leverages a unique and long-standing training infrastructure
and culture of collaboration within The Miriam Hospital and the Brown Department of Psychiatry and Human
Behavior, allowing for a large base of trainee colleagues, faculty experts, didactics and support. More than
90% of past fellows with STAR mentors have gone on to successful, research-intensive careers, with
numerous publications obtained during postdoctoral fellowship. The T32 will also enhance and leverage
Brownâs track record of recruitment of highly accomplished trainee candidates, with plans in place for focused
recruitment of racially/ethnically and socio-economically diverse fellows. The STAR T32 fits with the mission of
the NICHD Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch, including a focus on collaborative and translational
research to promote discoveries, and preventing, treating, and reducing all forms of childhood trauma."
10833474,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Stress profoundly impacts mental health via impaired cognitive function and increased risk of neuropsychiatric
disorders, resulting in loss of lives, tremendous healthcare costs and reduced economic productivity. Central to
the mechanism of stress-induced cognitive impairment is loss of excitatory synapses and consequently,
disrupted connectivity of key brain areas, including those involved in decision-making. Decisions rely on this
connectivity to combine sensory clues with internal factors like attention, memories and outcome predictions. In
the neocortex, sensory information is provided by bottom-up inputs while internal factors are conveyed via top-
down systems. The capacity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to integrate these various information
streams is fundamental to decision-making. There is emerging evidence from human studies that the parietal
circuit is affected by chronic stress. Yet, there is a critical gap in our knowledge regarding the mechanistic
role the PPC circuit may play in mediating the link between stress and impaired decision-making.
Our preliminary findings indicate that repeated exposure to multiple concurrent stressors (combining physical,
visual and auditory stresses, RMS for short) destroys excitatory synapses in the PPC. Specifically, synaptic
inputs corresponding to the sensory modalities (visual and auditory) conveying the stress are lost while top-
down inputs from frontal brain regions are preserved. These findings motivate our central hypothesis that
stress impedes decision-making by disrupting the integration of sensory and top-down information
streams in the PPC circuit. We will test this hypothesis at the behavioral, circuit and synaptic level. First,
utilizing quantitative behavioral analysis, we will determine which aspects of decision-making are affected by
RMS. We will use chemogenetic circuit manipulation (DREADDs) to link our behavioral findings to sensory and
top-down inputs of the PPC. Next, we will use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and signal detection theory
to directly test the effect of RMS on information transfer between cortical regions. Finally, we will use dual-color
optogenetics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices to determine the effect of RMS on the
integration of sensory and top-down synaptic inputs in PPC neurons. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will establish an important mechanistic link between the PPC circuit and stress-induced deficits in
decision-making. The generated insights will pave the way towards identifying novel targets for prevention and
intervention strategies to address stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders."

The rapid rise in prenatal exposure to prescription and other opioids over the last decade mirrors dramatic trends
in opioid use across the general population of the US. In some states nearly one in four pregnancies are exposed
to prescription opioids; 60-80% of affected pregnancies are Medicaid-covered. Moreover, the rise in maternal
opioid use disorder (OUD), prenatal opioid exposure, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) appears to be
driving a substantial increase child protective services (CPS) involvement. However, the impact of prenatal opioid
exposure on pregnancy and child outcomes, independent of co-occurring factors, remains unclear. To address
this gap, we have assembled a multi-source longitudinal administrative birth cohort that links data for all ~800,000
live births across Wisconsin, including ~350,000 Medicaid-covered births, from 2007 to 2018. By linking data at
the individual-level, and updating each source of data annually, we can identify and track subsequent births
(siblings) and follow a growing cohort of mothers and their children as their lives unfold over more than a decade.
Our unique data support multilevel examination of individual factors, and the influence of health care and
community characteristics, that is needed to better understand and address the effects of the opioid epidemic
on women and their children. We will use regression-based and quasi-experimental methods, and geospatially
informed analyses, to examine outcomes and factors which may influence outcomes. Our specific aims are: 1)
Estimate the bounded annual prevalence of prenatal opioid exposure, including OUD and infant NAS, among all
Medicaid-covered births in Wisconsin from 2007-2018, and describe the characteristics of affected women,
families, and their communities, and changes therein over time; 2) Examine associations of prenatal opioid
exposure, including OUD and NAS, with behaviors and outcomes including a) adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes; b) child maltreatment reports, substantiated reports, and foster care entries; and c) reproductive,
health, social, educational, and economic outcomes for mothers and children, spanning the prenatal period
through the first 8 years of the childâs life; 3) Investigate individual and community-level factors associated with
maternal participation in addiction treatment during the prenatal and postpartum periods, including type(s) of
treatment and treatment retention; and 4) Estimate plausibly causal effects of addiction treatment participation
on maternal and child wellbeing spanning the childâs birth through age 8 using a quasi-experimental design. This
research addresses the HHS 5-Point Strategy to Combat the Opioid Crisis, with a call for Better Data and
Better Research, and complements the research into the biological pathways and treatment strategies enabled

10834095,"Parkinsonâs Disease (PD) results from multiple underlying pathologies, including accumulation of a-synuclein-
containing Lewy bodies, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and perturbation of other neurotransmitter pathways.
While increasing dopamine production using the precursor L-DOAP seems effective at reducing PD symptoms
at first, the continuous decline in the number of dopaminergic neurons as PD progresses reduces the
effectiveness of L-DOPA, and additional therapy to control the PD's symptoms becomes necessary. The lack of
disease-modifying drugs that target PD's underlying pathologies and stop its progression represents a significant
gap in our knowledge and unmet clinical need. Therefore, this application aims to initiate early step experiments
in a continuum of research that is likely to lead to the development of clinically relevant positive allosteric
modulators (PAMs) of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) which are known to have neuroprotective, anti-
inflammatory, and precognitive properties and thus hold promise for the development of drugs with disease-
modifying properties for PD.
In this proposal, we are taking advantage of a lead pharmacophore, CMPI, that we have identified as an
(Î±4)3(Î²2)2 nAChR-selective PAM and its analogs to develop selective nAChR PAMs and to provide proof-of-
concept evidence of their in vivo efficacy against PD. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Identification of
CMPI analogs with high potency, efficacy, and selectivity as (Î±4)3(Î²2)2 nAChR PAMs; 2A) Optimization of a
zebrafish model for in vivo Parkinsonâs disease drug screening; and 2B) Assessment of nAChR PAMs effect on
behavioral, anatomical, and molecular measures of PD progression.
Upon accomplishing these specific aims, we expect that CMPI analogs that bind with high affinity and selectivity
to and potentiate agonist-induced responses of (Î±4)3(Î²2)2 nAChR will be identified. The anticipated results will
also provide in vivo evidence to support the pharmacological merit of Î±4Î²2 nAChR PAMs as a novel strategy to
slow the progression of motor and cognitive decline associated with PD. The proposed research project will also
optimize conditions for a reliable zebrafish PD-like phenotype animal model with measurable behavioral,
anatomical, and biological readouts suitable for high throughput screening of novel therapeutic compounds for
PD. This model will help reduce the time and cost of selecting lead compounds for future animal and human
studies and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of motor symptoms and cognitive
decline associated with Parkinsonâs disease. Once such drugs become clinically relevant, progress will have
been made toward effective PD treatment and advancing the National Institutes of Health mission."

Limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency is a blinding disease that accounts for an estimated 15-20% of corneal
blindness worldwide. LSC deficiency is caused by excessive loss of LSC, a population of pluripotent cells that
regenerate the transparent corneal epithelium. Loss of LSC due to chemical injuries and autoimmune disease
results in corneal conjunctivalization, erosions, and melting. Treatment options are limited; however, cultured
limbal epithelial cell transplantation (CLET) is a promising emerging therapy. In CLET ex vivo expanded limbal
stem/progenitor cells (LSPC) are transplanted onto diseased eyes to replace the native LSC and regenerate the
corneal epithelium. Short-term success has been reported with CLET; however, long-term outcomes have been
limited by loss of transplanted LSPC and recurrence of LSC deficiency over time. One reason for this is the lack
of a supportive niche. Under physiological conditions, the microenvironment of the limbus, known as the limbal
niche, sustains the pluripotency and proliferative potential of native LSC. However, in LSC deficiency, the limbal
niche is often damaged. Identification of synthetic and biological substrates that can function as niche substitutes
to support transplanted LSPC remains an ongoing challenge and an unaddressed barrier to long-term success
in regenerative therapies for the ocular surface. Although human amniotic membrane (HAM) is the primary
substrate used for CLET, it is limited as a long-term niche substitute by its opacity, rapid degradation, and lack
of limbus-specific proteins. In contrast Descemetâs Membrane (DM), is a basement membrane on the posterior
surface of the cornea is clear and resistant to collagenase digestion. Furthermore, the anterior fetal banded layer
of DM is rich in limbus-specific basement membrane proteins, including collagen IV Î±1, Î±2 subtypes, vitronectin,
and BM40/SPARC. The goal of this study is to compare the stemness and survival of donor and iPSC-derived
LSPC on DM vs HAM. In aim 1, we will perform in vitro phenotypic and functional comparisons of LSPC cultured
on DM vs HAM using biomarker expression and an organ culture model of LSC deficiency. In aim 2, we will
perform an in vivo comparison of cultured LSPC on DM vs HAM using a mouse model of LSC deficiency. In aim
3, we will compare biomarker expression and capacity to regenerate corneal epithelium in iPSC-derived LSPC
cultured on DM vs HAM. This project has the potential to inform our choice of substrate in CLET and improve
our therapies for LSC deficiency. The training plan will provide the applicant with technical competencies in the
characterization of LSPC, use of animal models of LSC deficiency, and manipulation of iPSC; as well as
professional skills in oral and written communication to facilitate development as an independent investigator.
Training will take place in University of Minnesotaâs (UMN) highly collaborative and well-resourced research
environment. The applicant will be mentored by Dr. Deborah Ferrington, a leader in applications of iPSC
technology in age-related macular degeneration, Dr. Ali Djalilian, a pioneer in therapeutic interventions for limbal

 Cells need to sense the nutrient availability to adjust their survival strategy. In eukaryotic cells, the
mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation.
Upon activation in a nutrient-rich environment, mTORC1 triggers anabolic reactions and inhibits catabolism.
Amino acid signals are transmitted to mTORC1 through a series of protein complexes that ultimately converge
on the Rag GTPases, a heterodimeric GTPase that recruits mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface. However, the
molecular mechanisms of how these protein complexes dynamically transmit the amino acid signal are still
elusive. In this proposal, we aim to develop biophysical tools to study the dynamics of the amino acid sensing
process. Specifically, we aim to use single molecule FRET to study the conformational dynamics of the Rag
GTPase heterodimer and its regulators (Project 1). Further, we plan to reconstitute an in vitro system to
recapitulate Rag-dependent amino acid sensing on a membrane surface (Project 2), and use cryo-electron
tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the signaling complexes in their native environment (Project 3). The
outcomes will yield novel insights into this important biological process and provide guidance to the

Despite recent advances in uncovering the role of circadian clocks in cardiometabolic disease and type-
2 diabetes, a gap remains in our understanding of how nutrient and circadian transcriptional regulators
coordinate responses to environmental stimuli across the 24-hour cycle in a tissue-specific manner.
Our recently published studies uncovered novel reciprocal interactions between the skeletal muscle
circadian clock and the nutrient-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription pathway.
Specifically, our work demonstrated that (i) circadian transcription factors regulate hypoxic HIF1Î±
activation and anaerobic glycolysis in muscle myotubes, (ii) the muscle circadian clock regulates
genome-wide hypoxic transcription, and (iii) the circadian clock establishes a time-of-day dependent
response to exercise-induced HIF activation in skeletal muscle. Collectively, these studies reveal
coupling of the hypoxia-inducible factor and circadian pathways in order to produce rhythmic adaptation
to hypoxic stress. However, it is still unclear how this coupling acts to regulate transcription and
metabolic flux, and whether in vivo circadian disruption impairs HIF-dependent metabolic
functions, such as glucose disposal in muscle in the context of exercise and diet-induced
obesity. Our present proposed studies will utilize an array of innovative models and techniques to build
upon our current findings to understand the interplay between hypoxic and circadian transcriptional
pathways at the genomic, nutrient-signaling, and whole-animal physiological levels. Overall, these
studies will advance our understanding of the role of circadian clocks in muscle metabolic
function and disease."

The neocortex is the most complex cellular system in the natural world, the seat of motor, sensory and

developing neocortex. These studies will use emerging evidence and new tools to elucidate how neural

This project aims to investigate the factors involved in lung epithelial regeneration following bacterial
pneumonia. The regeneration process relies on the activity of stem/progenitor cells, particularly lung alveolar
epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, which differentiate into alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells. However, defects in
this differentiation process occur in certain populations, such as the elderly and those with chronic respiratory
diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing AT2 cell activity is crucial for developing
effective therapeutic approaches. This project is based on the hypothesis that calcium-dependent metabolic
changes drive epigenetic reprogramming, promoting the gene program required for AT2-to-AT1 cell
differentiation. Specifically, the lysine trimethylation status of histone H3, controlled by Jumonji C (JmjC)
domain-containing histone lysine demethylases (JMJDs), plays a key role in regulating gene expression and
cellular differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of JMJDs increased levels of trimethylated histone lysine
marks and decreased AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation, suggesting the necessity of histone lysine demethylation
for AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation. The activity of JMJDs is regulated by the succinate/Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG)
ratio, which is influenced by mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ (mCa2+) levels. MICU1, a regulatory subunit of the
mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter channel, controls mCa2+ uptake from the cytoplasm into mitochondria and affects
the succinate/Î±KG ratio. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that Micu1 deletion in AT2 cells decreased
glutaminolysis feeding into the TCA cycle, increased succinate/Î±KG ratio and levels of histone lysine
trimethylation marks. Additionally, supplementation with succinate increased histone lysine trimethylation
marks and inhibited AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation. Based on these findings, we propose that MICU1-
dependent mCa2+ uptake regulates AT2 cell differentiation capacity by controlling the succinate/Î±KG ratio. This
reinforcement of Î±KG-dependent JMJD activity promotes the gene program required for AT2-to-AT1 cell
differentiation. This project has three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate how the succinate/Î±KG ratio
connects MICU1-dependent mCa2+ uptake to AT1 cell fate during AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation. Aim 2 will
determine the mechanistic role of glutaminolysis in AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation and lung epithelial repair. In
aim 3, we will determine whether histone lysine trimethylation marks, regulated by MICU1-dependent mCa2+
uptake, control the gene program necessary for AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation. Through unique mutant mouse
models and clinically-relevant model systems, this project will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms
underlying lung epithelial regeneration and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
bacterial pneumonia-induced injury."
10853975,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been detected in atherosclerosis, and the extent of EndMT
observed in the human plaques strongly correlates with the severity of the disease, implying clinical relevance
of EndMT in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Both disturbed blood flow (d-flow) and interleukin-1 signaling
(IL-1) have been implicated in EndMT formation. The signaling pathway that links d-flow and EndMT is still
unclear. Moreover, IL-1 as a therapeutic target has already been tested and the Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory
Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) assessed the therapeutic effect of the anti-IL-1Î² antibody in patients
after myocardial infarction and showed 31% reduction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. However, some
of those patients developed immunosuppressive off-target effects. In addition, there is no clear principal cell type
in human severe atherosclerosis responsible for IL-1 signaling. Our recently published work has demonstrated
that d-flow induces activation of interleukin-1 receptor signaling kinase (IRAK1) within endothelial cells (ECs),
with an increase in p-IRAK1 levels in human and mouse atherosclerosis. IRAK1 is co-expressed with EndMT in
severe atherosclerosis, and deletion of IRAK1 decreases EndMT in vitro, identifying a novel role for IRAK1 as a
downstream effector in d-flow-induced EndMT. Our central hypothesis is that IRAK1 activation mediates d-
flow-induced EndMT and selective inhibition of IRAK1 will allow efficient inhibition of atherosclerosis without
promoting significant immunosuppression. Aim 1 Determine the mechanistic role of IRAK1 activation in
oscillatory flow-induced EndMT. Our preliminary data supports IRAK1 activation by d-flow and that mediates
EndMT formation. Aim 1.1, utilizing CRISPR Cas-9 KO selective deletion and re-expressing vectors, we will test
the role of IRAK1 in oscillatory flow-induced EndMT. In Aim 1.2, we will evaluate the activating roles of IRAK1
domains by transiently transfecting IRAK1 truncated mutants into IRAK1-depleted and overexpressed ECs and
we will measure Phospho-IRAK1 and EndMT after oscillatory flow. In Aim 1.3, we will assess the functional role
of IRAK1 endogenous interactions by utilizing immunoprecipitations, gene silencing, and mass spectrometry.
Aim 2 will determine if selective inhibition of IRAK1 in d-flow-induced EndMT prevents atherosclerosis
progression. We will use Cre-lox endothelial-specific lineage tracing and novel endothelial-specific IRAK1
knockout mice and IRAK1 selective inhibitor to provide the first assessment of IRAK1 inhibition on EndMT
formation in vivo. Fibrous cap thickness, plaque lesion size, composition, and EndMT will be assessed in both
partial carotid ligation model of d-flow (Aim2.1) and diet-induced atherosclerosis (Aim2.2). FACS analysis of
blood and plaques will be done to assess total and differential leukocytes and proinflammatory cytokines. These

 This 5-year K08 training program is designed to facilitate my (Dr. Lin Shen) career development in
preparation of my independent research career as a physician-scientist. My long-term goal is to study the
pathogenesis and, potentially, the therapy of autoimmune diseases. This proposal focuses on how inhibitory
pathways restrain abnormal TCR signaling strength to achieve peripheral tolerance. Central guidance and the
training environment will be provided by my primary mentor, Dr. Arthur Weiss, an expert in TCR signaling.
Further expertise will be provided by a strong advisory panel of experts in lymphocyte signaling, immune
tolerance, autoimmunity and transcriptomic profiling. A training plan with experimental research, didactics, and
seminars has been developed to advance me towards my career goals. The extensive resources and support
at the UCSF will facilitate my pathway to independence and my long-term goals.
 Dysregulation of TCR signaling has long been recognized to play important roles in the pathogenesis of
autoimmune diseases. However, how inhibitory pathways are engaged by enhanced TCR signaling strength to
regulate peripheral tolerance and prevent autoimmunity remains incompletely understood. The cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase ZAP70 plays a requisite role in TCR signaling. Two ZAP70 hypermorphic mutants, the stronger
W131A and the weaker R360P, interfere with autoinhibition and have varying effects on TCR signaling. As a
consequence of enhanced basal signaling, OTII-TCR transgenic W131A T cells exhibit marked upregulation of
inhibitory receptors and acquisition of an anergic phenotype. The ZAP70 R360P mouse mutant that I
generated derives from a familial severe autoimmune syndrome. R360P mice failed to develop overt
autoimmune disease on a C57BL/6 background but exhibited expansion of regulatory and anergic T cells.
Strikingly, OTI-TCR transgenic R360P T cells showed enhanced responses to weak and self-peptides.
Introducing deficiency in Cbl-b, a negative regulator for TCR signaling, resulted in enhanced R360P-OTI T cell
responses to a weak agonist peptide and reversed functional anergy in W131A-OTII T cells. Therefore, I
hypothesize that increased TCR signaling strength renders T cells subject to greater control by inhibitory
pathways but may confer upon them greater sensitivity to disruption of these inhibitory pathways. In this
proposal, I will take advantage of the R360P and W131A mouse models to study how enhanced TCR signaling
strength and inhibitory pathways are coupled together to either maintain or subvert peripheral tolerance. In Aim
1, using a range of biochemical techniques and transcriptomic profiling, I will dissect how TCR signaling
strength is dynamically coupled to inhibitory programs. In Aim 2, I will study whether augmented TCR signaling
strength promotes sensitivity to the disruption of negative regulatory pathways. This study will provide new
mechanistic insights into how these opposing signaling pathways integrate to impact T cell antigen sensitivity
and to regulate peripheral tolerance and the quality of immune responsiveness."

While properly regulated levels of c-Myc are essential for normal cell growth and proliferation, aberrant
overexpression and activation of c-Myc contribute to most human cancers. Thus, c-Myc level and activity must
be tightly regulated during normal cell homeostasis. The rapid turnover of c-Myc is controlled by ubiquitin-
dependent proteolysis. c-Myc can be ubiquitinated by the Threonine 58 phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitin
ligase (E3) complex SCFFbw7 as well as various other ubiquitin E3s. Conversely, c-Myc ubiquitination can be
reversed by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), including USP28, USP36 and USP37. Interestingly,
c-Myc can also be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). Yet the function of c-Myc SUMOylation
is still unclear and how c-Myc is affected by deSUMOylation is unknown. We recently identified the SUMO
protease SENP1 as a novel c-Myc deSUMOylating enzyme. SENP1 directly binds to and deSUMOylates c-
Myc in cells and in vitro. Overexpression of wild-type (wt) SENP1, but not its catalytic-inactive mutant (C603S),
stabilizes c-Myc and enhances c-Myc transactivation activity. Consistently, knockdown of SENP1 reduces c-
Myc levels and suppresses cell proliferation. We further show that c-Myc can be co-modified by ubiquitin and
SUMO and SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation reduces c-Myc ubiquitination, suggesting that SUMOylation
promotes c-Myc degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In addition, SENP1 deSUMOylates
USP28 whereas USP28 stabilizes SENP1 and Fbw7 reduces SENP1 levels. Thus, c-Myc levels and activity
may be dynamically controlled by complex ubiquitination-SUMOylation crosstalk. SENP1 is frequently
overexpressed, correlating with the high expression of c-Myc and poor patient survival, in human breast
cancers. Together, these results lead to a novel hypothesis that SENP1 functions as a crucial regulator of c-
Myc by deSUMOylating c-Myc. To gain further insight into the role of SENP1 in regulating c-Myc protein
stability, activity and oncogenicity, we will investigate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of the
regulation of c-Myc by SENP1 in Aim 1, including how SENP1 contributes to c-Myc stabilization, how c-Myc is
co-modified by SUMO and ubiquitin, and how it interplays with Fbw7 and USP28 to dynamically control c-Myc
turnover. We will elucidate the role of SENP1 in c-Myc-mediated gene regulation in Aim 2 by analyzing
whether SENP1 regulates c-Myc binding and turnover at target gene promoters, whether it regulates specific c-
Myc target gene programs in response to growth signals, and whether SENP1 regulates the spatial localization
of c-Myc in the nucleus. In Aim 3, we will test whether SENP1 potentiates c-Myc-driven transformation and
mammary tumorigenesis, whether inhibiting SENP1 suppresses c-Myc-driven tumorigenesis in vivo, and
whether SENP1 inhibition is efficacious in breast cancer. Achieving these goals will provide critical insight into
how c-Myc is properly regulated by dynamic SUMO modifications, how deregulation of this contributes to
tumorigenesis, and whether SENP1 is a promising therapeutic target in human cancers."

The proposed program, âInterdisciplinary Research Training in Public Health and Agingâ
seeks a five-year continuation of the current award, which was funded originally in 2008,
and renewed in April 2014. The program will focus specifically on training opportunities in
the social and behavioral determinants of adverse health outcomes in older age, and their
mediation through or interaction with the biological mechanisms that are commonly thought
to be associated with aging-related changes in health. The rational for this focus lies in the
potential of this research to identify new opportunities for the prevention, management and
treatment of aging-related chronic health conditions and their functional consequences. The
program defines its disciplinary foundation in social epidemiology, while emphasizing
collaboration with scholarly activity from other disciplinary perspectives, including other
public health sciences, social sciences, biological sciences and medical sciences.
This application requests funds to support and train a total of 8 pre-doctoral trainees, with 2
new trainees being recruited each of the first 4 years of the program. The program will be
located in the Department of Epidemiology of the University of Michigan School of Public
Health. The Department of Epidemiology provides an exceptionally rich intellectual
environment for an inter-disciplinary training program in public health and aging, due to the
interconnections of its faculty with a large number of Research Institutes and Centers at the
University of Michigan. The training program includes 15 mentors with well-established
research and training records encompassing a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The
training program consists of a structured program of teaching and mentoring with the
following inter-related components: 1) mentored research activity; 2) course work in the
epidemiology of aging and related subject matters, and participation in public health and
aging research seminars; and 3) participation in other training and enrichment opportunities
available at the University of Michigan."
10843103,"The goal of this project is to delineate the mechanism underlying a novel regulation of HIV-1 release by CCL2
and to highlight CCR2 as a new HIV-1 drug target. Our recent work has shown that extracellular CCL2 modulates
virus release efficiency by mobilizing ALIX, an ESCRT III adapter protein, from F-actin to the cytosol making it
accessible to HIV-1 Gag, which in turn helps recruit ESCRT III complex to catalyze membrane scission at virus
bud neck. CCL2 depletion, on the other hand, lead to a dramatic sequestration of ALIX to F-actin and an inhibition
of virus production suggesting that CCL2 signaling must occur for virus production. CCL2-mediated
enhancement in virus release is only observed in viruses with late motif LYPX, e.g., HIV-1 clade B (HIV-1B).
Those lacking LYPX, e.g., HIV-1 clade C (HIV-1C), are unaffected. In this proposal, we will build upon these
exciting observations through investigations along the following three specific aims. Aim 1: To understand the
mechanism underlying CCL2-mediated ALIX mobilization, we will test the hypothesis that CCL2 signaling is
obligatory for ALIX-mediated HIV-1 release. We will employ CCR2 and CCL2 single and double knockout HeLa
cells to examine whether HIV-1 production and ALIX mobilization from F-actin to cytosol can occur in the absence
of CCL2-signaling. We will delineate downstream events of CCL2 signaling, in which we will test the hypothesis
that CCL2 signaling leads to ALIX phosphorylation, triggering ALIX mobilization from F-actin. It is known that
serine phosphorylation converts a closed form of ALIX to an open conformation that can now bind to retroviral
Gag protein and to CHMP4b, an ESCRT III protein. Separately, tyrosine phosphorylation of ALIX by Src is
reported to mobilize ALIX from cytoskeleton to cytosol. As Src is downstream of CCL2 signaling pathway and
the Src phosphorylation site on ALIX participates in the formation of ALIX closed form, we will test whether Src
is a key mediator in CCL2 signaling that leads to an open conformation. We will test the effect of phosphorylation
at both the tyrosine and serine residues implicated in ALIX mobilization by CCL2. We will study other post-
translational modifications on ALIX protein. Aim 2: We will examine the effect of CCR2bV64I polymorphism on
HIV replication. CCR2bV64I polymorphism is known to delay AIDS disease progression. Using PBMCs and
macrophages from HIV-negative individuals with the genotypes, CCR2bV64/V64, CCR2bV64/64I or CCR2b64I/64I, we
will test the hypothesis that V64I polymorphism abrogates CCL2-CCR2 signaling, inhibiting CCL2-binding or
internalization and ALIX mobilization from F-actin, decreasing the ability of HIV-1B to respond to CCL2 and
reducing virus production. Our preliminary data in HeLa cells already show that V64I abrogates the ability of HIV-
1B to respond to CCL2 and reduces the HIV-1B production levels. Aim 3: We will examine the effect of
CCL2-2518G polymorphism, which is known to increase plasma CCL2 and the risk of HIV acquisition, on CCL2
signaling and HIV fitness. Employing HIV-susceptible cells from human volunteers with CCL2-2518/AA,
CCL2-2518G/A and CCL2-2518G/G genotypes, we will test whether -2518G polymorphism leads to increased CCL2
expression, ALIX mobilization rates and virus fitness."

Abstract:
The long-term goal of this research program is to understand and identify mechanosensitive mechanisms that
regulate cell-to-cell coordination of movements during normal tissue morphogenesis and patterning. Of
particular interest, is the role that mechanosensitive and stretch activated proteins play in the transfer of
electrical currents, ions, and second messengers between cells, as these functions are known to be critical for
coordination of cellular communication within a complex tissue environment. For instance, our sense of touch,
regulation of blood pressure, osmotic regulation, and balance are all regulated by mechanosensitive channels
throughout the body. The importance of mechanosensitive channels is underscored by the association of many
disease states with compromised mechanosensation, including atrial fibrillation, muscular degeneration,
arrhythmias, polycystic kidney disease, and numerous neural diseases. Despite this, a relatively small amount
is known at the level of normal, healthy individual cells about how mechanosensitive channels go from sensing
force to eliciting changes in cellular signaling and/or function. Our interest therefore lies in understanding how
cells assimilate âdataâ from mechanosensitive channels to alter intra- and inter- cellular communication and
coordinate individual cellular movements within tissues. To carry out this work, we plan to utilize our historic
strengths in zebrafish development and tissue patterning along with sophisticated 3-dimensional in vitro tissue
modeling assays to understand: 1) how mechanosensation affects intracellular signaling, particularly though
the activation of transcriptional networks and altered gene expression, and 2) how mechanosensation affects
intercellular signaling activities to alter patterning of tissues. We will target and utilize highly mechanosensitive
cells, such as astrocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and epidermal cells, for our studies to
understand both generalizable and cell type specific roles of mechanosensation in regulating gene expression,
cellular motility, and cell-to-cell communication. These studies will provide fundamental data and cell biological

10843214,"Project Summary/Abstract
Active motility by apicomplexan parasites controls host cell invasion and egress, steps that are critical to the
intracellular cycle of infection. These processes are governed by calcium-regulated secretion of adhesive
proteins from micronemes, together with the concerted action of an actin-myosin motor that lies beneath the
parasite plasma membrane. Prior studies in Toxoplasma gondii have established the importance of calcium-
dependent protein kinases and protein kinase G (PKG) in controlling microneme secretion, motility, egress,
and invasion. This cascade is tightly regulated and recent studies have also shown that the c1 isoform of
protein kinase A (PKAc1) dampens calcium signaling to shut down microneme secretion and impair motility
after invasion is complete. The balance between PKG vs. PKAc1 activities governs the decision to activate
motility and promote egress vs. to remain intracellular. Although the role of PKAc1 in blocking premature
egress is clear, neither its mechanism of regulation nor the targets that it phosphorylates in order to dampen
calcium signaling and block egress have been elucidated. PKA activity is governed by production of cyclic
AMP (cAMP) by adenylate cyclases (ACs) and its consumption by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In preliminary
studies, we have identified candidate ACs that control cAMP levels to regulate PKA. In the proposed studies,
we will explore their functions to define how they temporally and spatially regulate PKA activity. We have also
used a protein degradation approach to create conditional knockdowns of PKA isoforms and verify that PKAc1
controls egress in type II parasites. We will use the tightly regulated conditional knockdown approach to
investigate downstream targets of PKAc1 that mediate the egress block using a combination of
phosphoproteomic studies to identify substrates and downstream validation studies to test their roles in
regulating egress. We will validate the role of specific phosphorylation sites in PKAc1 targets in suppressing
calcium signaling, motility, and egress. Collectively, the proposed studies will elucidate the molecular pathway
by which PKAc1 down regulates calcium levels, microneme secretion, and motility to prevent egress, thus
counterbalancing the activating effects of PKG. Elucidating the molecular regulation of the PKG/PKA kinases in
T. gondii will foster future studies to design inhibitors that block these pathways, thus providing new avenues
for development of therapeutics."

 Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a global cause of pediatric gastroenteritis, and can cause disseminated
infection in immunocompromised hosts. Seroprevalence studies indicate almost universal HAstV infection during
childhood. Despite their clinical importance, HAstVs are highly understudied. Little is known about the host
factors needed for infection or their mechanisms of viral entry into cells, and no proteinaceous viral receptor has
been identified to date. Beyond providing critical insights into virus-host interactions, identification of host proteins
sufficient and/or necessary for HAstV infection is key for creating small animal models permissive to infection
and to revealing antiviral strategies to combat infection.
 Leveraging both genome-wide knock-out CRISPR and surfaceome-specific CRISPR activation
screening, novel proteinaceous host receptors for HAstV were identified. These factors, neonatal Fc receptor
(FcRn) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), have also been implicated in viral infection for echovirus and
coronavirus infection respectively. Both were confirmed as necessary for in vitro HAstV infection of Caco2 cells
and as sufficient to permit HAstV infection of normally non-permissive human cells when overexpressed.
Additionally, use of biolayer interferometry confirmed direct physical interactions between both FcRn and DPP4
with the HAstV capsid. These preliminary data serve as the critical foundation for the extensive structural and
functional studies proposed here. In Aim 1, the specific protein domains and amino acid residues of FcRn and
DPP4 that functionally interact with the HAstV capsid will be identified, as will the viral capsid residues critical for
binding these host factors. Cryogenic electron microscopy will be leveraged to reveal how binding to these factors
affects the HAstV virion. These genetic and biophysical analyses will provide much-needed insight into HAstV
entry biology and form the basis of future pharmacological screens for identification of entry inhibitors. In Aim 2,
permissive human intestinal enteroid cultures will be used to determine the necessity of identified entry factors
for ex vivo HAstV infection. Blocking of infection via addition of soluble entry factors, anti-factor antibodies,
inhibitors, and CRISPR-mediated disruption of factors in these cultures will be performed. Additionally, existing
mouse models expressing human FcRn and DPP4 will be used to develop mice permissive to HAstV infection
and to evaluate whether these factors are critical for murine astrovirus infection. These studies will reveal the
species-specificity of receptor use and provide powerful new tools for study of HAstV pathogenesis and immune
response as well as for preclinical testing of vaccines and antivirals.
 The use of numerous orthogonal approaches, including mechanistic studies of critical receptor domains,
state-of-the-art structural techniques, and physiologically-relevant models, will yield a comprehensive picture of
how these novel entry factors promote HAstV infection."
10854158,"Project Summary/Abstract
Feeding is an essential behavior for animals to obtain nutrients for survival, but the influx of nutrients during
and after feeding must be properly managed to avoid disruption of metabolic homeostasis. Neural circuits in
the brain utilize sensory cues associated with food consumption, such as the taste of food and the amount of
ingested food in the digestive tract, to prime endocrine systems for incoming nutrients and regulate feeding
pace and amount. Although progress has been made in recent years to identify neural populations that
regulate endocrine function and feeding behavior, the complete neural circuits that transform food sensory
signals into endocrine regulation and feeding behavioral control are largely obscure. The long-term goal of the
proposed research is to elucidate the complete neural circuits that carry out such sensory-endocrine/feeding
transformations, and obtain a comprehensive circuit-level understanding of endocrine and feeding regulation
and its function in health and disease. To achieve this goal, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is used as a
model system. Drosophila has long been a valuable model for neural circuit studies, providing insights into
common principles for chemosensory processing and feeding regulation that are shared with mammals. The
recent completion of an electron microscope connectome of the entire Drosophila brain at synaptic resolution
provides an unprecedented opportunity to delineate complete neural circuits linking food sensory detection to
endocrine and feeding control. Guided by our connectomic analyses, this proposal aims to test the central
hypothesis that a subset of serotonergic neurons in the Drosophila brain integrates both external and internal
food sensory signals to regulate endocrine function and the feeding motor program. Aim 1 will use state-of-the-
art optogenetic and functional imaging approaches to test the hypothesis that serotonergic neurons integrate
food-related gustatory and mechanosensory signals from multiple organs, including external and internal
mouthparts and the digestive tract. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that serotonergic neurons activate two
parallel output pathways to (a) regulate endocrine function to promote sugar metabolism and digestive
function, and (b) inhibit the feeding motor program to suppress food intake, using a combination of calcium
imaging, optogenetic, metabolic, and behavioral approaches. These studies will reveal a complete neural
circuit from food sensory inputs to endocrine/motor outputs, and provide mechanistic insights into the sensory
integration of external chemosensation and gut interoception, gut-brain-endocrine interactions, and feeding
behavior regulation. The findings from this research will advance our understanding of how neural circuits
regulate feeding behavior and feeding-related endocrine function, providing a foundation for examining how
compromised function of these circuits may contribute to endocrine dysfunction, eating disorders, and obesity."

Sharks are members of the oldest class of living Vertebrates with adaptive immunity based on immunoglobulin,
T cell receptors, and the major histocompatibility complex. Eight class I lineages have recently been uncovered
by the Flajnik lab, the classical class I (UAA) and seven nonclassical lineages (UBA to UHA). Unexpectedly,
two of these MHC-linked shark nonclassical class I (Class Ib) molecules show striking similarities to the human
nonclassical class I molecules CD1 and HLA-E. Preliminary data on genetics, expression, and sequence
similarity strongly in the Flajnik lab suggest that UFA is the orthologue of CD1. Structural modeling and in silico
biophysical analyses in the Adams lab are consistent with UFAâs clear similarity to CD1, revealing a strongly
hydrophobic binding site. The second shark class Ib molecule, UDA, is predicted to bind peptides like classical
class I, yet it is monomorphic, single-copy, and has properties similar to mammalian HLA-E/Qa-1.
We will biochemically define UFA and UDA ligands and elucidate their structures. We will express and purify
recombinant versions of UDA and UFA for biochemical analysis including ligand elution and preparation of
tetramers to identify the shark cells recognizing these nonclassical class I molecules. Highly purified forms of
recombinant proteins will be used for structural analysis through X-ray crystallography. Using in-house
technologies, we will generate nanobody binding reagents to these proteins for structural analysis and also
complement the antisera and monoclonal antibodies already generated for tissue-expression analysis. By in
situ hybridization and antibody/nanobody staining we will define UDA/UFA cellular expression and examine
their upregulation in cells under stress. UDA and UFA tetramers will reveal which lymphocytes interact with
UDA/UFA and, with single-cell analysis, the adaptive and/or innate receptors that interact with them. We will
perform biochemical analysis of shark primary cells to characterize UDA/UFA biosynthetic pathways.
In this proposal, therefore, we will combine the expertise and experience of the two investigators, Martin
Flajnik, who has studied the genetics, biochemistry, and function of the shark immune system for 35 years and
generally the evolution of adaptive immunity, and Erin Adams, a structural biologist with deep knowledge of the
human class I system and evolutionary biology. In summary, we hypothesize that CD1 and HLA-E analogues
arose at the Big Bang of adaptive immunity 500 million years ago, suggesting that peptide-binding by the
classical class I, lipid-binding by âCD1,â and a peptide-binding by a jack-of-all-trades âHLA-E-likeâ nonclassical
class I were significant features in the earliest adaptive immune system."

Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is most common cancer in children (age 0- 14 years). Despite
improvements in treatment, survivors face a lifelong battle with negative health effects of treatment, making
prevention a priority. The lack of modifiable etiological factors has been a major barrier to prevention, but we
recently made a groundbreaking (albeit preliminary) discovery that neonatal cytomegalovirus (nCMV) infection
is a strong risk factor for childhood ALL (estimated odds ratio = 3.7) in a small study with 268 cases and 270
controls. In the same study, we also found CMV sequences within pre-treatment diagnostic tumor tissue. In
addition, we conducted a population-based study linking medical records and cancer registry data in Sweden,
which revealed a relative risk over 10 for early CMV infection and the childâs hematologic malignancy
diagnosis. We propose here to definitively assess the epidemiology of CMV and ALL including CMVâs impact
on the ALL tumor genome. We hypothesize that nCMV will contribute to ALL incidence and create specific
mutational signatures present in ALL tumor genomes known to be associated with viral and infectious
etiologies. In our first aim, we will better define the role of nCMV infection as an ALL risk factor in a study with
over 3800 cases and 4897 controls, accounting for other risk factors such as birthweight, birth order, mode of
delivery, polygenic risk score for ALL and parental ages neonatal immune phenotype, as well as the role of
maternal CMV infection status during pregnancy. We will also assess whether CMV contributes to the higher
risk of ALL in Latinos compared to other groups. As a second aim, we will test 1,020 children for CMV
involvement at birth and within their matched ALL tumor genomes collected at diagnosis. We will investigate
the presence of the APOBEC and Recombinase Activating Gene (RAG), virally-associated mutational
signatures, within tumors that were nCMV positive compared to those from children negative for the virus. This
research will leverage exceptional resources, including archived newborn blood specimens and population-
based childhood ALL cases and controls, and maternal blood specimens collected during mid-pregnancy. In
addition, the proposed study benefits from a high fraction of Latinos in the study population who carry a
disproportionate burden of childhood ALL, include advanced laboratory techniques to identify neonatal and
maternal CMV infection that have been refined in our laboratory, and will evaluate directly a mutation signature
putatively caused by the virus. CMV is a highly adept immune manipulator. Identification of CMV as an
etiologic agent in childhood ALL could create an unprecedented target for leukemia prevention, either by
vaccination against CMV infection or manipulation of the host response to CMV infection after birth. In either
scenario, this proposal will better characterize the role of CMV in the genesis of childhood ALL and have
profound impact from a prevention perspective. As CMV is also responsible for congenital hearing loss and a
host of other neurological outcomes, our research will impact childhood health apart from leukemia."

Single-cell genomic technology is transforming modern immunology. Single-cell transcriptomic
profiling combined with DNA bar-coding technology is capable of acquiring information on multiple
modalities simultaneously; surface receptor quantitation, paired clonotype identity, and genotype
can now be measured alongside the transcriptome in relatively routine technology. Extending this
rapid technological development in single-cell genomics, it is now possible to probe epitope-
specificity of individual antigen-specific cells in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this
proposal is to apply DNA bar-coding technology to build reagents capable of assessing B and T
cell specificity to HIV epitopes alongside other single-cell cell readouts, and in a high throughput
manner. The development of technology capable of rapid resolution of epitope specific responses
would address several needs in HIV research: (i) it would greatly accelerate the discovery of novel
broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV; (ii) it would allow comprehensively profiling of T cell
HIV epitopes, allowing more rapid identification of epitopes associated with protective immunity;
(iii) it would characterize transcriptional states of HIV-infected cells and accurately assess
differences between productively-infected, latently-infected and uninfected bystander cells. In the
incumbent grant (i.e. prior funding period), we developed novel methodology to obtain paired
clonotype identity and transcriptome data in antigen-specific B cells, including development,
validation and benchmarking of a novel bioinformatics algorithm capable of accurately
reconstructing paired immunoglobulin gene sequences in vaccine-elicited B cells. Here, we
extend our prior work to incorporate additional information: antigen specificity for HIV epitopes.
We will use DNA bar-coding technology to develop reagents capable of resolving epitope-
specificity of HIV-specific B and T cells in a high throughput fashion. Specifically, we will apply
DNA-bar codes to native HIV trimers and gp120 monomers to accelerate identification of B cells
producing neutralizing antibodies. We will also develop DNA bar-coded tetramer-based
technology to massively profile HIV-specific T cell responses epitope resolution. Lastly, we will
build on our ability to simultaneous quantify viral genomes and host cell transcriptome data in
single cells and develop methodology to differentiate the transcriptomes from latently-infected,
productively-infected, and uninfected bystander cells in HIV infection. These technologies would
be broadly applicable to HIV research and would provide high throughput means to identify
correlates of protection in several advanced HIV vaccine platforms."

The structural maintenance of chromosomes (Smc) 5/6 complex plays a critical role in tumor suppression and
the repression of tumor-causing viruses, such as the hepatitis B virus. Smc5/6 exerts these clinical functions by
promoting faithful genome replication, coordinating DNA repair, and silencing extra-chromosomal DNA.
However, there is little understanding of how Smc5/6 operates as a molecular machine, hindering our ability to
intervene in Smc5/6âs health-related functions. Our central hypothesis is that Smc5/6 operates as a dynamic
molecular machine that compacts DNA, intrinsically binds to DNA fork junctions, and co-localizes with replication
factors. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how defects in Smc5/6 promote genome instability
and malignant transformation.
This projectâs immediate objective is to elucidate the biophysical properties of the Smc5/6 complex by utilizing
correlative single-molecule fluorescence and force microscopy, which combines optical tweezers, automated
microfluidics, and multi-color confocal microscopy. In Specific Aim 1, Smc5/6âs DNA compaction abilities will be
assayed on individual DNA tethers. The effect of the subunits of Smc5/6 and ATP will be systematically tested.
The outcome of this work will define the role of each of these components on Smc5/6âs DNA compaction
behavior. In Specific Aim 2, the binding behavior and dynamic movement of fluorescently-labeled Smc5/6 will
be monitored on double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and fork junctions in real time. In Specific Aim 3,
Smc5/6âs interactions with replication factors will be defined by a first-of-its-kind in vitro reconstitution of the
eukaryotic replisome.
Overall, this project will: (1) consolidate our understanding of Smc5/6 at the molecular level; (2) yield important
insights into how eukaryotes maintain genome integrity and suppress tumors; and (3) potentiate new strategies
to modulate Smc5/6âs physiological functions as a tumor suppressor and host restriction factor. Dr. Xiaolan Zhao,
an expert on Smc5/6 biology who has a proven track-record for training successful scientists, and Dr. Shixin Liu,
an expert on single-molecule technology who practices active mentorship, are co-sponsoring this proposal. The
research efforts will take place at the Rockefeller University within the deeply supportive Tri-Institutional MD-
PhD Program. This proposal and fellowship is an important career milestone for dual-degree students seeking

identiï¬cation and inhibition of glycosylation in speciï¬c cells, the mapping of glycosylation-mediated and cell-
type speciï¬c interactions, and monitoring and manipulation of carbohydrate biosynthetic pathways. The
addition of carbohydrates to proteins, or glycosylation, is one of the most common forms of posttranslational
modiï¬cations and is associated with various processes, including protein stability, macromolecular
interactions, and cellular signaling. Unfortunately, the currently available tools for interrogating these functions
fall short, which limits the study of glycosylation to expert labs. We plan to tackle this unmet need using
carbohydrate chemistry, photo-chemistry, and chemical biology in three speciï¬c aims. In Aim 1, we will
build on our development of glycosylation probes and inhibitors, with a focus on using chemical genetic
approaches to create tools to identify and perturb glycosylation in a cell-speciï¬c fashion. In Aim 2, we will
leverage the advantages of chemoenzymatic modiï¬cation of glycosylation to install speciï¬c photocrosslinkers
onto living cells, with a focus on identifying biological interactions that are mediated by glycans, as well as
mapping cell interactions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create novel activity-based probes for measuring and
inhibiting critical enzymes responsible for monosaccharide biosynthesis. At the conclusion of these
independent aims, we will have generated new powerful tools that will have an immediate impact on the types
of questions scientists can ask about glycosylation in human health and disease."

 Neurons rely on polarity and stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton to support long-range directed
transport and long-term survival. However, both polarity and stability can be rapidly altered in response to
injury and these rearrangements are critical for neuronal resilience. It is becoming clear that rather than a
single master mechanism controlling neuronal microtubule organization through time and space, multiple
mechanisms operate in parallel. This complexity makes it challenging to understand how each mechanism
contributes to filament organization and how the system works as a whole. To overcome this challenge, a
mathematical framework that incorporates known mechanisms will be built. This framework will be invaluable
for understanding the dendrite microtubule system, and how it responds to perturbations induced by injury.
Aim 1. Polarized organization of microtubules in neurons is critical for correct cargo delivery to axons and
dendrites. A spatial stochastic model of the polarized array of dendritic microtubules will be constructed using
known mechanisms of polarity control in Drosophila dendrites. This model will also incorporate known
parameters for microtubule growth dynamics. Model validation will be carried out using experimental
perturbations of polarity control mechanisms as well as using measurements of microtubule dynamics. This
model will provide a framework for understanding how individual microtubule dynamics and local polarity
mechanisms influence microtubule spatial organization and polarity.
Aim 2. Neurons normally maintain the same polarized arrangement of microtubules for a lifetime. However, if
the axon is removed, a dendrite can reverse polarity and become a regenerating axon. How polarity reversal
occurs is not understood. The hypothesis that increased entry of microtubules from the cell body drives
reversal will be tested in vivo and in silico. The role of other control mechanisms in polarity reversal will also be
systematically addressed by testing the mathematical model and informing new experimental directions.
Aim 3. Most neurons have several dendrites emerging from the cell body. After axon damage, only one
dendrite switches polarity whereas the others revert to their pre-injury orientation. This selection bias is
hypothesized to depend on branching patterns of the dendrites. The combination of axon removal experiments
in neurons with distinct branching features and a reduced mathematical description of microtubule behavior will
provide insights on how dendrite geometry influences polarity control, robustness, and regeneration.
 The combination of sophisticated live imaging of microtubules in neurons in vivo with new mathematical
modeling of microtubule behavior will drive new insights on how neurons maintain a polarized, yet dynamic and
flexible microtubule cytoskeleton for a lifetime. The challenges posed by axonal injury require radical
cytoskeletal reorganization. Models developed and validated with measurements from healthy neurons will be
used to gain deep understanding of microtubule control mechanisms that are critical for axonal regeneration."
10837716,"The broad, long-term objectives of this technology-driven project are (1) to continue developing and (2) apply a
powerful, new, simple, microfluidic device (and method for its use) for determining rates of processes in the
extracellular space of brain in vivo. A specific focus is hydrolysis of neuropeptides in specific brain regions in
awake, behaving animals. Method: The implantable device uses electroosmotic flow to direct solutions of
substrates, with or without inhibitors, through brain tissue and direct unreacted substrate and products to an
online measurement system or collect them for later analysis. Uniquely, this device and method uses natural
substrates in vivo. The particular focus is ectopeptidases, the âectoâ implying cell-surface (membrane-bound)
enzymes that hydrolyze peptides in the extracellular space. A typical experiment infuses a substrate peptide and
an unhydrolyzable D-amino acid peptide analog with or without a selective inhibitor. The unhydrolyzable peptide
represents initial substrate concentration. Michaelis-Menten rate parameters are derived from experimental data
using a validated approach based on a simulation of the measurement. The simulation is required to correct for
diffusion of substrate and products in the tissue. Health relatedness: There are many neuropeptides, and many
critical brain functions such as learning and memory, pain perception, protection from injury due to anoxia, and
many others that rely on neuropeptide concentrations in the extracellular space. But there is currently no means
to directly measure the impact of the ubiquitous ectopeptidases on those concentrations. The proposed
microfluidic device and the simulation provide the means to measure the rate of hydrolysis of active peptides.
The proposed method permits quantitative modeling of peptide activity (e.g., Vmax) in the extracellular space in
vivo. Specific Aims: There are two parallel, independent aims. One improves the device. The other applies the
existing novel microfluidic device to a question about pain perception. (1) Improve upon the existing, fully
functional device to make experimental measurements with more flexibility in choosing substate/inhibitor
concentrations being passed through the tissue; to extend the deviceâs capability to reach deeper brain regions.
(2) Apply an existing, fully functional microfluidic device to determine differences in specific ectopeptidase
activities in the anterior cingulate cortex between rats experiencing mild chronic pain and controls."

America currently faces a dire epidemic of substance use disorders. In 2019, 20.4 million Americans aged
12 or older had a substance use disorder. Approximately 1.6 million suffer from opioid use disorder, which
causes more than 136 overdose deaths per day on average. Stimulant abuse is also a significant contributor
to this social crisis' extension and severity, with 1 million suffering from methamphetamine use disorder (MUD)
and another 1 million from cocaine use disorder. Methamphetamine and cocaine are currently major causes
of overdose deaths behind opioids for illicit drugs. Methadone and buprenorphine are widely used treatments
for opioid addiction, but there is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for stimulant use disorder
(SUD). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop pharmacological interventions for SUD. Medical marijuana
has been associated with reduced opioid prescription rates and deaths, and preclinical studies show that
cannabinoids affect addictive-like behavior. These effects are believed to be mediated by cannabinoid
receptors in the brain. The cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1R and CB2R, respectively) are part of the
endocannabinoid system and play a crucial role in modulating dopamine (DA) levels in the central nervous
system (CNS). Marijuana and nonselective cannabinoids such as THC can activate both CB1R and CB2R.
While extensive effort has been invested in understanding the role of CB1R in this DA system, the addictive
and psychoactive properties of cannabinoids are also associated with the activation of CB1R. The recent
discovery of inhibitory CB2 receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons and their inhibitory role
in the dopaminergic circuit, leading to reduced DA release in nucleus accumbens (NAc), as well as a receptor
modulating glial and microglia function in the CNS, has created a new opportunity for targeting this pathway
for therapeutic development. With support from a U18 NIDA pilot grant for the past year, we have successfully
identified a lead series of novel chemical entities (NCEs) that display functional selectivity for cyclase over
arrestin (i.e., biased) and are also very selective for CB2R with minimal activity for CB1R. Our lead candidate
has good oral absorption, brain penetration and, in animal models, reverses the addictive behavior of mice.
This proposal aims to further optimize our lead compound as a preclinical/clinical candidate for the treatment
of MUD. While displaying excellent selectivity for CB2R over CB1R, our lead compound has residual arrestin
activity and needs further PK optimization. We have put together a panel of multidisciplinary experts covering
CNS pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, biology, and preclinical and clinical addiction medicine and
psychiatry to further support the development of this class of compounds with the help of the Blueprint
Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) before testing in humans."
10837821,"Globally, 15 million preterm births occur annually, with the majority born in low- and middle-income countries.
Prematurity is a leading cause of both under-5 mortality and future neurodevelopmental delay. A long-
established link between periodontal disease and preterm birth exists, yet common dental interventions such as
scaling and planing fail to prevent preterm birth. Xylitol, a sugar substitute commonly found in gum products,
prevents caries and periodontitis with presumed dampening of local and systemic inflammation, a risk factor for
neurodevelopmental delay in offspring. We recently completed a cluster-randomized trial in Malawi designed to
test the efficacy of xylitol gums to prevent preterm birth and immediate neonatal outcomes. This follow-up study
proposal seeks to meaningfully advance our findings by evaluating if exposure to xylitol gum administered
preconception or during early pregnancy improves neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring (up to 6 years of
age). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis by formally evaluating whether chewing xylitol gum prevents
adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes by leveraging subjects from the Prevention of Prematurity and Xylitol
(PPaX) Trial that enrolled 10,404 pregnant women in Malawi from 2015-2019.
The Specific Aims of the research are to: 1) Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the MDAT as compared
to the KABC-II neurodevelopment diagnostic tool in assessing neurodevelopmental delay of formerly term
children aged 4-6 years of age; 2) Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the MDAT as compared to the KABC-
II in assessing neurodevelopmental delay of formerly preterm children aged 4-6 years of age; 3) Determine the
impact of xylitol gum exposure during pregnancy on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of 200 sex-matched term
born children (100 controls, 100 xylitol) and 200 preterm born children (100 controls, 100 xylitol). Validating the
MDAT by comparing it to the KABC-II neurodevelopmental assessment in former preterm and term neonates in
Malawi will allow for more efficient, cost-effective studies in the future and build capacity in low-resourced settings
to identify children with neurodevelopmental delay more easily and provide more timely intervention. If xylitol use
during pregnancy is found to prevent neurodevelopmental delay in offspring, this low-cost solution will prove to
be a game-changer in preventing neurodevelopmental delay worldwide.
Proposed Career and Learning Objectives are to: 1) Attain advanced skills in epidemiology, study design, data
management, and analytic methods to correctly implement research focusing on evaluating neonatal outcomes
in settings of health disparities, and 2) Enhance skills in database development, scientific writing, presentations,
and grant preparation, and 3) Attain advanced skills, including neurodevelopmental test selection, examiner
training and oversight, test interpretation and knowledge needed to conduct rigorous neurodevelopmental
outcomes research. These skills will facilitate the applicantâs cutting-edge research on perinatal interventions to
improve neonatal health and future neurodevelopmental outcomes in the most vulnerable populations."

How to engage and retain older adults in longitudinal mHealth research is virtually unknown. This is of great
public health importance as many older adults have barriers to obtaining health care that technology may
overcome by permitting in-home monitoring of health including cognitive function. Using mHealth technologies
to obtain data more frequently and in real life settings, vs. research center examinations that occur years apart
presents a transformational opportunity for cohort studies and may lead to practical methods for monitoring risk
of Alzheimerâs disease and related disorders (ADRD). We previously developed an innovative, scalable digital
cardiovascular health monitoring system, the âelectronic Framingham Heart Studyâ (eFHS)8 for use in middle-
aged adults, thus providing foundational experience that will support this proposal. We will extend eFHS to
enhance a smartphone app tailored for older participants. The app will capture patient-reported outcomes,
cognition, physical performance, social support, and health events (falls, hospitalizations). We plan to
investigate the usefulness of the mHealth system for monitoring health-related behaviors and we will relate the
digital data to brain aging including preclinical ADRD using in-person research grade neuropsychological (NP)
testing and brain MRI data. Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Enhance engagement strategies and identify factors associated with successful use of the
smartphone app and smartwatch among older adults at 3 months and 6 months. Successful use will be
defined based on adherence, including: 1) app-based completion of surveys and cognitive and performance
tasks (n=850); 2) wearing the smartwatch daily (nâ500). We will identify participant (e.g., age, sex, cognitive
status) and system-related factors (e.g., user-interface, navigation), that affect adherence over 3 and 6 months.
Aim 2. Compare the smartphone app-based data to research grade measures of brain health (NP
testing batteries, brain MRIs) collected in the FHS Research Center on the same participants. We will
compare the app-based measures with measures of brain health, including NP test measures (global cognition
and 4 domains: executive function, memory, language, visuospatial) and brain MRI markers (total brain
volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensity volume).
Sub Aim 2a: Construct a digital frailty phenotype.
Aim 3. Examine measures of physical activity and heart rate from the Apple Watch over 90 days with
research grade measures of brain health (see Aim 2).
 Our application will provide critically needed knowledge on how older adults engage with mHealth devices
and will provide insights on the benefit of mHealth data to monitor the health of older adults in clinical and
research settings. Digital biomarkers may be powerful tools to monitor risk factors/behaviors for ADRD and to
identify older adults at risk for cognitive and physical decline."

SjÃ¶gren's disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by chronic inflammation and diminished secretory
function of the salivary glands. Although extensive investigation has been done to understand it, causes of and
effective treatments for the disease are still unknown. Given the high degree of need and the limitations of current
therapies, development of novel treatments to decrease inflammation and restore salivary gland secretory
function is essential. Previous studies demonstrated that a treatment with aspirin-triggered RvD1 and
dexamethasone (AT-RvD1/DEX) reverses SjÃ¶gren's disease-like features in NOD/ShiLtJ mice at disease onset
but the utility of this treatment is currently limited because the minimum effective dosage has yet to be
established. Specifically, although AT-RvD1 has no known side effects, its relatively high cost could limit
affordability. More importantly, DEX has been demonstrated to have significant side effects that can be expected
to impede long-term use. By determining AT-RvD1/DEX biodistribution using mathematical modeling and thus
defining the optimal (i.e., minimum effective) treatment dose, it is possible to manage the issues presented by
both drugs and in so doing produce a cost-effective and clinically safe treatment option to mitigate symptoms
associated with SjÃ¶gren's disease. To that end, it is hypothesized that systemic delivery of AT-RvD1/DEX will
restore salivary gland secretory function in SjÃ¶gren's disease. Aim 1 will reduce AT-RvD1/DEX doses to their
minimum effective levels, while Aim 2 will explore mechanisms by which AT-RvD1/DEX treatment outcomes are
achieved and Aim 3 will apply AT-RvD1/DEX treatment to humanized systems."

We are requesting support for the 2024 GRC on Neuroelectronic Interfaces: Advances and Challenges in
Neurotech Development and Translation, and the associated GRS, which will be held March 9th â March
15th, 2024, at the Grand Galvez, 2024 Seawall Boulevard, Galveston, TX. Following the successful
2022 Neuroelectronic Interfaces Gordon Research Conference, this proposed conference will continue to
bring together world-class clinicians, scientists, and engineers with a multi-disciplinary skillset (e.g.,
cellular and system neuroscience, neuropathology, neurotechnology, materials science, and engineering),
to share advances, describe challenges, and discuss possible solutions that could support the successful
translation of chronically useful and reliable neural interfaces.
The expectation for Gordon Research Conferences is that vigorous formal and informal discussions will be
maximized between prominent investigators and junior attendees of the conferences, with particular
emphasis being placed on underrepresented groups, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. This
conference is designed to bridge the scientific field by attracting established researchers, who provide a
strong foundational support for past research, and both outside investigators and junior members of the
field, who often inject new ideas. We intend to prioritize the use of NIH funds to support the participation of
underrepresented participants as well as those experiencing hardship within their research efforts.
Specifically, we will use these funds to cover a portion of the costs of their participation (e.g., registration,
travel, childcare). Thus, we will promote the development of and continued involvement of qualified
researchers from underrepresented groups in neural-engineering research. Additionally, the 2024
conference program has an impressive range of topics, and the speakers are both diverse and of high
quality. We are building a program that we are confident will lead to a lively and inspiring conference that is
at the cutting edge of science and engineering. The program covers important topics related to the
development and translation of Neuroelectronic Interface technologies, ranging from neurotechnology in
society, advances in neuroscience research, interface hardware (from electrodes through packaging), CNS
and PNS targets, non-electrical interfaces, and even non-invasive interfaces. This GRC will provide a
forum for the findings of established scientists engaged in other biomedical areas to enable identification of
new concepts for, and potential collaboration in, neural interfaces research.
We expect this event to continue being a âgo to meetingâ for the neural interfacing community and
maintaining the tradition and prestige of the Gordon Research Conferences."
10825871,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of the proposed research is to 1) understand if activity of various cell types in DLPFC is consistent
with computational models of decision-making, and 2) investigate if there is a functional hierarchy in macaque
monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during decision-making. Decision-making is our ability to choose
and perform appropriate actions based on sensory cues and context to achieve behavioral goals. DLPFC is a
key decision-making brain region which receives inputs from higher-order sensory areas and sends outputs to
premotor cortices. DLPFC is also implicated in disorders of decision-making such as schizophrenia but currently,
it is unknown how circuit-level disruptions in this disorder result in its perturbed function. Specifically, we do not
understand 1) how different cell types in DLPFC mechanistically enable decision-making and 2) the spatial
organization of function in this area. We address these questions by combining in vivo neurophysiology with
computational modeling in DLPFC of monkeys performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard
discrimination tasks. Our first aim tests three emerging hypotheses of the role of cell types during decision-
making: 1) are inhibitory cells choice-selective or -nonselective during decision-making? 2) Do inhibitory neurons
exhibit contra-specific rather than ipsi-specific connectivity? 3) Do either somatostatin- (SST+) or parvalbumin-
positive (PV+) support decision-making through choice-selectivity? In this first aim, we will first build several cell-
type specific computational models of decision-making to establish predictions of neural dynamics during the
task. We will then use laminar multi-contact electrodes to record single neurons from DLPFC of monkeys
performing our novel red-green reaction time checkerboard discrimination task. With these recorded responses,
we will adjudicate between the models. Finally, we will examine each unitâs electrophysiological properties
(waveform shape and firing rate patterns) with our recently developed and validated approach that allows us to
delineate putative cell types (PhysMAP). With these identified populations, we will test predictions made by our
cell type-specific mean-field models of decision-making. In our second aim, we will test three competing theories
this time regarding the nature of functional gradients in DLPFC: 1) the âmodular hypothesisâ that different areas
are qualitatively distinct in their representations; 2) the âgradient hypothesisâ that different areas contain the same
information which differs quantitatively in the âamountâ; or 3) the âhierarchical hypothesisâ that âupstreamâ areas
contain all decision variables whereas ""downstreamâ areas only contain action-oriented variables. We will record
from DLPFC across several anatomical axes during two variants of the checkerboard task. We will then use
decoding and population analysis approaches like demixed principal component analysis to understand the task
representations of DLPFC at each location. Impact: This project will elucidate the in vivo spatio-temporal and
microcircuit dynamics in a clinically relevant brain area. Such data is a prerequisite for future development of
circuit-level therapeutics for mental illness and brain machine interfaces for recovery following brain injury."
10825874,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapy mediates potent immunity in some patients with aggressive malignancies,
but many individuals do not respond or relapse. One reason for therapy failure is due to lack of T cell persistence.
To overcome this problem, we aimed to generate a cell product that will lead to long term immunity to
aggressively growing tumors. Our team reported that antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that secrete IL-17, termed
Th17 cells, persist long term and can eradicate large solid tumors when infused into mice. We found that in the
tumor and draining lymph node of mice treated with Th17 therapy, there was a vast induction of genes in the
MHC-II pathway as well as key cytokines, costimulatory cues, and transcription factors known to support B cell
differentiation and maturation. Furthermore, host B cells were surprisingly critical in sustaining durable immunity,
as their depletion impaired survival. In mice deficient in B cells, IL-21 and IFN-g production by Th17 cells was
impaired. Importantly, our findings show for the first time an active role for B cells in ACT. Based on our findings,
we propose the central hypothesis that IL-21 and IFN-g enhance Th17 and B cell cooperativity, in turn sustaining
long lived responses via MHC-II dependent pathways and tumor specific antibodies. To test this hypothesis, in
Aim 1, we will examine how IL-21 and IFN-g support Th17-B cell cooperation. Th17 cells, deficient or sufficient
in IL-21R or IFN-gR, will be infused into melanoma-bearing mice, with or without IL-21R, or IFN- gR, and we will
test how IL-21 and IFN- g signaling governs Th17 and B cell self-renewal, proliferation, maturation, and
networking. In Aim 2, we will determine how transferred Th17 cells synergize with host B cells to mediate tumor
immunity. To address this, we will determine if Th17 cells can directly kill tumor in an MHC-II restricted manner
by performing in vitro killing assays with Th17 cells against melanoma (with or without MHC-II expression). Further,
Th17 cells will be transferred into mice, deficient or sufficient in MHC-II expressing B cells, bearing melanoma
(with or without MHC-II expression) to test the idea that both MHC-II on tumor and B cells is needed for sustained
immunity. Additionally, we will test if the antibodies induced by Th17 cell therapy are tumor specific. To test this,
we will transfer antibodies from Th17 cured mice into treatment naÃ¯ve mice challenged with lung metastasis to
test if these antibodies can protect tumor formation. These investigations are expected to expose the mechanism
behind Th17 and B cell antitumor cooperativity in turn informing the development of novel therapies to bolster
immunity against aggressive tumors that evade current treatments."
10825998,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most ubiquitous parasites of humans, chronically infecting one quarter of the
worldâs population. Though typically asymptomatic in immunocompetent hosts, infection can give rise to severe
clinical complications in the immunocompromised or during periods of weakened immune function. Parasites
that maintain the chronic infection are transcriptionally distinct from the acute stages that cause pathology, and
are resistant to treatment with antiparasitics. Understanding regulation of the T. gondii chronic stage is therefore
necessary to prevent and eradicate persistent reservoirs of disease. Our lab recently identified two core
components of the chronic differentiation program. First, we found that a single transcription factor, BFD1, is
necessary and sufficient for stage conversion. More recently, I discovered a cytosolic RNA-binding protein
(BFD2) that functions immediately upstream of BFD1 to regulate its expression. Parasites lacking either factor
are not able to produce chronic stages, either in mice or in response to alkaline stressâa standard in vitro trigger
of differentiation. My work suggests that BFD2 functions as a translational activator of BFD1 under stress, and
that this requires binding of BFD2 to BFD1 mRNA. In turn, BFD1 promotes BFD2 transcription, outlining a
feedback loop. This reciprocal positive regulation provides the driving force to commit parasites to their chronic
differentiation program; yet, precisely how the BFD1-BFD2 circuit is triggered by stress, and later overturned
during reactivation, remains to be explored. In the proposed studies, I will uncover the molecular basis of BFD2
regulation through three complimentary aims. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism of translational activation by
BFD2, and how this is influenced by protein-protein interactions. Aim 2 will assess the role of post-translational
modification in licensing stress-responsive BFD2 activity. Aim 3 will employ a novel gain-of-function screening
approach to identify the factors responsible for antagonizing the BFD1-BFD2 circuit during chronic-stage
reactivation. Together, these studies will integrate the genetic mechanisms underlying entry and exit from the T.
gondii chronic stage with the signals that trigger stage conversion, which may inform the design of therapies to
combat this important human pathogen."

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a 5-year expected survival rate of less
than 30%. Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a common mutation in AML
and is a molecular driver of immature blood cell proliferation. Despite advances in the development of FLT3
kinase inhibitors, remissions are short-lived. I have previously shown that inhibition of the epigenetic regulator
lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) enhances the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD AML. The drug
combination induces leukemic cell death by disrupting regulatory binding at the MYC blood-specific super-
enhancer complex (BENC), resulting in a loss of activity and expression of the MYC proto-oncoprotein. In Aim
1, I will use single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing and high-resolution epigenetic profiling of primary AML
samples to define the transcription factor regulators of the MYC BENC in FLT3-ITD AML. In Aim 2, I will use
activating CRISPR technology and drug sensitivity assays to identify the individual MYC BENC enhancer
modules that are critical for the activity of combined FLT3 and LSD1 inhibition. Successful completion of these
studies will determine the molecular control of the MYC BENC in FLT3-ITD AML, nominating novel targets and
enabling personalization of dual FLT3 and LSD1 inhibition for patients with FLT3-ITD AML.
 My goal is to manage an independent systems biology research group that investigates molecular
leukemia biology and targeted leukemia therapies while simultaneously practicing as a hematologist oncologist
at an academic research institute. This application proposes a comprehensive and interdisciplinary training plan
within a prominent academic medical and research institution that seamlessly integrates with the research
proposal and provides essential training in computational and molecular cancer biology. I will receive guidance
in drug sensitivity and functional genetic techniques as well as access to one of the largest AML patient
biorepositories in the world from my sponsor, Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer in the field of targeted leukemia therapy
and Director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will be supported in analysis of single cell sequencing data from my
co-sponsor, Dr. Emek Demir, the Section Head of Computational Biology at the Knight Cancer Institute. I will
learn to apply high-resolution epigenetic profiling techniques to investigate epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in
leukemia from my co-sponsor, Dr. Theodore Braun, a physician-scientist and Assistant Professor of Hematology
& Medical Oncology. I will be trained in the use of single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing from a leader in
single cell sequencing technologies, Dr. Andrew Adey. I will learn to use integrative systems biology techniques
to study targeted leukemia therapies from my thesis advisory committee member, Dr. Laura Heiser. I will learn
to design and test my hypotheses in the context of therapeutic responses in cancer from my thesis advisory
member, Dr. Naoki Oshimori."
10826071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Robust daily biological rhythms over the 24-hour (h) day-night cycles are key hallmarks of animal
healthspan and are strongly regulated by circadian clocks. Circadian clocks are cell-autonomous,
endogenous molecular timers present in the brain and peripheral organs that enable animals to adapt to daily
changes in their environment. Clock-controlled outputs are all-encompassing and clock disruption is
associated with a wide range of pathologies and chronic diseases. While the brain clock is synchronized to
external environment via photic cues from light-dark cycles, peripheral clocks in major organs are entrained
and synchronized by metabolic signals mediated primarily via food intake that are regulated by the brain clock.
This coupled brain and peripheral clock system promotes internal synchrony, maintaining balance between
metabolism and energy use. Given the importance of metabolic signals in regulating body clocks, it is critical
to understand mechanisms underlying metabolic regulation of daily biological rhythms. The overall goal of
this project is to investigate post-translational mechanisms that mediate metabolic regulation of time-of-day
protein functions to orchestrate daily rhythms. Efforts to understand the underpinnings of circadian clocks and
their control over daily rhythms have long focused on regulation at the transcriptional level. However, recent
studies have demonstrably confirmed the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in shaping
robust daily rhythms, often bypassing regulation at the gene expression level. We recently established that
metabolic signals from feeding-fasting cycles drive robust daily rhythms of global O-GlcNAcylation in
Drosophila and in mouse peripheral tissues. O-GlcNAcylation is a nutrient-sensitive PTM that interacts
extensively with phosphorylation to regulate protein structure and function as both PTMs modify serine and
threonine residues. We will test the hypothesis that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation work in
conjunction to regulate daily rhythms of protein activities. We further test the hypothesis that altering timing
of metabolic input by mistimed feeding will remodel the O-GlcNAcome, phosphoproteome, and their
interactions, resulting in potential disruption of peripheral clock functions. To date, there have only been a
handful of studies investigating rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and the consequences of its disruption. This project
is designed to address this significant knowledge gap. In Aim 1, we will identify proteins that are rhythmically
modified by O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in key mammalian organs and investigate whether and to
what extent rhythmic PTM profiles are sensitive to timing of metabolic input. In Aim 2, we will incorporate
proteomics data generated from this project into O-GlcNAc Atlas, a searchable database with a web interface
constructed by our collaborator Dr. Junfeng Ma, to enable user-friendly data discovery. This R21 project will
provide new insights into the regulation of daily biological rhythms by nutrient-sensitive PTMs and catalyze
functional characterization of nutrient-sensitive molecular pathways in a rhythmic biology framework."

The 2024 GRC on Angiotensin will focus on the latest advances in the RAAS, from discovery science to
clinical impact. The highlight will be the interplay between RAAS and other hormonal systems and how
this influences interorgan communications from cell signaling to systems biology, and the implications
in drug discovery. We will discuss interactions between the RAAS and other hormonal and biological systems,
the mechanisms of systems crosstalk, and its effects on inter-organelle and inter-organ communications to reveal
the role of the RAAS across systems. Growing evidence indicates extensive communication between distant
organs in health and disease. Examples include axes between gut-brain, heart-kidneys, heart-brain, liver-heart,
adipose-vascular, and immune-cardiovascular. Preceding the GRC, is the 2024 Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS), a unique forum organized by junior investigators for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early
career researchers, to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. The GRS will focus on sharing
knowledge of recent tools and breakthroughs to explore the RAAS system in the pathophysiology of
cardiovascular diseases. The mentoring block will emphasize career development and provide a session to
discuss important aspects such as grant writing and self-management. Moreover, it offers a one-to-one meeting
with a mentor to discuss career planning. Our scientific program is designed to attract a new broader community,
including scientists, clinical researchers, biomedical engineers, computational biologists, and data scientists from
across the world, and will facilitate opportunities for networking between diverse disciplines.
The theme of the GRC is âThe Interplay Between the RAAS and Other Hormonal Systems: From Cell Signaling
to Novel Therapies,â and the specific aims are to:

Childhood adverse experiences confer risk for a multitude of negative long-term health outcomes, but the
processes through which these experiences are neurobiologically embedded and possibly buffered by positive
experiences are still unclear. Though adversity is regularly associated with differences in brain structure, many
studies yield conflicting evidence. These may be resolved through methodological and conceptual
advancements that consider the discrepancies in adversity measurement, age-related expressions of neural
effects, and possible competing effects of positive childhood experiences. Adolescence, a period of dynamic
neural change when many first experience mental health problems, is a promising time to evaluate the effects
of childhood adversity on brain development and mental health. This project will employ cutting edge
computational techniques to identify the relative advantages of two conceptual models of adversity â the
cumulative risk model and dimensional model of psychopathology â as they relate to changes in brain structure
and mental health throughout adolescence. To achieve these objectives, this project draws from up to six
waves of data from a longitudinal sample of 174 adolescent girls (initial ages 10-13, ~18 months between
waves). The specific aims are: 1) evaluate the fit of cumulative and dimensional models of adversity with
longitudinal trajectories of mental health symptoms; 2) evaluate the fit of cumulative and dimensional models of
adversity with structural brain development and determine the viability of brain-as-a-mediator model; and 3)
identify the effect of positive life experiences on adversity-brain-health relationships. Completion of these aims
will sharpen scientific understanding of these conceptual models and provide targets for translational
application. To facilitate a career as a clinical and developmental neuroscientist, this project has five training
goals: develop expertise in 1) operationalizing childhood experiences to predict meaningful outcomes; 2)
employing longitudinal univariate and multivariate techniques; 3) adolescent structural brain development; 4)
science communication; and 5) professional development. This training will occur within the state-of-the-art
Center for Translational Neuroscience at the University of Oregon. Dr. Jennifer Pfeifer will be the primary
mentor due to her extensive knowledge of adolescent development and neuroimaging. Dr. Philip Fisher, an
expert in the effects of early adversity, will provide expertise on the conceptual models of adversity. Dr. Robert
Chavez will provide mentorship related to his considerable experience in multivariate modeling. Dr. Kathryn
Mills will support training in adolescent brain development and reproducible neuroscience practices as a
consultant with considerable expertise in those areas. Dr. Jena Doom, who has expertise in protective
mechanisms against childhood stress, will serve as a consultant on the operationalization of benevolent
childhood experiences. Given his expertise in longitudinal modeling in developmental neuroimaging, Dr. Kevin
King will provide consultation for longitudinal modeling considerations."

This shared instrument grant requests funds for a new flow cytometer, the Sony MA900, to be installed at
Yale University and dedicated to BSL3 research using fluorescence-based flow cytometry for either cell
sorting or purely analytic purposes. Flow Cytometry is a critical resource for biomedical research. Nearly
every discipline in the biologic sciences uses this technology that can be critical for a variety of
applications downstream of the sorting of cells based on phenotype. There is strong interest in studying
infectious disease at Yale â both at the cellular and host-response level. Many investigators performing
BSL3 research rely on a cell-sorting flow cytometer within the BSL3 facility to process infected cell
samples that can not undergo fixation. This is particularly important when cell sorting of unfixed infected
samples is required for subsequent in vitro cell culture assays or single cell RNA sequencing. Numerous
high-impact papers have resulted from prior BSL3 research at our institution, but many on-going studies
require continued access to reliable BSL3 flow cytometry. The requested equipment would replace an
aging BD FACSAria. The vendor will soon cease to offer service contracts on this model. Since this is the
only cell-sorting flow cytometer available for BSL3 researchers, any equipment breakdown could result in
delays that would significantly impede ongoing research. Thus, it is critical that this instrument be
replaced with a reliable cell-sorter that can be repaired in a timely fashion, preferably one that can be
operated independently by investigators when staff is not available."

Biliary tract cancer (BTC), which includes cancers of the gallbladder and bile ducts, is the second most
common primary hepatobiliary cancer worldwide. BTC is highly fatal, with ~90% of its patients dying within five
years after diagnosis. A better understanding of the etiology of BTC is critical for designing cost-effective
prevention strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this fatal cancer. The biliary tract plays a central
role in the metabolism and absorption of fat-soluble endogenous and exogenous compounds and in the
maintenance of normal liver functions. Many known risk factors for BTC are related to metabolic disturbance,
suggesting a significant role of metabolic perturbance in BTC pathogenesis. Thus, a systematic investigation of
circulating metabolites could provide valuable information regarding biomarkers for BTC risk and biological
mechanisms of BTC pathogenesis. Herein, we propose a well-powered, multi-ancestry study, using resources
from 17 large prospective cohort studies around the world and five large genetic consortia/studies of BTC, to
identify and validate metabolomic biomarkers for BTC risk. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze blood samples
collected prior to any cancer diagnosis from 750 incident cases and 750 matched controls to systematically
search the blood metabolome to identify promising metabolite biomarkers for replication. In Aim 2, we will use
genetic variants associated with circulating metabolites and data from large genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) of BTC to search for additional promising metabolite biomarkers for replication. In Aim 3, we will
quantify 50 promising metabolites selected from Aims 1 and 2 and evaluate their associations with risk of BTC
overall, and by its subsites, in an independent sample of nearly 2000 cases and their matched controls. Finally,
in Aim 4, we will build risk prediction models for BTC using metabolite biomarkers, genetic risk variants and
traditional risk factors. This is the first large study ever conducted to systematically search the blood
metabolome to identify risk biomarkers for BTC, and the first study to integrate metabolomic and genomic data
in BTC biomarker research. Including multi-ancestry populations will allow us to cross-validate research
findings and identify potential racial differences in biomarker associations. This study will provide substantial
novel data to improve the understanding of BTC etiology and identify biomarkers for BTC risk assessment."
10860970,"Summary Statement
The cellular processes responsible for Lewy pathology (LP) formation, maturation, and clearance in
human disease tissues remain unknown in part because a lack of techniques available to capture LP
interactions in the intact cellular environment. The long-term goal is to determine the core-cellular
processes responsible for LP in the human brain and find therapeutic targets to develop disease
modifying treatments for synucleinopathy. The objective of this proposal is to determine the role of LP
interactions in the initiation and progression of synucleinopathies. The central hypothesis is that core
molecular LP interactions are the major determinants of clinical synucleinopathies phenotypes and
disease progression. Our rationale for the proposed studies is that determining LP interactions across
the neuroaxis of the diseased brain will reveal those core pathological processes responsible for human
synucleinopathies and offer a concrete molecular description concerning how those processes define,
distinguish, and treat clinical synucleinopathies. The central hypothesis will be tested in two specific
aims: 1) Determine LP interactions in the human synucleinopathy brain; 2) Investigate LP interactions
across the neuroaxis of a rodent brain as synucleinopathy develops. We will test these aims by using our
innovative in situ proximity labeling technique that overcomes previous technical limitations, to provide
a clear molecular understanding of LP. The proposed research is significant because it will provide a
detailed understanding of LP interactions that should be targets for future disease modifying
therapeutics. The expected outcome of the proposed research is to provide the field with an unbiased
account of LP interactions in the human diseased brain and in models of synucleinopathy. These results
will have an immediate positive impact because they will provide a âbig pictureâ cellular/molecular
understanding of human synucleinopathies that is currently unavailable but crucial for progress in the
field"

Duke will complete all work for the machine learning model building and implementation of the model into the
Duke clinical workflow. For Aim 1 of the project, this work will include data extraction and cleaning, neural network
architecture design, and model optimization and validation. For Aim 2, this work will include establishment of
technical infrastructure for real-time image and access and processing, construction of a front-end dashboard in
close collaboration with frontline clinicians, and deployment and prospective validation of the model. The latter
step will also consist of education and training of hospital users. For Aim 3 of the project, Duke will guide staff at
Jefferson through the model implementation and validation process, with the active integration and training
performed by staff at Jefferson. In Aim 3 Duke will also run the experiments on multi-site model generalization,
using retrospective data at both Duke and Jefferson. Data will be shared between Duke and Jefferson via secure
ethernet transfer between Jeffersonâs secure data warehouse and Dukeâs Protected Analytics and Computing
Environment. The end goal of the work will be to provide a sophisticated, high-accuracy, and seamlessly
integrated tool for predicting the risk of actionable TBI complications over the course of a TBI patientâs hospital
encounter. This method, which will augment decision-making for treating a complex neurological condition, will
significantly improve overall TBI outcomes, reduce readmission rates, and minimize the extraordinary costs
incurred by inefficient provision of healthcare resources."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a class of persistent organic pollutants found in furniture,
cookware, home dÃ©cor, clothing, firefighting foam, food packaging, and contaminants in food and water. PFAS
are recognized as an environmental health priority by NIH due to their ubiquitous exposure, resistance to
environmental degradation, and bioaccumulation. Growing evidence of their effects on vascular risk factors (e.g.
hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, hypertension) and neurotoxicity suggest that PFAS exposure increases
Alzheimerâs Disease and Alzheimerâs Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) risk, but empirical data are
limited, weak, and inconsistent. Prospective cohort studies linking PFAS and AD/ADRD, with adjudicated clinical
outcomes and control for confounding by diet and kidney function, are lacking. We propose to quantify the
concentrations of 13 ubiquitous PFAS in archived serum samples from two time points, and the total PFAS
exposure burden, in the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS, N=1290), an established (25+ year-long) multi-
ethnic longitudinal cohort. We hypothesize that PFAS exposure increases the risk of cognitive impairment and
AD/ADRD through a mechanistic pathway involving hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. PFAS are shown to alter
lipid metabolism. NOMAS data have demonstrated a strong relationship between lipids and atherosclerosis.
NOMAS participants had blood collected at baseline (1993-2001) and during follow-up (2003-2008), and annual
follow-up, with comprehensive data on sociodemographics, vascular events, medical history, medications, health
behaviors, diet, lipids, neural imaging, and a range of vascular risk factors. Participants had multiple
comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, with extensive adjudication to identify those who developed
AD/ADRD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). NOMAS is ideal due to the diverse population (60% Hispanic,
20% Black, 20% White) at high risk for AD/ADRD and prospectively followed for vascular and cognitive
outcomes. We will determine the associations between serum PFAS concentrations with comprehensive lipid
profiles, carotid atherosclerosis phenotypes (plaque, intima-media thickness, stiffness), and risk of incident
AD/ADRD and MCI, with the goal of identifying the impacts of PFAS on AD/ADRD, mediated through lipid
metabolism and atherosclerosis. We will identify key confounders (diet), mediators (vascular risk factors), and
effect modifiers (APOE4 genotype). The innovative strengths are the ability to fill important gaps related to the
effects of PFAS on adjudicated AD/ADRD, ability to examine race/ethnic disparities in the effects of PFAS, and
effect modification by APOE4, inclusion of a broad range of PFAS, and the interdisciplinary team with experience
in PFAS exposure analysis and neuroepidemiology, which will lay the foundation for targeted community-wide
preventive interventions. The data will provide crucial information on biological mechanisms through which PFAS
impact cognitive impairment and AD/ADRD, which will inform public health recommendations on the avoidance
of PFAS-containing products, and support regulatory efforts to reduce community PFAS exposure."

Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) experience severe and episodic disruptions in regulatory control of
emotion (emotion regulation, ER) that exacerbate symptoms in BD across depressed, manic, and euthymic
states and interfere with mood stability over time. Emotion dysregulation in BD is associated with maladaptive
functioning, interpersonal problems, decreased work productivity, and suicidal ideation and behavior. The
development of rapid-acting alternative treatment options that improve ER are important to help achieve and
sustain remission and improve long-term functioning in individuals with BD. In this mechanistic study, we will
test whether stimulating the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a key region within the neurocircuitry supporting ER,
with a rapid and robust form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (accelerated intermittent theta-burst
stimulation, aiTBS), will increase ER in depressed patients with BD, as indexed by increased IPL-ER
neurocircuit functional connectivity and improved performance on ER-related behavioral tasks. Using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ER-related computer tasks before and after active versus sham
aiTBS, Aim 1 of the project will examine ER-related brain network changes following aiTBS using resting
state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after aiTBS. Aim 2 of the project will examine
ER behavior-based changes following aiTBS and the relationship to brain network changes using ER-related
behavioral tasks measured before and after aiTBS. We will additionally examine changes in brain activation
associated with ER behavior during an in-scanner task pre and post aiTBS; changes in functional connectivity
within the broader ER-related neurocircuitry (e.g. ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala) following aiTBS;
and the effects of baseline patient characteristics relevant to ER on outcomes (emotion reactivity, executive
function, impulsivity, approach/avoidance, interoceptive awareness). Patients will be randomized to either
active or sham aiTBS and will receive 6 sessions of high dose (1800 pulses) iTBS per day over a course of 4
days. Patients will be scanned at baseline and 3 days post aiTBS to measure the neuroplastic effects of
aiTBS. To increase the potential clinical utility of findings from this study, we will examine the effects of aiTBS
to the IPL in a sample of BD patients who are currently depressed, the most common and chronic mood state
in this population. If we can show stimulation of the IPL engages the broader neurocircuitry supporting adaptive
ER and affects ER-related behavior in depressed patients with BD, this will be an important first step towards
validating this target for the treatment of ER deficits in BD, and towards future validation of this approach in
maintaining mood stability in BD."
10849710,"Cell intrinsic innate immunity is a barrier that all viral pathogens must overcome or otherwise subvert in
order to successfully complete their infectious lifecycle. Collectively, these pathways detect non-self or danger
associated molecules, and, in response, produce signaling proteins called interferons that induce both local
and systemic anti-pathogen responses. These responses ultimately drive the clearance of most acute
infections, although they also lead to much of the observed pathology. Most, if not all, viral pathogens encode
antagonists of these pathways; frequently at the level of interferon production. One such pathogen, human
influenza A virus, is so successful that only around 0.5% of infected cells successfully detect viral infection at
early timepoints. Nevertheless, that small fraction of responders is crucial to the course of
diseaseâindividuals with defects in interferon pathways are often at extremely high risk of complications or
death following infection by respiratory viruses, including influenza.
Paradoxically, while most viral populations maintain stringent suppression of host detection, they
replicate with relatively low fidelity. For influenza, only about 10% of viral particles can successfully complete
the viral lifecycle. The rest of the particles are capable of entering cells and exposing potential innate immune
ligands, but nevertheless fail at some step to produce infectious progeny. Regardless, the vast majority of
virions, even those which cannot complete the viral lifecycle, still go undetected. What mechanisms, then,
allow viral populations to remain undetected by host cells despite failing so frequently at replication?
As a starting point to this ambitious line of inquiry, we are focusing on several discrete mechanisms in
influenza A virus for which we already possess either preliminary data or the capacity to readily procure such
data: 1) How the structure of the segmented genome of influenza A virus influences the range of potential
immunostimulatory failure 2) How the multifunctionality of influenzaâs predominant innate immune antagonist,
NS1, influences rates of viral detection, and 3) How polymerase error rate may be subject to innate immune
pressure. To address these questions my group will use a combination of variant analysis, deep mutational
scanning, and more classical molecular virology. By profiling the challenges viral populations must overcome
to evade innate immunity, and the mechanisms by which they do so, it is our hope to better inform models of
viral evolution and potentially even identify novel therapeutic routes exploiting those challenges.

approaches have already identified key components of the viral lifecycle that are subject to surveillance, and

Antiretroviral (ARV) agents for treatment and prevention will be key to Ending the HIV Epidemic. Although oral
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective, new options less dependent on day-to-day adherence are
needed to maximize impact. The era of long-acting PrEP has arrived, with rollout of two new products in 2022.
The dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR), self-inserted monthly, is being implemented in sub-Saharan Africa, and
injectable cabotegravir (CAB), given every 8 weeks, is now approved by the U.S. FDA. Despite the promise of
these modalities to reduce HIV incidence, acute HIV infections (AHI) occur among PrEP users and were seen
in DVR and CAB trials. Potential causes of AHI on PrEP modalities include inadequate ARV adherence/
exposure and resistance to the PrEP agent. As oral and long-acting PrEP are scaled up, 300,000 AHI could
occur among PrEP users in the next 5 years. DVR showed modest efficacy in trials and high ring adherence
will be critical. With high levels of circulating ARV resistance (from ARVs in the same class used for treatment),
DVR could fail to block infection with resistant virus. While CAB efficacy was high in trials, AHI occurred
despite on-time injections and resulted in resistance. Because the same drug classes are being used for HIV
prevention and treatment, resistance from CAB could render U.S. and global first-line antiretroviral therapy
(ART) regimens ineffective. Moreover, CAB levels persist for over 1 year in a pharmacokinetic (PK) tail that
could further increase resistance risk. As DVR and CAB are scaled up, key knowledge gaps must be
addressed: 1) What are causes of AHI on DVR and CAB in rollout settings? 2) What behavioral factors
contribute to DVR/CAB non-adherence prior to AHI? 3) What is the risk of DVR/CAB resistance? 4) What are
subsequent HIV treatment outcomes? This application proposes intensive studies of causes of AHI on DVR
and CAB, leveraging three studies enrolling persons with AHI from large PrEP programs in western Kenya and
the U.S. for sample collection, surveys, interviews, and ART outcomes assessment. Innovative methods will be
deployed to detect drug resistance (next-generation sequencing), identify novel mutations (full-genome
sequencing), retrospectively measure ARV exposure before diagnosis (PK analysis of hair samples cut into
segments reflecting exposure over sequential 2-week intervals), and understand DVR/CAB adherence prior to
AHI and ART adherence (longitudinal mixed methods). The proposed aims are: 1) To determine the causes of
HIV infection among women using DVR in Kenya. 2) To identify the causes of HIV infection among persons
using CAB for prevention in the U.S. 3) To evaluate subsequent outcomes on ART after HIV infection among
persons using PrEP modalities. Collectively, these aims will provide the first and largest analysis of causes of
and outcomes following AHI on DVR and CAB in rollout settings. This study will pave the way to address
crucial questions on novel resistance after CAB or DVR use and drug levels at which resistance emerges, and
will inform optimal implementation strategies for DVR, CAB, and next-generation PrEP modalities."
10850206,"Abstract 
Neutrophils, which are essential for host defense against bacterial and fungal infections, induce inflammation 
following tissue necrosis or ischemic injury. If not properly resolved, neutrophilic inflammation is the driving force 
behind a plethora of human inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils, delivered via the bloodstream, arrive at the site 
of injury by first rolling along the vessel wall and then arresting. Arrest is triggered by chemokines that induce 
the high-affinity conformation of Î²2 integrins. Two FERM domain proteins, kindlin-3 and talin-1, are required for 
neutrophil arrest. It is well known that talin-1, an adaptor protein that binds the actin cytoskeleton, activates 
integrins by binding and altering the topology of the Î² transmembrane domain. We recently reported that kindlin-3 
is recruited to the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin homology domain prior to neutrophil arrest. However, 
the mechanism underlying neutrophil spreading and the role of kindlin-3 in this process are poorly understood. 
Moreover, how kindlin-3 cooperates with talin-1 to activate integrins and whether kindlin-3 also functions as an 
adaptor protein by directly binding to actin are completely unknown. Our overarching hypothesis is that, during 
neutrophil spreading, both kindlin-3 and talin-1 are simultaneously recruited to the plasma membrane, where 
kindlin-3 organizes high-affinity integrin activation. To test this hypothesis, we generated reporter mouse lines 
for simultaneous detection of Î²2 integrin activation and imaging of kindlin-3 and talin-1 in mouse neutrophils. In 
Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that kindlin-3 organizes a ring of clustered high-affinity Î²2 integrins during 
neutrophil spreading under flow conditions; in Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that kindlin-3 regulates integrin 
activation by directly binding to the actin cytoskeleton; and in Aim 3, we will determine the role of Î²2 integrin 
activation in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The proposed research is conceptually innovative and highly 
significant because it will resolve the enigma of how kindlin-3 organizes high-affinity integrin activation and define 
the role it plays in IRI-induced inflammation. Successful completion of this proposal will establish molecular 
mechanisms of integrin activation and provide mechanistic insight into neutrophil spreading and vascular 
inflammation.

Association of Genetic Determinants of Diabetes with Cerebrovascular Disease in Multi-Ancestral Hawai'ian
Populations
Global increases in prevalent
type 2 diabetes (T2D)
and cerebrovascular disease means that health systems
need to meet increasing demand for preventive and therapeutic interventions. In addition to traditional public
health efforts, innovative health systems are developing and beginning to offer precision medicine strategies
based on genomic information. However, genetically derived instruments for evaluating
T2D and
cerebrovascular risk
are based on genetic studies performed in populations of predominantly European ancestry.
For populations underrepresented in these derivation studies, the clinical yield of precision medicine strategies
is lower. In the Pacific Islands, epidemiologic research has already identified high rates of diabetes, obesity,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI), relative to other
residential populations. Strokes occur at younger ages and with higher mortality and morbidity in NHPI
individuals. Particularly in populations like NHPI who are already vulnerable to health and health system
inequities, ensuring representation in translational and clinical genetics research is paramount to efforts to
reduce population health disparities in the future. Our proposed work aims to tackle the knowledge gaps

The inner ear is perfused by vessels that provide oxygen and nutrients to support the activity of hearing.
This separation between the blood and inner ear fluids is maintained by tightly connected cells that
reinforce the blood vessels and ensure that small molecules, proteins, and cells remain inside the blood
vessel. The structural elements that form this barrier are called the blood-labyrinth barrier. This barrier
plays an important role in regulating the entry of white blood cells from the blood stream into the inner
ear. When the immune system is activated, this barrier becomes leaky, and white blood cells leave the
vessel lumen, enter the inner compartment, and can then eliminate germs or unwanted cells. These
white blood cells are also capable of damaging normal tissues that are not intended targets of the
inflammatory response. The first part of this study examines the developing blood-labyrinth barrier in
animals that are born with a viral infection called cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is an important cause of
hearing loss in the newborn population and we do not fully understand how it causes hearing loss. We
have limited options to address hearing loss in infants born with CMV. This infection occurs at a time
when the blood labyrinth and blood brain barriers are not yet mature. Infection that begins in utero
cause long term deficits that may be related to abnormal development of these vascular barriers.
The second aim will identify which cells are directly targeted by the virus and whether cell killing by viral
infection contributes to loss of hearing function.
The third group of experiments will explore the role of the interferons in contributing to hearing loss in
mice. We will explore the effects of reducing IFN signaling specifically in blood vessels after viral
infection to disrupt the events that could lead to hearing loss while maintaining the important antiviral
effects of IFNs.
The goal is to improve our understanding of how the immune system works in the inner ear, what
elements of the immune system are critical for preventing or eliminating infections, and which of its
functions might contribute to damage and hearing loss. Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory
agents have been used in cases of sensorineural hearing loss with success, but their side effects limit
their effectiveness. Thus, there is an opportunity to study the contributions of inflammation and immunity
to design better medications and improve treatment of progressive hearing loss."

Surgical trainees seeking formal research training face substantial challenges. Surgeon-scientists are an
underrepresented population in academic medicine, and federally funded physician-scientistâled research has
been in decline over the past decade. At the intersection of pediatric surgical care and scientific research, there
are very few research training opportunities for either surgical residents or PhD postdoctoral fellows. Surgical
resident training programs that incorporate protected time for dedicated experiential research training have
effectively contributed to the âpipelineâ of successful, independently funded surgeon-scientists. The proposed
Childrenâs Surgery Methodology And Research Training (C-SMART) Program will bring together the extensive
expertise at Northwestern Universityâs Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie
Childrenâs Hospital of Chicago (LCH) to create a multidisciplinary, 2-year research training program consisting
of (1) a Health Services and Outcomes Research (HSOR) Track and (2) a Basic Science and Translational (BTS)
Research Track. The C-SMART Program will synergize NUFSM resources with training collaboration with
opportunities within the growing LCH Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute. Over the past 10 years, we
have leveraged this collaboration and curated a pipeline for nearly a dozen surgical research trainees and PhD
postdoctoral fellows to pursue successful academic careers at the intersection of child health and surgery. During
the proposed 2-year, intensive training period, trainees in the C-SMART Program will be immersed in
multidisciplinary, experiential research training, using a team science approach, with tailored mentorship and
focused didactic teaching (e.g., symposia, lecture series, masterâs degree courses). Each trainee will have an
experienced and diverse Mentor Team of content, methodological, and clinical experts, tailored to their training
needs. The C-SMART Program core curriculum will include courses in study design and analytic approaches,
best practices and ethics in research, and career development. Trainees will participate in workshops, seminars,
and research training opportunities at NUFSM, LCH, and at relevant surgical and pediatric professional societies.
Trainees will design and execute research projects that culminate in presentations at major national conferences
and publications in high-impact journals. The program will leverage both Diversity & Inclusion and Pipeline
Committees to attract competitive applicants and foster the retention and success of trainees who are historically
underrepresented in surgery. Continuous monitoring and iterative program improvement will be achieved by
engaging a highly accomplished External Advisory Committee and through robust evaluation by Northwesternâs
Program Evaluation Core. The goal of the C-SMART Program is to increase the number of investigators who
successfully achieve academic careers as independently funded pediatric surgical scientists. NUFSM AND LCH
are uniquely positioned to ensure the success of the C-SMART Program and the continued development of
future childrenâs surgical scientific leaders."

This T32 regional postdoctoral training grant in eating disorders research is a competitive renewal application
for an Institutional Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA that was initially awarded in 2009. This multisite postdoctoral
training program aims to prepare the next generation of scientists to advance the field of eating disorders
research. The mortality risks and disease burden associated with eating disorders necessitate highly
innovative and impactful investigations conducted by well-trained scientists. Mechanistic studies of the
neurobiological, psychological, and environmental causes and maintenance factors of eating disorders that can
be targeted in novel treatment and prevention programs are especially critical and remain a focus of our
training program. This multidisciplinary T32 program combines the long-standing strengths of eating disorders
research programs at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN), the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL),
and Sanford Center for Biobehavioral Research (Fargo, ND) to train emerging scientists in state-of-the-art
research methods. Comprehensive training is provided in the context of mentored research and weekly T32
seminars as well as coursework. Trainees include 2 postdoctoral fellows at each site with training durations of
2-3 years. T32 faculty across the three sites include 23 experts in eating disorders and related conditions who
represent multiple disciplines including psychology, psychiatry, epidemiology, dietetics, neuroscience, and
biostatistics. Each postdoctoral fellow is paired with an on-site primary mentor as well as a multisite mentoring
team to identify and pursue individualized training goals. Training progress is monitored with the use of
Individual Development Plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. Through their mentored research
experiences, seminars, coursework, and on-site learning opportunities, postdoctoral fellows develop advanced
skills in conducting rigorous research, publishing manuscripts, and submitting grant applications. Multisite
collaborations are strongly supported. Research ethics, scientific rigor, and reproducibility are emphasized
throughout the training program, and diversity, equity, and inclusion are prioritized. Currently in its 14th year,
this T32 program continues to be successful with a competitive applicant pool and high levels of research
productivity among current and previous trainees in both publications and grant awards."

The era of screening for prostate cancer (PCa) using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) has led to an
increase in the detection of low-grade prostate cancers that pose little risk of either metastatic spread or death.
Additionally, these men may be now exposed to morbidities of over treatment with little or no benefit of
cancer-specific survival. Active surveillance (AS) has thus evolved as a recommended management strategy for
men with low grade disease, providing the benefit of an individualized approach of carefully monitoring
disease progression, sufficient to permit timely therapeutic intervention. However, concerns about under-
grading, variations in criteria for AS eligibility, patient reported anxiety, depression, doubts about the possible
progression of the disease as well as higher decisional conflict regarding selection of AS, men on AS have been
reported to ultimately opt for treatment without any major change in tumor characteristics. On the other hand,
men on AS are a subgroup, who are highly motivated and eager to make positive lifestyle
changes to further reduce their risk of PCa progression- providing an opportunity for
chemoprevention. Chemoprevention strategies with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors significantly reduced the
risk of prostate cancer progression. However their use was also associated with increased detection of high-
grade disease, severely limiting their clinical adoption. Currently, there is a paucity of research that
systematically examines agents for chemoprevention in men on AS. Green tea catechins (GTC)
influence several hallmarks of carcinogenesis, including prostate carcinogenesis, with an acceptable safety
profile, making them attractive candidates for PCa chemoprevention. Several epidemiological, in vitro,
preclinical and early phase trials completed by our team and others have shown that the GTC are potent
inhibitors of PCa carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, bioavailable in tissue and plasma, reduces
several intermediate biomarkers implicated in PCa progression and without toxicities at these doses. Based on
the available evidence, we hypothesize that men with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate who
meet the criteria for AS, who receive GTC at a dose of 800 mg EGCG per day (vs. placebo) for 24 months, will
have a significantly decreased rate of clinical progression. We will test this hypothesis using a rigorous
experimental design in a phase II, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and
potential mechanism by which GTC modulates clinical progression and the related biological biomarkers
relevant to PCa progression in men on AS for PCa. Positive results from this study will be critical
to inform development a phase III clinical trial and ultimately provide a strategy for secondary chemoprevention
in men on AS, for whom, currently, there are no options for reducing risk of progression to PCa."

 Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is the initiating or âtruncalâ event
in both the sporadic as well as hereditary type of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) and VHL â
associated tumors. pVHL forms an ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the HIF (Hypoxia-inducible Factor)
transcription factor for proteasomal degradation when oxygen is available. Deregulation of HIF, and
particularly HIF2Î±, drives pVHL-defective tumor formation in vivo. Drugs against the HIF-responsive gene
product, VEGF, have been approved for the treatment of ccRCC, but are not curative and have only modest
activity against VHLâassociated tumors. Earlier work by DF/HCC and NCI investigators credentialed HIF2Î±
as a driver in ccRCC and VHL disease and we have sought to bring HIF2Î± inhibitors to the clinic. Our
collaboration on the UO1 grant entitled âDeveloping a translational pipeline for patients with VHL mutated
malignanciesâ has served to enhance the understanding of this crucial transcription factor and facilitate clinical
development of HIF2Î± inhibitors.
 Over the last four years, DF/HCC and NCI investigators co-led two studies of a first-in-class inhibitor
belzutifan that established proof of concept that HIF2Î± can be drugged. In ccRCC, Dr. Choueiri led the
trial that showed that belzutifan was well tolerated and clinically active in a subset of heavily pre-treated
patients. Building on this work, Dr. Choueiri's leading the pivotal belzutifan trial in ccRCC patients who have
failed standard therapy (NCT04195750). The UO1 supported work of the Kaelin Lab has led to belzutifan
combination trials with approved drugs (e.g., NCT05468697). In a parallel effort, Drs. Linehan and Srinivasan
led, and DF/HCC investigators participated in, the phase 1/2 clinical trial that led to the FDA approval of
belzutifan in patients with VHL disease (NCT03401788). This rapid regulatory approval was made possible
by an NCI comparison of the historical experience of patients in the NCI VHL Family Database to those treated
with belzutifan at the NIH Clinical Research Center. This work elucidated the impact of targeting HIF2Î± in
VHL mutation driven tumors. All of these projects were facilitated by close collaborations with patient
advocates and industry colleagues at monthly UO1 meetings.
 In our current grant period, we have established a collection of precious, belzutifan-treated VHL and
ccRCC patient tumor samples; obtained from clinical trials co-led by UO1 investigators; that will enhance our
ability to execute our aims. Working in parallel with industry colleagues, our UO1 team will continue to pursue
the identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers that will enable the rational application
of HIF2Î± inhibitors. Novel combination regimens will be studied in parallel clinical trials and pre-clinical models
to facilitate translational research. The long-term significance and ultimate clinical impact of this work will
be to identify new therapeutic strategies for patients with VHLâassociated tumors."
10831449,"ABSTRACT
The National Academy of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health have called for urgent
action to improve the care delivered to the nearly 1,000,000 elderly Americans who die in
intensive care units (ICUs) annually, or survive with severe disabilities. The problems include: 1)
patients with a poor prognosis often receive more invasive, burdensome treatment than they
would choose for themselves; 2) family members acting as surrogate decision-makers find the
experience emotionally overwhelming and suffer lasting psychological distress; and 3) treatment
in ICUs contributes to high end-of-life health care costs. These problems are especially
important to elderly patients, whose willingness to undergo invasive, life-prolonging treatments
varies and hinges on highly personal values and preferences. Despite widespread recognition of
these problems, there are no readily-scalable interventions that are proven effective to assist
surrogates in ICUs. Over the last 3 years (R21AG050252), we used a multi-stakeholder process
to first develop, then iteratively refine the Family Support Tool, an interactive, web-based tool to
help family members of elderly, incapacitated patients navigate the emotional, psychological,
and cognitive complexities of being a surrogate decision-maker. We then established in a
single-center RCT that the intervention is feasible, acceptable, improves the quality of clinician-
family communication, and is perceived to be highly beneficial by surrogates in ICUs. We
propose to conduct an appropriately powered randomized clinical trial of the Family Support
Tool among the surrogates of 450 elderly, critically ill patients at high risk of death or severe
disability. In Aims 1 and 2, we will determine the effect of the Family Support Tool on patientsâ
clinical outcomes, surrogatesâ psychological outcomes, measures of decision quality, and end-
of-life healthcare utilization. In Aim 3, we will conduct a qualitative study in parallel with the RCT
to identify the contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators that may influence the efficacy of the
Family Support Tool. The research is highly significant because it will establish the efficacy of a
low-cost, scalable intervention to overcome major public health problems that affect hundreds of
thousands of Americans annually. This proposal is innovative because the intervention
challenges the existing paradigm of how to support surrogates facing difficult decisions near the
end of life. The work is feasible in our hands because our team of established investigators
successfully developed and pilot tested the Family Support Tool, has a proven record of
success conducting trials in ICUs, and has buy-in for participation from all sites."
10831562,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are associated with an increased
risk for seizures, status epilepticus (SE), and the development of chronic epilepsy. Our collaborative group has
developed the first animal model of viral-induced epilepsy. Mice (C57BL/6) who receive intra-cerebral
injections of Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus (TMEV) display acute spontaneous seizures several
days after infection, survive the initial infection and go on to develop spontaneous recurrent seizures.
Furthermore, our data from the last award period using C57BL/6 mice with various cytokines or cytokine
receptors knocked-out have shown that manipulations in the TNFÎ± system can significantly alter the pathologic
sequelae observed following TMEV injection. Therefore, we propose to test our overall hypothesis that
following TMEV infection, calcium dependent increases in production and release of TNFÎ± from microglia
activates the neuronal TNFÎ±R1 pathway, contributing to seizure generation. The proposed experiments will
lead to a greater understanding of the role of viral and immune contributions to acute seizures, altered
neuronal and microglial function, and epileptogenesis. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to test our
hypothesis, including, state of the art in vivo and in vitro 2 photon microscopy, calcium imaging, novel
transgenic mouse models, chronic video-EEG monitoring and brain slice electrophysiology to: 1) Determine the
time course and extent of physical changes, motility, and the development of spontaneous calcium transients
in microglia in TMEV infected mice during the acute infection period using GCAMP5G selectively expressed in
microglia; 2) Determine the mechanisms underlying calcium transients in activated microglia during the acute
infection period and the role of calcium transients in cytokine production; and 3) Determine if signaling through
the neuronal TNFÎ±R1 pathway underlies hippocampal excitability and seizure activity following TMEV
infection. We anticipate that these experiments will provide important new insight into the role of TNFÎ± and it's
receptor, TNFÎ±R1 in cell death, synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis and set the stage for the
development of novel therapeutic interventions for the prevention of infection induced epilepsy."

As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a
greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality
rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative
physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and
includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and
analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been
used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not
able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these
tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for
studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable
(angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex
activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our
model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based
antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual
population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood
pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have
conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of
resistant HTNânamely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible
for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of
success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA
population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test
the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing
and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test
the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy
markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance
because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of
therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and
the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad
implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations."
10861054,"Molecular mechanisms that initiate leading process and apical dendrite polarization
 during embryonic neuronal development
An early and essential event in mammalian embryonic brain development is neuronal polarization, in which distinct
axonal and dendritic compartments are formed. Axons and dendrites inherently differ in the molecular composition
of their cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and plasma membrane. These differences underlie the unique morphology and
function of these compartments, and are responsible for directed information flow in the brain. Aberrations in neuron
polarization lead to developmental neuropathologies, intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and
neuropsychiatric pathologies. Bipolar polarity establishment in postmitotic neocortical and hippocampal CA1
pyramidal neuron progenitors marks polarization of the axon and the apical dendrite. The apical dendrite will
develop from the leading process of the bipolar neuron whereas the trailing process will become the axon.
Specification of the axon has dominated studies on neuron polarization, yielding an understanding of the
mechanisms underlying axonal identity, its specification and growth. Much effort has also been directed towards
elucidation of the mechanisms that control later events in dendrite morphogenesis - growth, branching, and structural
plasticity. However, the events leading to bipolar polarity and the subsequent development of the apical dendrite,
have remained elusive. We propose that distinctly higher cyclic GMP (cGMP) generated via localized assembly of a
cGMP production machinery at the leading edge of developing pyramidal neurons, promotes bipolar polarity,
leading process formation, and apical dendrite development. Using state of the art lifetime decay FLIM-FRET
cGMP measurements in mouse developing pyramidal neurons in acute slice, combined with cutting edge genetic
manipulations, and localized, directed optogenetic manipulations of cGMP production, this study is designed to
determine the spatio-temporal regulation of cGMP during polarity establishment and apical dendrite development,
and to identify its mechanistic basis in developing pyramidal neurons in vivo. Our studies will provide important
advance in the understanding of the early molecular events that take place during axon and apical dendrite
establishment in principal excitatory neurons in the rodent brain, and will contribute to the identification of
molecular targets and development of therapeutics for developmental neuropathologies resulting from abnormal
axon and dendrite development."

Tuberculosis (TB) is both among the most transmissible causes of death and the leading cause of death due to
an infectious disease worldwide, making it the leading cause of death due to a curable disease. Control of the
pandemic thus requires not only faster and more effective diagnostic tests and cures, but also novel and
specific transmission blocking interventions. This project focuses on the latter, and seeks to identify conserved
and specific metabolic processes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, whose
inhibition has the potential to impair its survival during transmission from one host to the next. This project
specifically leverages Mtb's exclusive evolutionary history in humans as both host and only known reservoir,
which has made transmission not only an essential feature of its pathogenicity but intrinsic phase of its life
cycle that is essential for its survival as a species. Despite its erratic and seemingly heterogeneous nature, all
transmission events involve a number of transitions, such as changes in gas composition and desiccation
stress, that are comparatively invariant and highly repetitive in nature. We hypothesize that these changes
have resulted in the evolutionary selection of specific and adaptive metabolic responses in Mtb that have
equipped it to predictably complete this essential but erratic phase of its life cycle, inhibition of which might
slow or prevent its spread. This project builds on preliminary data which have identified several such
responses and, in collaboration with other Projects and Cores in this Program Project, will now test their
essentiality for survival in a series of in vitro and animal models of aerosol transmission, and clinical relevance
as reported by clinical Mtb isolates recovered from epidemiologically defined settings and inferred levels of
transmissibility."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more people than any other
infectious disease each year. This is due, in large part, to its ability to spread from person to person through air
with an estimated infectious dose as low as one organism. Knowledge of the specific physico-chemical
conditions associated with Mtb's successful transmission through air from one host to another however
remains surprisingly incomplete. This project proposes to use applied mathematics, rheology, interfacial
physics, and novel fluid dynamics and droplet biophysics technologies to fill critical gaps in knowledge about
the in-host and between-host microenvironment of respirable droplets that can transmit Mtb. Knowledge of
such properties represents a conceptually powerful window into microbiological determinants of tuberculosis
(TB) transmission and novel transmission blocking interventions. These studies thus not only promise to shed
light on the fundamental environmental challenges faced by Mtb during its journey from one host to others, but,
in collaboration with other projects and cores in this application, will also enable the development of new and
sorely needed technologies for improved in vitro and animal models with which to enable experimental studies
of TB transmission and novel transmission blocking interventions."

There is substantive variation in preschoolerâs understanding of the core number concepts (e.g.,
cardinality) and associated skills (e.g., counting; Geary & VanMarle 2016) that are predictive of later
individual differences in readiness to learn formal math at school entry (Geary et al. 2018) and risk of
math LD (Chu et al. 2019). Child-centered interventions reduce these gaps (Dumas et al. 2019) but suffer
from fade out and thus do not typically confer long-term benefits (Bailey, 2019). Similar fade out is found
with individual therapy with young offenders, but sustained gains can be achieved with multisystemic
interventions involving the child, home environment, and school (Henggeler et al. 2009), and it is time to
consider this approach for LD. The proposed project will provide a unique and much-need foundation for
the development of multisystemic â including child, parents, home, and school â interventions for
preschoolers who are at risk for long-term math difficulties, including math LD. The home component
will provide the most thorough assessment ever conducted of the numeracy-related home environment,
including assessment of parentâs math achievement and the complexity of the math-talk with their
children, as related to preschoolersâ core conceptual number development (Zippert & Rittle-Johnson
2020). The classroom component will include teacher-report and direct observation of studentsâ
engagement in learning opportunities and the complexity of the math presented in classrooms. The child-
centered assessments will focus on the longitudinal development of the core number knowledge and
quantitative skills that predict later school readiness for math learning and risk of math LD (Chu et al.
2019; Geary et al. 2018). This ambitious combination will enable the first-ever dynamic assessment of the
multiple contextual and child-centered factors that contribute to childrenâs early math development,
including factors that indicate risk of later math LD. Unique features include direct assessment of parentsâ
math competencies; assessments of child-evocative effects (e.g., does childrenâs number knowledge
predict longitudinal change in the complexity of parent-child number talk?); and assessments of studentsâ
engagement in preschool classrooms. In all, the focus on core quantitative knowledge and skills,
combined assessments of parents, the home environment, classroom engagement and learning
experiences, and child characteristics will provide the broadest and most thorough study to date of the
multiple influences on early mathematical development and preparation for school entry and risk of math
LD. The combination will provide the foundation for early multisystemic interventions to better prepare
at-risk children for math learning."

approach, but most research and training is focused on child-centered factors, such as the development of
specific academic competencies or general abilities, such as working memory, that contribute to this
development. Although training in these areas is critical, it is relatively narrow and might lead to
researchers overlooking contextual factors that could contribute to the development of core early
quantitative competencies that support school readiness and risk of math LD. These contextual factors
likely include the attitudes and math competencies that parents bring to parent-child conservations about
mathematics, the home environment as related academic development generally, and studentsâ
engagement in classroom settings (Gray et al., 2017; Zippert & Rittle-Johnson 2020). To facilitate the
next generationsâ consideration of the multisystemic factors that influence math learning and risk of math
LD, graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar will receive training and experiences in child-centered,
parent- and home-centered, and classroom engagement assessments. An early assistant professor (Co-I
Rodrigues) who specializes in fractions interventions for students with math LD will serve as a mentee to
become familiar with the early mathematics development literature and through this expand her capacity
to broadly contribute to future math LD research. She will also work with the team, graduate students, and
the post-doctoral scholar on planning a multisystemic intervention for preschoolers who are at risk for
long-term difficulties with learning mathematics based on results from a multisystemic (including
children, parents, home environment, and classroom experiences) longitudinal study of early mathematics
development. The PI and Co-Is have broad expertise in cognitive science, parent-child dynamics, public

A large body of research has led to statistical models showing how movement velocity is encoded in the motor
cortex. However, forces also need to be controlled in harmony with motion when interacting with objects and
research has rarely focused on how the motor system coordinates both together. The simultaneous variation
of force and motion is incorporated in the definition of impedance. Our current neural models do not describe
impedance encoding, which limits our understanding of object interaction, an important aspect of human
behavior. The proposed research will develop new models of motor cortical impedance encoding during object
interaction. Using these new models to decode ongoing impedance signaling, we will substantiate an
advanced theory of impedance control used by the motor system to produce accurate object displacement in
response to the forces applied by the hand. This research bridges the expertise of Dr. Schwartz in
neurophysiology and of Dr. Hogan in robot control. Monkey subjects will perform tasks with real and virtual
tools that naturally encourage the use of impedance control. We will record the activity of motor cortical
neurons during these tasks and develop new mathematical models to describe the relation between neural
activity and force, motion and impedance. Results from electromyography recordings, joint angle
measurements and torque calculations, together with the neural models, will be used to better understand how
impedance is regulated at the level of muscles and joints. Contributions of stretch reflexes to impedance will be
studied and compared to the predictive impedance signaling decoded from motor cortex. This work promises
to extend our understanding of the neural control principles governing the way we use our arms and hands to
interact with our surroundings. These principles can be used to build new theories of the cognitive processes
used to predict and effect changes in the world around us. At the same time, elucidation of the neural and
mechanical details of forceful interaction will lead to new rehabilitative and neural prosthetic approaches to
paralysis."

Project background: This is a competing renewal R01 applicaton that proposes to study the cellular and
genetic origins of the most common adrenal disease, primary aldosteronism (PA). The prevalence of PA is 6-
8% amongst all hypertensive patients suggesting that 1 in 40 American adults has PA. PA is hallmarked by
renin-independent adrenal aldosterone production that results in excessive mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
activation. The two major subtypes of PA are unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral
idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). While PA resulting from APA has a surgical cure, IHA requires life-long
medical therapy using MR antagonists. There are no current therapeutic approaches that inhibit the disease-
causing inappropriate aldosterone production in IHA patients. During the initial funding period of this grant, we
made significant progress in defining genetic causes of PA. This includes the first in field use of a small cohort
of IHA formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) adrenal tissues that showed a buildup of activating somatic
mutations in CACNA1D (L-type calcium voltage-gated channel alpha 1D subunit). IHA CACNA1D mutations
were found in aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCC), a clonal adrenal dysplastic cellular entity that we
initially described in the zona glomerulosa (ZG) of normal adrenals. These findings form the foundation for this
competitive renewal application. Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define the aldosterone-driving somatic mutations
that initiate dysregulation of aldosterone production in a large cohort of normal adrenals (Ë 400). Aim 2 will
define the role of APCC and somatic gene mutations in bilateral adrenal IHA autonomous aldosterone
production. Aim 3 will evaluate the potential for calcium channel blockers (CCBs) to specifically target and
reduce autonomous aldosterone secretion in patients with IHA. Overall significance and clinical impact.
Despite the high prevalence of PA, its clear impact on cardiovascular disease, and intriguing new genetic
findings related to its cause, we know very little about the origin and progression of PA and particularly IHA.
Because IHA results from bilateral adrenal disease, there is no surgical cure. Current strategies, although
effective, do not target dysregulation of aldosterone release but instead target the MR, which can cause
unfavorable off target side effects. The proposed research would significantly improve our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms causing bilateral adrenal IHA and has the added potential of providing foundational
research for the development of novel therapeutics that could directly inhibit IHA adrenal renin-independent
aldosterone production."
10832978,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. The purpose of this K01 Award is to provide the candidate, Dr. Melissa N.
Slavin, at Columbia University School of Social Work, with the training needed to become an independent
substance use investigator in digital intervention science with a focus on sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
issues among vulnerable women, particularly women involved in criminal justice systems (WICJ). Dr. Slavin
proposes to adapt and determine the feasibility and acceptability of a digital intervention, which will include
facilitated group-based treatment via videoconference, and digital interactive activities, for reproductive-aged
women with a recent history of incarceration or community supervision. This intervention aims to reduce illicit
drug use and increase all forms of contraceptive use among women with substance use disorders (SUDs) and
unmet contraceptive needs (i.e., fecund, sexually active, and report not wanting more children or wanting to
delay the next child but are not using any method of contraception). WICJ, the majority of whom are reproductive-
aged, have high rates of SUDs and unmet contraceptive needs, influenced by synergistic individual-,
interpersonal-, and community-level risk factors. Unmet contraceptive needs result in unintended pregnancies
(UPs) among WICJ with SUDs, and increased rates of morbidity and mortality among women and their offspring.
Extant interventions among WICJ who use drugs often focus on sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including
HIV, while leaving out UPs. Among reproductive-aged women in general, digital interventions are effective at
reducing drug use and increasing contraceptive use, and can increase reliability of implementation, accessibility,
and personalization. Digital HIV-prevention interventions for WICJ who use drugs can provide a key platform to
address UPs among reproductive-aged women. Multimedia WORTH, an evidence-based HIV-prevention
intervention uses in-person groups and digital interactive activities to address risk factors among WICJ who use
drugs and is effective at increasing condom use. Dr. Slavin will adapt Multimedia WORTH for reproductive-aged
WICJ with SUDs and unmet contraceptive needs, using a digital intervention (facilitated group-based treatment
via videoconference, and self-paced activities) through 3 research aims (RAs): RA1: Identify modifiable
determinants of drug and contraceptive use among reproductive-aged WICJ via qualitative interviews; RA2:
Adapt Multimedia WORTH using a systematic adaptation framework; RA3. Evaluate feasibility, acceptability,
and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 50 WICJ. Data
obtained from this K01 will support the NIDA priority focus area of addressing real world complexities of addiction,
by targeting barriers to treatment relating to gender, age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity among
vulnerable WICJ. This K01 will provide Dr. Slavin training in: 1) adapting and implementing a culturally tailored
intervention, 2) conducting responsible research with vulnerable women, 3) utilizing a digital intervention to
address health disparities, and 4) quantitative and qualitative intervention evaluation research methodology."

 Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by an inflammatory reaction in and around pancreatic islets that is
followed by the selective destruction of insulin producing Î²-cells. The conventional wisdom suggests that
cytokines, released during islet inflammation, contribute to the development of autoimmune diabetes by directly
impairing b-cell function and reducing Î²-cell mass. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of islets with IL-1
alone, or in combination with IFN-g and/or TNF, results in an inhibition of insulin secretion and oxidative
metabolism, induction of DNA damage and a loss of Î²-cell viability that is mediated by iNOS expression and the
production of nitric oxide by Î²-cells. For over 30 years there has been an intense focus on determining the
mechanisms by which IL-1 damages Î²-cells, yet there is little direct evidence supporting a role for IL-1 in the
development of autoimmune diabetes. Pancreatic Î²-cells are terminally differentiated with a limited capacity for
self-renewal yet produce a hormone (insulin) that is essential for organismal survival. IL-1 is a pyrogenic cytokine
that is well known to induce fever and inflammation during infection and injury. If the Î²-cell response to IL-1 were
solely damaging, then most individuals would be highly susceptible to diabetes, as 90 % of the volume of blood
that enters the pancreas travels through islets (which represents 1% of the wet weight of the pancreas) such that
Î²-cells would be bathed in IL-1 during infection and injury. This application will test the hypothesis that there is a
physiological role for IL-1 signaling in Î²-cells that is designed to protect these cells from impending danger or
insult. By understanding the delicate balance between the damaging and protective actions of cytokines on Î²-
cell function and survival, we hope to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological roles of IL-1 signaling
in Î²-cells. There are thee aims that will test the hypotheses that: 1) the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin antioxidant
system protects b-cells from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; 2) nitric oxide, in a b-cell selective manner,
attenuates DNA damage response (DDR) signaling by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and
decreasing the levels ATP and NAD levels; and 3) IL-1 signaling promotes an adaptive protective response in
endocrine cells. A number of biochemical, molecular, immunological, cell biological, and transgenic techniques
will be utilized to investigate the cellular pathways through which nitric oxide and its reactive intermediates
participate in the protection of Î²-cells from damage. It is hoped that insights into the mechanisms controlling the
protective responses activated in Î²-cells following cytokine stimulation that are gained from these studies will
influence the design of therapeutic strategies aimed to activate protective pathways in b-cell as a mechanism to
limit the loss of function Î²-cell mass during the development of diabetes or recurrence of diabetes in the
transplantation setting."

The proposed research leverages a well-accepted clinical service of highly trained and embedded clinicians â hospital chaplains â to deliver an adapted, evidence-based compassion meditation program, CBCT (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training), for blood cancer patients hospitalized for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Due to chemotherapy-induced toxicity and early post-transplant complications, patients receiving HSCT experience a multitude of acute physical symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life and psychosocial well-being.

The central tenet of this proposal is that chaplain-delivery of CBCT at the hospital bedside will reduce several significant barriers to accessing meditation, including for racial and ethnic groups and for low-income patients who typically encounter barriers to access, as well as for patients during initial diagnosis and treatment who are least likely to engage in integrative interventions. The research objective is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of CBCT delivered by hospital chaplains at the bedside during HSCT, and to evaluate changes in depression and quality of life in patients receiving CBCT. The concomitant career training will allow the PI to develop the expertise to identify novel points of entry for integrative approaches to improve well-being and quality of life during and after cancer treatment, to adapt and optimize interventions for embedded delivery, and to evaluate clinically relevant outcomes. When paired with her expertise in mind-body science and the biological bases of social connection, as well as continued hands-on training in psychoneuroimmunology and contemplative science, the PI will pursue a long-term research program to evaluate integrative approaches to well-being in the hospital. Therefore, this award would allow the PI to accomplish her goal of becoming an independent, academic research investigator, while advancing the research objective of identifying, optimizing, and evaluating a novel hospital-based approach to reduce depression and improve quality of life during cancer treatment."
10834226,"Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription
regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years,
and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety
of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation
of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and
cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a
limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein-
peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and
on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is
challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by
innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve
four goals:
Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful
application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not
been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of
freedom in peptides.
Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will
construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable
experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at
much lower cost.
Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software
package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost.
Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide
leads by targeting Î²-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator
whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology."
10834741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection causes an estimated 610,000 human cancers globally every year. HPV
accounts for nearly all cervical and anal squamous cell carcinomas, increasing rates of head and neck squamous
cell carcinomas, and a subset of other anogenital squamous carcinomas â all with relatively heterogenous clinical
outcomes due to a lack of personalized care. My goal is to use a pan-cancer cohort of patients to define the
molecular heterogeneity shared across HPV-associated anatomic sites. Analyses that integrate many
genomic variables across patient cohorts, powered by next-generation sequencing, have successfully
ascertained genomic perturbations in individual tumor types. However, few studies have focused particularly
on genomic changes across HPV(+) cancers of differing anatomical origin. Additionally, there is little
genomic data available to analyze these differences in anogenital cancers. While large scale collaborative efforts
to investigate the molecular landscape of head and neck cancers have been successful, the specific genomic
changes and clinical outcomes attributable to HPV infection lack clarity due to smaller HPV(+) cohorts and
confounders like smoking. The HPV lifecycle is tightly linked to differentiation of the epithelial cells it infects. The
transformative potential of the oncogenic strains is classically attributed to expression of viral oncoproteins E6
and E7, which subsequently inactivate tumor suppressors TP53 and RB, respectively. However, while persistent
infection with high-risk HPV types and expression of E6/E7 proteins are capable of cellular immortalization in
vitro and are necessary in the formation of tumors, these events alone are insufficient for cancer development
in vivo. Thus, viral and host genomic changes must occur alongside HPV infection. It is my hypothesis that
the molecular heterogeneity of HPV-associated tumors is shared across anatomic sites and can be used
to subclassify these cancers based on therapeutically meaningful pathways. To test this, integrative
analyses of HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors will be employed using hybrid-capture sequencing across extensive
cohorts of cervical, oral, and anogenital tumors. Specifically, paired-end DNA sequencing using probes specific
to hundreds of genes commonly involved in cancer will be used to identify potential driver somatic mutations and
copy number alterations in these tumors (Aim I). Novel genomic changes determined here will then be examined
in context with other known biologically pathways and molecular perturbations in HPV-associated cancers. Next,
probes specific to the HPV genome will be used to assess viral properties such as strain, viral load, and
integration events within and across tumor types (Aim II). Finally, the prognostic effect of oncogenic PIK3CA
alterations will be determined through integration of clinical variables and overall survival using multivariate
modeling (Aim III). This unique training opportunity and exemplary mentoring environment will ensure my
complete development as a physician-scientist in clinical genomics working to identify novel means of
subclassifying patients in order to tailor treatments and improve outcomes."

An Epidermal Microfluidic Screening Panel for
Diabetic Kidney Disease
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common, multifaceted condition affecting an estimated 451 million individuals
worldwide in 2017, with Type-2 DM (T2D) comprising an estimated 90% of the patient population. T2D is
associated with substantial adverse health outcomes, onset of DM-related comorbidities, and premature
mortality. Clinicians have primarily relied upon self-reporting assessments from patients to evaluate adherence
to prescribed treatments. This reliance on self-reported data limits therapeutic development and clinical
interventions. The advent of wearable continuous glucose monitors (CGM) offers enhanced clinical insight by
monitoring the relationship between changes in blood glucose levels and real-world behaviors; however, this is
only a partial window. There is a critical need for improved measurement methods that will evaluate diabetes
associated complications such as
diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
before they occur in the home or activity-
relevant setting. The simultaneous real-time monitoring of other biomarkers in addition to glucose is required to
provide enhanced clinical understanding and intervention for DM-related disorders. Sweat contains a wealth of
biomarkers relevant to health status, including electrolytes, metabolites, organic compounds,
inflammatory/stress biomarkers, proteins and hormones. The potential advantage of personalized assessment
of sweat biomarkers as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for expanding clinical and therapeutic understanding of DM
and DM-related disorders is profound. Unlocking the potential of sweat as a non-invasive target in precision
medicine for DM-related conditions requires the ability to collect and store sweat over time without contamination
from subjects and the ability to quantify various biomarkers from the collected sweat accurately and promptly in
a wearable form-factor. We hypothesize that continuous electrolyte and sweat rate measurements will
provide actionable information for DM-patients both during exercise and during free-living conditions.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to develop a new wearable sensor through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will
test whether biometric signals relevant to
DKD
can be quantitatively measured in sweat via passive
sampling. This effort will test if identified biochemical analytes present in ultra-low concentrations can be
measured in sweat sampled passively with sufficient precision to serve as markers for
DKD
. Aim 2 will develop
a wearable prototype platform for
DKD
condition monitoring. We will use the sensing requirements identified
in Aim 1 to design sensors for integration into a wearable device form factor to permit sweat analysis without
requiring the use of centralized laboratory facilities and expensive analytical equipment. Aim 3 will characterize
sweat biomarkers as potential quantitative measures of
DKD
. The wearable prototype developed in Aim 2
will support measurement of target sweat biomarkers in a pilot validation study."

 Deuterium labeled medicines are being used to develop safer alternatives to existing therapeutics and
improve the safety of current drug candidates. Despite the tremendous promise that novel deuterated small
molecules have in the development of new medicines, methods to incorporate deuterium into molecular scaffolds
are primitive. While the synthetic organic chemistry community has grown accustom to highly selective transition
metal-catalyzed reactions for the creation of new CâC, CâO and CâN bonds, deuterium installation should also
be possible with full stereocontrol and minimal over- and under-deuteration impurities. Not only is highly selective
deuteration rare, but spectroscopic techniques to support advances in this field are inadequate. We are launching
a holistic research program to not only develop highly selective reactions for deuterium incorporation but pioneer
the expansion of analytical techniques required to support the development and use of these reactions among
the broader scientific community. Through our established collaboration with leaders in the spectroscopy field,
we have started to develop analytical techniques that provide the foundation for accurate characterization and
identification of deuterated small molecules. Our preliminary studies indicate that deuterium can be installed
precisely into small molecules. In many cases, isotopomer and isotopologue impurities are so minimal that they
are nearly undetectable. Our research is now positioned for expansion into broader classes of organic molecules.
We will develop new Cu-catalyzed transformations for the selective deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes
and alkynes. These transformations will precisely insert deuterium in a small molecule and be compatible with
compounds that contain functionality commonly found in small molecule drugs. We anticipate that in the next 5
years, our synthetic strategies and analytical methods will address significant portions of the outlined
considerations. This will drastically expand the development of novel deuterated therapeutics to address many
of the safety and tolerability problems plaguing modern medicine.
 Beyond deuterium incorporation, we are proposing to develop new reactions for the regioselective
hydrofunctionalization of internal aryl alkynes. Powerful methods for regioselective Cu-catalyzed alkyne
hydrofunctionalization exist but are mostly limited to terminal alkynes and symmetrical internal alkynes.
Consequently, there exists a major void in the synthesis of a-substituted styrenes. To access these molecules
from alkynes, we are proposing to develop a-selective Cu-catalyzed internal aryl alkyne hydrofunctionalization
reactions. The research will benefit from deuteration studies performed in our group to develop new Cu-catalyzed
alkyne hydrodeuteration reactions. The unprecedented regioselectivities obtained in our ongoing investigations
will serve as the starting point for developing the proposed Cu-catalyzed a-selective internal aryl alkyne
hydrofunctionalization reactions."

Adults with Alzheimerâs diseases and related dementia (ADRD) are among the most vulnerable individuals
from the pandemic. Both formal and informal care for adults with ADRD has been profoundly affected by the
Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the need of frequent hands-on care for these adults due to their limitations in
physical and cognitive functioning, in-home care services are limited and nursing home care has been risky
during the pandemic. The social and economic circumstances of many families also have been changed due to
the pandemic and hence their resources to care for a family member with ADRD. Disrupted care for adults with
ADRD may have adverse health consequences that may last beyond the pandemic period. A better
understanding of the effects of the pandemic on the dynamics between formal and informal care is critically
important to address unmet care needs for adults with ADRD during and after the pandemic.
We will first create a contextual measure of exposure to the pandemic (pre-, low-, high-, post-exposure) by
taking into account the infection risks of the virus in the local area and develop a tailored geographic boundary
for each individual that encompasses health and healthcare implications more directly relevant to the
individual. We will then examine differences in healthcare utilization associated with the level of exposure to
the pandemic. We will also assess the mediating and moderating role of formal and informal care resources
(e.g., hospital capacity, family availability) in the pandemicâs effects on healthcare utilization. It will then
examine the extent to which health, mortality, and healthcare costs of adults with ADRD were affected by the
exposure to the pandemic, including potential differential effects across demographic (gender, racial/ethnic)
and economic groups.
The proposed study uses an innovative, comprehensive approach to assess the Covid-19 pandemic effects. It
will develop a fine-grained contextual measure of exposure to the pandemic by using a daily infection risk in a
local area (tract, ZIP code, county) where an adult with ADRD lives and addressing spillover effects of
neighboring areas. It provides a nuanced understanding of the pandemicâs effect on healthcare utilization by
incorporating information on the time-course of dementia (exposure at the onset vs. exposure during the
subsequent years of dementia).
The study will provide important data on the underlying mechanisms of the pandemicâs effect on healthcare
utilization and health, and will identify sociodemographic and economic groups that are the most affected.
Therefore, it will inform health policies and intervention programs aimed at improving healthcare systems to
mitigate adverse effects of the pandemic and to reduce disparities in healthcare and health outcomes.

In the face of increasing data sizes, sketching techniques such as MinHash sketching and its winnowed
version have been among the most effective in facilitating scalabile analysis. Frequently though, bioinformatic
algorithms using these techniques do not account for the randomness inherent in both the sketching process
and in the mutation processes that generate the data (e.g. sequencing errors or evolutionary mutations). This
project directly addresses this limitation by laying the statistical foundations for how these sketching
approaches interact with mutation processes and k-mer based techniques, resulting in new algorithms for
important biomedical problems. Aim 1 derives, for the first time, confidence and prediction intervals for
frequently utilized sketching-based bioinformatics quantities that until now existed only as point estimates.To
do so, it relies on sophisticated techniques from probability theory. The mathematical foundations laid by Aim 1
will not only help us achieve the biological aims of this proposal, but will also serve as a basis for quantifying
the performance of future sketching-based bioinformatics algorithms. Aim 2 will then use these results to
develop the first metagenomic taxonomic profiling algorithm that accounts for the uncertainty present when
predicting the presence and relative abundance of microorganisms in a sample. This will resolve a
long-standing issue in this field by providing researchers an informed way to filter their noisy data without
sacrificing sensitivity, thereby facilitating biomedical discoveries (e.g. novel CRISPR systems). In addition, this
aim will result in the first scalable method to quickly estimate the fraction of a metagenomic sample that is not
described by current reference databases, thus illuminating which datasets contain the highest quantity of
novel genetic material and hence possibility for biological discovery (e.g. novel antibiotics). Aim 2 will be
achieved using techniques from compressive sensing as well as probability theory. Aim 3 will both use and
extend the results of Aim 1 to quantifiably improve one of the most fundamental tools in a computational
biologistâs toolkit: sequence alignment. This will equip modern sequence aligners with much needed
significance scores and confidence intervals, as well as allow for the automatic selection of parameter settings
to achieve a desired precision or recall. Due to their ubiquity in biomedical research, even a small improvement
in the accuracy and features of an aligner will have tremendous impact. Aim 3 will be achieved using
techniques from probabilistic algorithms. Finally, the long-term objective of this proposal is to provide
researchers a toolkit that enables the development of scalable k-mer-based sketching algorithms without
sacrificing their ability to quantify statistical significance."

Heart failure (HF) is a significant chronic health issue with the most prevalent cause of preventable
hospitalizations, linked to insurmountable health care costs. Cardiac resynchronization therapy
with a defibrillator (BIV-CRT) has been shown to improve outcomes of HF patients with severely
reduced left ventricular function, however it was shown to be less beneficial in a subset of patients
with right bundle branch block (RBBB) ECG morphology. His-bundle corrective pacing for cardiac
resynchronization (His-BIV) is an emerging technology that could be especially helpful in patients
with RBBB ECG pattern in whom BIV-CRT is less optimal. However, data are limited on the
efficacy and on the mechanism of action of His-CRT as compared to BIV-CRT. Therefore, we
propose a randomized mechanistic clinical trial to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and
mechanisms of His-CRT vs. BIV-CRT on electrical and mechanical resynchronization in 120 HF
patients with severely reduced left ventricular function, wide QRS, and RBBB ECG morphology.
The primary aim of this trial is to prospectively evaluate whether His-CRT is more effective
improving LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months than BIV-CRT in HF patients with RBBB.
Our secondary aim includes assessing the mechanism of benefit with His-CRT vs. BIV-CRT by
evaluating changes in ECG biomarkers, serum biomarkers, and echocardiography biomarkers.
Our tertiary aim is to evaluate the temporal development of the biological processes of electrical
and mechanical resynchronization with His-CRT vs. BIV-CRT, including temporal changes of
ECG biomarkers, NT-proBNP levels, and improvement in functional status and quality of life at 6,
12, and 24 months following device implantation with His-CRT as compared to BIV-CRT.
Safety assessment will include serious adverse events, implant procedure-related complications,
and evaluation of device and implanted lead parameters during follow-up.
Study population will include 120 HF patients with RBBB randomized to His-CRT vs. BIV-CRT in
a 1:1 ratio. We will be collecting echocardiography data at baseline and 6-month, and serial ECG
data at 6, 12, and 24 months, analyzed by central core laboratories. High-volume, experienced
centers with implanted device track records and research infrastructure will participate, with
implantation of His-CRT and BIV-CRT performed according to standard of care."

There is a high global burden of untreated postpartum depression. Untreated postpartum depression presents
acute and long-term risks to a mother's mental and physical health, as well as her child's survival, health, and
development. Although there is increasing willingness among funders and health systems to involve non-
specialists, such as community health workers, in the delivery of psychological interventions for postpartum
depression, the outcomes of these non-specialist interventions have been mixed. Digital technology, specifically
the use of passive sensing data collection to learn more about a mother's life and support behavior change, has
the potential to improve the effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by non-specialists. For the
proposed R21/R33, we will build on preliminary development work of Sensing Technologies for Maternal
Depression Treatment in Low Resource Settings (StandStrong) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and
functionality for postpartum depression treatment in Nepal. StandStrong is a digital platform consisting of two
mobile apps, internet-of-things (IoT) passive sensors, and a data analysis engine built using modern machine
learning approaches. StandStrong incorporates passive sensing data collection from mothers and their infants
that can be monitored by non-specialist counselors and then incorporated to better personalize psychological
treatment. For Aim 1 (R21 phase), we will use human-centered design to iteratively refine the StandStrong
platform and associated implementation material. For Aim 2 (R21 phase), we will evaluate the StandStrong
platform and associated contents according to acceptability, feasibility, usage, benefit, and validity. If milestones
are met for the R21, we will proceed to the R33 stage, in which we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT) comparing a psychological treatment as usual with the psychological treatment supplemented by the
StandStrong passive sensing platform with 112 depressed mothers (56 in each arm). For Aim 3 (R33 phase),
we will identify parameters for sustainability and scalability through engagement of policy, healthcare, and
telecom stakeholders, as well as costing the intervention and building mHealth research capacity. Successful
completion contributes to the NIMH's 2020 Strategic Plan to tailor existing interventions and develop innovative
service deliver for diverse populations. This project will contribute to NIMH's Opportunities and Challenges of
Developing Information Technologies through improving treatment of mental illness through use of passive
sensing technologies."

An estimated 37 million people (15% of the population) in the United States have chronic kidney disease. There are currently no specific interventions to decrease the progression of chronic kidney disease, which ultimately leads to renal failure necessitating kidney transplant or dialysis. Regardless of underlying etiology, advancing CKD ultimately results in irreversible nephron loss and renal fibrosis. Fibrosis is part of the normal repair process triggered in response to injury, and dysregulation of this process results in the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, primarily collagens. Current therapies have limited effectiveness and at most delay the progression of chronic kidney disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the early accumulation of ECM proteins in renal fibrosis will inform novel therapeutic approaches to CKD. Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that conditional loss of the miR-17~92 cluster (comprised of miR-17, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a) in nephron progenitors and their derivatives results in renal hypodysplasia and chronic kidney disease in mice. We now have preliminary data that inducible loss of miR-17~92 in adult renal epithelia results in increased susceptibility to renal fibrosis, and conversely that inducible gain of miR-17~92 in adult renal epithelia is protective against renal fibrosis. Our central hypothesis is that miR-17~92 in renal epithelia functions to limit renal fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine whether the miR-17~92 cluster is sufficient to protect against renal fibrosis in mice."

This application requests funding to support the purchase of a new PET radiochemistry synthesis system for the
production of investigational carbon-11 radiotracers. The system will be installed at the Vanderbilt University
Institute of Imaging Scienceâs Radiochemistry Core (RCC) facility; a core that allows access to research
radiotracers for use on three human PET/CT imaging systems, two pre-clinical PET imaging systems and a
variety of other end uses. The core also offers expertise in allowing investigators to develop novel radiotracers
for routine production. Currently, the RCC operates a GE TRACERlab FXc Pro as the sole automated system
capable of manufacture of carbon-11 radiotracers, which are extensively utilized by Vanderbilt researchers.
Specifically, [11C]PIB, a radiotracer targeting beta-amyloid, is currently produced at maximum capacity with this
single-system and additional capacity for manufacture of carbon-11 radiotracers is in high demand. Additional
carbon-11 capacity would allow for higher throughput for pre-clinical and clinical research at Vanderbilt and
support further projects that would not only benefit Vanderbilt researchers, but also maximize the use of the PET
scanners at VUIIS. Furthermore, breakage or extended down-time of the FXc Pro would cause major disruptions
to the coreâs ability to support all ongoing and future NIH-funded studies that use carbon-11 radiotracers. Thus,
the proposed carbon-11 production system was chosen to augment the current carbon-11 capacity. The selected
system, composed of a FX2 MeI, FX2 M, and FASTlab 2, would substantially advance our radiotracer production
capabilities to support ongoing and future NIH-funded research. The addition of the FASTlab 2 portion of the
combined system allows for dual-productions of [11C]PIB in a single setup, which would enable multiple dual-
tracer studies (amyloid/tau) to be conducted in a single day. This upgraded capability would provide more reliable
production of some of the most requested radiotracers and allow for smooth integration of newly developed
radiotracers to support ongoing and future NIH-funded research, ranging from studying the molecular basis of
cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases to developing novel therapeutic approaches."
10896372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder with many pathogenic elements. One contributing factor is
vascular dysfunction, which can be both a result of the primary AD pathogenesis and a cause of neuronal loss
and subsequent cognitive impairment. The molecular mechanisms by which AD and the vascular system
intersect and influence each other are still unclear. We have been working for two decades to try to better
define this molecular interaction.
We have shown that beta amyloid (AÎ²), the peptide that is a driver of AD, interacts with fibrinogen and
increases blood clot formation. These clots have an altered structure and are resistant to lysis. These
abnormal clots can contribute to reduced blood flow and increased inflammation, both of which could
contribute to vascular contributions to AD.
We have now found that the AÎ²/fibrinogen complexes can have toxic effects independent of clotting. In
hippocampal slice cultures, AÎ²/fibrinogen complexes are more toxic than either AÎ² or fibrinogen alone. These
results identify a new mechanism by which the interaction of AÎ² and fibrinogen can lead to neuronal
dysfunction.
Mutant and longer forms of AÎ² are sometimes much more toxic that the classical AÎ²42 and AÎ²40 species. We
show that some mutant forms of AÎ² that are more toxic interact much more strongly with fibrinogen. These AÎ²
variants provide an entrÃ©e for studying the mechanisms by which AÎ²/fibrinogen complexes are toxic in AD.
Therefore, our main goal is to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which AÎ² variants and their
fibrinogen complexes negatively affect the brain."

mission is to improve the quality, outcomes and value of rehabilitation care by fostering stakeholder-partnered
research within and across LHSs. LeaRRN will build upon a well-established infrastructure and collaborative
relationships at Brown, Pitt, and BU; faculty expertise in health services research, implementation science,
stakeholder engagement, and informatics; and established and emerging partnerships with a diverse group of
LHSs. LeaRRNâs overarching objective is to establish a national resource network to advance stakeholder-
partnered, rehabilitation LHS research to improve quality of care, demonstrate value, and enhance patient and
system outcomes. LeaRRN will include training to promote seven core LHS research competencies, including
(1) using a system science approach, (2) asking meaningful questions, (3) applying appropriate research
methods, (4) capitalizing on informatics, (5) championing research ethics, (6) optimizing quality improvement
and implementation science, and (7) engagement, leadership and research management. LeaRNN will also
support research innovation by convening health system stakeholders to identify priority topics to address
through mentored collaborations (i.e., LHS Scholar opportunities and pilot studies). Finally, through techniques
development, we will assess the needs of the rehabilitation research community, prioritize and design our
resources and activities to respond to those needs, and evaluate our impact. LeaRRNâs specific aims are to: 1)
create a LHS Innovation Hub that partners researchers with healthcare systems and engages stakeholders,
including patients, providers, administrators, payers, and policymakers, to develop rehabilitation-focused LHS
research questions; 2) provide funding and methodological/technical support for LHS Scholars and Pilot Study
Awardees to transform research ideas into full-scale studies conducted in real-world practice; and 3) develop a
knowledge repository, tailor LHS resources for rehabilitation and disseminate materials to advance best
practices in rehabilitation LHS research. LeaRRN will serve as a resource and incubator for rehabilitation
researchers interested in LHS research. The knowledge repository, investigative experience, collaborations,
and evidence generated by LeaRRN will transform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of rehabilitation care."

Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes contribute to the pathogenesis of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies via production of the âoncometaboliteâ D-2-hydroxyglutarate
(D-2HG). D-2HG blocks differentiation of malignant cells by inhibiting alpha-ketoglutarate (ï¡KG)-dependent
enzymes that regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH
enzymes are promising new therapies for AML, but their efficacy remains limited to the subset of patients with
IDH mutations. This raises the question as to whether analogous metabolic aberrations might contribute to
leukemogenesis in IDH-wildtype AML. Intriguingly, 2HG is a chiral molecule that can exist in either the D- or L-
enantiomer. Although cancer-associated IDH mutants exclusively produce D-2HG, biochemical studies
indicate that L-2HG can function as a ~10-fold more potent inhibitor of many ï¡KG-dependent enzymes,
including chromatin modifiers and regulators of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stability. However, biological
sources and activities of L-2HG have been poorly understood. We identified a metabolic pathway wherein
normal and malignant cells without IDH mutations selectively produce L-2HG in response to oxygen limitation
(a.k.a. hypoxia) through an unusual reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA). We show that
hypoxia-induced L-2HG enhances stability of HIF, increases repressive chromatin modifications, and blocks
differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. These findings suggest that L-2HG might account, at least in part, for
the importance of hypoxic niches, HIF, and LDHA in balancing self-renewal and differentiation of stem cell
populations, including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and leukemia stem cells. Thus, we
hypothesize that L-2HG functions as a metabolic signal that couples hypoxic niches to the
maintenance of normal blood stem cells and leukemia stem cells. This hypothesis will be rigorously
addressed in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanisms by which L-2HG regulates
blood cell differentiation in vitro. In this Aim, we will define the effects of L-2HG on gene expression and
chromatin structure and determine how these inputs balance HSPC stemness and lineage differentiation. Aim
2 will determine how L-2HG functions to control normal and malignant hematopoiesis in vivo. This Aim will use
novel genetically engineered mouse models that allow for tissue-specific, inducible manipulation of L-2HG
levels in order to dissect the role of L-2HG in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia. Aim 3 will elucidate the
oncogenic mechanisms and therapeutic potential of L-2HG in human leukemia. In this Aim, we will use primary
AML biospecimens and patient-derived xenografts to determine the mechanisms that lead to deregulated L-
2HG in a subset of AML and assess whether depleting L-2HG offers a promising strategy to treat human AML.
The proposed studies will offer fundamental insights into the metabolic control of normal and malignant stem
cell biology and expand the applicability of metabolic targeted therapies for leukemia and other cancers."
10843305,"Autophagy is a self-degradation process whereby cells can orderly clear defective organelles and recycle
macromolecules as a nutrient source. Autophagy is elevated and essential for the tumorigenic growth of KRAS-
mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), providing the rationale for clinical evaluation of the autophagy
inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for PDAC. Disappointingly, when used as monotherapy or in combination
with standard of care, HCQ has shown limited to no clinical efficacy for PDAC. We recently determined that the
treatment of PDAC with inhibitors of the key KRAS effector pathway, the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogenic activated
protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, unexpectedly caused further elevation of autophagy, rendering PDAC acutely
dependent on this process, and hypersensitive to autophagy inhibition. We determined that ERK inhibition
impaired other critical processes that then led to compensatory upregulation of autophagy. Our findings, together
with essentially identical conclusions by another independent co-published study, have led to the initiation of
clinical trials evaluating either MEK (trametinib, binimetinib) or ERK (LY3214996) inhibitor in combination with
HCQ for metastatic KRAS-mutant PDAC. While early observations from compassionate use of this combination
support a significant clinical impact, our preliminary studies support our premise that we can improve upon this
therapy. We propose three aims to further advance autophagy inhibition as an anti-RAS therapeutic approach.
First, we will determine if the ERK MAPK + HCQ combination will be similarly effective in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF-
mutant CRC (Aim 1). HCQ is a lysosome inhibitor and consequently not selective for autophagy. We hypothesize
that inhibitors of the ULK1/2 serine/threonine protein kinases, key initiators of starvation-induced autophagy, will
act as more specific autophagy inhibitors. However, as with all protein kinase inhibitors, inhibitor-induced
compensatory mechanisms will promote resistance to ULK inhibitor efficacy. Additionally, a comprehensive
determination of ULK1/2 substrates remains to be completed. Thus, we will determine the direct and
compensatory effects of ULK inhibition on the phosphoproteome and kinome to critically evaluate ULK inhibitors
as autophagy inhibitors (Aim 2). Our Aim 3 studies are based on our application of a 2,500-gene druggable
genome CRISPR/Cas9 genetic-loss-of-function screen to identify genes that modulate CQ anti-tumor activity.
The identified hits that either enhance or reduce CQ growth inhibition activity represent candidate combinations
or biomarkers for CQ resistance, respectively. We have identified mediators of the DNA damage response and
cell cycle regulators as two major classes of resistance-promoting genes. We will mechanistically dissect these
relationships and determine how inhibition of members of these pathways influences autophagic flux. In
summary, our studies will enhance our understanding of autophagy regulation in cancer and aid in the
development of novel combination therapies to target autophagy for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers."

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a life-saving therapeutic tool and the most common form of allogeneic
transplantation in clinical practice. Despite ABO blood type matching, transfusion recipients can make
alloantibodies against non-ABO polymorphic RBC antigens. Such antibodies can result in significant morbidity
and even mortality, due to difficulty locating compatible RBC units, hemolytic transfusion reactions, or hemolytic
disease of the fetus and newborn. The burden of alloimmunization is high in patients requiring life-long chronic
transfusion therapy, such as those with sickle cell disease. Despite its medical importance, little is known about
what makes transfused RBCs capable of activating the immune system in order to generate alloantibodies. Using
a pre-clinical model, we discovered that mouse RBCs, after processing and storage in conditions that replicate
clinically used methods and storage solutions, activate splenic dendritic cells (DCs) in the spleen of transfusion
recipients. We further showed that activation of these DCs is required for alloimmunization by initiating CD4+ T
cell priming. DC activation does not occur if fresh RBCs (without storage but identical processing) are transfused.
Further, DC activation occurs even when stored RBCs lack an alloantigen. This led us to search for how stored
RBCs trigger innate immune receptors after transfusion. By testing numerous families of pattern recognition
receptors, we discovered that RBC alloimmunization requires the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling adaptor
molecule MyD88. MyD88 has also been implicated in the alloimmune responses in solid organ transplantation
by activating DCs for T cell priming; however, the nature of the ligands or the TLR relevant for graft rejection in
these systems remains unknown.
Using cell type specific MyD88 deletion, we found that DC and B cell, but not macrophage intrinsic MyD88
signaling is required to mount an alloantibody response. We ruled out a requirement for most MyD88 dependent
cytokine pathways in RBC alloimmunization; instead, our preliminary data suggest that particular TLRs are
necessary for the response to RBCs. Given the sterility of RBC units used for transfusion in patients and animal
models, we hypothesize that mammalian damaged self-molecules adhere to RBCs either during storage or after
transfusion into the recipient and trigger TLRs on B cells and DCs to induce alloimmunization. To test this
hypothesis, we will identify the immunostimulatory ligands on stored RBCs that are responsible for initiating the
alloantibody response. Our preliminary data using screening TLR cell reporter assays support that human RBCs
can activate select TLRs in vitro. We will determine TLR-dependent activation pathways in DCs and B cells
necessary for alloimmunization and will trial validated TLR inhibitors to see if we can avert alloimmunization in
our mouse model. Successful identification of RBC-derived TLR triggers would enable screening of RBCs with
immunostimulatory potential, as well as identifying new therapeutic targets to mitigate RBC alloimmunization."
10847843,"Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions in children are common, often co-occurring, and can lead to
lifelong challenges that impact quality of life. Moreover, psychiatric disorders that typically do not fully manifest
until adulthood, such as schizophrenia, have their roots in development. The relevance of brain development to
understanding psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions underscores the importance of supporting a
pipeline of investigators trained in research that characterizes when and how differences in brain development
manifest. The Duke-North Carolina Central University (NCCU)-Interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Training Program
in Child Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Conditions (DN-IPT) will focus on research training in
developmental approaches aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of child psychiatric and
neurodevelopmental conditions including research on developmental antecedents to adulthood psychiatric
disorders. The DN-IPT will enroll three new postdoctoral (MD, MD/PhD, and PhD) fellows per year to become
independent researchers through a 2â3-year course of training. The DN-IPT will provide Trainees with focused,
rigorous, in-depth training in a) our central theme of an interdisciplinary, developmental neuroscience research
approach; and b) one or more of five research methodologies to interrogate this theme: (1) brain imaging; (2)
computational approaches; (3) digital health; (4) interventions; and (5) preclinical models. Cutting across all
trainings, the DN-IPT will emphasize the core values of increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion. A key strength
of the DN-IPT is the partnership between Duke University School of Medicine (DUSM) and North Carolina Central
University (NCCU), one of the largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in the US, which is
co-located with the DUSM in Durham, NC. The strong DUSM-NCCU partnership is reflected in DN-IPT Faculty
Mentors and Trainees at both institutions, joint trainings and seminars, student research internships, and
Program Directors (MPIs) at both institutions. In addition, the DN-IPT will add needed geographic diversity to
NIMH T32 programs. Fewer than 10% of the NIMH-funded T32 programs are in US Southern states (while nearly
40% of the US population live in the South), limiting the recruitment and engagement of promising trainees. Our
concurrent focus on both child psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions is a unique and synergistic
strength of the DN-IPT in light of the high degree of co-occurrence of these conditions and their combined impact
on a wide range of outcomes. Finally, the DN-IPT will help fill the concerning gap in child psychiatrist-scientists.
We are particularly well positioned to recruit and train child psychiatrists with a child psychiatry residency that
includes physician scientists, strong institutional support to train physician scientists, and robust representation
of child psychiatrist-scientists in the DN-IPT. In sum, the DN-IPT will train the next generation of developmentally
oriented researchers, increasing the diversity of investigators, and setting the stage for advances in the diagnosis
and treatment of child psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions."

Macro-autophagy and mitophagy (a mitochondria-specific form of autophagy) are constitutively active in the
heart and essential to maintaining cardiomyocyte survival under stress by removing potentially harmful proteins
and organelles. Extensive studies suggested the occurrence of macro-autophagy and mitophagy impairment
early in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF), but its precise role in HF progression is unclear, and the
mechanism(s) of its origin remained elusive. We reported that the Sigma 1 receptor (Sigmar1) is a widely
expressed protein in the heart. We have reported that Sigmar1 possesses a physiological role in maintaining
healthy heart function, and Sigmar1 ablation results in cardiac contractile dysfunction. However, a myriad of
Sigmar1âs functions reported to date was based on the effects of Sigmar1 ligands (e.g., agonist/antagonist) in
non-cardiac cells, and some of these ligands elicited these effects even in Sigmar1 null cells. Therefore, despite
the wealth of published literature, the molecular mechanism and function of Sigmar1 in cardiac pathophysiology
remained unclear as all reported studies are correlative, limited to pharmacologic approaches using non-
selective ligands, and molecular mechanisms remained unknown. To determine the molecular function of
Sigmar1 in the heart under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, my laboratory recently generated
cardiac-specific Sigmar1 transgenic mouse and Sigmar1 conditional knockout mouse models. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that Sigmar1 is cardioprotective and can prevent HF pathogenesis by activating
macro-autophagy and mitophagy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: i) Aim 1 will determine how Sigmar1 activates macro-autophagy and mitophagy in the heart,
ii) Aim 2 will determine a novel function for Sigmar1 to protect the heart from ischemic and nonischemic HF.
Here, we will use a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches in conjunction with genetically
modified mice to define the physiological role of Sigmar1 in protecting the heart from pathological remodeling in
response to cardiac injury. As a result, we will be able to determine Sigmar1-mediated autophagy regulatory
mechanisms in the heart. These studies will uncover new mechanistic perspectives to approach HF
therapeutically and will also provide candidates for pharmacologic and genetic targeting."

Obesityis a global health problem that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,and
cancer.
As the main inducible thermogenic cell type capable of improving energy homeostasis in humans,
beige adipocytes are a potential therapeutic target to combat obesity and related comorbidities. A critical barrier
to the anti-obesity potential of beige fat is the limited understanding of the intercellular regulation of beige
adipogenesis in obesity. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a central regulator of adipose
remodeling. Here, we have identified a microRNA cluster, miR-130b and miR-301b, as an important
macrophage-derived suppressor of adipose tissue beigeing and energy metabolism. We found that miR-130b is
upregulated in subcutaneous ATMs of both humans and mouse models with obesity. Our recent published study
showed that mice lacking miR-130b/301b globally are protected from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and
glucose intolerance, concomitant with increased beigeing and decreased inflammation specifically in
subcutaneous fat depot. Further studies using myeloid-specific miR-130b/301b knockout mice showed that
deletion of miR-130b/301b specifically in myeloid cells resulted in nearly complete loss (~99%) of miR-130b in
adipose stem/stromal cells (ASCs) and in circulation, indicating that myeloid cells are the major source of miR-
130b. In vitro studies demonstrated that macrophages (MÏs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing miR-
130b that are taken up by ASCs, and miR-130b overexpression in ASCs suppresses beige differentiation likely
via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mitochondrial metabolism. However, detailed molecular
mechanism whereby miR-130b/301b, produced in myeloid cells, impacts beige adipogenesis and adipose tissue
inflammation in specific fat depots remain to be elucidated. We hypothesize that HFD increases MÏ-derived
miR-130b/301b which suppresses beige adipogenesis via EV-mediated transfer of miR-130b/301b into specific
ASCs and increases inflammation via modulation of MÏ polarization. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies using
MÏ-specific miR-130b/301b knockout mice and EV administration, our goals are to delineate cell-specific
actions of miR-130b/301b and explore therapeutic potential of EV-mediated miR-130b/301b inhibition in obesity.
Aim1 will test the hypothesis that HFD, opposed to cold, increases MÏ-derived EV uptake of miR-130b/301b
into the subtypes of adipose progenitors, impairing beige adipogenesis. Cell distribution of miR-130b/301b in
WT versus MÏ-specific miR-130b/301b KO mice will be assessed using miRNA flow cytometry and
miRNAScope. Single-cell RNAseq and MÏ/ASC co-culture will be performed. Aim2 will assess the roles of miR-
130b/30b in MÏ polarization and the underlying mechanisms. Aim3 will explore therapeutic potential of EV-
mediated miR-130b/301b inhibition in obesity and associated disorders. Results of these studies will provide
new knowledge about the cross-talk between macrophages and beige adipocyte development/function in obesity
and pave the way for using miR-130b/301b and their gene networks as novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers."
10842544,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Selenoproteins are prominently engaged in the integrated cellular response to stress. Here we focus on the ER-
bound membrane proteins selenoprotein K (selenok) and selenoprotein S (selenos), which are mostly known for
their connection to ER stress resolution. However, they also contribute to other cellular processes, such as
protein quality control, protein palmitoylation, cytokine secretion, immune response, calcium signaling, protein
trafficking, and differentiation. Consequently, their genetic variations are associated with heightened risks for -
among others- cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer, while their expression levels are tied to cancer
prognosis. However, there is no unifying and comprehensive view that plausibly spans their involvement in
multiple protein complexes and connects their seemingly disparate cellular roles.
Motivated by our work, we propose that selenok and selenos are putative ER-bound transcription factors. Upon
stimulation, they are processed and migrate to the nucleus to affect gene expression. To test selenokâs and
selenosâs direct involvement in gene transcription, we will determine their nuclear forms and evaluate their
interactions with nucleotides and transcription factors. We also suggest that in the ER membrane, selenok and
selenos contribute to protein quality control by acting as sensors of misfolded and misassembled proteins. There
are indications that the two selenoproteins act as accessory proteins of derlins, which are part of the ER-
associated degradation (ERAD) pore-forming complex. In this capacity, selenok and selenos could identify
âclientâ proteins for extraction through the ERADâs pore, delivering them to derlins and thus preventing harmful
accumulation. Based on preliminary experiments, selenok and selenos appear able to recognize certain protein
surfaces, such as hydrophobic leucine zippers, positive patches on armadillo domains, and b-propeller folds of
proteins. These ârecognitionâ surfaces are usually hidden when proteins are properly folded, and complexes are
well-assembled. However, when these systems fail to take on their intended forms, these surfaces get exposed.
Using a structural biology approach, we will characterize the complex of selenok, selenos, and derlin. To
substantiate this sensing function, we will investigate how the presence and absence of selenos influence the
interactions between representative degradable âclientsâ and derlins using in vivo photo-crosslinking of unnatural
amino acids at site-specific locations. In addition, we will study the interactome of the less characterized selenok
and identify its directly bound protein partners and enzymatic substrates.
These dual roles of selenok and selenos in gene transcription and ERAD sensing would explain how they can
influence numerous signaling pathways, engage with multiple protein complexes, and respond to cellular stress.
Altogether, this proposed research will provide fundamental insights into the rich diversity of selenium-based
redox biology and the specifics of cellular roles of selenok and selenos under normal and stressed conditions,
thus providing a molecular-level explanation of why they exert such a significant influence on human health."

Clostridioides difficile (formerly named Clostridium difficile) is a Gram-positive, spore-forming pathogen, and the
leading cause of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated intestinal infections. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection
(CDI) often follows antibiotic treatment and subsequent disruption of the resident intestinal microbiota, however
the rise of infections in healthy young adults suggests that there are additional factors that contribute to CDI. To
colonize the gastrointestinal tract, C. difficile must compete with both the host and members of the gut microbiota
for critical nutrients. Access to nutrient metals can profoundly impact the outcome of CDI as metals are required
cofactors for approximately 30% of all proteins. This fact is exploited by host metal binding proteins which
sequester nutrient metals to restrict microbial growth in a process termed nutritional immunity. A hallmark of CDI
is the secretion of potent toxins that cause severe damage to the gastrointestinal epithelium and trigger the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These events initiate the immune-mediated
recruitment of inflammatory factors to the site of infection. One of the most abundant inflammatory proteins that
accumulates at the site of CDI is calprotectin. Calprotectin is the most abundant protein in neutrophils and is a
component of nutritional immunity that directly inhibits microbial growth through nutrient metal sequestration.
Calprotectin is also a potent immunomodulatory protein, and a common clinical inflammatory biomarker whose
abundance correlates with CDI severity. It is unknown how the massive infiltration of calprotectin affects metal
availability in the gastrointestinal tract and shapes competition between C. difficile and members of the gut
microbiota. In addition, how C. difficile adapts to calprotectin-dependent metal limitation and resists nutritional
immunity during CDI remains unclear. We propose a model whereby nutrient metals make a critical contribution
to the outcome of CDI. Toxin driven inflammation drives the recruitment of immune cells into the gut which leads
to the accumulation of large amounts of CP. CP chelates available nutrient metals and exerts potent pro-
inflammatory activities. This massive inflammatory response and redistribution of nutrients alters C. difficile gene
expression and affects the interaction between C. difficile and members of the microbiota. Finally, we
hypothesize that C. difficile encodes multiple gene products that compete with both CP and the microbiota for
nutrient metals and this competition has a profound effect on the outcome of CDI. Experiments described in this
proposal will test this model and define the contribution of nutritional immunity to the pathogenesis of C. difficile,
determine the role of metal binding and immune cell recruitment in the protective properties of calprotectin, and
identify C. difficile genes required to compete with the microbiome for nutrient metals during inflammation.
Collectively, the findings from this proposal will inform the development of effective therapeutic or prevention
strategies for the treatment of CDI."

Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved behavior that is widely observed across the animal kingdom. It is
characterized by transitions between different vigilance states: wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and
non-REM (NREM) sleep. These transitions are controlled by interactions between different neuronal populations
and are under the influence of homeostatic and circadian mechanisms. As sleep has many beneficial and
restorative effects, good quality sleep is important for mental and physical health. It has been well-established
that stress and sleep have a bidirectional relationship. Stress is known to be a major cause of disrupted sleep.
Chronic sleep disruption can lead to an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders. The paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) contains corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRHPVN) neurons that have been
shown to be activated by stress. Central and systemic administration of CRH has been found to induce
wakefulness. Additional studies have found that central blockade of the CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) reduces the
wake-promoting effects of CRH injection, suggesting this receptor plays a key role in CRH-mediated arousal.
However, the neural mechanisms by which CRH neurons regulate wakefulness are not very well understood.
Tracing studies have revealed that CRHPVN neurons project to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), a
well-known sleep center containing neurons that are crucial for sleep regulation. In situ hybridization studies
have shown that CRHR1 is expressed in the POA. While CRH has been implicated as a regulator of wakefulness,
the role that CRHPVN neurons and their projections to the POA (CRHPVNâPOA) play in the sleep-wake cycle and
sleep homeostasis has not been fully investigated. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CRHPVN
neurons control wakefulness and impair the homeostatic response to sleep pressure following chronic stress.
To address this hypothesis, this proposal will use a genetic mouse model, CRH-Cre, to specifically label CRH
neurons, in vivo calcium imaging, optogenetic manipulations, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing techniques, and a
chronic social defeat stress paradigm to manipulate these neurons and their projections. Aim 1 will determine
the role of CRHPVNâPOA projections in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Aim 2 will investigate the role of CRHPVN
neurons and CRHPVNâPOA projections in sleep homeostasis following chronic stress. Understanding how CRHPVN
neurons promote wakefulness and regulate sleep homeostasis in response to chronic stress will further elucidate
how the circuits controlling stress are interconnected with those regulating sleep and wakefulness."

 The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has experienced unprecedented growth in research across the
United States and is rapidly emerging as a likely keystone biomedical model system in the next chapter of
scientific discovery. Over the past decade, the number of marmoset laboratories in the US has quadrupled.
There are now over 40 Principal Investigators who use marmoset as the model system in their research.
Neuroscience is the primary engine driving marmoset research today, as nearly three quarters of marmoset
researchers in the US use this model species to examine molecular, systems or cognitive functions in normal
and diseased brains. Although these grassroots have been successfully forged new paths of scientific inquiry
using marmosets in the U.S., critical bottlenecks have emerged that threaten to thwart the continued growth of
this emerging model system. We propose to establish a Bicoastal Marmoset Breeding center, with two
breeding colonies, one on the East Coast at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the other on the West Coast
at University of California at San Diego (UCSD). The Center aims to produce a large number of marmosets to
supply the marmoset research community in the U.S. Because of the non-availability of air transport of NHP in
U.S. and prohibitively expensive ground transportation of NHP between the east and west coast, these two
breeding colonies are strategically located to support the marmoset community in regions near each colony.
We believe such a center is needed to address the national shortage of marmosets in order for the marmoset
model to realize its full potential as a keystone species in the next chapter of neuroscience that serves to
accelerate the rate of discovery and better understand human neurological disease."
10845516,"Very preterm infants are prone to numerous medical complications with lifelong impact. Amongst the most
serious are severe intraventricular hemorrhage (sIVH) and the subsequent progression to posthemorrhagic
hydrocephalus (PHH). Currently, the only treatment for PHH is surgery, most commonly with shunts that are
prone to malfunction across the lifespan. Children with sIVH and PHH are also at high risk for intellectual
disability, behavioral problems, neurosensory impairment, cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Emerging evidence
suggests that the cellular and molecular events regulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, including CSF
secretion, propulsion and reabsorption, develop during the third trimester and the first few months postnatally.
Maturation of these highly subspecialized and metabolically active cellular processes spatially and temporally
overlaps with preterm birth and IVH, and are thus vulnerable to injury over an extended period. Most importantly,
these processes are responsive to neurorestorative interventions with re-purposed medications, raising the
possibility of using medical treatment after sIVH to prevent progression to PHH and the need for shunts.
Preclinical data show that melatonin (MLT) and erythropoietin (EPO), when administered in a sustained dosing
regimen, can prevent the hallmarks of progression from early postnatal sIVH to subsequent PHH, including
macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly. Combination therapy is required as neither agent alone prevents PHH. In
human preterm infants, MLT and EPO have been safely used as monotherapy in clinical trials with similar dosing
regimens. We propose a Phase I, single institution, randomized, double-blind trial for very preterm infants with
sIVH to define a safe combination dose of MLT and EPO. With IRB, IND and primary neonatologist approval,
and informed consent, a maximum of 60 very preterm neonates with sIVH will be enrolled, treated through
33w6/7d, and followed to 37w6/7d. Neonates will be randomized 3:1 between MLT+EPO and placebo, with all
receiving standard of care. Concurrent controls are needed due to fluctuations in preterm birth co-morbidities
and mortality. Masking is essential to reduce attribution bias. The primary endpoint is a composite serious
adverse event (SAE)/dose limiting toxicity (DLT) including death, potential MLT-realted DLT: severe liver function
abnormalities compared to age-matched peers with sIVH, and known EPO-related SAE: thrombosis,
polycythemia, and hypertension. No MLT-related SAE have emerged in clinical trials thus far. We hypothesize
that the MLT+EPO SAE/DLT rate will not be higher than the placebo rate. Secondary outcomes will be rate of
co-morbidities of preterm birth. Exploratory data, collected to guide design of future clinical trials for efficacy, will
include serial neuro-imaging metrics acquired from clinical images, serial neonatal neurodevelopmental
examinations, serum and urine MLT and EPO levels, and liquid biomarkers. Successful implementation of this
initial safety trial will provide essential data to guide the next stage of clinical trials to test if sustained MLT+EPO
treatment can reduce the need for surgical intervention, and avoid the lifelong burden of shunted hydrocephalus."

This project will provide rigorous scientific evidence on the effects, over the long-term, of
exposure to stressors on cognitive performance, physical and psychosocial health and well-
being of older adults in Indonesia using extremely rich population-representative longitudinal
data collected from about 12,000 older respondents (>40y) before and for 20 years after the
2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery
(STAR). The tsunami was a large and unanticipated natural disaster that devastated some
coastal communities while other comparable, nearby communities were untouched because of
the wave direction, land and seabed topography. Exposure to the tsunami is, therefore,
plausibly exogenous in our study area, coastal Aceh and North Sumatra, so that estimated
effects of exposure to the stress of the tsunami can be given a causal interpretation. We will
investigate how these effects vary with the nature of individual-specific experiences of the
tsunami including being caught up in the water, losing family and loss of economic livelihoods.
The research will document the extent of resilience and recovery among older adults in the face
of the tsunami and its aftermath, as well as the role played in these processes by individual,
household, family and community resources, including post-tsunami reconstruction.
Special attention is paid to the measurement and interpretation of cognition and health. All older
respondents will complete assessments used to screen for Alzheimer's disease which will be
clinically validated. For a randomly selected sub-sample of older respondents, the screeners will
be complemented with innovative neuroscience-based measures of executive functioning and
emotional control assessed on tablets in the home. Validated cardio-metabolic biological risks
will be collected for the same subsample of older adults to provide uniquely rich, high quality
measures of key outcomes designed for this research. The links between cognition and health
will be described using contemporaneous measures and exploiting longitudinal data on health
that reach back 15 years."

 Our proposal will develop the largest cohort of Adenosquamous cancer of the pancreas (ASCP) models
and characterize the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of this devastating tumor in comparison with that of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with the expectation of identifying epigenetic features that can be
exploited to selectively impair growth of cells of one or both subtypes. ASCP is a rare subtype of pancreatic
cancer representing 2-4% of all pancreatic cancers with an incidence rate of < 1 case per 100,000 people per
year. Strikingly, ASCP displays a higher metastatic potential and a worse clinical outcome than the more
common (90-95% of cases) PDAC. Yet, a large population-based analysis did not detect any differences in
tumor stage at the time of diagnosis between PDAC and ASCP. Despite aggressive surgical management for
those few patients who present with resectable disease, the median survival has been reported to be
consistently less than 1 year. Furthermore, no standard adjuvant therapy, or first line therapies for metastatic
patients, has been established for this aggressive subtype of pancreatic cancer. Our preliminary observations
suggest a unique ASCP genomic and epigenomic landscape and demonstrate how our molecular studies can
identify candidate therapeutic targets and strategies for this dismal cancer that we now aim to validate using
unique preclinical ASCP models. It is our HYPOTHESIS that ASCP evolve from the same lineage as PDACs
yet contain distinct epigenomic features driving the aggressive phenotype of ASCP. We propose that
modulating ASCP epigenome will sensitize ASCP cells to existing chemotherapies (e.g., gemcitabine and
irinotecan) used as first line of treatments for PDAC and other solid malignancies. Further, we will evaluate the
effects of depletion of key epigenetic proteins on the maintenance of the ASCP epigenome and cell viability,
and the impact of epigenetically targeted drugs in combination with chemotherapeutic agents on ASCP tumor
growth with the aim of identifying precision treatments for ASCP. Our studies will provide insight into the
epigenetic mechanisms that maintain the ASCP and PDAC phenotypes and will be relevant to squamous
carcinomas from other tissues (e.g., colon, lung and stomach). Further, the successful completion of this
proposal will serve as a foundation for new treatment options for ASCP patients and potentially other cancers
with mixed histologies."
10825700,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to determine molecular mechanisms of heteromeric ionotropic
glutamate receptor (iGluR) gating and modulation by ligands and auxiliary subunits. iGluRs are
ligand-gated, tetrameric ion channels that mediate fast neurotransmission in the central nervous
system (CNS). iGluRs are critical for learning and memory, and their mis-regulation is implicated
in neurological disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimerâs disease. The Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-
4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), the fastest subtype of the iGluR family, assembles
as a tetrameric combination of four distinct, principal subunits, GluA1 to GluA4. AMPARs can be
further classified into GluA2-containing, Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptors, and GluA2-lacking,
Ca2+-permeable (CP) receptors, which are involved in Ca2+ influx-mediated excitotoxicity. While it
is known that AMPAR formation is primarily heteromeric in the CNS, most research has focused
on homomeric assemblies. Furthermore, AMPARs co-assemble with a broad range of structurally
diverse auxiliary subunits that regulate their synaptic localization, trafficking, pharmacology, and
ion permeation. Structural and functional characterization of heteromeric AMPARs, CP-AMPARs
and their complexes with auxiliary subunits, which regulate the vast majority of excitatory
neurotransmission in glutamatergic synapses and are involved in devastating neurological
diseases, thus representing promising pharmacological targets, will provide novel insights into
iGluR function in physiological conditions as well as aid in the rational design of therapeutics
targeting these receptors in disease states. We will study AMPAR structure and function with the
following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of heteromeric
AMPARs. Aim 2. Characterize structure and function of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in complex
with auxiliary subunit transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) É£7. To achieve these
goals, we will use a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods, including the
fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC), whole-cell patch-clamp and
single-channel recordings, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results will uncover the
molecular basis of heteromeric iGluR gating and inhibition, provide new insight into translational
pharmacology and aid in the development of treatment of devastating neurological disorders."
10825702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mnemonic strategy implementation has proven useful for cognitively healthy people but also for people with
episodic memory impairments due to normal aging, brain injuries, and neurodegeneration. Although recently there
has been emphasis on studying more diverse and representative samples in cognitive psychology and neuroscience,
little research has applied a cultural approach to study memory strategies. Culture can shape the way one thinks about
the self, known as self-construal, which can have major implications for cognition. Thinking about the self can
enhance memory via the self-reference effect, a strategy that relies on relating information to oneself. Context
features of to-be-encoded events that can be used to enhance episodic memory may be attended to differently
across cultures, potentially affecting episodic memory. However, the mechanisms by which culture impacts the
effectiveness of these memory strategies has not been investigated. We address this gap in the literature by
investigating multiple cultural groups in the U.S.
The specific aims of the project are to advance understanding of how self-referencing and context impact memory,
as well as the neural activity that supports these benefits in memory, in culturally diverse samples. An independent
self, considered separate from and unique from others, characterizes non-Hispanic White samples whereas
Chinese and Latino samples tend to be more interdependent, conceptualizing the self in terms of relationships
with others. We will test to what extent cultural group and associated factors impact self-reference and context
effects in episodic memory in non-Hispanic Whites, 2nd generation Chinese Americans, and 2nd generation
Mexican Americans, the two largest racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S; thereby moving beyond the East-
West comparisons typical of culture work. Although these 2nd generation groups have many aspects of self-
construal in common, there are important differences, such as emotional expressivity. We will explore culture
group differences in the content of episodic memories, and the potential heterogeneity of 2nd generation samples
by considering the roles of cultural and language identity, and stress on memory outcomes. We will measure
behavioral memory performance and brain activity during episodic encoding and retrieval (ERP and Encoding-
Retrieval Similarity Analyses) to distinguish mechanisms of strategy implementation from processes specific to
memory success, allowing us to understand how culture impacts episodic memory.
Not only will the project diversify and expand our study populations but should the effectiveness of these memory
strategies depend upon culture, it would suggest a need to update and advance current memory theories to
incorporate the influence of these factors. Furthermore, understanding cultural differences in the use of memory
strategies can support effective cognition and independence across the lifespan, revealing who may have the most
difficulty implementing such strategies and identifying reasons why, informing future interventions."

The microtubule poison paclitaxel (PTX) is standard-of-care for breast cancer treatment for all breast cancer
subtypes in both early stage and metastatic disease. However, ~50% of breast cancer patients do not benefit
from PTX. Though PTX causes mitotic arrest at high concentrations in cell culture, our data from two biomarker
studies demonstrate that PTX levels in patient tumors are too low to cause mitotic arrest. Instead PTX causes
abnormal multipolar mitotic spindles. Division on multipolar spindles causes unequal chromosome segregation
(termed chromosomal instability, or CIN). While low rates of CIN are common in tumors, increasing the rate of
CIN above a maximally tolerated threshold is lethal. Since PTX increases CIN, these data support a model in
which PTX is effective when it increases CIN over the maximally tolerated threshold. Our long term goal is to
use this novel mechanistic insight to convert PTX from generic chemotherapy into precision medicine by
developing a) a biomarker to predict which tumors will respond to PTX, and b) method(s) to sensitize the ~50%
of resistant cancers. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that there are two major determinants of
PTX sensitivity. First, tumors that have endogenous CIN close to the maximally tolerated CIN threshold are more
sensitive to PTX. Second, some tumors can focus PTX-induced multipolar spindles into near-normal bipolar
spindles by mid mitosis and dramatically reduce PTX-induced cytotoxicityâeven when PTX affects spindles in
early mitosis. Since PTX treatment increases the incidence of multipolar spindles in early mitosis, this implicates
mid mitosis focusing of PTX-induced multipolar spindles as a second mechanism of PTX resistance. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that pre-treatment CIN correlates with PTX response in primary breast cancer, as determined
in an ongoing biomarker study of neoadjuvant single-agent PTX and a retrospective analysis of I-SPY2 samples.
Additionally, Aim 1 will test whether experimentally inducing CIN enhances PTX response. Aim 2 will enable
state-of-the-art quantitative measure of CIN by a) employing single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) to quantify
all chromosomes; and b) accounting for dropout of highly aneuploid cells from the tumor population through a
technique known as Approximate Bayesian Computation. Aim 3 will experimentally test how pole focusing
controls PTX response. Additionally it will test the hypothesis that alisertib, an inhibitor of AurkA, can prevent
pole focusing. Preventing pole focusing is expected to sensitize tumors that are resistant to PTX by forcing cells
to undergo multipolar divisions, markedly elevating CIN. Finally, a CRISPR screen will be used to identify genes
that confer this mechanism of primary resistance. A gene signature for pole focusing could improve a CIN-based
predictive biomarker of PTX response. Together, this translational work based on the conceptual advance
provided by our previous translational studies will provide basic knowledge of the biological mechanisms
regulating cell death in response to a cornerstone of anti-cancer treatment. This will provide a sound basis for
the future development of a predictive biomarker of PTX and strategies for sensitizing PTX-resistant cancers."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida auris are opportunistic pathogens of great concern
due to their broad arsenal of virulence factors and resistance to antimicrobial drugs. These pathogens are among
the most common agents in hospital-acquired infections and are often co-isolated from lung and wound
infections. Furthermore, these infections are often in the form of mixed-species biofilms, which can provide
additional protection against antimicrobial compounds. The antimicrobial resistance crisis of the last few decades
in combination with the rise of difficulties in discovery of drugs with novel mechanisms of action have resulted in
urgent needs for alternative treatments. Bacteriophage (phage) therapy and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
present as encouraging approaches. Phage therapy has been used to combat bacterial infections for over a
century and is an exciting alternative approach to combat drug resistant bacteria. Phage therapy employs
bacterial viruses as antibacterial agents yet provides no remedy for fungal infections. There also are no known
lytic viruses that infect Candida spp. Therefore, the present study aims to develop novel treatments against P.
aeruginosa and Candida spp., using combinations of phages and antimicrobial peptides, with focus on the
treatment of dual-species biofilms. In addition to developing combination treatments utilizing antimicrobial
peptides and phages, we propose to genetically engineer P. aeruginosa phages to produce AMPs to enhance
peptide access to targeted Candida spp. within mixed-species biofilms. This approach alleviates two potential
concerns with the current state of AMP application: low bioavailability due to peptide instability in body fluids and
excessive toxicity if higher systemic doses are required. Dual-species biofilms will be generated in vitro,
subjected to these treatments, and analyzed to determine remaining live biomass using metabolic studies.
Differentially fluorescently labeled strains will also be used for confocal microscopy to determine strain-specific
responses to these treatments. Suitable antimicrobial peptides will be identified against single- and dual-species
populations growing planktonically and in biofilms. Phage engineering will involve using a CRISPR-Cas9 system
to edit phage genomes to encode anti-Candida and anti-biofilm AMPs. The phage engineering approach
provides not only novel alternative treatments, but also a new phage engineering pipeline, expanding the use of
phages as cargo delivery vehicles to infection-specific sites. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating
engineering phages to produce AMPs to treat mixed-species populations, and thus may also serve as a template
for the treatment of mixed-species infections beyond P. aeruginosa and Candida spp."

The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae causes cholera, a severe human diarrheal disease that affects millions of
people annually. A number of oral cholera vaccines (OVC) have been developed but show varying efficacy
among populations in distinct geographical regions, with poor OCV response being common in cholera
endemic areas. However, the underlying causes of this variation are poorly defined. There is therefore an
unmet global health need to develop strategies that boost the effectiveness of these lifesaving OCVs. The
resident microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiome, varies significantly among
individuals, and this variation has been linked to variation in host phenotypes and responses to therapeutics.
Our central hypothesis is that inter-individual variation in the microbial populations of the gut contributes to the
high level of geographical variation in OCV efficacy through effects on the intestinal immune system. Our
preliminary data shows that the gut microbiome represents a personalized contributor to OCV outcome; (i)
specific gut bacterial taxa correlate with high and low responsiveness to OCV, inter-individual microbiota
variation in cholera endemic areas (ii) directly impact infection outcome and immune responses to V. cholerae
and (iii) recapitulates human donor OCV outcomes in a germfree mouse transplantation model, and (iv) gut
microbiome modulation of host CD4+ T cells critically regulates immune responses to V. cholerae. Precision
editing of the gut microbiome therefore represents an attractive strategy to boost OCV responsiveness, but
implementation of such approaches requires detailed understanding of the specific microbes responsible, and
the nature of their interactions with the host immune system. We will leverage our teamâs expertise in OCV
clinical studies, metagenomics, anaerobic microbiology, intestinal immunology, and gnotobiotic mouse models
to make causal and mechanistic links between structural variation in the gut microbiome and human vaccine
responsiveness, and to identify specific microbes able to drive strong OCV outcomes. Our ultimate goal is to
identify specific microbial taxa that drive divergent immune responses to V. cholerae, which may then inform
microbiome-targeted probiotic and prebiotic strategies for cholera prophylaxis. We will address this problem
through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1- Determine the effect of inter-individual microbiota variation on OCV
responsiveness; Aim 2- Define the microbiota targets that enhance responsiveness to oral cholera vaccines;
Aim 3- Define the immune cell populations that mediate microbiota-driven effects on OCV."
10837750,"Recent animal studies have provided new evidence that the cerebellum may have a stronger link to the reward
system of the brain than was previously recognized. Direct projections from cerebellar deep nuclei (DN) to the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been identified, and stimulation of these cerebellar afferents to the VTA was
found to be rewarding. Such findings raise the possibility that cerebellar dysfunction could contribute
substantially to addiction via a cerebellar influence over VTA. Consistent with animal findings, we have found in
human fMRI preliminary data strong cerebellar and VTA activation in response to alcohol cues relative to non-
alcohol stimuli in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared to controls, and close coupling observed
between DN and VTA activation. Studying AUD and control participants, this project will address three
important questions. The first is: What is the nature of cerebellar input to the VTA, and how is it perturbed in
AUD? A number of investigations have suggested that when a stimulus is presented, the cerebellum generates
a prediction of events that will follow based on prior associative learning, and then compares predicted and
actual outcomes to generate a prediction error. We hypothesize that these functions are disrupted in AUD. Our
preliminary data show that when an expected stimulus does not occur, a strong prediction error signal in the
form of increased functional connectivity (FC) between cerebellum and its projection target is observed, and
we found an analogous increase in DN-VTA FC, that was abnormal in AUD patients, when alcohol pictures
were presented. In Aim 1, using fMRI and a monetary incentive task, we will investigate if DN-VTA FC reflects
reward prediction and/or positive or negative reward prediction error. The second question is: Is the amount of
activation in brain reward centers that is elicited by alcohol stimuli related to the amount of dysfunction in the
cerebellum? In Aim 2 we will investigate 2 measures of cerebellar integrity to determine their relationship with
the magnitude of alcohol cue related activation in cerebellar, VTA, and other reward structures, and with DN-
VTA FC: (1) The timing of the undershoot of the cerebellar hemodynamic response function (HRF), which has
been found to be correlated with number of lifetime drinks; and (2) classical eyeblink conditioning, for which the
cerebellum is necessary. The third question is: Can abnormal cerebellar activation and FC, as well as alcohol
craving, be reduced by non-invasive cerebellar stimulation? In Aim 3, Using fMRI combined with cerebellar
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during a cue reactivity task, we hypothesize that in AUD
participants cerebellar and VTA activation will be reduced, DN-VTA FC will be normalized, and alcohol craving
will be reduced. We will examine, using both resting state fMRI and psychophysiological interaction analysis,
the effects of tDCS on FC among important structures of the reward system as well as on DN-VTA FC. These
investigations will lead to a better understanding of the involvement of the cerebellum in AUD, as well as the
therapeutic potential of cerebellar modulation."

10837867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS) remains the leading cause of disability in the US. Large vessel occlusion (LVO)
represents up to 20% of all ischemic strokes, but causes 90% of stroke-related death and severe disability.
Both intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT) are effective time-sensitive treatments to
prevent stroke-related morbidity and mortality. EVT is highly effective for LVOs, does not provide any benefit in
non-LVO strokes and is available in less than 20% of US stroke centers. IVT is readily available, has a modest
effect for LVOs and is the only therapeutic alternative for non-LVO strokes. The challenge for paramedics is to
expedite EVT for eligible patients without harming a large proportion of non-qualified patients in need of IVT, in
the context of initial diagnostic uncertainty. The current system triage criteria have lagged behind emerging
therapies available to the sickest subset, and the disparity in stroke outcomes is exacerbated in rural areas and
for ethnic minorities.
Herein, we propose a study to foster the development of an innovative geospatial triage algorithm of stroke
care in the U.S. health system through a multidisciplinary collaboration to maximize neurological recovery to all
stroke patients. The model will be constructed to provide optimal predicted outcomes for individual patients,
using a Bayesian framework to inform each link of the treatment decision tree, building on prior studies while
overcoming their limitations and closing the implementation gap. First, the patient outcome model will be built
using individual and hospital level data randomized trials, which will enable a context sensitive triage decision
algorithm without reliance on overbroad assumptions about the treatment pathway. We will uniquely
incorporate uncertainty through modelling of individual level data in a Bayesian framework, rather than relying
on point estimates at an aggregate level. Additionally, our model will be adaptable; we will be able to
incorporate emerging LVO diagnostic tools with improved diagnostic accuracy, as well as new therapeutic
strategies as the stroke field evolves. Furthermore, the conditional structure will allow the modification of facility
capabilities, including the introduction of new EVT-capable stroke centers. The clinical and cost-benefit
algorithm impact will be assessed by comparing with the current real-world triage by incorporating local stroke
center and EVT-capable center data on stroke flow metrics from Get-With-The Guidelines-Stroke registry to
better estimate the probability of good outcomes and improve triage capabilities. Finally, the triage algorithm
will be integrated into a point-of-care decision tool support readily available for all EMS to recommend the
optimal destination for all the entire stroke population after their initial assessment. After appropriate refinement
and adequate implementation in subsequent studies, this tool will not only have the potential to optimize stroke
outcomes, but also reduce the actual geographic and racial disparities in the U.S."

Our laboratory identifies small molecules with physiological activity to advance biological discovery and to
develop new medicines. The principal goal of this R35 early-stage investigator MIRA proposal will be to enable
our research effort collectively, which we believe will be best maximized by focusing on three key areas. In the
first, we have been advancing multiple pharmacological approaches in the field of regenerative medicine. Here,
we have developed a unique toolset to promote regenerative tissue repair, targeting the Hippo YAP pathway as
well as multiple tissue resident stem cell populations. We will continue to augment this toolset, delineating
knowledge about the signaling logic of these pathways and identifying key mechanisms that can be potentially
exploited therapeutically, as we have done to date. Second, we have significant efforts in âligandingâ the roughly
twenty transcriptional responses to cellular stress, including heat shock, oxidative, proteostasis, among others.
We have developed best in class activators of the NRF2 pathway and have shown superiority to the clinical
stage molecule Bardoxolone methyl in animal models. Likewise, we have used chemical tools to understand the
essential language of how central carbon metabolism âtalksâ to the oxidative stress sensing machinery of the cell.
We will continue to develop novel small molecules for targeting these largely unliganded transcriptional
responses. Lastly, we will continue developing novel methods to effectively mine screening libraries for small
molecules with interesting and useful properties. We are developing methods to effectively screen libraries for
new covalent reactive groups as well as developing new methodology to screen enzyme families en masse."

We are seeking to acquire a Delta Q Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS) along with its peripherals for the
UW Isotope Ratio Laboratory. The need for this instrument arises because our current Delta Plus and Delta V
instruments are obsolete and no longer, or soon to be no longer, supported by the manufacturer and pose
extreme challenges in terms of operability and repairs. The upgraded Delta Q IRMS is a versatile and high-
performance instrument that accurately measures stable isotopic ratios in both gaseous and solid samples. Its
enhanced capabilities and efficient sample analysis per isotope will ensure the continuity of our lab's operations.
Specifically, this instrument will play a vital role in measuring stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen, with
a specific focus on doubly labeled water studies. These studies are of utmost importance in the fields of nutritional
sciences and obesity research. The precise measurements and advanced technology of the Delta Q IRMS will
provide reliable data for investigating energy balance components, thus making a significant impact in the obesity
field. Accurately measuring energy intake and expenditure is crucial for comprehending human energy balance,
and the doubly labeled water method stands out as the most precise approach for this purpose [1]. Conventional
methods that rely on self-reported data through diet records and questionnaires are susceptible to errors and
bias[2], while the doubly labeled water method, coupled with changes in body energy stores, has been advocated
by Ravelli and Schoeller, 2021 [3]. As a result, the doubly labeled water method, which relies on isotope ratio
analyses, is indispensable for understanding energy balance, preventing obesity and chronic diseases, and also
addressing malnutrition [4]. Access to isotope ratio analyses is limited to a few expert labs worldwide, and our
lab has been at the forefront of pioneering the doubly labeled water method for the past 25 years [5]. We have
provided analyses to 28 investigators leading to 107 publications, which have been cited more than 47,000 times.
To continue meeting the demands of our NIH-funded users, the acquisition of the Delta Q IRMS is indispensable.
It will (1) provide precise and accurate isotopic ratio measurements, enabling in-depth exploration of energy
expenditure, energy intake, body composition, and metabolic pathways in humans and animals, (2) enhance the
health-related goals of our users' investigations, and (3) foster biomedical research within and beyond our
institution. The acquisition of this instrument is vital for cutting-edge research and its availability in the UW Isotope
Ratio Lab will have a profound impact on the scientific community. Ensuring the continuous generation of
accurate data will enable valuable insights and advancements in diverse research areas that rely on stable
isotope analyses. Moreover, it will empower researchers to make significant strides in various health-related
fields. This instrument plays a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge and fostering innovation ultimately
contributing to breakthrough discoveries. In light of these considerations, we request the acquisition of a shared
Delta Q IRMS to support our services to users and contribute to advancements in obesity and other fields.

Problematic alcohol use (ALC) has devastating consequences for individuals, families and society. It is
imperative to illuminate the poorly understood genetic basis of ALC to improve the precision of prevention and
treatment. Research shows that heritable adolescent precursors to ALC are conduct problems (CP), depression
(DEP), and particularly their co-occurrence. Moreover, temperament provides important clues to the diverse
genetic origins of CP and DEP. This suggests that combinations of CP and DEP symptoms and temperament
characteristics may yield novel, genetically-distinct traits that could become new, more precise targets of ALC
prevention. The research targets analysis of four prospective cohorts that will be integrated using advanced data
harmonization: Adult and Family Development Project (PI: Chassin), Michigan Longitudinal Study (PI: Zucker),
Tracking Adolescentsâ Individual Lives Survey (PI: Oldehinkel), and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (PI: Timpson). Collectively, these datasets provide multigenerational extended pedigrees densely
affected with ALC, genomic data, longitudinal data spanning 10+ years, and rich phenotyping of key measures
that are similar or identical across cohorts. Aim 1 will examine patterns by which symptoms of CP and DEP and
temperament characteristics are inherited, thus identifying highly heritable traits underlying ALC. Aim 2 will
employ group-based multi-trajectory modeling of these heritable traits across adolescence (ages 11-18) and
relate them to ALC outcomes into adulthood. In Aim 3, sex differences in the multi-trajectory groups and in their
associations with ALC will be examined. The complementary research and training aims will be instrumental in
launching the candidateâs independent research program on the genetics and development of alcohol use
disorder (AUD). The proposed award will provide training in an optimal scientific environment, the University of
Pittsburgh, across several key areas: (1) quantitative genetics, large-scale genotypic analysis, genetics of AUD,
and other advanced methods with Dr. Bernie Devlin, primary mentor and expert in statistical genetics, and Dr.
Arpana Agrawal, consultant and expert in the genetics of AUD; (2) development of AUD and comorbid
psychopathology into adulthood with Dr. Brooke Molina, co-mentor and expert in AUD and comorbidity; and (3)
data harmonization through consultation with Dr. Patrick Curran, an expert in longitudinal data harmonization.
This training will equip the candidate to conduct powerful genetic studies, to take advantage of ever-increasing
open data, and to contextualize genetic influences on AUD. With the support of this award, the candidate will
gain skills to conduct genetically-informative research that will improve the precision of identification for
adolescents at-risk for AUD. This program of research has the potential to advance the field by producing insights
into AUD etiology that could eventually inform precision-medicine based prevention."
10854986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The first priority of the mammalian embryo is to establish its own placenta, which will eventually be recognized
and accepted by the mother. At the same time, the embryo must reserve fetal cells by endowing some with
pluripotency. Decades of rigorous study have revealed the molecular mechanism that partly explains this first
cell fate decision. Around the 16-cell stage, when the embryo is still a ball of cells, cells on the outer surface
polarize and repress Hippo signaling. As a consequence of Hippo repression, transcription factors YAP and
TAZ (WWTR1) enter the nuclei of the outer cells, where they partner with TEAD4 to promote expression of key
regulators of placental (trophectoderm) fate. Excitingly, this mechanism, which we helped discover in mice, is
conserved in humans, highlighting the utility of the mouse model as a discovery platform. Yet, a major mystery
remained unsolved: how are the pluripotent cells specified? Are they pluripotent by virtue of being non-
trophectoderm? Or is there a more active mechanism? Our lab discovered that the pluripotency factor SOX2
exhibits a unique expression pattern at the 16-cell stage. That is, when other pluripotency factors, such as
OCT4 and NANOG are expressed in both inside and outside cells of the embryo, SOX2 is detected only in
inside cells. This observation suggests that SOX2 helps actively specify the earliest stages of pluripotency.
Through a series of experiments, we subsequently showed that SOX2 expression pattern is dependent on the
YAP/TAZ/TEAD transcriptional complex, indicating that trophectoderm and pluripotency are regulated by
Hippo signaling in parallel, starting at the 16-cell stage. We now seek to discover: 1) Does the SOX2 pattern
provide the positional information to restrict the activity of other pluripotency factors to the inside cells of the
embryo? 2) Do Sox2 paralogues work with SOX2 or other factors to promote the pluripotency of inside cells?
3) How do YAP/TAZ/TEAD mechanistically repress expression of Sox2 while promoting expression of
trophectoderm genes in outer cells? Our team brings together expertise in high throughput genome editing,
time-resolved analysis of single cell gene expression, and ultra-low input genomics, which are all needed to
make the major mechanistic advances envisioned here. These studies will help reveal the generalizable
principles of mammalian embryonic development that are fundamental to ensuring healthy pregnancy and child
development."

Radiation dose is a major drawback of computed tomography (CT) imaging. While the long-term effects of
radiation are difficult to quantify, there is a continued desire to reduce radiation dose through technical
improvement. In theory, photon counting detectors (PCDs) provide several opportunities to reduce CT radiation
dose. In practice, however, PCD CT scanners today have shown only modest gains in dose efficiency
compared to scanners from prior generations for most scanning protocols. Several components of the CT
scanner must be re-engineered to benefit from the dose saving potential of PCDs. The objective of this work is
to perform this re-engineering by designing new components that can take advantage of radiation dose
reduction opportunities with PCD CT.
In Specific Aim 1, we will develop hardware that could improve quantum efficiency, or the fraction of incident
photons that are successfully detected. Today, about 40% of the x-rays that arrive at the detector are never
absorbed by the sensor. 30% of the x-rays are stopped by the anti-scatter grid, and 10% of the x-rays
penetrate the sensor without interaction due to the relatively low stopping power of the sensor. First, we will
experimentally demonstrate a lightweight, striped anti-scatter grid that will increase the number of primary
photons detected while providing a means for estimating residual scatter. The geometry of this grid introduces
striping in the detector signal, with stripe contrast proportional to the level of remaining scatter. Therefore, the
images themselves will contain a means to subtract the remaining scatter. Second, we will develop a guardrail
that can fluoresce a fraction of the punch-through photons and return them to the sensor. We will demonstrate
the guardrail experimentally in a CdTe benchtop PCD.
In Specific Aim 2, we turn to spectral nonidealities in PCD CT. PCDs suffer from pulse pileup and charge
sharing. We will experimentally test a pileup detection circuit that reroutes suspected pileup events into
separate counters. We show that this substantially reduces the impact of pileup and will simulate its use
together with charge summing modes to reduce charge sharing effects. Historically, charge summing modes
have not been used in CT applications because of their pileup penalty. We hypothesize that this mode could
be enabled by stronger pileup corrections, such as the one we will demonstrate. Charge summing modes also
improve dose efficiency for grayscale (non-spectral) tasks by eliminating double counting effects.
Successful completion of these Aims could allow PCDs to unlock their dose reduction potential and could
improve the dose efficiency of PCD CT by 40% for non-spectral imaging tasks and 200% for spectral imaging
tasks."

monitored closely by faculty advisory and program oversight committees. Trainees will be taught how to think
critically and creatively, and receive instruction in academic skills (e.g. grant and MS writing, etc) and the
responsible conduct of research. The program is also stepping up its efforts to promote diversity among its
selected candidates through the recent creation of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Collectively, these

 Age-related decline in vascular function is a key factor in decreased organ function,
vitality, resistance to stress and increased morbidity/ mortality. Our laboratory has made
long-standing contributions about how lipid mediators (sphingolipids and prostanoids) enhance
vascular endothelial cells (EC) function and resilience to pathological processes. Our recent
data suggest that age-dependent decline in EC protective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)
signaling contributes to EC dysfunction and pathology of various organs. Specifically, circulatory
HDL-bound S1P signaling via EC S1P receptor-1 (S1PR1) is a key mechanism that enhances
EC resilience and that therapeutic strategies designed to counter its age-dependent decline was
efficacious in reducing organ pathology. This premise is further supported by unbiased studies
in humans which show age-dependent decrease in ApoM, the S1P chaperone on HDL. We
hypothesize that aging compromises vasculoprotective S1P pathway which enhances EC
resilience, thus contributing to rapid decline in organ function. The corollary of the hypothesis is
that mechanism-based therapeutic enhancement of EC S1PR1 pathway will decrease the rate
of decline of organ-specific EC. To understand organ-specific vascular aging mechanisms, we
profiled the transcriptome and chromatin regulatory sites globally from freshly isolated EC from
normal mouse aorta, lung and retina. EC defects in these organs lead to atherosclerosis,
reduced resistance to viral infections and vascular pathology in central nervous system (CNS),
respectively. First, we will characterize an aging-induced aortic endothelial cell-2 (AEC2)
population which has attenuated S1PR1 signal while exhibiting inflammatory and fibrotic gene
signature. We will define age-associated chromatin regulators of AEC2 cells and assess the
ability of S1PR1/ Gi-biased signals to counteract this pathological EC phenotype change in aged
mice. Second, we will test the hypothesis that EC S1PR1 signaling in lung EC (LEC) supports
resilience against viral infections. Mechanisms by which aging attenuates LEC S1PR1 signaling
will be elucidated. Therapeutic strategies that mimic HDL-S1P that suppress pathological
phenotypes will be tested. Third, using the retinal EC (REC) as a model of the CNS
vasculature, we will examine whether S1PR1 signal can counter age-related barrier breach,
transporter gene expression and astrogliosis either alone or in combination with the Wnt
signaling activators. These studies are anticipated to lead to new insights by which lipid
mediators contribute to vascular dysfunction and disease during aging, which could ultimately

Columbia University's biomedical informatics training program seeks to advance the discipline of biomedical
informatics by providing a broad and rigorous formal course exposure paired with intense research training in
a strong health-focused environment. Our program is run by Columbia's Department of Biomedical
Informatics, and it offers an exceptionally rich environment as it is closely tied to NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital, the Columbia Data Science Institute, and departments and schools throughout the university. We
have a large, internationally recognized faculty with consistent involvement in national biomedical informatics
projects. In addition, our clinical information systems service responsibilities offer trainees opportunities to get
first-hand exposure to, and training on, state-of-the-art clinical and research information systems. Funded by
NLM since 1992, our program has produced many informatics leaders, including chairs, directors, senior
research faculty, and ACMI fellows, and it has graduated 91 pre-doctoral PhD students (49 NLM trainees) and
75 NLM postdocs. Our graduate programs received over 100 applications this year.
Our curriculum includes a biomedical informatics core, additional courses in data science, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning, qualitative methods, information technology methodology, courses in the
application domains, extensive research experience throughout the training period, teaching experience, and
dedicated instruction on ethics. We cover five application areasâ health care/clinical informatics, translational
bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, public health informatics, consumer health informaticsâ and
propose a new specialization dedicated to informatics and data science for HIV research. We cover three
educational end-pointsâ pre-doctoral PhD (generally for 3-5 years), post-doctoral MA and PhD (generally for
2-3 years), and post-doctoral non-degree for those trainees with previous informatics doctoral training
(generally for 2-3 years)â as well as short-term positions. We request 12 pre-doctoral slots (including 2 for the
new Informatics and Data Science for HIV specialization), 5 post-doctoral slots, and 4 short-term trainee
positions (2 pre-doctoral and 2 post-doctoral)."
10850483,"The prevalence of cannabis vaping, especially among young people, continues to outpace the
understanding of its impact on public health. The frequency of vaping cannabis among
adolescents from all demographic groups was recently reported as â¥ 6 times per month, and is
rising faster than occasional use. Cannabis concentrates (CCs), also termed extracts or oils, are
among the most common and potent cannabis vaping formulations. CCs are typically highly
enriched in cannabinoids such as THC or CBD. THC concentrations in CCs are ~50-90% (w/w),
while the THC content in cannabis plant material for smoking is 10-25%. Currently, the number
of new CC formulations continues to grow, including the emergence of previously unknown
semi-synthetic cannabinoids, many of which are currently legal and readily available. The
overarching goal of this project is to bridge significant knowledge gaps including understanding
how specific chemical formulations and vaporizer designs exacerbate toxicant formation. To
address these issues, new analytical methodology will be developed to determine the origins of
toxic emissions. A main toxicant prioritized for study in the application is ketene, a violently
reactive, potentially deadly poison gas with high pulmonary toxicity. The specific aims of the
proposed study are:
1. Determine chemical sources of ketene emissions during vaping
2. Determine the device-related parameters that modulate toxicant emissions."
10915012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hispanics/Latinos are the fastest growing demographic group in the U.S., expected to comprise 24% of the US
population by 2060. Latinos experience high rates of health disparities, including a high burden of
cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes mellitus (DM), uncontrolled hypertension (HTN), obesity, and Alzheimerâs
Disease and vascular dementias. The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a
longitudinal cohort study established in 2004, following ~16,500 US Latinos from four geographic areas and
from multiple Latino backgrounds (Mexican, South American, Central American, Cuban, Dominican, and
Puerto Rican). We oversaw the collection and analysis of sleep measures during its baseline exam. Along with
our colleagues, we identified a high prevalence of sleep disorders which varied in frequency by social and
behavioral factors and Latino background, and associated with incident DM, HTN, and cognitive decline and
impairment.
In this project we will apply an integrative and multi-disciplinary research to study biological mechanisms that
result in sleep health-related risk of DM, HTN, and cognitive decline across diverse Latinos. First, we will
identify methylation and metabolomics measures associated with sleep phenotypes, and characterize them
biologically. We will link some of them to modifiable lifestyle and sociocultural measures. Second, we will
develop metabolomics and methylation biomarkers of sleep by combining information across multiple makers.
We will study the association such biomarkers with incident outcomes (DM, HTN, cognitive decline and
impairment). Third, we will estimate the effect of sleep phenotypes on modifying genetic risks for DM, HTN,
and cognitive outcomes using a gene-by-sleep interaction analysis with polygenic risk scores for each
outcome. We will also perform multi-omics analyses synthesizing multiple omics measures to understand
biological pathways. Finally, we will apply causal analysis to quantify the potential reduction in risks of incident
DM, HTN, and cognitive decline and impairment following potential intervention on sleep phenotypes, under
the assumption that metabolomics and genetic pathways can be blocked. We will estimate these effects in
aggregate and across Latino backgrounds. Our work will lead to development of public health interventions at
the community level (e.g., addressing strategies to improve sleep health) and at the personal level: by
identifying individuals who will benefit most from improving their sleep, for example, according to their genetics
or metabolomics profile."

 Childrenâs participation in life activities with family and peers plays a vital role in their physical and psychosocial
development. Many children with cerebral palsy are often deprived of such interactions given limited postural control and
walking capabilities, leading to delayed development and low quality of life. Ride-on power mobility devices (PMD),
such as the go-baby-go cars, have gained much public health attention since these devices allow for the self-generated,
active control of mobility, spatial exploration, and socialization. More recently, adapted stand-on ride-on PMDs have
provided the additional support to maintaining an upright posture, expected to additionally improve childrenâs balance and
lower extremity strength. However, besides the limited scope of case reports and case series, literature has largely
provided qualitative outcomes after use of these devices. Still unknown are the biomechanical factors underlying
purported beneficial physical changes of using stand-on PMDs. Understanding which biomechanical factors can be altered
after PMD use, especially stand-on devices, will guide subsequent intervention work to enhance functional outcomes. For
this R03 project, we will administer an intervention with individually-adapted stand-on PMD for three months to a cohort
of children with cerebral palsy. We will recruit a small homogeneous sample (n=10) of young children (ages 4â6 years)
who have difficulty with walking and balance (Gross Motor Function Classification System level III) to gather
comprehensive pre-post biomechanical pilot data to support the subsequent R21 project. This is the first study to evaluate
biomechanical factors underlying expected changes in balance (static and dynamic) and mobility function after stand-on
PMD intervention. The completion of this study is expected to generate fundamental knowledge to guide further PMD
interventions with the goal of decreasing the lifelong burden of secondary medical conditions that emerge in this
population due to impaired balance and limited mobility. Our long-term research agenda is geared toward helping children
with impaired mobility engage in life and physical activities with family and peers to foster development and enhanced
quality of life. This goal is in alignment with the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research aims to develop
scientific knowledge to enhance health, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities. More
specifically, our proposed work (current R03 and subsequent NIH grant applications) falls within NINDS/NICHD
Strategic Plan for Cerebral Palsy Research in which we will specifically address early interventions via active play to
improve abilities in functional activities and to minimize effects of the injury on body structure and function with the goal
of enabling increased participation in society and promoting independence."

Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in
many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female-
specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1Î± neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high
intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1Î±
neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila
genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1Î± neurons. For this
aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design
transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I
hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1Î± neurons; and b) pC1Î± neurons project dendritic outputs to
PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I
anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1Î± neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2
will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1Î± neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling
methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression
mediating neurons also play key role in pC1Î± neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will
also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive
behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the
phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g,
activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored
K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe
behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the
progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown.
Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific
behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease
models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of AÎ²-42 to aggression.
My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human AÎ²-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and
(cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize AÎ²-42
overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use
diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research
effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging
and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression."

10831465,"Extracapsular cataract surgery is a marvel of modern medicine that has greatly reduced
the global burden of cataract-related blindness. However, optimal implantation of a
replacement intraocular lens requires preservation of most of the lens capsule, the basement
membrane surrounding the lens. Since lens epithelial cells (LECs) are tightly attached to the
lens capsule, it is not possible to remove all LECs during cataract surgery, and these cells
undergo robust wound healing responses characterized by cell proliferation and the
transdifferentiation of LECs to scar producing myofibroblasts. While modern intraocular lens
implants can sequester myofibroblasts away from the ocular axis short term, these cells can
survive long term at the periphery of the capsular bag, and often escape years after surgery,
migrating into the visual axis, where they can proliferate, wrinkle the capsule, and produce
fibrotic extracellular matrix molecules, leading to the onset of posterior capsular opacification
(PCO) years after the initial cataract surgery. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which
myofibroblasts differentiate post lens injury, and maintain their phenotype long term is of great
importance. During the last grant cycle, we discovered that fibronectin produced by lens cells
after surgery was critical for the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype of LECs post fiber cell
removal while RNAseq profiling revealed that numerous inhibitors of protease activity
upregulate their expression dramatically in LECs following lens injury suggesting a key role for
fibrotic ECM in establishing and sustaining fibrotic PCO. This proposal seeks to investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which fibronectin regulates the fibrotic phenotype of lens epithelial
cells and the role of matrix regulators in this process."

The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Brian Rice, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Stanford
University, the support necessary for his transition from a junior investigator into an independent clinician-
scientist using applied biomedical informatics to address health disparities. Dr. Rice is an emergency medicine
physician with an advanced degree in epidemiology and global health, and a background in computer
programming and artificial intelligence. His long-term goal is to utilize his interdisciplinary training to develop
and implement machine learning tools to empower precise, high-value clinical decision-making surrounding
emergency care and transport in historically disadvantaged populations. His training activities focus on
advancing his ability to apply biomedical informatics to address health disparities via these training objectives:
1) expanding his skills in data management and computational statistics 2) learning methods for community-
engaged and participatory approaches to health disparities research, and 3) acquiring new skills machine
learning and classification model building. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr.
Tina Hernandez-Boussard, a biomedical artificial intelligence expert with a focus on improving transparency
and minimizing bias in machine learning models to make them more equitable and generalizable, and Dr.
Stacy Rasmus, a leading Alaska Native behavioral scientist with extensive experience successfully conducting
community-engaged qualitative research in rural Alaska. The research proposal builds off the candidateâs prior
work with air medical evacuation (medevacs) in rural Alaska which established the central hypothesis that
medevacs can be classified as appropriate or inappropriate by machine learning models built on outcome data
and enriched by qualitative methods. This central hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: 1)
define the burden and outcomes of medevacs in rural Alaska; 2) identify key context-specific contributors to
medevac utilization in rural Alaska; and 3) develop machine learning models to classify appropriateness of
medevac utilization in rural Alaska. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it employs
accepted methods of machine learning classification modelling and applies them to novel fields of medevac
and Alaska Native health disparities. The significance of the proposed training grant is it will provide the data
and the skills required for Dr. Rice to subsequently study the implementation of these models as a decision tool
in a future R01-level application. Ultimately, this continuum of research has the potential to decrease expenses
and improve safety by redirecting medevac resources towards patients whose time-sensitive conditions benefit
from medevacs and away from patients that incur risk and cost without benefit, both in Alaska Native
communities in rural Alaska and for all Americans living in rural regions nationwide."

Significance: Premature very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the Neonatal ICU continue to suffer morbidity
and mortality from sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and early detection and treatment of these
illnesses has been shown to improve survival and outcomes. Continuously monitored vital signs contain subtle
changes in the early stage of sepsis and NEC, but these physiological markers are invisible with current
technology, even for the most sophisticated monitors and experienced clinicians. Our group continues to build
on experience and collaboration to develop early warning systems through advanced time series and machine
learning data analytics that will improve outcomes for premature infants. Progress: Our first such early warning
system, the HeRO monitor, alerts clinicians to abnormal heart rate characteristics and was shown to reduce
sepsis-associated mortality by 40% in a randomized trial of 3003 VLBW infants. The past 7 years of NIH
support produced several important discoveries, including 1) Adding pulse oximetry oxygenation data (SpO2)
to electrocardiogram data improves sepsis and NEC prediction; 2) Center-specific differences in patient
demographics and care practices impact algorithm performance; 3) High cross-correlation of heart rate and
SpO2 reflects increased apnea and sepsis risk across multiple sites. Innovation: The proposed work
represents a paradigm shift in patient care â monitors that report trends of development of health and illness
rather than fleeting values, leading to improved outcomes of preterm infants in the NICU. Approach: In the
current proposal we are adding a fourth large NICU to accomplish the following aims: Aim 1: Use advanced
time series analytics and machine learning to refine and expand predictive monitoring algorithms for sepsis
and NEC; Aim 2: Determine the impact of demographics and center on outcomes and algorithm performance;
Aim 3: Share multi-center data and analytics globally by building on an existing platform. Investigators: Co-PI's
Fairchild and Moorman have a longstanding collaboration and have led successful multicenter clinical and
analytical research for the life of this grant and have strengthened the team by adding new collaborators and
centers. Environment: The centers involved in this proposal are unique in their ability to collect and analyze
large vital sign and clinical data sets, made possible by robust institutional research and computing support."

cardiovascular, pulmonary disease, neurocognitive dysfunction and malignancies. The goal of the Chicago Cook
County Clinical Research Site (CRS) of the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study, formerly the Chicago
Women's Interagency HIV Study, is to advance understanding of HIV-related co-morbidities and pathogenesis
through scientific innovation and a translational approach involving investigators from basic, clinical,
behavioral and community health sciences. In collaboration with the other national Clinical Research Sites and
the Data Analysis and Coordinating Center, the site has developed a Unified Science Agenda that aims to
holistically describe mechanisms underlying premature morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons. Cook
County CRS investigators will lead or co-lead projects in Behavioral Science, Malignancy, Neurocognition,
Sleep Science and Pathogenesis including initiatives related to Liver Disease, Oral Health, Microbiome Science
and Outcome Adjudication. The Cook County CRS will contribute to HIV and multidisciplinary science by
fostering collaboration through an open, inquisitive approach, sharing ideas and the rich data and specimen
resources of the cohort with qualified experts who can further advance mechanistic understanding of HIV-
associated co-morbidities. The Cook County CRS will also support promising and diverse early career
investigators and those new to HIV research through pilot grants, intentional mentorship, and linkage to

The overarching goal of the Atlanta Clinical Research Site (CRS) is to advance the unified scientific agenda of
the MACS/WIHS CCS by: a) providing leadership in the development of the unified science protocols; b)
serving as a local reading center and support laboratory for studies; and c) leveraging our research
infrastructure to implement the CCS protocols by retaining current participants, recruiting new participants from
under-represented minority groups, and engaging Emory scientists and the local community in CCS science
and activities. The Atlanta CRS is well poised to accomplish these goals because of our unique location at the
epicenter of the U.S. epidemic, the robustness of our HIV research program, and our track record of successful
and collaborative contribution to the unified science of the WIHS over the past 5 years.
Georgia now has the third highest rate of new HIV diagnoses among the Southern states1 and the 5th largest
HIV epidemic among the U.S. states2. While HIV rates are high in both rural and urban Georgia, Atlanta is
home to most (62%) of the stateâs affected patients, and the majority reside within 10 miles of the Atlanta CRS.
Importantly, nearly two-thirds of people living with HIV in Atlanta and ~20% in Georgia receive care in Emory
associated HIV clinics (n=10,354). HIV+ and negative volunteers that have consented to be contacted for
research are available via the CFAR HIV Disease Registry (> 13,000 unique patients), the PRISM Health MSM
cohorts led by Emory faculty Dr. Patrick Sullivan, and the Georgia CTSA database (>100,000 individuals),
providing us access to a diverse population of HIV+ and at-risk HIV- individuals from across the state.
Leveraging these institutional resources, the Atlanta CRS will contribute to the CCS unified science in the
following manner: 1) Provide leadership to support the CCS unified specific aims through expert contribution by
Emory investigators, including scientific specific leadership roles in the following aims: (a) age related co-
morbidities; (b) health disparities; (c) HIV pathogenesis; and (d) career development; 2) Leverage our state-of-
the-art research infrastructure to implement all components of the CCS unified science, including adjudication
of clinical events, development of data quality control procedures and good laboratory practices, staff training
in relevant CCS research activities, and enrollment of new participants; 3) Enhance our vibrant community
engagement to support our efforts to enroll new participants, expand our CAB to be representative of the
combined cohort of women and men, and introduce use of innovative technology to enhance community
outreach and support accrual and engagement of our combined cohort; and 4) Build on our track record of
mentorship by expanding HIV research opportunities for early stage investigators in coordination with the CCS
Investigator Developmental Award Advisory Committee."
10832099,"Abstract
Metastasis is a well-known driver of cancer-related deaths. Nevertheless, limited success has been achieved in
targeting cancer metastasis because it is an exceedingly complex process driven by multiple, integrated
mechanisms. Collaborative studies in the Zijlstra and Weaver laboratories studied two separate aspects of cell
motility: a) the dynamics of cell-cell adhesion controlled by proteolytic shedding of adhesion receptor and b) the
release of motility promoting extracellular vesicles (EV). Since these two events take place in the same cells and
contributed to the same phenotype, we speculated that these two biological processes were coordinated. Indeed,
preliminary studies demonstrated that syntenin-1, a key component of the EV biogenesis pathways, was part of
a cell adhesion complex anchored by the IgG superfamily member Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule
(ALCAM) and its companion-tetraspanin CD151. Altering the expression and/or shedding of ALCAM drastically
impacted EV biogenesis, confirming our original idea that cell-cell adhesion could be coordinated with EV
biogenesis. The hypothesis that this occurred through an intracellular link between ALCAM and syntenin is
further supported by the ability of free intracellular domain to suppress EV biogenesis. Based on these
observations and our published expertise in cell adhesion, EV biology and metastasis, we propose to investigate
the integration between cell-adhesion and the production of motility-promoting EVs during cancer progression.
Specifically, the proposed studies will investigate: 1) the mechanistic integration between cell-adhesion and EV
biogenesis, 2) the consequences for cargo incorporated in motility-promoting EVs, and 3) the functional
contribution to autocrine and paracrine communication. Moreover, the relevance of this biology will be tested in
the context of bladder cancer where ALCAM shedding is an independent prognostic indicator of survival. For
this purpose we have developed a novel ex vivo organotypic culture system for bladder urothelium and bladder
cancer in which we can replicate the clinical phenotypes of both papilloma and carcinoma of the bladder.
Considering that tumor cells have a large number of divergent mechanisms at their disposal by which they can
enhance their malignant behavior, determining how mechanisms of cell adhesion and EV biogenesis integrate
is not only an innovative way to deconvolve complex metastatic behavior, it will also have significant clinical
impact. With findings from the propose studies, will provide novel avenues of intervention where a therapy may
target a point of synergy and integration rather than a direct mode of action."
10832678,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Urinary stone disease (USD) is the second most costly urologic condition in the US, with an annual healthcare
expenditure of more than $2 billion. Ureteroscopy (URS) via laser lithotripsy (LL) is the treatment of choice for
USD. Recently, the introduction of high power/high frequency Holmium (Ho): YAG lasers and Thulium Fiber
Laser (TFL) has fundamentally altered the clinical mode of operation in LL. Contemporary LL is often performed
using dusting and pop-dusting modes that pulverize stone to dust in situ without the need for fragment extraction.
However, there is an unmet need to develop approaches that can address some of the challenges of dusting
and pop-dusting in order to significantly improve the clinical treatment outcome regardless of stone composition,
shorten the procedure time, and lessen the risk of tissue injury. The proposed Duke FORWARD P20 Urology
Center (Duke FORWARD Center) will tackle some of the most pressing problems in treating USD with LL. The
Center's Research Project (RP) will focus on modifying the fluid medium to enhance the inherent cavitation or
photothermal ablation mechanism for stone ablation during another critical clinical procedure, called pop-dusting,
so that the treatment efficiency can be improved, while the procedure time and potentially collateral tissue
damage will be reduced. The RP will be led by Po-Chun Hsu, a promising junior investigator new to USD
research with expertise in nanotechnology for heat and thermal management that will be central to the RP's
strategy. The primary goal of Duke FORWARD's Administrative Core (AC) is to guide and support the efforts
of the Center's RP Team to successfully conduct their project and help prepare them to apply for future R01s.
The Specific Aims of the AC are to: (1) Facilitate productive collaborations among the RP Team and with the
broader CAIRIBU research community; and (2) implement a career development plan for RP PI Po-Chun Hsu
for him to gain experience and mastery in USD research knowledge and technical capabilities. If the aims of the
AC are achieved, the RP Team will have successfully accomplished the aims of their RP and will be in a position
to submit one or more follow-on R01s by Year 3 of the proposed Center. In supporting the Center, the AC will
facilitate innovative research with the potential to benefit millions of USD patients worldwide and will have
introduced this talented new USD research team to the NIDDK-sponsored CAIRIBU benign urology research

10832679,"RESEARCH PROJECT: ABSTRACT
Urinary stone disease (USD) is a benign but severely painful genitourinary disease that affects nearly 1 in 11
Americans, with an annual health expenditure of over $2 billion in the US. The introduction of high power/high
frequency Holmium (Ho): YAG lasers and Thulium Fiber Laser (TFL) have fundamentally altered the mode of
laser lithotripsy (LL), which is the treatment of choice for USD. Pop-dusting is a technique widely used in the final
stage of LL, whereby the laser fired in a renal calyx causes the sizable fragments to move rapidly to grind them
down to dust, which potentially leads to significant temperature increase in the kidney. Benchtop in vitro, porcine
in vivo, and FDA adverse event reports all raise concerns for dangerous thermal dose accumulation and
potentially permanent thermal injury. Our recently published findings lead us to hypothesize that cavitation
bubble collapse with resultant microjet impact on the stone surface or streaming-induced shear may contribute
to this process. In other words, the absorption of laser power of the fluid plays a critical role in the pop-dusting
behavior. Therefore, by enhancing the Ho:YAG laser or TFL absorption, we can lower the power requirement for
generating equivalent or stronger bubble activities to improve pop-dusting efficiency, while concurrently lowering
the risk of thermal damage to the kidney tissue. The overarching objective of the Research Project (RP) of the
Duke FORWARD P20 Urology Center is to extend the research efforts of the Center for Urological Research
and Engineering (CURE) at Duke University by incorporating previously unexplored nanotechnology
approaches. We plan to utilize nanophotonic science to develop a specialized nanofluid with high and selective
absorption of the laser and investigate its benefits on LL efficiency, toxicity, and clinical safety from a benchtop
model to in vitro and in vivo studies. The center's Research Project has three Specific Aims focusing on (1)
Develop biologically safe nanoparticles with absorption peak optimized for Ho:YAG laser (Î» = 2.1 Î¼m) and TFL
(Î» = 1.94 Î¼m) and assess cavitation dynamics and cell injury in an optical cuvette model. (2) Investigate the
effects of nanoparticle-enhanced pop-dusting in a hydrogel-based kidney model and examine treatment
efficiency and thermal damage risk in vitro. (3) Explore the effects of nanoparticle-enhanced pop-dusting in a
porcine model and evaluate toxicity, safety, and pop-dusting efficiency in vivo. By achieving these aims, we
envision successful progress and critical preliminary data collection, both in vitro and in vivo, for supporting future
R01 applications on nanotechnology-enhanced LL. We further anticipate that the synergy and new knowledge
created by this FORWARD P20 program will greatly enhance and promote our existing and future collaborations
within the broader NIDDK CAIRIBU program, including the U54 Center at Columbia and the KURe K12 program
at Duke, as well as through other USD research activities."
10833477,"Erythropoiesis is a dynamic process governed by quantitative changes in the relative levels of transcription fac-tors (TFs). Due to the current paucity of quantitative data on the proteins that constitute the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), most models of erythropoiesis are based primarily on mRNA measurements and do not typically consider changes in the protein levels of specific TFs. This significantly limits the understanding of erythropoiesis and other transcriptionally regulated processes such as Ã-globin expression, ultimately impinging on the capacity to correct hemoglobin disorders. The long-term goal is to decipher the TRN that controls erythropoiesis in health and disease. The objective of this proposal is to significantly expand our TRN model for cell fate decision during erythropoiesis by integrating dynamic bulk and single cell TF protein abundance measurements with other transcription-relevant -omics data. The central hypothesis is that relative protein levels of TFs are critical parameters in the establishment of gene expression programs during the continuum of differentiation, and that erythropoiesis is driven by graded changes in the relative amounts of specific combinations of TFs. The rationale is that integration of the dynamic and quantitative nature of the TF proteome into an expanded TRN of erythropoiesis will yield a model with improved predictive power which will serve as a benchmark for healthy erythropoiesis against which to compare erythroid-related disease states, and will facilitate the identification of pharmacological agents to restore normal erythropoiesis. Three specific aims have been designed: 1) Absolute quantification of the TF proteome during erythropoiesis; 2) Determine how changes in the abundance of multiple TFs in single cells initiate and progressively reinforce cell fate decisions along the erythroid trajectory; and 3) Computational analysis, modeling and validation of the erythropoiesis TRN. For the first aim, quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) approaches will be used to measure absolute levels of the TF proteome during ex vivo erythropoiesis of HSPCs derived from healthy donors. For the second aim, complementary CyTOF and targeted-MS proteomic approaches will be used to estimate TF protein abundances in single cells, and other single cell âomics technologies will be used to measure changes in gene expression and TF genomic binding during ex vivo erythropoiesis. For the third aim, TRN models of erythropoiesis will be built utilizing measurements of TF protein abundances, and other transcription-relevant âomics data. Functional validation will be performed for TFs that have been implicated in transcriptional control during erythropoiesis based on our recent results. The approach is innovative because it uses a novel combination of single cell and bulk proteomics methodologies to quantify large numbers of TFs during erythropoiesis in primary human cells and uses the data for integrative TRN modeling. The proposed research is significant because it will illuminate complex regulatory processes that control erythropoiesis. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to guide the design of new therapeutics to re-establish proper Ã-globin expression in Ã-thalassemic patients."
10833598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
By 2040, 20% of the population will be over 65. Sixty percent of cancer diagnoses and 70% of cancer deaths
occur in older adults, with rural older adults at a higher risk of developing and dying from cancer than their urban
peers. Additionally, 73% of cancer survivors are older adults. Depression is an important concern for older adults
with cancer, as estimates of those with depressive symptoms are as high as 27%. Depression often interferes
with treatment decision making and treatment adherence. In rural areas, up to 25% of older adults have a
diagnosable psychiatric illness. Additionally, older adults often have subsyndromal depression, with recent
population estimates of up to 40% in medically ill patients. Even the presence of mild depressive symptoms is
associated with significant mortality. These individuals are at increased risk for social isolation with minimal
access to mental health care despite a willingness to utilize these services. We developed a novel intervention,
the Cancer and Aging: Reflections for Elders (CARE) Intervention, to treat depression and distress in older
cancer patients. CARE is a manualized, five session telephone intervention which can easily be disseminated.
CARE uniquely focuses on aspects of aging and cancer by: 1) integrating development theory of aging with
reappraisal theory, and 2) incorporating feedback from older cancer patients. This unique tailoring is designed
to help older adults negotiate age specific developmental tasks and utilize reappraisal strategies important for
successful aging. As a result, CARE has the potential to be more effective than âoff the shelf,â standard
psychotherapeutic interventions, applied to this population. Data from the pilot RCT indicated that CARE is
feasible and effective. This study tests the efficacy of the CARE intervention in a large, two arm, RCT. We will
partner with the Cancer Support Community (CSC) to recruit through CSCâs local affiliates in areas with large
rural populations and to deliver the interventions via telephone through the CSC-identified social workers. 476
subjects will be randomly assigned to two arms: Arm 1-the CARE Intervention and Arm 2- a Social Work and
Supportive Counseling (SWSC) Intervention. Both interventions will consist of 5 sessions (45 mins) and 4 briefer
booster sessions (30 mins). CARE has the potential to impact the field on both a theoretical and clinical level.
Importantly, CARE was tested by phone to reach older adults who are geographically isolated and was
developed so different types of professionals (e.g., masterâs level psychologists, social workers, clergy,
psychiatry nurses) could provide the intervention. If found to be effective, CARE could be a cost effective, easily-
implemented, first-line treatment for depressive symptoms for older adults with cancer."

 Delirium is a geriatric syndrome of fluctuating confusion that is a common complication of surgery and
hospitalization in older adults, and is associated with increased risk of death, disability, and dementia. People
with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at especially high risk for delirium. The
pathophysiology of delirium is not well understood, but is thought to include neuroinflammation and brain
energetic disruption. These features also link delirium to ADRD. Impaired cerebral glucose metabolism is a
chronic feature of ADRD, and an acute feature of delirium. Similarly, chronic neuroinflammation is thought to
be an important contributor to ADRD, and acute inflammation is associated with delirium. In this translational
project we propose to test an innovative molecular link between acute-on-chronic brain inflammation and
metabolic dysfunction, using cell systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from a human delirium cohort.
 Ketone bodies provide a non-glucose energy source for the brain during fasting, and ketone body
metabolism remains intact in ADRD even with impaired glucose metabolism. We recently found that disrupted
glucose metabolism is an important driver of behavioral changes in mouse models of delirium. We also
recently showed that a ketogenic diet improves memory in both aging mice and an ADRD mouse model. We
developed an innovative toolkit of compounds and genetic models to mechanistically study ketone bodies
experimentally. We hypothesize that energetic support from ketone bodies might help compensate for
inflammation-induced neuronal impairments in glucose metabolism. We also elucidated a new mechanism
linking inflammation to metabolism, showing that activation of peripheral macrophages induces enzymes that
degrade the key metabolic mediator NAD+. Inflammation-driven NAD+ depletion occurs chronically in aging and
ADRD, and may occur acutely in delirium.
 We will use an inflammation model of delirium with normal mice and two ADRD models to test if ketone
bodies or NAD+ can rescue acute delirium-like behavioral changes, and identify the relevant mechanisms (Aim
1). We will use cultured cells and an in vivo brain inflammation model to determine if activated microglia
deplete NAD+ similarly to macrophages, and whether preventing this also rescues delirium-like behaviors (Aim
2). Finally, we will use cerebrospinal fluid samples from a large clinical study of postoperative delirium to
determine how endogenous ketone body and NAD+ levels differ between patients with vs. without delirium
(Aim 3). This collaborative project links basic science expertise in ketone body and NAD+ biology relevant to
ADRD, with basic and clinical research expertise in delirium. It will open a new area of mechanistic study on
inflammation-induced metabolic deficits in delirium, guiding development of translational interventions."

10833605,"ABSTRACT
Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is a benign plasma cell disorder, common in
the population (3-5% â¥50 years) and characterized by an asymptomatic clonal plasma cell expansion.
Although MGUS precedes multiple myeloma (MM) with progression rates of 1% per year, most (>75%) MGUS
never progress. MGUS is also associated with increased risk of infection, fracture, osteoporosis, renal
impairment, and thrombosis, with resultant morbidity and mortality. Few risk factors are identified for either the
development of MGUS or MGUS progression to MM, with African American (AA) ancestry being one of the
strongest. Identifying individuals who are more likely to progress is important given that individuals
with MGUS who are closely monitored prior to development of MM have better outcomes. Prior work
identified genetic variations associated with MM through family studies and, more recently, through genome
wide association studies (GWAS). However, no well-powered genetic epidemiology studies of MGUS have
been performed, particularly in AAs; and to our knowledge, none have investigated whether detection of
genetic variation improves the identification of high-risk MGUS, including those that progress to MM.
Therefore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of genetic susceptibility to MGUS (Aim 1) and MGUS
progression to MM (Aim 2) using established epidemiologic and genomic studies among European Americans
(EA). Given the racial predisposition for MGUS and MM among AAs, for the first time, we propose to evaluate
the known MM susceptibility variants and novel variants identified in Aims 1-2 in AAs (Aim 3). Using both
GWAS and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), we will answer the questions: (1) What are the
genetic variations and genes predisposing to MGUS (Aim 1)? (2) How do these compare to genetic
predisposition associated with progression from MGUS to MM (Aim 2)? (3) Do these identified genetic factors
(and consequent polygenic risk scores, PRS) differentiate between MGUS patients that do and do not progress
to active MM (Aim 2)? and finally, (4) Are these genetic factors for MGUS risk and progression similar across
populations of EA and AA ancestries (Aim 3)? We will utilize established EA and AA studies of MGUS and
MGUS progression to MM (MM vs. MGUS), the majority with GWAS, to allow for discovery and validation. We
will also leverage genomic data, including RNA-sequencing of both whole blood (peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, PBMCs) and sorted CD138+ bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) from MGUS patients to inform gene
expression for the TWAS. Further, we will perform functional characterization of the new genes or variants
validated in both EA and AA populations. Upon completion, our study will validate and characterize germline
genetic factors associated with risk of MGUS and progression to MM in both EAs and AAs. It will have high
impact, providing insight to MGUS and MM etiology and informing genetic contributions to clinical risk models
for progression for the millions of people living with MGUS."

Aneuploidy is a cellular state in which cells contain extra or missing chromosomes. Over 90% of solid tumors
are aneuploid. Aneuploidy has been shown to contribute to drug resistance and metastasis, and aneuploid
cancers have a worse patient survival rate than euploid cancers. Despite aneuploidyâs role in cancer, aneuploidy
itself causes growth defects and induces several ongoing stressors within the cell. Gaining or losing
chromosomes leads to transcriptomic and proteomic stress, metabolic deregulation, an altered secretome, and
induces further chromosome mis-segregation. We hypothesize that aneuploidy-induced cellular stresses can be
targeted to specifically eliminate aneuploid cells, and we aim to discover genetic dependencies that are specific
to aneuploid cells. We will use CRISPR to screen multiple near-euploid human cell lines and aneuploid clones
that we derive from these near euploid cell lines. We will then compare the effect of aneuploidy on gene
dependency, independent of cell line-specific effects. Toward this goal, we have generated 54 aneuploid clones
from nine near euploid human cancer cell lines, and we have access to an additional ten aneuploid clones from
two human cell lines. We will screen these aneuploid clones, and their near-euploid controls, with a domain-
specific CRISPR library. This library targets multiple druggable protein domains, including all kinase,
ubiquitinase, transcription factor, epigenetic modulator, âroyal familyâ epigenetic factor, protease, and ubiquitin
ligase genes. In preliminary work, we have screened multiple euploid and aneuploid cell lines with a smaller
kinase domain-focused CRISPR library, and we identified several potential aneuploid-specific dependencies.
More aneuploid cancer cell lines and their corresponding controls will be screened to confirm these potential
hits. Cancer aneuploidy is not entirely random, as specific chromosome gains and losses are selected for in
certain cancer types. In addition to uncovering general aneuploid dependencies, we aim to uncover chromosome
specific dependencies. Once we have uncovered potential aneuploidy dependencies, we will validate their
aneuploid-specificity, and then we will use cDNA to rescue gene knockout and rule out off-target effects. We will
use IP mass spectrometry to uncover any differences in hit protein binding between euploid and aneuploid
conditions, or to identify the protein binding partners of poorly characterized genes. Next, we will perform RT-
qPCR and IF to screen for aneuploidy-associated phenotypes including chromosome missegregation, proteomic
stress, senescence, and apoptosis. Additional follow up experiments will be performed to uncover their
aneuploidy-targeting mechanisms and better understand the targetable stressors induced by aneuploidy. During
this period I will be trained in CRISPR screening, bioinformatic analysis, and mass spectrometry techniques.
Aneuploid dependencies and chromosome-specific aneuploid dependencies could serve as promising targets
for aneuploid-cancer therapeutic development."
10910906,"Background: [The 2019 US Department of Health and Human Services Advancing American Kidney Health
Initiative aims to âimprove care coordinationâ¦for people living with kidney disease.â Accessing care from
multiple systems and insurers can result in lapses in care coordination, and] patients with serious conditions,
such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), are especially vulnerable to poorer outcomes from fragmented care.
[While Medicaid expansion, as occurred with the Affordable Care Act (ACA),] is effective in improving access
to health care and health outcomes for the uninsured, the significant number of Veterans enrolled in VA (who
already have access to comprehensive care) who gained access to Medicaid with expansion face increased
risk of care fragmentation. Increased use of non-VA care as a result of the MISSION Act poses similar risks.]
Significance/Impact: As more Veterans access care from a mixture of VA and non-VA sources, VA needs to
adopt strategies for cross-system care coordination to ensure effective and efficient care for Veterans. This
requires understanding how Veterans utilize care when multiple options are available. Patients with advanced
CKD have highly complex care needs. Lack of well-coordinated care may increase unnecessary care and
worsen outcomes for such patients. Examining use and outcomes data will illustrate multiple aspects of access
and care coordination for Veterans with chronic conditions and anticipates implementation of the MISSION Act.
Innovation: [That some states opted out of ACA Medicaid expansion allows for a natural experiment where
changes in quality of care and utilization over time can be compared between states that did and did not
expand Medicaid. The team will use VA, Medicare, and recently-released post-expansion Medicaid claims data
to evaluate how Medicaid expansion influences Veteran choices of health system use and CKD treatment.]
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the characteristics of Veterans and Veterans with CKD who are most
likely to enroll in both Medicaid and VA. Aim 2: To determine the impact of dual enrollment on the utilization of
health care services for Veterans with advanced CKD and to create a reference tool to enhance coordination
for these patients. Aim 3: To evaluate differences in quality of health care and costs among Veterans with
advanced CKD in states that have expanded Medicaid and those that have not.
Methodology: Claims data [from 17 states (7 that expanded Medicaid in 2014 and 10 that did not) in the
Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) file for 2011-2014] are included. A difference-in-difference model will estimate
the association of state Medicaid expansion with [changes in Veteransâ dual-enrollment status (VA and
Medicaid) and in utilization and outcomes for Veterans with CKD. Utilization analyses will consider outpatient
visits, emergency department visits and hospital admissions recorded in VA and Medicaid data. Outcomes to
be considered are time-to-mortality, emergent vs. elective initiation of dialysis, and costs to the health care
system.] Each analysis contains demographics, comorbidity and illness severity. For all aims, separate models
for low-income (Priority 5) Veterans are estimated as a sensitivity check. [In addition, strategies to support
enhanced care coordination will be gathered from interviews with renal care teams and organizational leaders
then developed into a care coordination reference tool for those who provide care for patients with kidney
disease. Input from Veterans and patients will be incorporated at each stage of the interview and reference tool
development process.
Next Steps/Implementation: Veteran/patient and VA operational (National Kidney Program; Office of
Veterans Access to Care) partners will be provided with interim and final findings to guide strategic planning
and to inform programs that support optimal care for Veterans with access to multiple sources of care. Results
from this project will be of great importance as stakeholders plan for Veteran needs in the form of direct health
care services and effective care coordination, and as they make state and national policy recommendations.]"

Young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YGBMSM) make up 63% of the HIV prevalence
(18%) among GBMSM in Ghana. Our previous studies show that intersectional stigma and discrimination (ISD)
(around HIV, sex, and gender expression) and insufficient HIV knowledge impede HIV testing, PrEP, and ART
(HPART) adherence among GBMSM. Those in slums face additional stigma associated with their communities;
hence the social and economic barriers in slum communities can intertwine with ISD to exacerbate the risk of
HIV infections and discourage HPART adherence among YGBMSM as they internalized stigma and avoid HCF.
A status-neutral approach to HIV care can reduce ISD among YGBMSM and HCFs and improve HPART among
YGBMSM. Yet, current HIV interventions and programs in Ghana have focused on separate services and
predominantly address only testing. To this effect, we propose to adapt a multilevel intervention (LAFIYA,
meaning wellness) to address ISD and HPART using status neutrality among YGBMSM and HCF in Ghanaian
slums. LAFIYA showed early efficacy in increasing HIV testing/self-testing among HIV-negative or unknown-
status YGBMSM in Ghanaian slums. Adaptation to a status-neutral intervention will extend its utility for HIV
prevention and care by utilizing scientific advancements around intersectional stigma, HIVST, PrEP, and linkage
to care. LAFIYA also mainly focused on GBMSM and involved providers from two facilities who received ISD
reduction training. The proposed LAFIYA will include HCF-wide training, PrEP, and ART components. Guided
by the eight steps of the ADAPTT-IT model, we will implement the two aims. 1) Adapt a multilevel intervention
to address ISD and HPART using status neutrality among YGBMSM. We will conduct FGDs and in-depth
interviews (IDI) with YGBMSM (n=70), GBMSM providers (n=20), and NURSES/HCWs (n=80) to deepen
understanding of ISD, barriers, and facilitators of HPART adherence among YGBMSM. In a summative analysis,
we will integrate realities from providers and YGBMSM to optimize the intervention potential to address ISD and
increase HPART. 2) Test the preliminary efficacy of the intervention to address ISD and increase HPART
adherence using CRT Design. We will assign YGBMSM (n=240) friend groups to control or intervention groups
(n=120) and HCF(n=6) to control or intervention (n=3). The intervention arm will receive LAFIYA. We will collect
3, 6, and 9 months post-intervention data among YGBMSM (n=240) and HCWs(n=300). to measure HPART
adherence (primary outcomes), ISD reduction, HIV and status-neutral knowledge (secondary outcomes), and
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention (implementation outcomes). We will conduct
additional focus groups and interviews post-intervention among implementers and participants (sample sizes
same as in AIM1) to evaluate their experiences with the intervention. The findings will inform intersectional stigma
reduction and HIV status-neutral implementation strategies among YGBMSM, slums, SSA, and other high-risk
populations in different settings."

Many adult tissues replace cells lost due to normal wear and tear through the activity of stem
cells, but can use entirely different strategies when injury occurs. The ability to understand and
control regeneration, or the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury, is a long-
standing goal in biology. Cells with the capacity to adopt the biological properties of other cell
types under specific conditions, or cellular plasticity, are key contributors to regeneration. Stem
cells and even differentiated cells can have surprising degrees of plasticity, allowing them to
adopt new fates and rebuild damaged tissues. This happens in response to altered
microenvironments that arise upon injury, but the mechanisms that regulate plasticity are poorly
understood. We have developed the Drosophila testis as a model system to study the biology
of stem cells and their microenvironments, or niches. Advantages include the relative simplicity
of this tissue and an unparalleled collection of genetic tools to probe it functionally. Previously,
we showed that damaging the Drosophila testis converts differentiating germ cells to revert to
germline stem cells to repair the tissue. We recently found that quiescent somatic niche cells
can transdifferentiate into new somatic stem cells upon damage. Here we combine live
imaging, lineage tracing and single cell transcriptomic profiling to determine now niches sense
damage and then activate program(s) to regenerate missing stem cells. We will also uncover
the overall complexity of the genetic pathways enriched in the testis niche during normal tissue
turnover, following up on candidate signals that relay information from stem cells to their niche.
Our synergistic approach will enhance the understanding of the fundamental cellular and
molecular mechanisms driving homeostasis and regeneration in the testis, which has important
implications for understanding fertility, regeneration and cancer."

 Diabetic retinopathy is an increasingly common cause of visual impairment and blindness among
adults. Modern therapy has become increasingly effective, but remains insufficient to prevent vision loss in a
sizable proportion of patients. Early-acting and efficacious new remedies are needed, especially since the
prevalence of worldwide disease is increasing. A barrier to accomplishing this goal is a poor understanding of
the earliest causes of retinal injury in diabetes. In this application, we will address this barrier by studying early
changes in retinal metabolism during diabetes â changes that are likely to contribute to disease onset and that
can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.
 Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of all forms of diabetes and is directly related to its complications,
including diabetic retinopathy. Since glucose is the primary fuel of the retina, we investigated what pathological
effects might occur due to its excess supply in diabetes. Specifically, we discovered that diabetes is associated
with a fundamental shift in retinal metabolism away from tissue break down (catabolism) and towards tissue
building (anabolism). Among the largest changes is that of lipid biosynthesis, a pathway responsible for
generating a ubiquitous medium-chain fatty acid in mammalian cells, palmitate. In diabetes, retinal palmitate
synthesis is elevated by 70% compared to non-diabetic controls. Using targeted genetic manipulation of the
enzymes in the synthesis pathway, we determined that reduction of palmitate prevents vision loss in diabetes
whereas elevating its production accelerates the onset of visual abnormalities. We now ask how such signals
are related to disease development and what specific molecules are involved. Towards these goals, we
recently found that excess palmitate in the diabetic retina impacts several retinal enzymes that are regulated
by S-palmitoylation. The largest change was seen in retinal Ryanodine Receptor 2 (Ryr2) â an intracellular ion
channel that regulates calcium homeostasis â as it is hyper-palmitoylated in diabetes compared to non-diabetic
controls. In this application we will determine whether this molecular change is associated with pathology and
whether it can be reversed for therapeutic effects.
 We will address three major aims: (1) define the effect of diabetes on retinal Ryr2 palmitoylation and its
functional consequences; (2) delineate whether Ryr2-associated calcium flux in rods is dependent on retinal
lipid biogenesis; and (3) determine whether improving retinal lipogenic signaling in diabetes reduces diabetic
retinopathy severity. By accomplishing these aims, we could uncover essential root causes of diabetic
retinopathy and we may introduce novel targets for therapy directed at a very early stage of the disease
process."

There is a substantial and growing population of children/adolescents who are HIV exposed uninfected (HEU)
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There is emerging evidence that fetal exposure to maternal infections and
medications may result in adverse adult/adolescent mental health outcomes; it is plausible that fetal exposure to
HIV or antiretrovirals (ART) could similarly influence long-term outcomes. Despite evidence for poor growth
and neurodevelopmental deficits, programs to systematically monitor neurodevelopmental and mental
health outcomes among HEU at a population level are lacking. Understanding whether there are increased
adverse neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in HEU due to fetal HIV/ART exposure has been
challenged by difficulties in defining appropriate comparator cohorts, changing PMTCT treatment guidelines, and
lack of validated, scale-able assessment tools.
Our team has a unique track record for moving novel approaches for screening and testing from pilot to
implementation, conducting large scale evaluations, and conducting neurodevelopmental and mental health
assessments in HIV-affected children and adolescents. We propose parallel longitudinal and population
based HEU/HUU cohorts, in urban and rural settings, spanning infants/children/adolescents age 6 weeks
to 18 years to determine differences in neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes. The R61 phase
will accrue a longitudinal homogenous cohort of 2000 HEU/HUU infants exposed to Option B+ PMTCT treatment
regimens, with extended follow-up in the R33 phase for a total of for 4 years, and assessed for
neurodevelopmental, mental health, hearing, growth outcomes and telomere length. An approach to survey older
HEU/HUU (age 3-18) for neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes and collect maternal medical, ART
regimen and timing, and viral load data from medical records will be piloted in the R61 phase and expanded to
100 HIV clinics in the R33 phase. Selected neurodevelopmental/mental health screening and diagnostic tools to
be used are based on open source availability, diagnostic or screening performance, cultural appropriateness,
accessibility, and clinical relevance. In the national R33 survey, cost analysis will complement clinical data; and
together, will be disseminated to stakeholders at a workshop to develop a framework for an integrated HEU
screening program in public health settings.
This proposal leverages extensive team experience in prior longitudinal MTCT cohorts, in national child and
adolescent surveys, HEU recruitment, neurodevelopmental and mental health assessment, and medical record
extraction and analysis at scale, to comprehensively understand burden, mechanism and outcomes in HEU.
Engaging stakeholders has the potential to enhance HEU management programmatically based on findings."
10857191,"Summary
The United States (US) is the most affected country worldwide by the ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The availability of effective vaccines had initially slowed
down new infections, reducing incidence of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, hospitalization
burden, and deaths. Unfortunately, vaccine hesitancy, and the emergence of new, highly transmissible variants
of concern (VOCs), such as the Delta variant that has rapidly become the dominant one in the US among both
non-vaccinated and vaccine breakthrough cases, have caused a new dramatic epidemic surge in July-August
2021, and are likely to be an ongoing problem hindering epidemic eradication efforts. Although data on increased
mortality and worse clinical outcome in people with HIV (PWH) with COVID-19 is somewhat equivocal, recent
surveys indicate that PWH has a higher likelihood of severe disease or death than patients without immune
dysfunction. Moreover, while most people effectively clear SARS-CoV-2 in 2-4 weeks, several reports of infection
in immunosuppressed individuals have shown intra-host emergence of multi-mutational variants, some at sites
linked to immune evasion, especially in case of persistent infection. The overarching goal of the proposed project
is to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genomes intra-host evolution in the context of HIV infection by developing a
phylodynamic and artificial Intelligence framework to assess the emergence and likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 VOC
(PhAI-CoV) in immunocompromised PWH. The hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 infection in PWH can result in
enhanced evolution of viral variants that can efficiently be tracked by phylodynamic analysis and predicted to be
VOCs by artificial intelligence algorithms. To test such a hypothesis, we developed three specific aims that will
investigate three complementary, albeit independent, issues. We will use a well-characterized cohort of PWH
and rigorously collected longitudinal data and samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in Miami,
Florida, one of the cities with the highest HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infection burden in the US. In Specific Aim 1 we
will recruit and retain n=120 PWH with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as n=120 matching controls with
acute SARS-CoV2 infection but without HIV, and study how COVID-19 disease severity differs by HIV status,
depending on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history and infecting variant. In Specific Aim 2, we will Investigate intra-
host SARS-CoV-2 evolution throughout the duration of infection to assess the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in PWH to result in sustained intra-host evolution leading to the emergence of novel viral variants. In specific
Aim 3, we will develop an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict the likelihood of new variants to be
VOCs. Understanding the evolutionary scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 variants emergence within HIV infection and
evaluating the probability for increased strain infectivity and/or pathogenicity will provide a crucial tool for
planning and implementing public health measures before transmission occurs in the general population."

This proposal develops a novel technology to enable analysis of millions and eventually hundreds of millions of
live cell-cell interactions in parallel. These tools will address a major unmet need, with future potential
applications including but not limited to screening functional antibodies and peptides, evaluating ligand-
receptor specificity, and determining affinities in cell adhesion.
The technology is embodied by micro-capsules: semi-permeable compartments composed of a thin shell and a
hollow core, which can be generated extremely rapidly around cells. Micro-capsules are resilient and exchange
small molecules with surrounding media. They allow long-term cell growth, as well as multiple sequential steps
of imaging, treatment, cell fixation, staining, and sorting, including steps that are difficult or impossible to carry
out today on defined cell mixtures at high-throughput.
In this proposal, we build on proof-of-concept data to now establish and benchmark two prototype methods
that will enable screening and mapping cell interactions at a scale that is 100-10,000-fold greater than is
possible with existing plate-based or microfluidic methods, at lower cost and in less time. We use receptor
agonist/antagonist screening and mapping as test cases that allow defining clear performance indicators,
including false-positive and false-negative rates of the method. The two methods entail (1) high-throughput
screening of cell-cell interactions, and (2) high-throughput mapping of cell-cell interactions. âScreeningâ
focuses on selecting particular desirable interactions from a large pool, while âMappingâ refers to the task of
systematically associating variation in an input variable (e.g. DNA sequence or signaling environment) with an
output (e.g. cell activity). Currently, the only methods for systematically mapping cell-cell interactions require
using micro-well plates at low throughput.
In addition, in parallel to developing the prototype platforms, we will continue to develop capsule chemistries
and microfluidic capabilities that will enable faster screening, different capsule sizes suitable for working with
bacteria (small) to organoids (large) and multiple cell types, and to enable different screening outputs. These
capabilities are not needed for the prototypes but will generalize them.
If successful, we will have developed, optimized and benchmarked the prototype systems to the point where
they are ready for earnest application to problems in high-throughput screening and systematic mapping of
cell-cell interactions. To do so, we focus on systematically problem-solving assay design, and we incorporate
benchmarks throughout. The proposed research will significantly accelerate our ability to both gain basic
quantitative insights into cell-cell interactions in health and disease, and to enable new platforms for
therapeutic discovery."
10853359,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 14.1 million people in the United States. Despite the
prevalence of this disorder, we lack a thorough understanding of its underlying neurobiological mechanisms.
One of the major mechanisms believed to contribute to the development of AUD is the dysregulation of central
stress systems (Brady & Sonne, 1999). Whereas acute alcohol elevates stress hormones, chronic alcohol intake
results in diminished hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function characterized by a reduced physiological
response to stress (Stephens & Wand, 2012). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNCRH) are essential for initiating the HPA axis response.
Moreover, PVNCRH neurons and HPA hormones show distinct adaptations to chronic stressors, excessive
alcohol, and withdrawal from alcohol (Bryon Adinoff et al., 2003; Sivukhina et al., 2006). For example, AUD and
abstinence both blunt hormonal HPA axis responses to stress, but basal cortisol production is hyperactive during
acute withdrawal and hypoactive during protracted abstinence(B. Adinoff et al., 1998; Stephens & Wand, 2012).
While much of the field has focused on the role of PVNCRH neurons in initiating the hormonal response to stress,
recent studies have revealed these cells are also critical for stress-linked behaviors that are independent of
stress hormone actions (Kim et al., 2019). These include active defensive behaviors (escape), social approach
and perseverative, grooming behavior. These studies indicate that PVNCRH neurons orchestrate complex
behaviors and highlight new opportunities to probe for how disruptions in local signaling and changes in afferent
drive to PVNCRH neurons following alcohol consumption may affect behavior. In addition, preliminary studies from
the Bains lab have found that PVNCRH neurons can track the valence of contexts over a scale of time that outlasts
behavior. Changes in the activity of these neurons following alcohol exposure may contribute to aberrant patterns
of behavior that drive chronic alcohol consumption. Here, we propose to use a multi-faceted approach integrating
machine learning based behavioral analysis, cell type specific genetic manipulations, in vivo imaging and ex vivo
slice physiology to begin to unravel the role of PVNCRH neurons in alcohol use disorders. We will test the central
hypothesis that alcohol drinking leads to heightened activation of PVNCRH neurons driving persistent increases
in stress behaviors and that PVNCRH neurons play a critical role in alcohol consumption."

Cancer cells must activate a telomere elongation mechanism and acquire genomic alterations. Many of the most
lethal cancers rely on the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. ALT is a specialized
homology directed repair (HDR) mechanism dedicated to repair and elongate telomeres, thereby ensuring the
proliferative immortality of these cancer cells. Recurrent inactivating missense mutations in genes encoding the
ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodeling/histone H3.3 deposition complex exhibit a strong concordance with
tumors in which ALT is activated, with both arising late in metastatic disease. These loss of function mutations
disrupt ATRX-DAXX mediated assembly of chromatin, provoking replicative stress and double-strand breaks
(DSBs) within telomeres that is believed to stimulate ALT-associated HDR. Whereas the HDR mechanisms that
underpin ALT have been extensively studied, the mechanisms governing how cells compensate for loss of
ATRX-DAXX to maintain chromatin while also acquiring metastatic traits remain ill-defined. This proposal
builds on our recent report that upon inactivation of ATRX-DAXX, a related chromatin assembly factor known
as HIRA becomes indispensable for de novo histone H3.3 deposition and telomere extension in ALT cancer
cells. Furthermore, we discovered that the depletion of HIRA provoked acute systemic death of ATRX-DAXX
deficient cells. Strikingly, this cytotoxicity was reversed by reconstitution of ALT cells with wild type ATRX
protein. These data provided compelling evidence for a compensatory function adopted by HIRA due to
ATRX-DAXX deficiency that could be harnessed to eliminate ALT cancer cells."
10810761,"Oregon PRAMS Project Summary/Abstract
Oregonâs Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) conducts surveillance on selected
maternal behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during and shortly after pregnancy. Because of
the design of the survey, weighting which includes an emphasis on gathering data equitably from six
racial and ethnic subpopulations, and a high response rate, the PRAMS surveillance data are very high
quality and offer far more breadth and depth than birth certificate data. The Oregon Maternal and Child
Health Section has also leveraged PRAMS into a longitudinal data collection system by re-interviewing
respondents when the index child is 3 years old via the Early Childhood Health in Oregon survey. The
PRAMS+ECHO surveillance system provides data for Oregon's Needs Assessments (including Title V and
Home Visiting), for monitoring the health status of Oregon women and children, for informing state and
local public health department program and policy efforts, and for research into emerging health
problems and public health practice. The data have recently been used to monitor maternal mental
health during and after pregnancy, safe to sleep/back to sleep habits, breastfeeding, maternal
substance use during pregnancy (alcohol, commercial tobacco, e-cigarette, marijuana, and prescription
painkillers), maternal leave employment practices, and periconceptional folic acid."
10840782,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) care and rehabilitation presents significant current and future challenges to the
Veterans Health System (VHS). In addition to specific disabilities, there is a growing concern that TBI may
significantly elevate risk factors for long-term chronic inflammation-induced progressive disease. Currently,
effective therapies to address both of these issues are hampered by the lack of a sufficient neurobiological
foundation to guide refinement of therapy for disability, and prevention strategies for chronic disease.
Acceleration/deceleration TBI causes micro-vessel shear injury, blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and
micro-bleeding. Iron deposited by diffuse micro-bleeds fuels inflammation through reactive oxygen species
(ROS), and other inflammatory pathways may further induce progressive disabilities. There is an urgent need to
address both specific disabilities and risk factors for long term progressive disease, and to develop effective
therapies that have excellent potential for translation. The proposed pre-clinical studies will increase our
understanding of microbleed (iron)-induced inflammation and the potential therapeutic benefits provided by a
new iron chelating drug to address three long-term hallmark TBI disabilities that significantly impact the quality
of life. The proposal will test the preclinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a new hexadentate iron
chelator, NaHBED, to remove microbleed-induced iron, a powerful catalyst of inflammation, and to upregulate
neural and vascular trophic agents to protect and heal injured neural and vascular tissues. Accordingly, three
specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: To correlate TBI-induced chronic disorders with cellular/molecular
changes in LC and specific neural substrates of test behaviors in three functional domains. Tests for motor,
anxiety, cognitive functions, and a comprehensive safety protocol will be conducted immediately before and
monthly for 3 months post-treatment to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment. Clinically relevant state of
the art Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI)/Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) MRI, and histological
and immunohistological experiments will be performed to chart the time course for iron removal and/or further
iron deposition. Specific Aim 2: (Therapeutic efficacy). To determine the efficacy of NaHBED therapy in
mitigating long-term motor, cognitive and anxiety disabilities. Chronic treatment will be initiated at 6 months post-
TBI using a dose shown in preliminary work to be effective. In addition, to temporal characteristics and progress
of iron elimination and/or further iron deposition following NaHBED therapy (SWI/QSM MRI), the therapeutic
impact on chronic motor, anxiety, and cognitive disabilities will be assessed immediately before and monthly for
3 months following the initiation of treatment. Specific Aim 3: To determine the safety and efficacy of NaHBED
in reducing iron toxicity and up-regulating of trophic factors at the cellular level in the neural regions for motor,
cognitive, and anxiety behaviors, using comprehensive histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular
assays. We propose that treatment will significantly decrease the magnitude of long-term motor, cognitive and
anxiety disabilities and these improvements will be correlated with significant decreases in a) cell death, b) iron
deposition and neurodegenerative markers for inflammation and ROS, c) normalization of BBB markers, and d)
significant increases in neural and vascular protective factors in the specific neural centers that provide key
neural substrates for the studied behaviors. These chronic TBI studies address specifically highlighted RR&D
concerns regarding TBI-induced long-term disabilities, and long-term degenerative disease (RX-18-014). In
particular, these studies will provide new insights regarding TBI-induced factors that potentially contribute to
significant chronic inflammation-induced TBI disabilities. Since these risk factors are prevalent in both impact
acceleration (vehicular) TBI as well as blast TBI, they affect the predominant VHS TBI population. If our proposed
treatment is determined to be safe and effective in the chronic TBI setting, it is well positioned for immediate
translation to clinical treatment and rehabilitation since it obtained an IND approval for other disorder."
10840852,"ABSTRACT
Infection of the eye by Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) can result in Herpes Keratitis (HK), which is the
leading cause of infectious corneal blindness worldwide. In the U.S., nearly 500,000 individuals
experience ocular herpes infections that are often recurrent and culminate in progressive corneal scarring
and loss of vision. The gold standard treatment is Acyclovir (ACV) that targets HSV-1 thymidine kinase
(TK). However, emergence of ACV viral resistant mutants in 7-14% of ocular HK patients has created the
urgent need to discover a second drug directed against a different HSV-1 target. A new class of antiviral
targets are processivity factors (PFs) that are essential for tethering their cognate polymerases (Pols) to
the template to enable continuous DNA synthesis. During HSV-1 replication, the DNA-anchored PF binds
to the extreme C-terminus of Pol (C-Pol) to keep Pol from dissociating from the viral template. When
co-crystallized with its PF, the C-terminus of the viral Pol (C-Pol) forms an Î±-helix, with one face making
multiple bonds with several residues of PF while the other face is solvent exposed. Our goal is to develop
a novel antiviral drug that specifically targets herpes PF for the purpose of treating ACV resistant HK.
Stapled a-helical peptides have emerged for use in targeting protein-protein interactions that often
display as long flat surfaces which are difficult for small molecules to bind efficiently. Peptide a-helices
are ideal structural motifs for incorporating chemical staples to provide rigidity to make natural bonds
with residues on the target protein. Moreover, staples can create a protease shield to prolong residence
time. We have now engineered a stapled peptide of C-Pol (SPep7B) that blocks the mechanism of
processive DNA synthesis in vitro and HSV-1 infection in human organotypic (3D) corneal epithelial cells;
the unstapled peptide is non-inhibitory. SPep7B was shown to eliminate HSV-1 viral DNA in infected
cells while failing to block a different virus. Importantly, SPep7B exhibits undetectable toxicity
(CC50>100ÂµM) by two different assays in human ocular epithelial cells. Our GOAL is to enter SPep7B
into preclinical development as a Topical to treat HK. This will be accomplished by conducting a
series of AIMS that include scaleup of SPep7B and evaluating two formulations for delivery of SPep7B into
human 3D cultures and then ex-vivo excised rabbit cornea for permeability and toxicity. These studies are
essential to confront the physiological and anatomical barriers to topical ocular delivery. In vivo studies
will evaluate SPep7B for tolerability, genotoxicity, PK, and repeat dosing. An efficacy study will evaluate
SPep7B for clinical cure and viral clearing. Backup analogs of SPep7B will be prepared and evaluated
for risk mitigation. A model for new antiviral drugs: Closely aligned with this approach is the
potential for using PFs and stapled peptides of other viruses for treating unmet medical needs caused
by infections that lead to deleterious complications."
10840854,"Adolescence is a complex time of heightened self-consciousness, risk taking and peer orientation which may be
especially challenging for teens diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Longitudinal magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) studies of children with ASD that begin at diagnosis and extend into adolescence are
extremely rare. This is a critical gap since adolescence is also a period of profound brain changes. The MIND
Institute Autism Phenome Project (APP) was initiated in 2006 to discover multilevel phenotypic information
enabling definition of clinically meaningful subtypes of ASD. Nearly 300 families have completed an initial
assessment with successful MRI. The APP includes autistic children with all severity levels and co-occurring
conditions such as anxiety and intellectual disability. Children with ASD and age-matched typically developing
controls had their first MRI at 2-3.5 years of age and up to 3 additional scans between ~4 and ~12; 773 MRI
scans have been acquired. We propose to extend this study to a 5th time point in middle adolescence (14-17
years). A guiding theme of this research is that different trajectories of brain development will differentiate subsets
of children with ASD and some of these differences will become most apparent as the child enters adolescence,
which coincides with pubertal development. Because we have carried out pediatrician-based Tanner staging at
multiple time points, we will be able to evaluate how puberty influences the emergence of these developmental
brain differences across all aims. Capitalizing on the large amount of longitudinal structural MRI data acquired
to date, we will use structural covariance analysis and other network level strategies to evaluate developmental
differences in gray matter structure across several domain specific networks. Focusing on intrinsic connectivity
networks implicated in the triple network model of autism, we predict reduced magnitude and extent of salience
and central executive networks in ASD and greater extent with anterior-posterior decoupling in the default mode
network. The amygdala is a brain region consistently reported to be altered in ASD. Our previous MRI and
postmortem research indicate that there is an abnormal trajectory of amygdala growth in autism with enlargement
early on and atrophy in adolescence. We will investigate longitudinal growth of the amygdala to test the
hypothesis that it undergoes atrophy in adolescence in ASD. We hypothesize that this preferentially involves
those with a form of co-occurring anxiety disorder and is different from teens with anxiety but not ASD. We will
also address the critical under-studied question of what neural alterations differentiate children with ASD with,
and without, intellectual disability. We will investigate the maturation of brain regions and networks associated
with intellectual and language function to explore differences between children with ASD and low verbal/cognitive
performance from those with normal verbal/cognitive performance. Finally, we will evaluate trajectories of autism
severity change into mid adolescence and explore the neurobiological underpinnings of these changes. We
predict that persistent alterations in the salience network will be associated with increased severity over time."
10840983,"Project Summary: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRDs; e.g. Frontotemporal
Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, etc.) are crippling neurodegenerative disorders. The onset of these diseases
is strongly correlated with aging. Cures for AD and ADRDs remain elusive; Alzheimer's has become the 6th most
frequent cause of death in the USA. An emerging candidate contributor to Alzheimer's and ADRD is the L1
retrotransposon, which becomes dysregulated during aging and correlates with Alzheimer's / ADRD onset. One
hypothetical mechanism by which L1 may contribute to Alzheimer's / ADRD is through its exacerbation of cellular
senescence. Senescence is a phenomenon by which normal cells stop dividing; these cells accumulate with
advancing age and are found at the locations of dysfunction in age-related diseases. In mice, senescent cells
have been shown to shorten life and actively drive age-related neurodegeneration; preventing senescent cell
accumulation decreases tau-dependent degeneration and cognitive decline. AD patients exhibit increased
indicators of cellular senescence. It is increasingly clear that senescent cells are not inert, but instead drive tissue
deterioration via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype - secreting a variety of growth factors and pro-
inflammatory cytokines. L1 retrotransposons have recently been shown to drive progression of the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype, and thus, L1 is an important agent of cellular senescence. L1 activation is also
associated with AD-related Tau pathologies. The L1 encoded ORF2p enzyme (endonuclease and reverse
transcriptase) is often flagged as a source of pathological cellular insults, e.g. via new, mutagenic L1 insertions
and contributions to chromosomal instability. However, the effects of L1 expression extend beyond DNA
damage. Numerous mechanisms may be at play, including the titration of normally homeostatic host factors
away from their physiologic functions and into L1 ribonucleoprotein granules, as well as the production of
immunity-and-inflammation-triggering cytoplasmic L1 DNA:RNA hybrids; indeed, the latter is now understood to
be a key component of L1âs role in cellular senescence. Moreover, L1 also mobilizes Alu and other non-
autonomous retrotransposons.
Objectives: In Aim 1, we will use targeted mass spectrometry to profile L1 ORF1 protein expression in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain tissues of patients exhibiting AD/ADRD and cognitive decline,
as well as in senescent cells and neuronal iPSCs; in Aim 2 (in vitro cell culture) and Aim 3 (clinical samples) we
will profile L1-associated protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions in the same biological samples as Aim 1;
and in Aim 4 we will take a candidate-based approach using molecular genetics to dissect the mechanisms of
action of L1 in senescent cells."

The University of Washington (UW) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) was established in 1970 and is
the only MD-PhD program in the five âWWAMIâ states (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho)
comprising a quarter of the landmass of the United States. Our program has thus far produced 285 graduates,
78% of whom have been employed in scientific research throughout their careers. Our goal is to leverage
institutional and national resources to build an educational pipeline leading to the development and identification
of a diverse group of talented trainees and equip them with the skills, mentorship, role models, and motivation
required to advance the frontiers of biomedical science and technology. Among multiple accomplishments,
students and graduates of our program created the Apple Macintosh computer and one of the first enzyme
replacement therapies for metabolic disease, have provided fundamental insights into the nature of stem cells,
the sequence and structure of the human genome, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and have led similarly
successful MD-PhD programs elsewhere, thereby exponentially amplifying our programâs impact on training the
next generation of physician-scientists. Our competitive program has grown to an annual class of 15, comprising
approximately one-fifth of all medical students in Seattle. For each offer of admission, we receive over 23 training-
grant-eligible applications. Of our 96 current trainees, 21% are from populations under-represented in medicine
and 19% are from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our partnership with Morehouse School of Medicine enriches
both institutions. Our trainees carry out their PhD research with UW faculty mentors at the UW, Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center (Hutch), Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute, and Benaroya Research
Institute. Current trainees' PhD departments and programs include Molecular and Cellular Biology,
Neuroscience, Genome Sciences, Bioengineering, Computer Science, Molecular Engineering, Chemistry, and
Epidemiology. They are mentored by a highly trained group of 81 well-funded, diverse, and gender-balanced
distinguished faculty drawn from across ranks of junior to senior investigators, who emphasize and practice
responsible, reproducible science in safe training environments. Our program integrates medical and graduate
education, while reducing redundancy. Mean time to completion is 8.3 years and on a shortening trajectory, with
minimal attrition of 2.6%. Over half of trainees receive NIH F30 independent fellowships. Over the last 15 years,
graduates published a mean of 6.7 peer-reviewed papers, including 2.8 as first-authors, many of which are
exceptionally impactful and have altered the course of research in their fields. Nearly all graduates go on to
research-related residencies at leading institutions, predominantly in fields conducive to long-term retention in
research. We continually evaluate our outcomes, measure our progress toward its overarching objective of
producing resilient physician-scientists pushing the envelope at the interface of science and medicine, and
iteratively evolve our program to stay at the forefront of evidence-based innovations in training practices."

Genomic basis of phenotypic variability of complex disorders
Extensive phenotypic variability has complicated our understanding of complex disorders. We study the 520-
kbp deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 as a paradigm to dissect the genetic basis of complex disorders.
Originally identified in children manifesting developmental delay, the deletion is inherited in >95% of cases
from a parent with mild neuropsychiatric features, conferring differential susceptibilities to disease among
carriers in the same family. We found that carrier children were more likely to carry another large CNV or rare
deleterious mutation (âsecond-hitâ) elsewhere in the genome compared to their carrier parents, indicating that
the deletion sensitizes the genome for a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the ultimate phenotype
is determined by variants in the genetic background. Our long-term goal is to understand how specific
combinations of second-hit variants, in concert with the 16p12.1 deletion, lead to distinct clinical outcomes. In
the previous funding period, we analyzed the genomes and quantitative phenotypes of 150 families with the
16p12.1 deletion, and tested individual as well as 214 pairwise interactions of homologs of 16p12.1 genes in
Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis models. We found that patterns of rare variants correlated with
the severity of clinical features, which were contingent upon family history of neuropsychiatric disease and
assortative mating profiles of parents. Furthermore, knockdown of individual 16p12.1 homologs in Drosophila
and X. laevis resulted in distinct developmental defects and these homologs interacted synergistically with
patient-specific second-hits to modulate neuronal and cellular defects. Here, we propose to fine-map genetic
and familial factors in larger cohorts, assess deeper cell type-specific effects, and identify generalizable
principles for phenotypic variability of complex disorders, through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Perform
whole genome sequencing and detailed phenotyping on an additional 250 families carrying the 16p12.1
deletion, and leverage the increased sample size to identify effects of single and combinations of genes and
variant classes as well as polygenic risks towards variability in families, including anticipation across
generations; Aim 2: Assess patterns of second-hits across different proband phenotypic profiles, family
histories, disease ascertainments, and unselected populations of 1,281 unrelated 16p12.1 deletion carriers,
and compare results with 2,200 individuals with other rare CNVs, such as 16p11.2 and 15q13.3 deletions, to
identify patterns of second-hits that are common or unique to different CNVs and ascertainments; Aim 3:
Perform functional studies to assess interactions of 16p12.1 genes with second-hits within neuronal cell types
in Drosophila and quantitative neurological assays in Danio rerio models. Ultimately, our study will improve
strategies for genetic diagnosis, counseling, and development of therapeutic strategies for complex disorders."
10843314,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The NIH has called for testing promising implementation strategies (PAR-19-274) and there is a critical need for
implementation and sustainment of effective and evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address health conditions
including substance use disorders (SUDs). This proposed project is consistent with NIDAâs Priority Focus Area
âStrategies to improve the effective and sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment
interventions (implementation science).â Most implementation strategies do not address the complex multilevel
context for implementation in public service sectors. This proposed project will expand the Leadership and
Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention, an innovative organizational change strategy for
EBP implementation and sustainment, to include partnership with a statewide Department of Mental Health and
Addiction (DMHA) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) in order to align state-level leadership
policies and directives with organizational implementation improvement strategies. SUDs are among the most
complex of public health issues and Indiana ranks as the fourth worst state in providing SUD services with about
8.5% of the population meeting criteria for a SUD, of whom only 13.6% seek treatment. Indiana DMHA
approached the UCSD LOCI team to aid in the implementation of combined Motivational Enhancement
Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) The main innovation in this project is that, consistent with the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and system and organizational theory,
we will add a system level component to LOCI with the goal of bridging outer and inner context and developing
and aligning a positive implementation climate to support implementation and sustainment of MET/CBT for
SUDs. This project will test an implementation strategy that seeks to align, system, organization, and clinic
leadership and strategies to implement and sustain an EBP for substance use disorders. The Leadership and
Organizational Change for Implementation - System Level (LOCI-SL) seeks to improve implementation
leadership, climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, and EBP fidelity and client engagement in services. LOCI-
SL will be tested in a statewide mental health and addiction service system and its community mental health
centers."
10854453,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes mellitus affects 37 million US adults and is the leading cause of vision loss among adults aged 18-64
years. Countries such as the UK that have robust eye screening and treatment programs successfully prevent
blindness from diabetes. In the US, where screening programs have been less successful, usual-care screening
involves a primary care provider referring patients with diabetes to an eye care provider for a dilated eye exam.
Barriers to usual-care screening include transportation, cost, and the time required for patients to make and
attend this separate eye care appointment. Racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged
communities, such as individuals on Medicaid, are more affected by these challenges, resulting in lower
screening rates and higher rates of preventable vision loss. Thus, an urgent need exists for a program that
equitably improves eye screening and follow-up eye care rates for patients with diabetes. The overall objective
of this proposal is to investigate an FDA-approved artificial intelligence (AI)-based system that allows primary
care providers to identify diabetic eye disease at the primary care clinic without the need for oversight by an eye
care provider. The novel intervention we are testing, AI-BRIDGE (Artificial Intelligence-Based point of caRe,
Incorporating Diagnosis, SchedulinG, and Education), is an autonomous AI-based protocol that provides
screening for diabetic eye disease at primary care visits, as well as culturally adapted patient education on
diabetic eye disease and, if a patient screens positive, assistance with scheduling an in-person, follow-up eye
care visit. To achieve our objective, we will carry out 2 specific aims: (1) Determine whether, relative to usual-
care screening, AI-BRIDGE improves eye screening and follow-up care rates across races/ethnicities and
reduces racial/ethnic disparities in screening rates. To do so, we will work with stakeholders to adapt AI-BRIDGE
to an underserved primary care setting and then conduct a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial
of the adapted intervention in partnership with 10 clinics that are Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers,
providing primary care to medically underserved communities. (2) Identify determinants of, and strategies to
promote, effective and equitable implementation of AI-BRIDGE using a mixed methods approach. We
hypothesize that factors such as organizational leadershipâs commitment to the intervention, competing demands
on the clinic, and patient and provider perceptions of AI will contribute to adoption of AI-BRIDGE. To test this
hypothesis, we will conduct semi-structured interviews of patients, clinic leadership, and providers to identify
barriers and facilitators, and then work with stakeholders to identify strategies to address the barriers identified.
This work is innovative because it is the first-ever randomized controlled trial that (1) evaluates whether AI can
improve equity in eye screening and follow-up care and (2) identifies barriers, facilitators, and strategies to
successfully implement this screening strategy in an underserved setting. It is significant because a scalable, AI-
based eye screening and follow-up program could reduce disparities in vision loss and ensure that, in the future,
diabetic eye disease is no longer the leading cause of blindness in the US."
10842546,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The functional interpretation of human genetic variation needs to catch up to our ability to catalog the DNA
sequences of individuals. Better tools are required to interpret mutationsâ effects, improving our ability to
diagnose and treat diseases. Our goal is to accurately predict which mutations cause human disease by
developing tools for three-dimensional and context-dependent interpretation of genetic information. We focus on
genes that regulate the genome, known as epigenetic enzymes. We will specifically study the chromatin
remodeler, SMARCA4, which enables the genome to be used in the right amount at the right time. SMARCA4 is
critical to study because 1) it is required for normal physiology and development, 2) germline mutations define
rare and undiagnosed diseases that affect people of all ethnicities and genetic ancestries, 3) somatic mutations
underly cancer development from many body tissues, making new findings of high biomedical value. Additionally,
epigenetic regulators are often associated with more than one medical condition. This data conveys epigenetic
enzymes' powerful and multi-faceted functions and their ability to orchestrate many different physiologic changes
that can differ across individuals. Further, the distinct physiological contexts that SMARCA4 acts within will vary
across body tissues and over time. SMARCA4 is the catalytic unit within the BAF complex, which also exists as
different sub-complexes, necessitating the study of each. This concordance affords a pivotal opportunity to
develop new procedures for helping more patients with diverse congenital and somatic diseases and better
understand this chromatin remodeler's normal functioning. Our central premise is that SMARCA4 mutations alter
specific features of the encoded 3D protein in quantifiable ways using novel computational tools that generate
mutation-specific functional calculations. This is important since current guidelines for genetic diagnosis are
primarily based on linear sequences rather than 3D features of gene products, and these guidelines fail to
capture many pathogenic mutations that likely cause diseases. More importantly, our methodology applies to all
diseases, independent of the affected cell or organ, and performs with the same high accuracy for cancers and
non-cancer diseases. Our proposal will generate specific deliverables that fill crucial knowledge gaps for
advancing data science for genomics. Current data science methods in genomics are primarily based on
sequence-based evolutionary conservation and population-level empirical observations. Thus, existing methods
fail to reveal genetic differences specific to individuals and fail to provide actionable mechanistic information.
Using mutation-specific structural, dynamic, and systems-level annotations, our work offers a more powerful
interpretive toolset across diverse clinical and research domains. We will benchmark our approach against
current tools, validate via clinical cases, and bring information of mechanistic value that can be tested
experimentally. Finally, we will develop a scalable process that can, through future work, be applied to additional
epigenetic enzymes."
10842547,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overall goals of this research program are to develop analyses, tools, and methods to achieve new,
more effective catalysts and reactions. New synthetic methods greatly increase access to untapped chemical
space, leading to materials and pharmaceuticals that benefit society. To achieve these goal, investigations will
focus on obtaining an improved understanding of reactivity and selectivity.
 The fundamental hallmark of this program is the ability to access new reaction patterns to construct important
organic structures in an efficient and rational manner. Reaction models and mechanistic understanding gives us
the tools to solve problems and posit hypotheses. High throughput microscale experimentation permits rational
hypotheses to be interrogated broadly and to develop new models to understand reaction space.
 One set of goals will be state-of-the-art computational and machine learning methods combined with new
high throughput experimentation methods and large datasets to understand stereoselectivity, chemoselectivity,
and reactivity at the molecular level with the aim of designing new, more effective catalysts and reactions.. The
control of selectivity and reactivity are essential features of efficient synthesis, yet our molecular level
understanding of how fundamental interactions perturb these aspects is only rudimentary.
 Another set of goals will be oxidative coupling of fragments via C-C and C-O bond formation by means of Câ
H activation. The development of new oxidative coupling chemistry is a particular focus due to increases in
efficiency from lower step counts and smaller waste streams. The challenge in this area is selectivity in any given
transformation due the numerous CâH bonds present in a typical organic molecule. Use of biomimetic processes
leads to bioactive natural products and natural product-like cores, desirable entities in medicinal chemistry. The
focus will be on transformations that are currently inaccessible include cross selective couplings, coupling at
unactivated positions, and couplings with substrates resistant to direct oxidation. New strategies that will be
implemented include the use of templating groups and alternate protocols to generate oxidized equivalents.
Catalyst libraries will be deployed in a high-throughput microscale format to discover new reactivity.
 Invaluable training, largely absent outside of industrial settings, will be afforded to graduate students and
other coworkers."

Our research investigates molecular mechanisms through which mechanical forces are regulated and
perceived, how biochemical and biomechanical signals are integrated, and how they act together to modulate
growth and shape during developmental, physiological, and pathological processes.
 Planned investigations build on our discovery of a process that links cytoskeletal tension at adherens
junctions to regulation of Hippo signaling and tissue growth. This occurs through tension-dependent
recruitment of an Ajuba family LIM protein (Jub in Drosophila) to a-catenin. Jub then recruits and inhibits the
key Hippo pathway kinase, Warts, which leads to increased activity of the Hippo pathway transcription factor
Yorkie (Yki). We will investigate molecular mechanisms mediating this regulation, extending our recent
discovery of recruitment of Warts into phase-separated condensates with Jub and of a Jub-promoted
phosphorylation of the Warts N-terminus. Our research will test hypotheses regarding how these activities
contribute to inhibition of Warts and their relevance to regenerative and oncogenic stimuli that activate Yki and
its mammalian homologues. Our research on Hippo signaling will also extend our discovery that it modulates
Drosophila glial cell proliferation, focusing on how Hippo signaling is regulated in the glial cells that form the
blood-brain barrier in Drosophila.
 Our research will also investigate how the cytoskeleton is regulated to drive morphogenetic processes.
Spectrins are membrane cytoskeletal proteins that influence cell shape and Hippo signaling. We discovered
that the Drosophila Î²H-Spectrin Karst (Î²H-Spec) can compete with myosin for binding to F-actin to influence
cytoskeletal tension. This raises fundamental questions that we will address regarding how and where spectrin
and myosin functions are integrated to modulate cell shape and behavior, including how the apically localized
Î²H-Spec and myosin compete and cooperate to influence normal development and physiology, how the
localization of Î²H-Spec and myosin are coordinated, and whether the laterally localized Î²-Spectrin similarly
competes with myosin for F-actin binding to modulate morphogenesis. We will also extend understanding of
Notch signaling functions by investigating how Notch regulates the cytoskeleton to create the dorsal-ventral
compartment boundary of the Drosophila wing disc.
 Our studies investigate highly conserved proteins and signaling networks, and they are relevant to
understanding normal development and physiology, as formation of organs of characteristic and reproducible
size and shape is essential for organ function, and the symptoms of many congenital syndromes stem from
defects in organ growth or morphogenesis. Moreover, dysregulation of growth control is associated with
tumorigenesis, and a detailed understanding of organ growth, morphogenesis, and repair is required to create
functional organs from stem cells, which is a key goal of regenerative medicine."

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, essential for cellular electrical activity, are generated by tetramers of
pore-forming Î± subunits, often in complexes with other, non-pore-forming Î² subunits and other protein classes.
Sodium-coupled solute transporters provide a mechanism for transport of water-soluble ions,
neurotransmitters, vitamins, sugars and other small molecules across cell membranes and against the
electrochemical gradient. In prior award cycles we discovered that Kv channels form physical complexes with
sodium-coupled solute transporters and we defined multiple modes of co-regulation in these âchansporterâ
complexes, establishing a new class of cellular signaling hub. Concomitant with this work, we discovered a
range of novel small-molecule modulators of Kv channels and chansporter complexes, including synthetic
compounds and plant metabolites, some with therapeutic potential. In this latest cycle, we propose to pursue
both these fields of study, focusing primarily on the Kv1 (KCNA) and Kv7 (KCNQ) Kv channel families,
disruption of which causes disorders as diverse as ataxia, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, achlorhydria,
hypothyroidism, and epilepsy, and the transporters with which they interact. We will build on our prior work and
preliminary data that include novel chansporter complexes, novel modes of Kv channel chemosensing in
chansporter complexes, and screening results revealing abundant new Kv channel modulators from plants. We
have established two new, unpublished transgenic rodent lines for this project that will facilitate study of new
therapeutic approaches to treat Episodic Ataxia 1 (EA1) (a mouse model), and of the precise roles in vivo of
KCNQ5 and KCNQ5-transporter complexes (a Kcnq5 knockout rat line). We use a highly integrated approach
to investigate the molecular mechanistic bases for channel and chansporter biology and pathophysiology,
drawing from our long experience in studying molecular basis of biology and disease in multiple tissues,
cellular electrophysiology, transport and radioligand assays, transcriptomics, various imaging modalities,
structure-function studies, and biochemical techniques. In the next five years, we aim to address several
critical knowledge gaps, pursuing the following novel research directions: (1) Molecular mechanistic studies of
new and known channel-transporter complexes to dissect novel forms of co-regulation and signaling; (2)
Channel/transporter-active small molecule discovery from plants, drawing from our completed dual-target
screen of 1444 plant extracts; (3) elucidation of novel roles for KCNQ5 in the vasculature and brain; (4) in vivo
testing of the first compounds known to directly rescue EA1-linked Kv1.1 sequence variants. Our overarching
goals are to uncover new chansporter complexes and their roles in vivo, enhance understanding of Kv channel
biology, and discover novel and therapeutically relevant channel/transporter-targeted small molecules."

Influenza viruses result in a significant number of illnesses and deaths each year highlighting its health and
economic burden. Management of this disease is difficult, and little is known about how different host factor
contribute to heterogenous outcomes. To advance the goals of understanding the diverse immune responses to
influenza and predict risk, it is essential to develop new tools that can define individualized immune trajectories,
simultaneously account for multiple sources of heterogeneity, and accurately predict dynamics that drive disease
progression. This project addresses gaps in identifying the impact that host factors have disease outcome and
gaps in developing computational methods for respiratory infections that accurately predict inflammation and
disease severity. The studies will develop and exploit new predictive systemic immune models and simulate
human populations using virtual patient cohorts aims at differentiating clinical outcomes and identify downstream
effects of varying levels of basal immunity."
10844627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This career development award will provide didactic and experiential training and mentorship necessary for the
candidate to become an independent and fully-funded health services researcher focused on the development
and testing of health-oriented emergency department strategies to improve primary and secondary prevention
of substance use disorders (SUD). The research plan focuses specifically on the epidemic of opioid use
disorder (OUD), fueled by incident OUD which has been largely iatrogenic (i.e., prescribed opioids leading to
OUD despite being used as directed for therapeutic purposes). Guidelines and legislation have targeted
provider prescribing, but the role of the patients in therapeutic decision-making has not been addressed
directly. There is an urgent and imperative need to understand factors influencing patients' motivation
to seek and/or use opioids and engage them as stakeholders in the balance of pain and OUD risk.
Emergency departments (EDs) have been a prime subject of opioid prescribing interventions, because they
frequently initiate or continue therapeutic opioids and do so in circumstances with little provider-patient
familiarity or follow-up care. The objective of this study is to measure and model associations between ED
patient decision-making factors (knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions) and patient motivation to use
opioids for pain relief or avoid OUD risk. The central hypothesis is that ED patients' desire for therapeutic
opioids and decision to use them when available results from potentially modifiable cognitive factors. We will
conduct a mixed-methods study using a combination of focus groups, cross-sectional quantitative survey, and
longitudinal follow-up of opioid seeking and therapeutic use after ED visit for acute pain to accomplish the
following aims: 1) Establish a qualitative understanding of cognitive factors influencing patient motivation to use
opioids for acute pain; 2) Develop the Decisions To use Opioids (DTO) survey instrument to quantify potential
cognitive determinants of patient motivation to use opioids for acute pain; including 2a) Psychometric testing of
the DTO, and 2b) Measure the contribution of cognitive factors to patient motivation to seek/use opioids.
This will promote highly impactful advances in the field of iatrogenic OUD, by informing shared decision-
making models and new behavioral interventions. The research plan is also highly complementary to the
career development of an independent clinical researcher focused on the development of primary and
secondary SUD prevention strategies in the ED setting, providing experience in mixed-methods, longitudinal
prospective clinical research, survey validation, and predictive modeling, as well as rich preliminary data to
support future investigation under the direction of a highly qualified and multidisciplinary team of mentors. The
quintessential contribution of this research will be to engage the patient in helping to balance the risk of
unrelieved pain with the risk of subsequent OUD."

Chemical Biological Discovery of Lipid Virulence Factors in the Major Bacterial Pathogens
For decades, the search for the causes of bacterial virulence has focused on genes rather than metabolites.
Genetic approaches have been broadly successful, and modern infectious disease research relies
fundamentally on genomic maps of the major pathogens. Owing to the lack of whole-organism chemical
biology tools, bacterial lipids have not been systematically tested for their roles in virulence, even though lipids
are the primary interface with the human host, where they control nutrient flow and trigger host immune
response. We invented a mass spectrometry platform for lipid profiling to detect nearly all ionizable lipids in a
bacterial cell within 2 hours. Experiments on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhi now provide clear evidence for the general insight that many, perhaps the majority, of lipids in the world's
bacterial pathogens, are currently unknown as named compounds. Based on successes in identifying virulence
factors in two major pathogens of worldwide significance, we will carry out a chemical biology approach known
as forward lipidomics. Specifically, we will use whole organism mass spectrometry profiling to discover the
lipids that are selectively expressed in virulent bacteria and are unknown in existing lipid catalogs. Then, we
will chemically synthesize the virulence associated lipids and link them to their biosynthetic genes for deletion
in bacteria using reverse genetic approaches. Using genetically modified bacteria that are deficient in defined
lipids, we will determine the roles of virulence lipids during infection. Using nature identical synthetic lipids, we
will determine the cellular mechanisms of generation of foamy macrophages and identify immune receptors
that mediate host response. We will create lipid maps of the major Gram negative pathogen groups based on
patient strains to build the overlooked field of chemical biology of bacterial virulence. These basic and
translational studies will support the development new forward lipidomics approaches to the diagnosis and
treatment of major infectious diseases."
10845290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hallmark features of many forms of cardiovascular disease include exercise intolerance and a high risk of
suffering an adverse ischemic cardiovascular event such as cardiac fibrillation, myocardial infarction, or stroke
during physical exertion. An exaggerated increase in sympathetic nervous system activity during exercise (i.e.,
sympathoexcitation) is a direct contributor to exercise intolerance and the risk of such adverse events. During
exercise, mechanical forces associated with contracting skeletal muscles stimulate small diameter muscle
sensory neurons (group III/IV muscle afferents) which plays an integral role in the activation of a reflex, the
exercise pressor reflex, that contributes to increased sympathetic nervous system activity during exercise. The
goal of this project is to investigate the cellular signaling mechanisms that result in exaggerated mechanically-
activated exercise pressor reflex sympathetic control signals in cardiovascular disease. Specifically, we will use
a rat model of limb ischemia in which a femoral artery is chronically ligated (a model of simulated peripheral
artery disease) and a complementary blend of molecular and whole-animal approaches to investigate the
signaling pathways within muscle sensory neurons that result in a pathophysiological enhancement of
mechanically-activated channel function. The incorporation of multiple experimental techniques including
molecular, electrophysiology, reflex, and conscious exercise experiments will ensure that our findings are robust,
integrative, and translational in nature. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role played by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
(IP3) receptors and altered calcium signaling in group III/IV muscle afferents in the exaggerated mechanical
component of the exercise pressor reflex (i.e., the mechanoreflex) in rats with chronic limb ischemia. In Aim 2,
we will investigate the role played by exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), especially EPAC 1, signaling
in group III/IV muscle afferents in the exaggerated mechanoreflex in rats with chronic limb ischemia. In Aim 3,
we will investigate the role played by protein kinase C (PKC), especially PKCÎµ, signaling in group III/IV muscle
afferents in the exaggerated mechanoreflex in rats with chronic limb ischemia. This project is innovative because
it is the first to systematically investigate the signaling mechanisms that modulate the function of mechanically
activated channels that contribute to sympathoexcitation during exercise in cardiovascular disease. This project
is significant because the experiments may identity three novel targets (IP3 receptors, EPAC1, and PKCÎµ) for
therapies aimed at mitigating sympathoexcitation, exercise intolerance, and/or elevated risk of ischemic events
in cardiovascular disease patients."
10845291,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the impairment in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and the fragile X premutation (FXpm), surprisingly little
research has examined the underpinnings of these impairments. One potential factor that contributes to
impairment is autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. Elevated physiological arousal, reflecting ANS
dysfunction, has long been implicated as contributing to learning impairments and atypical behavior in FXS.
While ANS dysfunction has been linked to impairment in both FXS and FXpm, research has not examined the
presence, onset, developmental trajectory, or developmental consequences of ANS dysfunction or how
molecular-genetic factors are associated. This project addresses these critical gaps with the following specific
aims: (1) Identify the onset and developmental trajectory of baseline ANS dysfunction through prospective
longitudinal assessment at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months in FXS (n=30 males) and FXpm (n=30; 15 males and 15
females) contrasted to typical controls (n=45; 30 males and 15 females); (2) Determine how molecular-genetic
variation relates to the onset and/or developmental trajectory of ANS dysfunction in FXS and FXpm; (3)
Characterize behavioral and ANS reactivity to sensory stimuli through prospective longitudinal assessment at
6, 9, 12, and 24 months in FXS and FXpm; and (4) Document the consequences of ANS dysfunction across
infancy on sensory processing impairments, adaptive skills, ASD symptoms, and social communication,
concurrently and at 24 months in FXS and FXpm. This work will have tremendous impact by greatly expanding
information on the mechanistic underpinnings, biological pathways, and timing of symptom progression, which
is essential to identify targets and timing of treatment to reduce symptom severity in FXS and FXpm. Our focus
on infancy is critical, as evidence has documented that intervention provided early in life has the potential to
accelerate development and improve developmental trajectories over time in a multi-dimensional manner."

Cachexia, or the inflammatory loss of lean body mass, is a leading predictor of morbidity across chronic diseases.
A disease of complex etiology, cachexia has proven difficult to model in animals. Little is known regarding the
molecular mechanisms controlling cachexia onset, persistence and pathology; and widely efficacious
interventions to reverse cachexia are lacking. We have recently shown that Toxoplasma infection in mice is
novel animal model to study sustained cachexia. The longevity of this model has led to the discovery that
chronically cachectic mice have perivascular fibrosis in the liver. Importantly, we have found that mice defective
in the IL-1 innate immune signaling pathway are protected from cachexia and fibrosis and altered lipid
metabolism, despite harboring a similar titer of Toxoplasma as WT animals. We hypothesize that cachexia is
a cost of long-term IL-1 signaling. In this proposal we will determine whether eliminating chronic infection or
blocking fibrosis is sufficient to reverse cachexia. We will identify the IL-1R expressing cell types driving cachexia
and determine how IL-1 signaling on fibroblasts and/or endothelial cells control aberrant lipid metabolism in
cachectic livers. Our studies are timely, as a recent clinical study demonstrated that blocking human IL-1a with
a monoclonal antibody has reversed some symptoms of cachexia. Thus, we have a novel model to understand
the mechanism of IL-1 function in cachexia and test therapeutic interventions for disease reversal. Understanding
the role of the IL-1 axis in cachexia will improve the life span and comfort of patients suffering from a wide range
of debilitating chronic diseases."
10825993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a double-stranded DNA human tumor virus that is the main causative
agent of Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), a rare, but extremely aggressive skin cancer. MCC predominantly affects
elderly or immunosuppressed patients. Currently, there is a lack of durable and effective treatment options to
treat this cancer, thereby necessitating the need to identify new therapeutic options as rates of MCC are steadily
increasing. Before the onset of MCC, MCPyV establishes a latent infection and therefore, must have its own
mechanisms to promote long term survival within its host to cause MCC later in life. It is known that other human
tumor viruses, such as Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), induce cell cycle arrest in infected cells to promote viral
persistence. My previous results showed that MCPyV induces host cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence by
expressing the large tumor antigen (LT) as a mechanism to promote viral genome maintenance in human
fibroblast cells. When investigating how MCPyV LT might induce cellular senescence, we observed that this viral
oncoprotein induces the nucleolar stress response (NSR), a host stress response that functions to cause cell
cycle arrest and/or cellular senescence, usually in a p53-dependent manner. The NSR is canonically activated
upon factors that can inhibit ribosomal biogenesis and often results in disruption of the nucleolar structure and
activation of p53. Though this stress response has been characterized in response to nutrient starvation,
chemotherapeutic drugs, or other stressors, it has not been sufficiently defined in the context of viral infections.
The goal of this proposal is to determine how the NSR is regulated by MCPyV infection and how this stress
response might impact MCPyV replication. Specifically, my preliminary data indicated that MCPyV LT
downregulates processes that regulate ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expression and processing, or dysregulates
ribosomal assembly and/or protein synthesis seen by a lack of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (p-RPS6)
expression, implicating a potential role of LT in modulating ribosomal biogenesis on the RNA and protein level.
Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCPyV LT can inhibit ribosomal biogenesis to
induce the NSR, which is required for MCPyV viral persistence. To address this hypothesis, Specific Aim
1 will characterize the NSR phenotypes and elucidate the mechanism and processes of ribosomal biogenesis
that are directly disrupted by MCPyV LT. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism by which MCPyV LT
promotes p53 activation and how the p53-dependent NSR regulates MCPyV genome replication and
persistence. Taken altogether, the findings from this proposal will significantly expand our understanding on the
role of the NSR as a critical viral sensor and identify host factors that are essential for MCPyV pathogenesis."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening inflammatory lung disease that has high
morbidity and mortality rates, with 40% of patients dying making it a significant public health concern. In the
healthy human lung, the fluid in the airspace is balanced by two complementary processes: sodium-driven fluid
clearance and paracellular diffusion of fluid through the junctions between epithelial cells. ARDS is due to
dysfunction in these two processes, leading to flooding of the tiny air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli). In the
impaired lung, paracellular diffusion increases due to increased leak, but the lung compensates by increasing
sodium-driven fluid clearance. This leaves the lung functional but impaired, priming it for ARDS. The damaged
lung barrier combined with a second injury such as pneumonia, sepsis, or ventilator-induced injury can cause
severe airspace flooding, pulmonary edema, that cannot be mediated by compensatory fluid clearance.
Chronic alcohol abuse exacerbates the severity and likelihood of ARDS, by disrupting a major regulator of the
fluid balance in the lungs, tight junctions. Studies have examined factors that affect tight junctions in alveolar
epithelial cells, but a lesser studied possible interactor of tight junctions are integrins. Integrins exist as obligate
Î±/Î² heterodimer pairs that can form several functionally distinct conformations. The two forms are an inactive
bent state and an active extended state that enables high affinity ligand binding. Here we will examine integrin
expression, localization, and function in primary alveolar and airway epithelial cells. The effect of specifically
targeting integrins on paracellular permeability will be measured, along with determining the molecular
mechanisms linking integrins to the regulation of tight junctions. This approach will help evaluate integrins as a
target to regulate lung fluid balance through the control of lung epithelial tight junctions."

The selective transformation of unactivated CâH bonds into CâC bonds has been a longstanding challenge for
synthetic chemists, and the uranyl cation (UO22+) has been shown to catalyze these transformations on a variety
of substrates14-20. The uranyl cation is the most common form of uranium in the environment, existing in sea
water at a concentration of about 3.3 ppb10. Early studies on the photochemistry of the uranyl ion have shown
that photoexcitation with visible light will populate a highly oxidizing (+2.6 eV vs SHE) triplet excited state of the
uranyl unit, which has a lifetime of microseconds with free radical character on the oxo groups and the uranium
center11-13. This oxyl radical abstracts H atoms to form an O-H bond that is sufficiently strong to enable abstrac-
tion from unactivated CâH bonds. Recent publications on photocatalysis of the uranyl ion have reported the
functionalization of a variety of CâH bonds to form CâF bonds, CâC bonds, and CâO bonds17-20. Due to the
ubiquity of CâH bonds in organic molecules, site-selectivity transformations are often difficult to achieve. Fur-
thermore, stereoselective reactions would require chiral ligands that have not yet been incorporated into uranyl
complexes. Nature has developed a variety of metalloenzymes that functionalize unactivated CâH bonds with
exquisite selectivities imparted by the enzymatic scaffold22-29. In many of these enzymes, the reactive metal-oxo
intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from a CâH bond to generate a carbon-centered radical. Functionaliza-
tion of the generated radical, however, is largely limited by the rapid rebound of the radical onto the metal hy-
droxide, providing hydroxylated, halogenated, or pseudohalogenated products35-42. Abstraction of a C-H bond by
the uranyl ion, however, is not followed by transfer of the hydroxyl radical, due to the strong UâO bonds, thereby
enabling functionalization of the radical intermediate in different ways. Thus, one should be able to achieve site-
selective and stereoselective CâH bond functionalization with the uranyl ion by incorporating a photocatalytically
active uranyl ion in place of a natural ion in the active site of an enzyme. The Hartwig group has experience in
creating and developing artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) with non-native metallocofactors for abiotic chemistry
and catalysis51-61, and the Arnold group has extensive experience studying the uranyl ion and the photochemistry
of this unit14-16,21. Through a collaboration between these two groups, I propose to develop novel ArMs containing
an unnatural uranyl cofactor for the site- and stereoselective functionalization of CâH bonds to form CâC bonds.
This will be accomplished by following two complementary strategies: 1) design of a photocatalytically active
uranyl complex and bioconjugation of this complex into an enzyme scaffold; 2) incorporation of the unnatural
amino acid phosphotyrosine or phosphosyrine into an enzyme active site and binding the uranyl ion within the
unnatural site containing a phosphate group. These metalloproteins will then be used for intra and intermolecular
Giese-type reactions initiated by hydrogen-atom abstraction, followed by addition to electron-poor alkenes."

 Extravasation of inflammatory monocytes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in response to human
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) is a critical event that leads to chronic neuroinflammation, neurologic injury,
and subsequent loss of cognitive abilities in a significantly large number of infected individuals. However, given
the heterogeneity of monocytes that exists in HIV-infected individuals receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART), it
remains unknown as to whether the neuro-modulatory actions of monocytes are limited to select subset of
monocytes. Directly relevant to the goals of RFA-21-250, our supporting data reveals that the ART-treated HIV-
infected individuals harbor higher numbers of inflammatory monocytes (CD14lowCD16hi) in their circulation.
These cells also exhibit characteristic features of clonal hematopoiesis (CH), such as loss of DNA
methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) with concurrent increase in the
expression of janus kinase-2 (Jak2 ; these three gene products, and few others, are often termed as CH drivers).
Interestingly, subsequent experiments in various models suggested that this monocyte subset (1) translocate to
the central nervous system (CNS) in response to ART, in platelet-dependent manner, (2) is neuro-modulatory in
action, and (3) can be expanded following exposure of monocytes to activated platelets and ART. Based on
these findings, we posit that the priming of monocytes by activated platelets potentiates ART-mediated
clonal hematopoiesis in monocytes, leading to HIV-associated neurologic injury. In this model, we propose
that the composite effect of activated platelets and ART results into clonal expansion of inflammatory
(CD14lowCD16hi) monocyte subset with CH, and subsequent demethylation/induction of PSGL-1 gene in them.
Functionally, these events facilitate the transmigration of such monocytes into the perivascular spaces within the
CNS, where these cells differentiate into macrophage phenotype, while retaining CH profile, and contribute to
the neuronal dysfunction. This model then, in full accordance with the available literature, accounts for how
neurologic manifestations are initiated and maintained due to immune-CNS interaction in ART-treated HIV-
infected individuals."
10837871,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Neuroimaging methods such as functional MRI and magneto- / electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) cannot directly reveal causal relationships between regional brain activity and behavior. To allow causal inference, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to perturb local cortical activity to create temporary ""virtual lesionsâ. However, even simple behavioral tasks employ widely distributed brain networks with multiple nodes activated at different millisecond-level latencies, whereas todayâs TMS technology is mainly limited to single-channel devices that target only one brain area at a time. The mismatch between the large number of network nodes and the small number of cortical areas we can target with present TMS devices forms a critical barrier in exploring network-level causal inferences in the human brain. To remove this barrier, we need TMS technology that can perturb multiple cortical locations at specific processing stages. Removing this barrier would open entirely new avenues for gaining insight into how complex cognitive functions emerge from cortical networks. For the identification of neural networks underlying cognitive operations, two steps are necessary. First, network nodes are identified as locations where the strength of the TMS-induced electric field and relevant behavioral or neuroimaging-based variables maximally correlate. This can be achieved efficiently using the unprecedented ability of the multichannel TMS array to generate different customized electric field patterns in rapid succession. Next, information flow between the network nodes is explored by stimulating the nodes in rapid temporal succession. For this, the ability of the multichannel array to switch between electric field patterns in milliseconds is crucial. The network-level mapping capabilities of the instrument will be first verified in a testbench experiment in a known network (motor system). We then proceed to studies that identify network nodes underlying language comprehension. Finally, we will use the multifocal stimulation approach to investigate information flow in the language comprehension network and develop a neural mass model of the underlying neuronal circuits for a theoretical basis. In the long term, the wider society may benefit from all applications of the proposed research through network-level TMS therapies that are optimized for modulating functional connectivity between brain regions involved in critical functions such as hearing, speech, and language processing."
10861093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An adequate placental transfer of lipids is critical for normal fetal growth and brain development, yet the
mechanisms involved in placental lipid handling and transport are largely unknown. Many important
pregnancy complications such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and maternal diabetes are
associated with disturbances in fetal fat deposition that may contribute to adverse short-and long-term
outcomes. Although mechanistic links between placental lipid handling and transport, fetal fat deposition and
fetal brain development remain to be established, emerging evidence suggests that these pregnancy
complications are associated with altered placental lipid metabolism. The syncytiotrophoblast, the
transporting epithelium of the human placenta, mediates the transfer of lipids from the maternal to the fetal
circulation. There is now compelling evidence that complex lipid forms are produced in large amounts by the
syncytiotrophoblast and are potentially released to the fetus. In particular, primary human trophoblast cells
rapidly take up fatty acids and incorporate them to phospholipids. De novo synthesis and remodeling of
phospholipids generates a range of biologically active intermediates, including Phosphatidic Acid which
regulates mTOR signaling in cancer cells. Phospholipid remodeling generates Lysophosphatidylcholine
species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA) which is the predominant form in which DHA is
transported across the blood brain barrier, mediated by MajorFacilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 2A
(MFSD2a),an LPC-DHA transporter. We found high levels of LPC-DHA in placental tissue and that umbilical
vein LPC-DHA levels are higher than maternal circulating concentrations, suggesting that DHA is delivered to
the fetus as LPC-DHA. In addition, we discovered that MFSD2a is expressed in the human
syncytiotrophoblast basal plasma membrane, consistent with the possibility that this transporter mediates
transfer of LPC-DHA to the fetus. These observations provide the premise for our central hypothesis that
trophoblast phospholipid synthesis and remodeling are highly active, produces phosphatidic acid (which
modulates TOR signaling) and LPC-DHA for transport to the fetus, mediated by MFSD2a. Our hypothesis is
supported by compelling preliminary data including evidence that phosphatidic acid regulates placental
amino acid transport mediated through mTOR signaling and LPC-DHA is produced in placenta and released
to the fetus. We will use human placental tissue, maternal and umbilical blood samples collected from normal
and complicated pregnancies, siRNA gene targeting approaches in cultured primary human trophoblast cells
incubated in a physiological mixture of 13C-stable isotope labelled fatty acids and trophoblast specific gene
targeting in mice to address this hypothesis. These
mechanistic
placental
studies are highly significant because we will use nove
approaches to establish that phospholipid synthesis intermediates are important regulators of
function and critical mediators of placental transfer of DHA, essential for normal brain development.

Severe pediatric febrile illness has high global mortality and disproportionately affects children in resource-
limited settings in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Though rapid, appropriate treatment can improve outcomes in
severe febrile illness, we lack a robust understanding of how to rapidly identify children in need of urgent and
specific management. My central hypotheses are that next generation sequencing can improve detection of a
serious bacterial infection compared to culture and that biomarker point-of-care tests can predict a serious
bacterial infection and clinical deterioration in children presenting with severe febrile illness. With the Pediatric
Severe Infection Collaboration (UCSF, Muhimbili Hospital in Tanzania, and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in
San Francisco), this proposal leverages expertise that uses clinical data, cutting-edge pathogen detection
methods, an innovative bioinformatics platform (Global IDSeq), and biomarkers to develop a treatment
algorithm for severe febrile illness in Africa. In this prospective cohort study of Tanzanian children with severe
febrile illness, we will determine risk factors associated with poor clinical outcomes (Aim 1) and employ both
locally available diagnostic techniques (Aim 1) and state-of-the-art next generation sequencing to determine
the etiology of severe febrile illness (Aim 2). Using data from Aims 1 & 2, we will determine which POCTs for
host serum biomarkers (procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate, blood sugar, and hemoglobin) best
predict serious bacterial infection and clinical deterioration (Aim 3) and develop a treatment algorithm
incorporating clinical signs and biomarkers that will guide management and resource allocation.
My long-term career objective is to improve clinical outcomes for children with severe febrile illness through the
development and implementation of evidence-based interventions that are appropriate and context-relevant for
resource-limited settings. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award offers me the
opportunity to: (1) develop skills and expertise necessary to become an independent physician-scientist in the
field of pediatric severe febrile illness; (2) integrate population-specific clinical data, locally available diagnostic
data, cutting-edge next generation sequencing science, and host biomarkers to better identify serious bacterial
infections and high-risk children; (3) build further clinical research infrastructure and processes in Tanzania for
future clinical studies; and (4) learn and apply next-generation sequencing data analysis using a bioinformatics
approach and advanced biostatistical analyses of complex observational data. I have assembled a mentoring,
collaborative team with diverse expertise who are committed to helping me achieve these goals. After
completion of this proposal that employs local clinical data, a highly sensitive method of pathogen detection, an
innovative bioinformatics platform, and a unique approach to risk stratification with point-of-care biomarkers,
we will be uniquely positioned to create an evidence-based, contextâspecific treatment algorithm to improve
outcomes in children with severe febrile illness in SSA, which will be tested in an R01-funded study."

for structure determination and analysis to support research groups affiliated with the Oklahoma COBRE in
Structural Biology (OCSB) and other groups involved in structural biology research across the State of Oklahoma
and in the region. The BSC accomplishes this purpose by using robotic instrumentation for the screening of
crystallization conditions, high-flux microfocus X-ray generators, and a state-of-the-art hybrid pixel X-ray detector
for rapid data collection along with computational resources to process and determine the structure of the
macromolecule of interest. Dr. Blaine Mooers (Academic Core Director) and Dr. Leonard Thomas (Facility
Manager) are full-time Ph.D. crystallographers. The core employs a Staff Scientist and a Graduate Assistant to
aid in the screening of crystallization conditions and the preparation of samples for the collection of X-ray data.
The core provides training to students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty who are interested in macromolecular
structure determination. The services of the BSC encompass all aspects of structure determination including
crystallization screening, crystal cryo-protectant screening, diffraction data collection and processing, structure
determination and refinement, structure analysis and interpretation, figure preparation, and structure deposition
in the Protein Data Bank. The core also facilitates diffraction data collection at national synchrotron facilities.
During Phase 2, a Molecular Modeling Unit was added to the core, which has been facilitating intensive
computational work for candidate drug molecule screening, molecular dynamics simulations, and molecular
replacement. This unit will also be used for molecular modeling with small-angle X-ray scattering studies (SAXS)
data and cryo-EM data with ensembles of structures.
During Phases 1 and 2 of OCSB funding, the BSCâs user base expanded from 7 to over 50 user groups. To
promote further expansion of the user base in Phase 3, the BSC will expand its support and promotion of solution-
based structure determination methodologies, such as SAXS and cryo-EM. The BSC Academic Core Director
Dr. Blaine Mooers is a SAXS expert and thus uniquely qualified to consult and collaborate with researchers in
need of this methodology. During Phase 2, OCSB funding was used to purchase cryo-plungers for the freezing
of samples for cryo-EM. In addition, the University of Oklahoma recently hired a TEM specialist as a staff scientist
for its OU Samuel Roberts Noble Microscopy Laboratory (SRNML) to allow for the expansion into cryo-EM. The
core is collaborating with the SRNML on implementing cryo-EM techniques such as cryo-grid preparation and

Research Development Core (RDC) is significant because it will advance the science of aging, provide much-
needed training and professional development of early career scientists, provide access to technology
platforms and promote the aging field beyond its current boundaries."
10861851,"ABSTRACT- Genomic Translation Across Species Core
The overarching goal of the Genomic Translation Across Species Core (GTASC) aligns with the larger mission
of the Nathan Shock Center, to advance translational research on biological processes contributing to aging-
related outcomes through interdisciplinary collaboration. While there has been much progress in using model
systems to understand biological processes underlying aging phenotypes related to healthspan and disease, the
translation of findings in model organisms from biologists to clinicians in order to validate genetic, transcriptomic,
or epigenetic associations with age-specific indicators in humans occurs very slowly, as does bringing findings
back to model systems for experimental manipulation. The GTASC has a unique set of resources and expertise
with which to facilitate translational processes in normal aging samples, with diversity in sex/gender and
race/ethnic composition, and with age ranges from 50 to 109, thereby enabling the potential to accelerate the
rate of therapeutic discovery for many aging-related diseases. This core leverages expertise in the methods and
analysis of phenotypes derived from large-scale, nationally representative, normal aging cohorts, and makes
these population-level data accessible to biologists. We will use up to 28 years of data from the U.S. Health and
Retirement Study (HRS), a population representative sample of adults aged 50+ (N=18,000) who have high-
density genotypic data, and transcription and methylation data (n~4,000), and over 16 years of data from the
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) genetic sample (N=7,407). Available phenotypes include
biomarkers curated from blood, methylated DNA or telomeres, as well as indices of functional ability, including
physical status, disease conditions, cognitive functioning, frailty or mortality indicators, and environmental and
behavioral phenotypes. Aims of the GTASC are to: (1) Accelerate translational research on human aging by
interrogating findings derived from model systems in human population data; (2) Develop the resources and
tools that can be expediently invoked for customized translational analyses; and (3) Develop new research
directions using model systems, which entails designing and developing analytical plans for experimental and
mechanism-based studies based on findings from human data. Increased access to cross-translational
resources to validate model system findings in humans, generate additional hypotheses under natural human
conditions, and use empirically-driven approaches for experimental designs will lead to an accelerated pace for
gaining novel insights into processes in aging, and pave a faster route to intervention and treatment studies. The
innovative combination of population genomics, biological markers, bioinformatics, and expertise in phenotype
development to mark mortality, disease, and functionality is what gives this GTAS Core its uniqueness as a
resource."

PACS2 syndrome is a recently identified neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a recurrent de novo missense
mutation in PACS2 (p.Glu209Lys (PACS2E209K)). Patients carrying this missense mutation suffer from
developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-66 (DEE66), and share several deficits, including neonatal seizures,
global developmental delay, hypotonia, autism, and cerebellar dysgenesis. The mechanism by which
PACS2E209K causes PACS2 syndrome is unknown, and no curative treatment is available. PACS2 is a
multifunctional sorting protein that is essential for formation of ER-mitochondria contacts (MAMs), and localizes
calcium signaling molecules to the ER, including the calcium-permeable channel PKD2. MAMs are dynamic
quasi-synaptic structures that localize mTORC2/Akt, which phosphorylates PACS2 to modulate calcium transfer
and lipid metabolism. MAM-localized PACS2 acts as a phosphorylation state-dependent metabolic switch that
coordinates SIRT1/PGC-1Î±-dependent oxidative metabolism with MAM integrity and function. The E209K
substitution is located in a critical autoregulatory domain that controls binding of PACS2 to its client proteins.
Preliminary studies suggest PACS2 interacts with PKD2 to mediate ER-mitochondria calcium transfer and that
the E209K substitution reduces MAM contacts and diverts calcium into the cytosol. Consequently, PACS2E209K
increases aerobic glycolysis in both patient cells and the cortex of Pacs2E209K/+ mice. Consistent with these
findings, preliminary electrophysiology studies reveal PACS2E209K increases glutamatergic synaptic inputs in L2/3
cortical neurons. Together, these findings suggest PACS2E209K disturbs MAM function, impacting neuronal
metabolism, neurotransmission, and behavior. Our long-term goal is to understand how PACS2E209K causes
disease and to use this information to develop effective therapies. The objective of this particular application is
to determine how PACS2E209K dysregulates ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer to disturb CNS metabolism and
behavior. We hypothesize that PACS2E209K disturbs PKD2 function to dysregulate MAM integrity and calcium
diffusion dynamics, which consequently switches the brain to glycolytic metabolism and dysregulates
neurotransmission resulting in behavioral deficits. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine how PACS2E209K alters ER-mitochondria calcium coupling in
isolated neurons and ex vivo L2/3 slice cultures, 2) Determine the impact of PACS2E209K on fuel handling by
measuring glucose and lactate dynamics, mitochondrial metabolism and gene expression, and 3) Determine
how PACS2E209K alters synaptic activity, learning and behavior. The approach is innovative because we will
combine advanced live-cell imaging with metabolic profiling and behavioral assessments of the first mouse
model for PACS2 syndrome to elucidate the mechanism by which the recurrent E209K substitution causes
neuronal dysfunction. This research is significant because it will advance our mechanistic understanding of a
critical cellular process that might be targeted to treat this debilitating disorder."
10861800,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must navigate important cellular fate choices that include a
symmetric self-renewal, symmetric commitment or undergo an asymmetric cell division where
one of the cells is fated to differentiate. Alterations in this homeostatic program can lead to
hematopoietic disorders and malignancies. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a
heterogeneous set of clonal disorders characterized by ineffective blood cell development. A
common pathophysiologic mechanism in MDS is the presence of dysregulated hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells that fail to normally develop into the diverse set of blood cells
necessary for normal function. Our laboratory and others identified MUSASHI2 (MSI2) as a
central regulator of HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cell self-renewal (Kharas et al. Nature
Medicine 2010). Additionally, we identified that Msi2 loss results in a defect in controlling
symmetric and asymmetric division, failure to engraft and results in defective maintenance of
myeloid lineage biased HSCs in part through control of the TGFÎ² pathway (Park et al. 2014
Journal of Experimental Medicine). We found that elevated levels of MSI2 expression predicts
poor outcome and using a genetic MDS mouse model that overexpresses MSI2 can drive a
more aggressive MDS (Taggart et al. 2016 Nature Communications). To determine if MSI2 is
part of a regulatory network, we performed proteomics and in vivo shRNA screen for functional
regulators of leukemia self-renewal. Based on this screen, we identified SYNCRIP, an RNA
binding protein that shares MSI2 targets and is required in leukemia stem cells (Vu et al., 2017
Nature Genetics). Our preliminary data with a conditional knockout for Syncrip indicates that it is
also critical for HSC self-renewal. Our proposal will expand our focus from MSI2 to its
associated regulatory network and characterize and identify new molecular determinants for
HSC and HSPC symmetric self-renewal and asymmetric fate choice. We have adapted new
technologies that include a barcoding, single cell RNA-seq and paired daughter HSC assays
(FATE-seq). We have also develop a new way to map direct mRNA targets in HSCs called
(HYPERTRIBE), (Nguyen et al. Nature Communications 2020).This proposal will identify new
regulators of HSPC fate choice which will lead to novel therapeutic strategies to improve
outcomes in MDS patients."
10861810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aminoglycosides are one of the cheapest and well-known antibiotics in clinical use for over 70 years, but one of
the major limitations in their use is their ototoxicity. Although new generations of antibiotics have emerged in the
last decades, aminoglycoside antibiotics maintain a leading role in treatment of acute infections and for specific
indications such as tuberculosis or the containment of pseudomonas bacteria in patients with cystic fibrosis.
Owing to their broad antibacterial spectrum and efficacy against resistant bacterial diseases, aminoglycoside
antibiotics continue to be indispensable. However, their use has been limited due to side effects. The major side
effects accompanying aminoglycoside treatment are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, including cochlear damage
and vestibular disorders. Nephrotoxicity affects about 20% of patients and is usually reversible, while ototoxicity
is irreversible. It is estimated that cochlear damage occurs in 20% and vestibular disorders in 15% of those
receiving aminoglycoside antibiotics, but the incidence increases markedly to 80% in long-term treatment for
tuberculosis. The pathological feature of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is loss of mechanosensory hair
cells in the inner ear. Hair cell loss begins at the base of the cochlea and proceeds toward the apex. Hair cells
are specialized mechanoreceptors that convert auditory and vestibular mechanical stimuli into electrical signals.
These cells are responsible for the detection of sound and equilibrium. Since mammalian hair cells lack the
ability to regenerate, the loss of or damage to hair cells is the leading cause of permanent hearing impairments
and vestibular disorders. Although a series of biological events and cell death pathways are known to be involved
in aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, no established clinical therapies for prevention or amelioration of this
disability are available. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity reduces the quality of life of millions of affected
individuals and confers a great economic cost. Therefore, development of new efficacious synthetic
aminoglycoside derivatives, but without the problematic side effects, will provide a fundamental approach to
prevent ototoxicity. Since the ototoxicity potential and organ preference varies among the different
aminoglycoside antibiotics, small changes in structure may greatly influence toxicity, providing great possibility
to find new aminoglycoside derivatives. We are developing fast and low-cost methods to develop
aminoglycosides with broad spectrum anti-infective activities, but with reduced ototoxicity. In this project, we will
identify novel aminoglycoside based anti-infectives, that show reduced ototoxicity. This work addresses an
important health issue, anti-infective drug ototoxicity, and presents creative steps towards a novel solution to this
problem.
Unless innovative strategies are developed to produce robust and effective new classes of non-toxic antibiotics,
health care costs will continue to climb and we will completely lose our ability to combat even the most common
infection. One of the challenges of research in drug development is to find ways to use the increasing knowledge
of the mechanisms underlying disease biology, and toxicities, along with disease transformation and progression
to develop novel therapeutic strategies for MDR, XDR, and PDR infections. One of the biggest bottlenecks in
the advancement of drugs to the clinic and eventual limitation in the clinical usage, is the toxicity of the drug.
This problem becomes even more acute when the drugs have to be used for extended periods of time (months),
such as for fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. We have therefore focused our efforts in
identifying the toxicity pathways for individual drug classes, such as aminoglycosides, and addressed these
issues at the very outset. Since aminoglycoside-induced hair cell loss in explants is similar to that in humans,
we will first use mouse organ culture for a secondary screening of the top compounds without toxicity. We will
then use pigmented guinea pigs to evaluate auditory function by measurement of auditory brainstem responses,
count loss of sensory hair cell loss, and assess renal function with serum for the top compounds. The results of
this project will help us identify novel aminoglycosides with high efficacy against microbes of interest, but with
reduced toxicity.
The work proposed here, a multidisciplinary effort using rapid methods of synthesis, inhibition, and ototoxicity
assays, will be further developed in this Phase II application using in vivo efficacy and ototoxicity studies using
guinea pig models. We propose using novel aminoglycoside modifications, patented NUBAD assays, mouse
organ culture studies, guinea pigs, to identify conjugates that show reduced ototoxicities, opening possibilities
for developing drugs that can target resistant pathogens, but with much improved therapeutic indices."
10862174,"General Introduction, Abstract
Smell deficits are one of the most reproducible changes in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). They are tightly
correlated with specific clinical features, such as negative symptoms and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social
cognitive deficits), but rarely with positive symptoms. Many studies have also observed molecular and cellular
changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in living patients with SZ. Our group has accumulated evidence that
the immune/inflammatory changes associated with redox imbalance may be major pathological changes in the
OE of SZ patients. Nevertheless, whether and how the OE pathology mechanistically contributes to these
specific clinical features has been a major knowledge gap. Using an inducible animal model, we have
demonstrated that chronic local OE inflammation elicits a functional alteration in prefrontal cortex (PFC)
pyramidal neurons, likely via the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. As a result, the mice showed behavioral deficits in
the positive valence systems and social processes. Consistent with this basic science observation, we have
recently obtained promising results that specific molecular changes in the inflammatory/redox signaling in the
OE are directly correlated with negative symptoms (deficits of the positive valence systems) and smell deficits
in SZ patients at the cross-sectional and longitudinal levels. Altogether, we hypothesize that molecular and
cellular changes in the OE in SZ patients, or at least in a subset of them, significantly contribute to specific
clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits. We expect that the OE pathology alters the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits and PFC pyramidal neuron functionality, which in turn contributes to negative symptoms and
social cognitive deficits in SZ patients. We hypothesize that the impact of OE pathology on the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits is more robust in adolescence/young adulthood when the PFC maturation dynamically
happens. We propose three Projects and three Cores. Project 1 (P1) will define how OE perturbation (e.g.,
chronic local OE inflammation) elicits the neuronal alteration in the OE and OB, which results in behavioral
deficits; P2 will determine the circuitry mechanism(s) that links OE pathology to the PFC via the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits, and identify the critical developmental period vulnerable to the OE influences; P3 will define
OE pathology in early-stage SZ patients at the molecular/cellular levels, stratify patient groups depending on
the specific mechanisms (e.g., molecular expression levels), and elucidate how the OE pathology influences
specific clinical symptoms (e.g., negative symptoms and cognitive deficits) via the olfactory-prefrontal circuits.
This molecular/circuitry mechanism cannot solely be causal for these clinical deficits. Nevertheless, we
consider this mechanism as a significant contributory factor for them. Given that inflammation/redox-associated
pathology in the OE is potentially treatable with local, non-invasive interventions, we believe that this study will
provide new translational insights into these treatment-refractory clinical domains in SZ."
10862175,"Core A (Administrative Core): ABSTRACT
Core A (Administrative Core) is a large core that comprises sub-groups for administrative leadership, scientific
and educational leadership, database and bioresource organization, and public education and outreach. For an
efficient and central operation of the overall Center, we have integrated these distinct components under the
leadership of Core A PI, who also serves as the Center Director. Accordingly, this Core has four major aims as
follows: In Aim 1, we will provide centralized administrative leadership for the entire Center grant. In Aim 2, we
will provide centralized scientific and educational leadership for the entire Center grant. Scientific leadership
includes assistance and guidance to the Center members on three overarching scientific questions for the
Center (questions on animal-human translation, olfactory epithelium (OE) pathology, and study design that can
be linked to future validation of the discoveries from the present proposal). This Core will also facilitate and
moderate scientific collaboration with investigators outside the Center. In addition, we will provide a
âmultidisciplinaryâ educational platform for young scholars in the Center, which includes the arrangement of
periodic group meetings and an annual retreat. Scientific rigor and integrity, as well as, an individual
development plan for each scholar will be emphasized. Furthermore, this Core will facilitate communications
with the institutional leadership and the advisory board members, and lead a preregistration of the proposed
study to the Center of Open Science. In Aim 3, we will organize bioresources and datasets, building a useful
database. The goal of this Aim is to store, organize, and keep track of datasets and resources collected in this
P50. Accordingly, we will provide the Center investigators with quick access to well-documented and
standardized databases. This central data management will improve the efficiency of the collaborations among
Projects and Cores and help to resolve confusion or conflicts. In addition, this also facilitates future data
sharing with peers and the public. Finally, in Aim 4, we will lead public education and outreach for our peers
and the general public. The overall Center will emphasize the significance of public education and outreach to
our peers and society. Accordingly, this Core will generate and maintain the web page of the P50 Conte
center, organize education and outreach plans, including the maintenance and expansion of the programs that
we have established during the past P50, such as the Schizophrenia Center Annual Symposium, Monthly
Seminar Series, Mind the Gap Workshop, and family meetings where the Center-associated physicians meet
with patients and their family members in a panel format. We believe that this Core will play a key role by
providing a central service in administrative leadership, scientific and educational leadership, database and
bioresource organization, and public education and outreach. This Core will lead research rigor and integrity. In
sum, this Core will aim to organize the Center and provide meaningful deliverables to our peers and society."
10862176,"Project 1 Abstract
Smell deficits have been reproducibly shown to be associated with negative symptoms and impaired social
cognitive processes in schizophrenia (SZ). Smell deficits are found from the early stage of SZ. Olfactory
epithelium (OE) pathology including molecular and cellular changes (e.g., immune/inflammatory changes in
association with redox imbalance) are directly associated with smell deficits, olfactory bulb (OB) volume
reduction, and negative symptoms in SZ. Nevertheless, it is not yet known how OE perturbation induces
pathological signatures of the OE and OB changes, which may lead to negative symptoms and impaired social
cognition. In the OE, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) can be continuously produced from stem cells such as
horizontal basal cells (HBCs) even in adulthood. OSNs transmit sensory information to the OB via direct
neuronal connections, which projects to the primary olfactory cortical regions. These brain regions directly
connect with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that regulate higher brain functions. Using a mouse model, we have
previously reported that OE inflammation affects cell cycle/fate control of HBCs, leading to OSN dysfunction.
Our preliminary data also show that OE inflammation leads to a volume reduction and layer structure changes
of the OB, reduced excitatory synaptic inputs to the OB and PFC principal neurons, and deficits in motivation
and social recognition. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that chronic local OE perturbation during
adolescence/young adulthood, a critical period for PFC maturation, induces pathological signatures of the OE,
which may be a contributory factor to impair olfactory-prefrontal circuits, leading to behavioral deficits in
positive valence systems and social processes. To address these hypotheses, we will leverage our mouse
models to produce local OE perturbation. Using the inducible OE inflammation model and inducible OSN
inactivation model, we will identify the impact of OE perturbation (i.e., OE inflammation and OSN inactivation)
on pathological signatures of the OE and OB changes (Aim 1). We will also identify the impact of OE
perturbation on behavioral outcomes (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine specific molecules that contribute to
the impact of OE pathological signatures on OB changes and behavioral phenotypes (Aim 3). Overall, this
project will identify molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the impact of chronic local OE perturbation
during adolescence/young adulthood on the olfactory-prefrontal circuits (focusing on the OB) and behavioral
domains in positive valence systems and social processes."
10862177,"Project 2 Abstract
Pathological changes of the olfactory epithelium (OE) and smell deficits are reproducibly reported in
schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Notably, smell deficits are tightly correlated with negative symptoms (e.g.,
avolition, anhedonia; due to impaired positive valence systems) and social cognitive deficits, but not with
positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion) in SZ. However, a conceptual framework for explaining the
impact of the olfactory system on higher brain functions (e.g., motivation, social process, and cognition)
remains lacking. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the OE project their axons to the olfactory bulb (OB),
which then transmits the information to several olfactory cortices, including the anterior olfactory nucleus/taenia
tecta (AON for simplicity) and the piriform cortex (Pir). These olfactory cortical regions subsequently project to
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may participate in in emergence of negative symptoms as well as in deficits
of social cognition in SZ and related disorders. Our preliminary results show that chronic local OE inflammation
leads to reduced excitatory synaptic inputs into PFC pyramidal neurons (PNs), we propose that the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits provide the causal link between OE perturbation and PFC functionality to impact higher brain
functions. Because adolescence/young adulthood is a critical period for PFC maturation, which depends on its
excitatory inputs, we will test the central hypothesis that chronic local OE perturbation during this period
leads to prolonged PFC dysfunction through the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. Specifically, we will pursue
three aims. First, we will determine the impact of OE perturbation on functional properties of PFC PNs in two
inducible OE perturbation mouse models [in collaboration with Project 1 (P1) and P3]. Using patch clamp
recordings, we will examine the effects of OE inflammation or OSN inactivation in two time windows covering
adolescence to adulthood on intrinsic electrophysiological properties and synaptic connections of PFC PNs
and aim to reverse the effects by chemogenetic activation of olfactory-prefrontal circuits. Second, we will
determine the impact of OE perturbation on PFC activity (both olfactory cortical PN terminals in PFC and PFC
PNs) via fiber photometry recording during specific mouse behaviors that assess motivation and social
recognition (in collaboration with Project 1). Third, in collaboration with Core B and Core C, we will determine
the impact of OE perturbation on functional connectivity of olfactory-prefrontal circuits in mice via in vivo
electrophysiology and compare functional connectivity between control mice and human healthy subjects (via
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging) to evaluate cross-species similarity. Overall, this project
will fill a significant knowledge gap by establishing olfactory-prefrontal circuits as a novel contributory link
between OE pathology and negative symptoms/social cognitive deficits in SZ that are currently treatment
refractory (complement P1 and P3)."
10851379,"SUMMARY
Allergic diseases represent a major public health burden characterized as an epidemic that involves the
interplay between genetic factors and environmental exposures. Allergens are one of the many multiple
triggers that produce IgE and cause inflammation of the airways, two crucial components of allergic disorders,
including atopic asthma. Spleen associated tyrosine kinase (aka tyrosine-protein kinase SYK) is critically
involved in the earliest steps of signaling reaction following aggregation of IgE/FceRI on the basophil/mast
cell surface after re-exposure to the same environmental substance (allergen). There is a considerable body
of evidence and a consistent set of observations, based on cellular functions and clinical associations,
highlighting the deeper relevance of SYK to the IgE-mediated reaction in humans. In addition, we have
demonstrated that basophil traits, such as SYK expression and IgE-mediated histamine release, can serve
as biomarkers for predicting the clinical efficacy of omalizumab in allergic diseases like asthma. However,
little is known about the genetic regulation of SYK, which is crucial in determining how IgE-dependent allergy
disorders manifest. We confirmed that the expression levels of SYK and histamine release in human basophils
were correlated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of the SYK gene. Exploration
of cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) discovered a genomic region encompassing the SYK
transcription start site (TSS), and it contained multiple variants with a high potential for transcriptional
regulation. We hypothesize that genetic factors interact with specific local cell/tissue environments to modify
either SYK expression or its function; therefore defining a unique molecular phenotype of human basophils,
which can serve as biomarkers for clinical efficacy of anti-IgE therapy as well as being potential drug targets
for novel therapeutics. This application's specific aims are to: (1) determine the genetic regulation of SYK
transcriptional activity and function; (2) identify common haplotypes that influence SYK expression and
function in individuals of European and African ancestry; and (3) compare transcriptome gene signatures
among IgE-bearing cell types. Results from these studies will provide strong motivation to explore the larger
impact of their influences on atopic disorders."
10853575,"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an epidemic. An estimated 34 million people in the US have T2DM and 84 million
have pre-diabetes - nearly half of whom are adults 65+ yo, putting many older adults at higher risk of unhealthy
aging and cognitive decline. A healthy lifestyle can treat and even reverse T2DM. But making lifestyle changes
is hard and many people fail, contributing to $327B in US healthcare costs. Diabetes group visits (DGV) and
diabetes self- management education and support (DSME/S) help people with T2DM to learn and sustain
complex disease management skills. Yet, access to DSME/S is limited such participation in DSME/S programs
is reportedly as low as 7% among adults with T2DM. New technologies supporting DSME/S programs are
emerging, but most fail to meet the unique needs of older adults with limited technology fluency, creating a new
digital divide. See Yourself Health (SYH) aims to bridge this digital health gap for older adults with a newly
designed immersive learning and telehealth application â the HOPE App â designed to deliver high-impact, high
engagement diabetes care and DSME/S tailored for older adults with diabetes.
Advancements in virtual reality software, new cloud gaming technology and user interface design have enabled
our team to envision a new telehealth and immersive learning environment to support chronic disease self-
management needs of older adults with diabetes. We use virtual reality, telecommunication technology and
social gaming strategies to offer real-time peer support, care coaching, and 28 modules of live-action experiential
learning programs to help participants master complex diabetes self-management skills. In our Phase I SBIR
project, we reached the following milestones: prototyped the HOPE App platform with cloud access and new
navigation and communication features; completed usability testing (SUS = 71) with 20 target users and
feasibility testing (100% participation) of the HOPE App platform; developed new DSME content for older adults.
In Phase II, we will further develop the HOPE App patient engagement and population health management
features and capabilities and then assess its efficacy in a fully powered clinical trial. Specific Aim 1: Develop the
HOPE Appâs state-of-the-art immersive patient engagement experience with automated onboarding, social
networking and gamified DSME/S features to support long-term patient retention. Specific Aim 2: Develop the
HOPE Appâs predictive analytic capabilities for population health management. Specific Aim 3: Clinical validation
of the HOPE App intervention on six-month clinical outcomes (A1c), patient reported outcomes (diabetes
distress) and engagement (patient retention, adherence to DSME/S). SYH has assembled an expert business
team to sell the HOPE APP to our target customer, health care payors. The HOPE APP offers a simple, high-
impact, highly engaging, immersive telehealth experience with the potential to become a ubiquitous diabetes
management tool to transform diabetes patients into high performing drivers of their own care."
10852961,"This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms, physiological functional significance, disease and
therapeutic relevance of a radically new neuron-like function of the understudied but chief renal cell type of the
macula densa (MD). MD cells are traditionally known as specialized renal epithelial cells capable of sensing the
local tissue environment and releasing various chemical messengers to control renal and glomerular
hemodynamics via tubuloglomerular feedback, and renin release as their classic functions. In addition, our work
in the last grant cycle identified their novel function in endogenous kidney tissue remodeling and repair. However,
interesting new insights suggest neuron-like function of these cells. Preliminary work using unbiased intravital
multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of MD versus all other renal cell calcium responses uncovered neuron-like rapid
and regularly oscillating spontaneous calcium transients (pacemaker activity), coordinated cell-to-cell
propagation within the MD via long (>50 Âµm), axon-like cell processes that were entirely specific to MD cells.
Numerous neurotransmitters and systemic neuroendocrine hormones given locally or iv triggered robust and
specific MD cell calcium responses and increased afferent renal nerve activity. MD cell gene profile and tissue
enrichment analysis identified brain tissue specificity of MD cells, and the expression of numerous neuronal
markers including nerve growth factor receptor p75NTR (NGFR, the highest expressed growth factor receptor
in MD cells), and some of the major Alzheimerâs disease risk genes. These studies painted a paradigm-shifting
new picture of MD cells functioning as interoceptive neuron-like cells that form autonomous, nephron-level
neuronal networks in the kidney, sense the local and systemic environment, process and send signals to renal
and central effectors in the brain to maintain homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that neuron-like MD cell
calcium and NGFR signaling play novel primary roles in physiological responses to control renal hemodynamics,
renin, and tissue remodeling (local interoception) and whole body homeostasis (systemic interoception). Further,
we hypothesize that alterations in the neuron-like functions of MD cells represent a novel, neurodegenerative
component in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can be therapeutically targeted. This project
will use comprehensive experimental approaches including new transgenic mice with chemo and optogenetic
tools, in vivo MPM imaging including innovative 3-photon excitation, MD transcriptome analysis, bioinformatics,
in vitro MD cell culturing and models of CKD. The specific aims are to examine the role of MD cell neuron-like
calcium and NGFR signaling in (1) physiological responses of the JGA, (2) in the development and progression
of kidney disease, and (3) their therapeutic potential in CKD. These novel MD cell-specific molecular and
signaling mechanisms may be targeted in the future development of new first-in-class MD cell stimulating
therapeutic approaches for CKD."

Scale-up of vector interventions, improved diagnosis, and effective treatment have collectively contributed to
significant global reductions in malaria mortality and morbidity over the last 15 years. Nevertheless, malaria
burden remains high in sub-Saharan Africa, which reported 215 million cases and 380,000 deaths in 2019.
Malaria burden reduction is not uniform, with some countries or regions continuously exhibiting high incidence
whereas others show drastic reductions. Consequently, many African countries have proposed sub-national
stratification of malaria risk and have developed corresponding surveillance and intervention plans to target
heterogeneous malaria burden. As the prevalence of clinical malaria cases decreases, transmission becomes
more focal and the proportion of malaria infections that are asymptomatic increases. Asymptomatic cases
typically go undetected and untreated. They constitute an obscure parasite reservoir, silently sustaining
transmission and threatening malaria control and elimination efforts. Functional and responsive malaria
surveillance systems are necessary for quantifying the true burden of disease, identifying residual transmission
foci for targeted control, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Enhanced surveillance methods and
more sensitive malaria diagnostic methods are needed to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in
low-transmission settings. The central objective of this F31 application is to examine the spatial and
genetic epidemiology of malaria parasites in low-transmission regions in Kenya in the context of rapidly
declining transmission following the implementation of intensive control programs. I will examine the
effectiveness of hospital-based clinical malaria cases and reactive case detection methods in transmission
hotspot detection (Aim 1), and investigate the genetic connectivity and diversity of malaria infections within and
among clusters of malaria cases using amplicon deep sequencing and microsatellite typing (Aim 2). Identification
of transmission hotspots will inform malaria intervention strategies best suited to local epidemiological contexts.
Patterns of genetic connectivity among parasite isolates will reveal the geographical spread and transmission
network of malaria infections. These data will improve our understanding of malaria epidemiology in settings
where transmission is rapidly declining, thus guiding decision-makers in tailoring optimal strategies to achieve
local malaria control and elimination goals. This proposed research will have broad implications for malaria
surveillance in other areas of Africa that are experiencing significant reductions in malaria transmission. Under
the mentorship of a multidisciplinary team, I will gain skills in infectious disease epidemiology, spatial
epidemiology, molecular population genetics, and bioinformatics while developing leadership and professional
skills that are necessary to prepare me for a career as an independent global health researcher and infectious
disease epidemiologist."
10832100,"The long-term objective of this project is to merge molecular tool development with functional
studies of kinases that are of biological interest. To date, weâve developed new chemical tools for
modulating kinase regulatory interactions, global conformational state, and interactomes, which
weâve used to understand how differentially modulating these parameters affects the intracellular
functions of protein kinases. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that new and
unexpected mechanistic discoveries can be made on even the most well characterized kinases
through the application of new molecular analysis tools. We found that the phosphotransferase
activity of the tyrosine kinase Src is regulated by its N-terminal SH4 domain, which was previously
believed to only serve as a membrane tether. In this proposal, we will leverage many of the same
methodologies what we used to stusy Src in order obtain a detailed molecular understanding of
Lck, which is a Src-Family Kinase (SFK) that plays a specialized role in T cell receptor (TCR)
signaling. SFKs that contain identical domain architectures as Lck cannot replicate Lckâs role in
TCR signaling and our preliminary results suggest that Lckâs regulatory module is unique. Our
goal is to comprehensively profile the regulatory properties of Lck and to determine what makes
it unique amongst the SFKs. In three Aims, spanning enzymology, biochemistry, cell biology, and
chemoproteomics, we propose to study the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of Lck and the
functional consequences of manipulating its regulatory apparatus during TCR signaling. In
addition, we describe a new technology for profiling the regulatory and conformational states of
kinases during TCR signaling."
10833092,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Our long-term goal is to understand how the structure and function of dendrites in the frontal cortex are
affected by stress and antidepressants. Considerable evidence indicates that the action of fast-acting
antidepressants such as ketamine relies on synaptic plasticity in the frontal cortex. An essential ingredient for
plasticity is calcium influx in dendritic spines. However, to date, empirical data detailing how antidepressants
may modulate calcium levels in dendritic spines in vivo are lacking. In preliminary studies, we used subcellular-
resolution two-photon microscopy to visualize localized calcium transients in dendritic spines in the medial
frontal cortex of the mouse in vivo. We found that the administration of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine
leads to an acute elevation of calcium signals in apical dendritic spines, due to a suppression of dendritic
inhibition. On the basis of the preliminary results and prior research, we hypothesize that the enhanced
synaptic calcium signal is a necessary step towards ketamineâs antidepressant action. In this project, we will
determine the interactive effects of stress and ketamine on synaptic calcium signals (Aim 1). We will track
morphology and calcium signals in the same dendritic spines to ask if the calcium elevations precede structural
remodeling (Aim 2). We will determine if spines receiving inputs from specific long-range afferent regions are
selectively targeted (Aim 3). Together, the results are expected to provide insights into the biological basis of
ketamineâs action. As calcium is an essential checkpoint for synaptic plasticity in the frontal cortex, delineating
its role in antidepressant action will accelerate the evaluation of candidate compounds and the development of
more targeted treatments."
10833713,"How cells become specified and differentiate at the correct time and place is a fundamental question in
developmental biology. Cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs) are an excellent model system to understand this
process due to the multipotent nature of the progenitor cells, generally unrestricted developmental potential
with known lineage and derivatives, and defined gene regulatory networks. In addition to the gene networks,
epigenetic regulators can affect the expression of numerous target genes and may help to explain the
differences in penetrance and phenotype between individuals with the same genotype. This is important since
defects in neural crest development underlie many human congenital birth defects, such as cleft lip with or
without palate and many craniofacial syndromes. Thus, understanding the genetic and epigenetic regulators in
cNCC development is key to understanding how cell fate is determined. We hypothesize that PRDM
paralogs regulate global gene expression by regulating downstream targets oppositely, including Wnt
pathway components, to control the timing of cartilage/bone differentiation within the cNCC lineage.
The rationale for the proposed studies is that an in depth understanding of normal cNCC development will
provide insights into normal biology and the etiology of neural crest-associated birth defects, many of which are
thought to arise from cNCC abnormalities. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Test
the hypothesis that PRDM proteins act upstream of Wnt signaling to control the timing of cNCC
differentiation into chondrocytes. We will test the hypothesis PROM paralog activity is required in cNCCs
cell autonomously upstream of Wnt signaling to promote differentiation of chondrocytes. 2) Test the
hypothesis that Prdm3 and Prdm16 genetically interact to regulate cNCC gene expression and
chromatin accessibility. In Aim 2, hypothesis that Prdm3 and Prdm16 genetically interact to control gene
expression via regulating transcription and chromatin modification specifically at cNCC and Wnt gene targets.
3) Test the hypothesis that Prdm3 regulates global gene expression by controlling the timing of
genomic accessibility of Prdm16. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that loss of Prdm3 leads to global
alterations in chromatin state at cNCC progenitor genes via changes in binding of Prdm16 throughout the
genome, which controls the liming of cNCC differentiation into chondrocytes. Together, these studies will
reveal basic information of how cNCCs differentiate into specific cell types during development. The results of
this proposal have the potential to reveal important new insights into cNCC development and how these
processes go wrong in disease, with the hope of providing a foundation for the design of therapeutic strategies
for neural crest associated birth defects."
10771212,"The goal of the CCII COBRE is to establish a thematic multidisciplinary research center of excellence at the 
University of Louisville that focuses on improving our understanding of cancer immunology and developing 
novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Importantly, with the recent clinical successes of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and oncolytic viruses, there is great interest and momentum in understanding the interaction between 
the host immune system and neoplastic cells. Our projects proposing basic immunology research coupled with 
translational and human specimen studies are expected to ultimately lead to entirely new immunotherapeutic 
approaches, as well as strategies for overcoming resistance to existing agents. The Administrative Core (AC) 
will coordinate the professional activities of the more than 40 individuals who will constitute the new Center for 
Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CCII). The AC will provide administrative, fiscal, and scientific 
oversight and planning for junior investigators, mentors, projects, the research core, a pilot program, and 
advisory committees. In addition to governance functions, the AC will provide key research and mentoring 
support. This will include the awarding of project grants, assignment of mentors, provision of a grant writing 
mentorship program, biostatistics and bioinformatics support, compliance and regulatory oversight, mentoring 
of pilot projects, and encouragement of diversity and inclusion. Internal advisors and an External Advisory 
Committee (EAC) that consists of five leading scientists in the CCII thematic area will guide the AC. The EAC 
will provide scientific guidance and constructive feedback regarding center/project progress and be involved in 
CCII strategic planning and in the selection of replacement and pilot projects. The two PIs of the overall CCII 
program will direct the AC with key support from two co-Is who have extensive experience administering multi- 
component grant programs and from two additional co-Is who are well qualified to oversee the essential 
biostatistics and bioinformatics support. Their efforts will supplement a mentoring program that is anchored by 
eight senior investigators who are experienced mentors and have been highly productive and well funded in 
the thematic area. The three specific aims of this Administrative Core that encompass all of these functions are 
to: (1) Establish procedures for CCII administration, planning, and decision-making; (2) Provide a mentorship 
program to accelerate the careers of the CCII junior investigators; and (3) Create a CCII pilot grant program 
that will stimulate new projects and collaborations. Innovative features of the AC are built on lessons learned 
from establishing other multidisciplinary thematic centers and include a shared governance approach that aims 
to ensure engagement of all participants and a holistic mentoring strategy that provides comprehensive 
guidance for our CCII junior investigators. By the end of the 5-year funding program, we expect that 4-6 CCII 
junior investigators will have been awarded R01 grants and that many of these graduates will remain key 
members of this new COBRE focused on cancer immunology and immunotherapy."
10849765,"The cannabis sociopolitical landscape has dramatically shifted in recent years leading to the decriminalization,
medicalization, and legalization of cannabis use, which has contributed to the reduced risk perception of its harm.
This transformational time, however, has health implications particularly for vulnerable populations related to
neurodevelopment since cannabis is commonly used by pregnant women and women of childbearing age.
Accumulating evidence from our long-standing research has clearly demonstrated that prenatal exposure to D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, has long-term effects on behaviors
â relevant to reward, motivation, negative affect and decision-making, and molecular disturbances linked to
synaptic plasticity with profound epigenetic dysregulation that are exacerbated by stress. We have also identified
specific epigenetic modifications linked to synaptic plasticity and behaviors associated with the protracted effects
of developmental THC exposure. Recent results have highlighted the immune system as relevant to
developmental cannabis/THC since preliminary gene expression analysis of the placenta from women who used
cannabis during pregnancy revealed marked reorganization of the immune transcriptome that correlated with
later childhood behavior. Immune-related genes were also altered in mesocorticolimbic structures of adult rats
with developmental THC exposure, which enhances the correlation between immune- and synaptic-related
genes. To gain neurobiological and mechanistic insights, we will conduct integrative and translational studies
(human and rat models) to: (1) Determine the impact of prenatal cannabis/THC exposure on immune-related
disturbances (placenta and brain); (2) Delineate molecular networks within distinct mesocorticolimbic cell
populations through high resolution single-cell strategies altered by developmental cannabis/THC exposure
relevant to immune function; and (3) Identify early biological disturbances (sustained into adulthood) predictive
of long-term effects on brain and causally mediate behavior due to prenatal cannabis/THC exposure. The
translational knowledge gained and the human and rodent databases generated from this project will significantly
advance our understanding of psychopathology risk that often has its genesis during development."
10849767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Higher levels of physical activity have been found to improve health and to reduce cognitive decline as
adults become older, but more than half of all adults in the United States do not meet their activity goals.
Regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits and one type of physical activity that is
broadly applicable to people of all ages is walking. Programs to increase walking are both broadly feasible and
safe, and do not require unique training or specialized equipment. Walking is also measurable, with clearly
identifiable individual targets that are associated with health improvements.
 This study will use a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation design to adapt, and test the
effectiveness of, two successful social incentive-based interventions to increase physical activity. Social
incentive-based interventions can harness and enhance an individual's social network to increase physical
activity, and can be more sustainable and scalable than financial incentives. The two interventions are a
gamification strategy and financial incentives donated to charity on the participant's behalf. Following an initial
phase of community-participatory adaptation of the two proven social-incentive intervention strategies, a
three-arm, cluster-randomized trial of 225 families will be conducted to evaluate the two social incentive
interventions in the community. The study aims include:
 1. To adapt our prior work to improve the implementation of interventions in the community among
 families that include at least one older adult.
 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of two social-incentive interventions among families to increase physical
 activity relative to control families.
 3. To conduct a robust process evaluation that will provide information on the implementation process.
 4. To assess the cost of each of the interventions from a societal perspective and compare cost
 differences between each intervention and control relative to the effectiveness measured by
 incremental increases in physical activity.
 5. To use findings from the effectiveness trial, process evaluation and cost analysis (Aims 2, 3 and 4) to
 scale-up and disseminate tools and products for use by community organizations locally and nationally.
 This study focuses on scalable approaches to address health disparities in physical activity by partnering
with community organizations in low-income and minority neighborhoods, using behavioral economics to
deploy low-cost social incentive interventions, and applying implementation science frameworks from the
Consolidated Framework for Intervention Research (CFIR) to improve adoption and dissemination. An
effectiveness-implementation study design will maximize contributions to science, public health practice, and
reduction of health disparities."
10847913,"This proposal is a renewal of a successful T32 training program entitled âVanderbilt Interdisciplinary Training
Program in Alzheimerâs Disease.â This training program provides robust interdisciplinary, translational research
training for biomedical PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias.
The program capitalizes on the rich institutional resources of Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt University
Medical Center, and Meharry Medical College and the interdisciplinary research strengths of our training
faculty. Established in 2018, this T32 program aims to position the next generation of basic, translational, and
clinical scientists to advance towards independence while making major contributions to the understanding of
Alzheimerâs disease and its intersection with neurodegeneration and concomitant pathologies that contribute to
clinical manifestation and decline (e.g., cerebral small vessel disease). During the initial award cycle, we
established our training curriculum, built awareness of our program across campus (resulting in a steady
growth of competitive nominations), and appointed 20 total trainees (9 PhD students, 11 post-doctoral fellows).
Trainee outcomes are strong with all program graduates retained in aging or neuroscience research-related
careers and 7 trainees receiving independent funding. Concurrent with the launch of this T32 training program,
we also launched our new National Institute on Aging-funded Vanderbilt Alzheimerâs Disease Research
Center. This new Center grant has resulted in extensive expansion of our Alzheimerâs disease and related
dementias research activities and increased the richness of our institutional infrastructure, data resources,
intellectual neighborhood, and training opportunities. Finally, we have established a new and innovative
diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice curriculum that will be integrated through all aspects of this T32 training
program in the upcoming cycle. This curriculum fosters the development of cultural competence, consideration
of relevant biological and intersectional variables, recruitment and selection bias, and transparency in reporting
to promote more equitable research. Through individualized mentorship from faculty and peer networks, an
integrated curriculum, and involvement in cutting-edge research, our program will continue to emphasize basic
science and clinical fundamentals of Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias. Trainees will continue to
develop essential research and professional skills for building a successful career along with a deep
appreciation for rigor, reproducibility, and responsible conduct of research. Participation in a high-quality
interdisciplinary research experience will synthesize the traineesâ knowledge base, research and professional
skill set, and appreciation of research ethics. Each traineeâs individualized training plan will be augmented by
additional institutional and programmatic resources to foster academic excellence and scientific innovation
during these early, formative periods of professional development."
10847161,"Project Summary and Abstract
The processes underlying human health and disease are highly complex. This necessitates the
creation, organization, and dissemination of vast amounts of relevant scientific data. Organizing this
information into databases and user-friendly web sites and tools is therefore an integral component of
ongoing efforts to understand and ultimately improve human health.
Many human diseases are now appreciated to result from genetic and environmental perturbations to
gene regulatory mechanisms. As direct readers of genomic regulatory sequences, transcription factors
(TFs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are primary components of gene regulatory mechanisms.
Accordingly, the nucleic acid binding specificities of TFs and RBPs (henceforth, âspecificitiesâ) provide
foundational knowledge for understanding the processes underlying human health and disease states.
Comprehensive mapping of TF and RBP specificities is thus regarded as a major goal in the fields of
human genetics, functional genomics, and bioinformatics. We aim to ultimately achieve this goal and
disseminate the resulting data freely to the research community. To this end, we created the CisBP
and CisBP-RNA TF and RBP specificity databases over 10 years ago. Since then, we have improved
upon these resources through periodic updates incorporating new experimental data generated in our
labs and others. Since their creation, these unique resources have been heavily utilized by the research
community, with over 60,000 unique users and over 2,800 citations to date.
Our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve CisBP and CisBP-RNA have enabled the comprehensive
study of gene regulation in healthy and disease states in humans and other organisms relevant to
human health. In this proposal, we seek to build upon these powerful resources by improving the
database contents and underlying computational infrastructure (Aim 1), incorporating newly generated
specificity data for TFs and RBPs from human viruses and other important human pathogens (Aim 2),
and enhancing the user experience through improved web sites, web tools, and community outreach
efforts (Aim 3). Implementation of these improvements will directly lead to increased database update
frequencies, improved user experiences, a large and more knowledgeable user community, and new
data for studying the role of gene regulation in human healthy and disease states."
10857314,"Abstract: The RAS-regulated RAFï®MEKï®ERK MAP kinase pathway is a central pathway for pancreatic
cancer initiation as 95% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas express mutationally activated KRAS. To date, however,
targeting downstream components of KRAS signaling in clinical trials have not shown efficacy. Autophagy has
also been shown to be important for pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, however, clinical trials have been
disappointing with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (4-aminoquinolones) treatment in conjunction with standard
chemotherapy. We have recently demonstrated that combined inhibition of both MEK 1/2 and autophagy results
in in vitro cytotoxicity and dramatic in vivo tumor regression in a recent publication in Nature Medicine, which
was extended to a single pancreatic cancer patient with no therapeutic options left who demonstrated a dramatic
tumor burden reduction of ~50% after 4 months of therapy of combined trametinib and hydroxychloroquine. Two
Phase I/II clinical trials have resulted from the work and are either accruing or soon to open. The long-term goals
of my research as a physician-scientist is to contribute a deeper mechanistic understating of KRAS signaling in
pancreatic cancer and design successful clinical strategies to improve outcomes for one of the most treatment
resistant human malignancies. The short-term goals of this K08 application are to understand the resistance
mechanisms to trametinib and hydroxychloroquine to determine predictive biomarkers and how to overcome
resistance. My immediate career goals over the next 5 years include updating and broadening my knowledge of
cancer biology, becoming proficient in grant writing, accomplishing the AIMS outlined in this proposal, publishing
the results, assisting in designing and executing clinical trials resulting from the work, securing grants, continued
expansion of laboratory personnel, generating R01 applications, and establishing excellence in my clinical
practice. My long term career goals include building an enterprise of investigations into the discovery of
therapeutic targets for treating gastrointestinal malignancies, furthering the field of understanding of the role for
autophagy in malignancy, and training the next generation of physicians and scientists. My mentors include
Martin McMahon, PhD, G. Weldon Gilcrease III, MD and Ignacio Garrido-Laguna, MD, PhD. Dr. McMahon
provides me with laboratory space and expertise in RAFï®MEKï®ERK MAP kinase signaling, pre-clinical
modeling and pancreatic cancer cell biology. Dr. Gilcrease is a GI Oncologist provides guidance with clinical
responsibilities. Dr. Garrido-Laguna is a GI Oncologist with expertise in pancreatic cancer and clinical trials, who
will advise in designing and executing anticipated clinical trials that will result from this body of work. In addition
to these excellent mentors in basic science and clinical pursuits I will also have the support of the Preclinical
Research Resource Core and collaboration with Courtney Scaife, MD and Jill Shea, PhD who will assist with
preclinical model PDX establishment and testing. In summary I will have an excellent environment to further my
career with guidance and support for basic science, translational science, and clinical investigation."
10857316,"The Role of Fathering in the Language Development
Among Young, Low-Income African American and Latino Children
Abstract
 Recent studies of low-income children have revealed significant variations in the
quality of parent-child communication as well as the quantity of parent input that are
important for successful child language development. Shared aspects of early parent-
child communication including joint engagement with symbols and the interactionâs flow
predict language outcome above measures of parent verbal input (15) or the childâs joint
attention skills. The importance of early joint engagement for language development is
demonstrated in diverse race-ethnic groups.
 However, the majority of this research has focused on mothers. More research on
ethnic minority fathers is critical to document the heterogeneity in as well as the unique
cultural ecology of the early language environments of low-income, ethnic minority
children as well as to foster innovation in the development of preventive interventions to
support language development and early academic success. We propose to leverage a
longitudinal study of low-income African American and Latino children that includes
video recordings of 216 2-3 year old children interacting with their fathers and their
mothers. By leveraging an existing archive of videos, we extend the original NICHD
investment as well as lower costs enormously relative to the cost of launching a new
longitudinal study. Our aims are as follows:
 Aim 1: To describe father-child interactions in low-income African American and
Latino families encompassing both broad characteristics as well as culturally distinct
patterns of father language input and quality of joint engagement.
 Aim 2: To compare language input and the quality of joint engagement among
African American and Latino low-income children in early father-child and mother-child
interactions.
 Aim 3: To examine the relation between early language input, joint engagement,
and culturally distinct patterns of father-child interaction with language development and
literacy achievement in early elementary school among African American and Latino
low-income children.
Aim 4: To explore whether father-child interactions, father-child language, and/or the
relation of these with child language development and early literacy achievement differ
by child gender."
10857319,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Every year Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a
societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a
diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the
burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early
detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for
the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051).
Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our
interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are
proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages
Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low-
cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously
developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia
Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to
identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct
two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early
detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the
Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient
reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS).
The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two
screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the
incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital
Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare
system with Epic nationwide.
The high costs of treating Alzheimerâs disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible
and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost
instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and
better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive
models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care."
10857194,"We are studying how osteoblast death due to glucocorticoids (GCs) is counteracted by vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Developing osteoblasts express the ACTH receptor, and osteoblasts
express VEGF in response to the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Continuous steroid treatment reduces
ACTH production to low levels. In rabbits with high-dose GC, we showed that intermittent ACTH at minimum
doses to elevate ACTH for four hours greatly reduced osteonecrosis. Our recent studies show that osteoblast
growth and differentiation is increased by VEGF. Further, ACTH is one of several factors that regulate VEGF
production in bone. Thus, in bone, as in the adrenal, the actions of ACTH are complex, and systematic work
will be needed to determine how ACTH, VEGF, and other regulatory pathways interact in bone.
 Our hypothesis is that ACTH is a major regulator of bone growth and survival in regions with rapid bone
turnover such as femoral head trabecular bone. The work planned will find quantitative ACTH doses,
currently unknown, that increase bone mass. Work planned we will use a rabbit animal model, and human
cells to assure relevancy to human disease. Our work using mice encountered difficulties in modeling human
bone response; at present the best animal model for osteonecrosis is the rabbit.
 Gaps in understanding include downstream actions of ACTH in bone cells. Interactions of ACTH with
other systems that regulate VEGF, mediated by inflammatory cells, hypoxia, and by additional cytokines. It is
not known how response of bone in vivo varies with the dose or interval of ACTH administration.
 Specific Aim 1 will use methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)-treated rabbits to define the dependency of
osteonecrosis on VEGF synthesis, ACTH concentration, and dose interval. Specifically, we will define
concentration dependency of ACTH effects. We will study effects on VEGF production of varying ACTH
injection, relative to depot MPA alone or in untreated rabbits. ACTH will be injected daily, at 8 AM, at 0.01,
0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 Âµg/kg, for 28 days. Osteonecrosis, bone turnover, serum ACTH and corticosteroids will be
measured. This will establish the relationship of specific ACTH doses to suppression of osteonecrosis.
Additionally, to define effect of frequency of ACTH administration on efficacy, we will compare the effects of
ACTH at 0.05 or 0.15 Âµg/kg twice daily versus 0.1 or 0.3 Âµg/kg once daily.
 Specific Aim 2 will study the mechanism of response of human osteoblasts to ACTH and VEGF in vitro.
To determine whether ACTH provides survival signals in addition to VEGF, we will study the response of
osteoblasts to VEGF, with and without ACTH. Cell proliferation and matrix synthesis will be measured, as well
as production of regulatory cytokines by osteoblasts under normal and hypoxic conditions. Further to define the
VEGF response, we will make osteoblasts with VEGF receptors -1 and -2 (flt-1 and flk-1) eliminated. This will
allow ACTH effects to be defined in the absence of autocrine VEGF response.
 Specific Aim 3 will determine how ACTH modulates VEGF production in glucocorticoid-treated human
cells. This will include evaluating the extent to which immune cells regulate production of VEGF by osteoblasts.
To do this, we will make mixed cultures including macrophages or T-lymphocytes. We will characterize VEGF
production in these cultures, and determine whether VEGF regulation involves specific cytokines, and its
sensitivity to glucocorticoids. In addition, we will determine whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone in
meaningful amounts. Specifically, we will analyze pro-opiomelanocorticoid (POMC) expression and processing
in bone cells including osteoblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages.
 This work will define a new metabolic regulatory pathway in bone, using innovative methods. It will shed
new light on mechanisms that contribute to osteonecrosis, which is a serious and common problem."

10861069,"Abstract
The goal of this proposal is to investigate mechanisms for pyroptosis-dependent and novel pyroptosis-
independent export of proinflammatory cytokines mediated by caspases, secretory autophagy proteins, and
gasdermin D (GSDMD), a recently identified effector molecule for pyroptosis. The inflammasomes are crucial
innate immune signaling platforms implicated in immune defense against infections and autoimmune/
autoinflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimerâs disease.
Activation of the inflammasome signaling pathways leads to the maturation and secretion of cytokines such as
IL-1Î² and IL-18, and an inflammatory form of programmed cell death in certain cell types called pyroptosis.
GSDMD assembles membrane pores upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases-1, 4, 5 and 11 and caspase-8.
In macrophages, such pores allow the release of mature cytokines upon cytolysis. Intriguingly, pyroptosis- and
membrane pore-independent function of GSDMD during secretion of IL-1Î² upon inflammasome activation has
been demonstrated for neutrophils, epithelial cells and T cells (Projects 1, 2, and 4), in which GSDMD is recruited
by secretory autophagy proteins to facilitate a novel non-lytic form of cytokine release. Specific recognition of
GSDMD by caspases or autophagy proteins thus underlie GSDMD function in lytic or non-lytic cytokine release.
We hypothesize that inflammatory caspases recognize GSDMD through distinct protein-protein interfaces during
lytic cytokine release. By contrast, GSDMD is recruited by autophagy machinery to facilitate novel non-lytic
cytokine secretion independent of membrane pore formation. We will focus on the following specific aims in a
collaborative Program Project to test the above hypothesis. Aim 1. Define the mechanisms of protease-
dependent activation of GSDMD in lytic release of cytokines. We propose to elucidate the mechanisms of
GSDMD recognition by caspases and serine proteases in collaboration with Projects 1, 2 and 4. Discovery from
our proposal may facilitate investigation into specific caspase inhibitors based on distinct enzyme-substrate
interfaces, which may target pyroptosis, apoptosis and other inflammatory signaling pathways involving
caspases. Aim 2. Define the mechanisms of GSDMD-guided non-lytic secretion of cytokines. We propose to
characterize the recruitment of IL-1Î² and GSDMD by chaperones and autophagy proteins. The roles of these
interaction in non-lytic cytokine release will be probed in collaboration with Projects 2 and 4. The success of this
project will reveal the molecular mechanisms for the lytic or non-lytic secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
mediated by GSDMD. This proposal draws on the strength of the other three Projects to facilitate and validate
our structural studies. Structural insights from our studies will in turn inform experimental design and data
interpretation for the other Projects. As such, outcomes from the four Projects benefit each other as an
interdependent and integrated Program."
10853372,"Project Summary
 Clinical decisions based on hemodynamic data âtime-varying measurements of pressure and volume in
the cardiovascular (CV) systemâ can be some of the most complex physicians will face. Yet they are consigned
to tackle these decisions with little more than a mental model of the patient. From deceptively simple questions
like whether a patient will respond to fluid resuscitation, to plainly challenging ones like whether the right ventricle
will tolerate placement of a left ventricular assist device, the physician must mentally reconstruct a patientâs
physiology from the shadows it casts in the form of clinical state measurements. Right ventricular (RV)
dysfunction, in particular, represents a large class of problems in cardiology whose management is widely seen
as challenging. This stems from inadequate RV monitoring tools and the challenge of gauging the RVâs
interactions with other cardiovascular subsystems. Given detailed hemodynamic measurements a physician
should be able to tap computational resources that would systematically infer a quantitative cardiovascular (CV)
model that gave rise to it, thereby characterizing the RV and its interactions. Computational models such as
these, which could be repeatedly updated as new sensor data stream in, are known as digital twins.
 Here we propose to develop and validate a digital âhemodynamicâ twin to aid the management of right
ventricular failure. Such a computational tool would allow the physician to explore a patientâs right ventricular
physiology in silico and to predict the effects and the limits of drug therapy. Specifically, we aim to solve the
inverse problem of system identification (SID) on real-world clinical data, both extending the computational tools
for hemodynamic SID and validating them on a large number of patients. We will focus on patients who are
susceptible to RV dysfunction, including outpatients with pulmonary hypertension and inpatients recovering from
cardiac surgery in an intensive care unit. The creation of a digital twin will require only data that are collected
using routine hemodynamic monitoring techniques that are widely available. We will test the fidelity of our SID
tools, use the digital twins to search for new subtypes of pulmonary hypertension and post-cardiac surgery
recovery, and determine the ability of newly identified cardiovascular parameters to predict patient outcomes."
10841581,"ABSTRACT
In this proposal we apply somatic cell gene editing strategies to enhance pancreatic beta cell replacement
therapies for type 1 diabetes (T1D). We have formed a team that combines expertise in beta cell biology,
synthetic and systems biology, and islet transplant immunology to address key impediments for efficient
immunosuppression-free transplantation of pancreatic islets. We propose two orthogonal yet complementary
aims to address two critical challenges in islet transplantation - islet survival and immune rejection. Most of the
transplanted islets die before revascularization can occur, which limits the efficacy of the therapy. We have
shown hypoxia and nutrient deprivation during ischemia independently and synergistically kill transplanted islet
cells. Aim 1 of this proposal addresses the hypothesis that peri-transplant death can be alleviated by deleting
negative regulators of beta cell survival or by over-expression of positive regulators. We will take both targeted
and unbiased approaches to test candidate regulators and to identify novel regulators of human islet survival.
Our team has already performed high-throughput screens using RNAi in primary human islets using in vivo
transplant survival as a readout. We are ready to apply our expertise to CRISPRi and cDNA screens of primary
human islets. Previous clinical islet transplant experiences show that stronger immunosuppression is associated
with higher rate of insulin independence after islet transplantation. The immune system deploys multiple
redundant mechanisms to eliminate transplanted foreign tissue. This, combined with the fragility of the
transplanted islets and heightened immune functions in T1D recipients, forms a formidable immunological barrier
to beta cell replacement therapy. We hypothesize that multipronged approach of minimizing islet cell
immunogenicity, neutralizing inflammation in the graft, and blocking cellular infiltrate will shield the islets from
immune rejection without the need for systemic immunosuppression. In Aim2, we will test this hypothesis by
gene edit human islets to ablate the expression of polymorphic human leukocyte antigens. We will test dominant
strategies that block innate inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1 and type 1 and type 2 interferons. We will also
target adaptive immune cells by blocking their trafficking, activation and effector function. Successful
confirmation of our hypotheses will provide proof-of-principle data to support efforts of clinical translation as next
steps. We envision that these strategies may be applied to primary human islets, stem cell-derived beta cells,
and even xenogeneic islets. While these CRISPR modalities are powerful research tools for screens and proof-
of-concept experiments in the laboratory, base editing and/or prime editing may be preferred embodiments in
the clinical setting. Our end goal is to generate game-changing strategies to address these key impediments,
with a vision towards clinical translation."

A Career Development Award in Global Postpartum Health
This application is for a Fogarty International Center K01 International Research Scientist Development Award
(IRSDA) for Dr. Bridget Spelke, MD, an obstetrician-gynecologist and research fellow in Global Women's Health
at the University of North Carolina (UNC). Dr. Spelke is in the formative stages of her research career and aims
to establish herself as an independent investigator and future leader in the area of global postpartum health, a
high-risk period that has been neglected for too long. She has lived full-time in Lusaka, Zambia since August
2019 where she has established a solid career foundation for clinical research in obstetric outcomes for women
in resource-constrained settings. Dr. Spelke's proposed K01 research will leverage a recent expansion of the
Zambian Preterm Birth Prevention Study (ZAPPS), a long-standing pregnancy cohort that is following women
and their infants through 12 months postpartum. Dr. Spelke will study a novel strategy to identify women at risk
for severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the first week after delivery: continuous remote physiologic
monitoring with easy-to-use, multiparameter, wearable sensors. To inform the design of a future hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial, Dr. Spelke proposes a mentored research program that will estimate the
frequency of severe maternal morbidity in the ZAPPS cohort (Aim 1); implement a pilot randomized feasibility
trial of postpartum physiologic monitoring (Aim 2); and evaluate barriers and facilitators to adoption of a digital
health intervention in a resource-constrained setting through implementation research frameworks (Aim 3).
These three research aims will provide preliminary data toward the design of a future trial. They are interrelated
and independent of each other; study results will advance research on digital and postpartum health in resource-
constrained settings regardless of outcomes. Each of these studies aligns with individualized career
development goals in clinical trials design and analysis, implementation research for digital health technologies,
and collaborative global health research partnerships. Dr. Spelke has assembled a highly accomplished and
eminently qualified mentorship team comprising: her primary Zambia mentor, Prof. Bellington Vwalika, an expert
in clinical trials implementation in sub-Saharan Africa; her primary US mentor, Prof. Elizabeth Stringer, an expert
in maternal-fetal medicine and maternal health epidemiology; and her core mentor, Prof. Ben Chi, an expert in
implementation science in sub-Saharan Africa. All three mentors have decades of experience in collaborative
global health partnerships and extensive experience mentoring early career researchers. The IRSDA will
advance Dr. Spelke's skills in each of these fields, supporting both didactic and practice-based learning
opportunities, as she establishes her independent area of investigation and progresses towards research
independence in global postpartum health."
10841584,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intellectual disabilities (ID) are lifelong conditions caused by neurodevelopmental errors. We recently identified
gain and loss of function (GOF and LOF) mutations in the chromatin modifier Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 1
(EZH1) as the cause a previously undiagnosed intellectual disability syndrome in ten children. EZH1 is one of
the two Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferases of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The
other one, EZH2, has long been considered the main responsible for H3K27 di and trimethylation (H3K27me2/3)
and PRC2 mediated transcriptional repression, in part owing to a weaker catalytic activity of EZH1. EZH2 is
highly expressed in dividing cells, and its dysfunction leads to defects in neural progenitor proliferation and fate
specification, and neurodevelopmental disease. Despite evidence indicating that EZH1 is also expressed in the
developing and adult nervous system, its relevance and function in neural development and homeostasis remain
unknown. In preliminary work, we found that EZH1 is expressed constantly across human cerebral cortex
development and becomes the predominant paralogue by the late neurogenesis period owing to a rapid decline
of EZH2 expression. Using human embryonic stem cells (hESC) carrying EZH1 LOF and GOF mutations, and
their differentiation to cortical neurons in monolayer and organoid cultures, we found signs of delayed neuronal
differentiation in EZH1 LOF and premature differentiation in EZH1 GOF. However, amounts of H3K27me3
measured by WB, showed similar levels across all the mutant and control cell lines. Thus, we hypothesize that
EZH1 regulates cortical neurogenesis timing through a non EZH2 redundant mechanism that becomes dominant
as neurogenesis progresses and EZH2 expression declines. To test this hypothesis in Aim 1 we will determine
differentiation stage specific molecular functions of EZH1 during neurogenesis by defining the genomic
binding profile of EZH1 (SubAim1.1), its effects on H3K27 methylation and transcriptional regulation
(SubAim1.2), and the composition of PRC2-EZH1 subcomplexes (SubAim1.3) over time during neuronal
differentiation. In Aim 2 we will dissect the effect of EZH1 mutations in cortical neurogenesis timing and
the ability of EZH1/2 inhibitors to them we will dissect the origin and consequences of EZH1 mutation driven
dysregulated neurogenesis timing by extending our organoid analysis to 30, 40, 60 and 100 days (SubAim2.1),
by unbiased quantification of the composition and cell type specific differential gene expression using scRNAseq
of the organoids (SubAim2.2), and assessing the potential of EZH1/2 inhibitors on restoring the cellular and
molecular alterations caused by EZH1LOF and GOF mutations (SubAim2.3). These studies will uncover a
currently disregarded role of EZH1 in the regulation of cortical neurogenesis and neurodevelopmental diseases
and may provide new therapeutic targets for IDs."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of Americans, yet
therapeutic options to prevent, slow, or cure AD and related dementias (ADRD) remain limited. The
multifactorial nature of AD/ADRD along with a heterogeneous presentation across individuals, necessitates
multiple therapeutic approaches. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has established a series of research
programs to diversify the therapeutic pipeline, including the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Alzheimer's
Disease Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation project (AMP-AD) and dozens of additional consortia and
projects. These programs employ open science practices to understand the molecular complexity of AD/ADRD
and identify new avenues for treatment. The Data Coordination Center (DCC), led by Sage Bionetworks,
supports these programs by overseeing dissemination of research outputs through the AD Knowledge Portal
and the Agora Platform. These platforms have been widely utilized, with thousands of researchers having
accessed data and hundreds of publications referencing their use. The DCC also promotes cross-project
integrative analyses through working groups, which have yielded significant contributions in terms of
harmonized datasets and cross-consortium publications. As the AD Knowledge Portal Data Coordination
Center, we will leverage and expand our existing processes, systems, and infrastructure to further our mission
to accelerate translational research in AD. We propose to: 1) apply Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
Reusable (FAIR) practices to define data and metadata standards and oversee data contribution and
governance; 2) use evidence-based strategies to engage the consortium in collaborative cross-team research
projects; (3) disseminate consortium-generated resources through the AD Knowledge Portal and Agora and
develop interoperability with the broader ecosystem of AD/ADRD data and resources; and 4) maximize the
impact of AD Knowledge Portal resources on basic and translational AD/ADRD research through outreach and
engagement with the broader research community."
10846947,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer and is usually fatal within a year of diagnosis. While
immune checkpoint blockade therapies, such as Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have
shown success in various cancers, in recurrent GBM only 8% of patients revealed objective responses. Non-
responsive GBMs display an immunosuppressive profile and higher levels of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells
(TIMs), consisting of brain microglia and peripheral-derived cells. Tackling the immunosuppressive
microenvironment is the major challenge in GBM immunotherapy. The goal of the study is to identify
mechanisms of GBM-mediated immune suppression and develop effective immunotherapy.
In human GBM specimens and mouse models, we previously identified elevated activation of Proline-Rich
Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) signaling, associated with an immunosuppressive
environment compared to healthy brain tissue. Pyk2 knock-out tumors exhibited increased infiltration of
inflammatory myeloid cells and antigen-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Additionally, an inverse relationship was
found between Pyk2/FAK activation and Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) expression in human GBM samples, while
NF1- cells demonstrated higher expression of PD-L1, which was reduced by knocking down Pyk2 and FAK.
Based on these findings we hypothesize that Pyk2 and FAK signaling in GBM cells coordinate the development
of an immunosuppressive tumor environment by regulating the release of cytokines and expression of PD-L1 in
GBM cells. Targeting Pyk2/FAK enhances the sensitivity of GBM to anti-PD-L1 therapy. The NF1 loss exhibit
increased sensitivity to Pyk2/FAK inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for NF1- GBMs. The
combination of Pyk2/FAK inhibitor defactinib and PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is anticipated to enhance anti-
tumor immune responses and improve therapeutic outcomes in PD-L1 inhibitor non-responsive patients.
In this study we will utilize NF1+ and NF1- mouse GBM models and primary human GBM cell cultures, coupled
with cell biology approaches, to dissect the underlying mechanisms of Pyk2 and FAK signaling in regulating the
activation state of TIMs. Additionally, the effectiveness of Pyk2/FAK inhibition as a sensitization strategy for the
PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab will be assessed in mouse GBM models, with a focus on NF1- tumors. These
findings have the potential to enhance treatment outcomes in GBM and guide personalized treatment decisions
based on the NF1 status of the tumor. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. To identify the role of Pyk2 and FAK signaling on the immunological microenvironment in NF1-
and NF1+ GBM tumors.
Specific Aim2. To identify the role of Pyk2 and FAK signaling in PD-L1 expression in GBM cells.
Specific Aim3. To assess the effectiveness of combined Pyk2/FAK and PD-L1 pharmacological inhibition in
reducing GBM tumor growth."

 This application represents the first renewal request to continue support of the UCLA Predoctoral Training
Program in Brain and Behavioral Development during Adolescence (UCLA BBDA). UCLA BBDA leverages
UCLAâs internationally known strength in adolescence by integrating campus expertise in developmental
neuroscience and behavioral science to create a one-of-a-kind training experience that produces translational
scientists with the skills necessary to conduct research supporting the NICHD mission to âenhance the lives of
children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all.â
 The study of adolescent brain development has expanded dramatically over the past two decades, and
UCLA BBDA training focuses on four substantive growth areas necessary for the field to have translational
impact and improve the health and lives of the nationâs youth: (1) an integrative approach that incorporates
both typical and atypical brain development; (2) the interaction between brain development and the social
environment; (3) sophisticated approaches to examining longitudinal change over time; and (4) attention to
population diversity according to ethnicity and socioeconomic resources.
 We accomplish this by providing an intensive mentored research experience, dedicated coursework
designed for the program, access to diverse faculty and research centers, as well as comprehensive
professional training that provides trainees with the toolkit necessary to become productive and impactful
independent scientists. As described in the Progress Report, we have had a successful first five years with 19
trainees working with 14 different primary and secondary mentors and who have demonstrated a strong level
of productivity. All of the 5 who have received their Ph.D. have obtained post-doctoral, research, and faculty
positions and the remainder are on track to complete their Ph.Dâs in a timely fashion.
 In the next five years, we aim to build upon our earlier successes and develop the program further by
adding new faculty and incorporating access to other resources on campus in order to provide additional
training opportunities in: (a) advanced methods in neuroimaging, such as structural and functional brain
connectivity; (b) biological markers of health; and (c) effective translation and dissemination of the science of
adolescence. Finally, we have continued and expanded upon our Recruitment Plan to Enhance Diversity in a
number of ways, such as partnering with UCLA initiatives focused on equity-minded recruitment and retention
and institutional efforts to recruit from national conferences drawing students from underrepresented
backgrounds. Collectively, these enhancements will help prepare our predoctoral trainees to position
themselves at the leading edge of the field and establish independent research careers that will further
NICHDâs mission of enabling children and adolescents to lead healthy and optimal lives."
10847671,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Due to genomic technologies, electronic medical records, and digitized high-throughput
experiment readouts, building an independent biomedical research career requires fluency in both biomedical
data generation and data science methods for analyzing large-scale biomedical datasets. This dichotomy is
challenging to address in doctoral training; biology doctoral students may take quantitative coursework with no
emphasis on biomedical data, while computational biology students often focus on one data type as end users.
The objective of our Predoctoral Training Program in Biological Data Science at Brown University is to turn âI-
shapedâ predoctoral students â with strength in one discipline â into âpi-shapedâ Biological Data Scientists with
fluency in two languages: (1) generating biological data motivated by questions across a range of scales and
systems, and (2) developing quantitative methods for modeling and testing hypotheses using large-scale bio-
medical datasets. The established Biological Data Science training community at Brown University has 34 en-
gaged faculty mentors across multiple disciplines who will jointly and actively mentor a steady state of six NIH-
supported predoctoral trainees during the first and second years of doctoral study (resulting in >30 Biological
Data Scientists over 5 years) in a variety of didactic, research, and mentoring activities, as well as in research
and professional development events that continue to foster interdisciplinary community for senior trainees.
These activities will include coursework in inference for genomics and molecular biology, laboratory practicums,
computational workshops, a year-long second-year graduate seminar focused on extensive peer review of meth-
ods for analyzing biological data, an annual program retreat, and a series of professional development events
for interdisciplinary researchers. The resulting community will promote the development of professional skills
essential for interdisciplinary biological data science research, including an emphasis on the ability to communi-
cate science to both broad and field-specific audiences, navigate interdisciplinary collaboration and grant appli-
cations, interview for academic and industry-based research careers, and conduct reproducible and open bio-
logical data science research. The faculty mentorsâ research programs cover multiple biological organisms, sys-
tems, and problems, ranging across biological and neuronal networks, computational biophysics, computer vi-
sion and visualization, evolutionary and statistical genetics, functional genomics, host-pathogen interactions, the
microbiome, and the molecular biology of aging. These activities will expand successful activities funded under
a previous NIGMS T32 FOA (now in year 5 of funding), resulting in the persistence of 23 trainees in biomedical
research, including 15 women and 7 students from groups historically underrepresented in biomedical research.
These trainees have secured external fellowships and produced 42 peer-reviewed publications and 8 preprints
under review thus far. The mentors have a combined annual research funding base of over $24 million in direct
costs this year, offering a strong foundation to bolster this innovative interdisciplinary training program."

Cancer has been a major focus of biomedical research since the war on cancer began with the National Cancer
Act of 1971. Despite this focus, nearly 10 million people die of cancer each year, worldwide. To help ensure that
the nationsâ biomedical, clinical, and behavioral cancer research workforce remains strong, we have developed
the Cancer-focused Summer Undergraduate Research (CanSUR) Program, with the goal of recruiting highly
motivated undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to foster their passion for a future career in cancer
research and oncology. The CanSUR Program supports 32 undergraduate scholars each year, recruited from
national and regional colleges/universities for a 10-week period, to participate in a cancer research experience
with members of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC). Key objectives of the CanSUR Program
are to: (1) provide a hands-on, cancer research experience including project development, execution,
interpretation, and reporting of research results in a Case CCC memberâs laboratory; (2) develop the
communication skills necessary to understand and present research in diverse settings; (3) educate participants
about cancer research career opportunities; (4) provide scientific enrichment and professional skills development
curricula to help prepare Scholars for graduate and/or medical school; (5) evaluate all aspects of the Program.
Three major components have been developed to meet these objectives. First, a Week 1 Cancer Immersion
Bootcamp has been developed that includes interactive lectures/discussions, HoloLens virtual reality education
modules, social outings to build community, discussions of cancer career paths, campus and Case CCC core
facility tours, and research ethics and lab safety training. Second, Scholars will engage in an individual mentored
research project. Finally, a Career and Scientific Enrichment Curriculum has been developed to help Scholars
learn about hot topics in cancer research, build communication skills, develop professional habits, and prepare
for the next step in their cancer-focused career path. Given the importance of our objectives, we have been
pledged substantial institutional support and have 70 Case CCC members and institutional leaders who focus
on cancer education prepared to continue recruiting and training outstanding undergraduates in this summer
program. As such, we are well-positioned to convert highly-motivated undergraduates into the nationâs next
cancer research workforce."

The primary cilium plays critical roles in cellular signaling which within the pancreatic islets are
essential for the proper regulation of hormone secretion and blood glucose control. In both
humans and rodent models, diabetes manifests from misregulated islet cell secretory function
due to altered crosstalk and coordination among the key endocrine cells, but the etiology of islet
cell paracrine dysregulation in diabetes is unknown. Our recent studies reveal that primary cilia
are required for the maintenance of islet function by allowing islet cells to sense and respond to
each otherâs activity status as communicated by hormonal cues. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that primary cilia promote islet cell coordination by mediating paracrine hormone
signaling via the major Î±- and Î²-cell hormones. To these this hypothesis, we will use islet cell-
specific primary cilia deletion mouse models to delineate the mechanisms by which Î±/Î²-cell cilia
regulate paracrine hormone release and action on target cells. Aim 1 will determine whether
primary cilia mediate Î±-cell intra-islet signaling via glucagon and GLP-1. Aim 2 will determine
whether primary cilia mediate Î²-cell intra-islet signaling via insulin and serotonin. In both aims,
we will employ orthogonal imaging and biochemical approaches in primary islets to delineate a
physiologic role for primary cilia in islet function. A detailed understanding of islet cell inter-
regulation by primary cilia could support the development of novel therapies to treat or prevent
islet failure in diabetes."

Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the world of genomics, transcriptomics and
epigenomics. Core facilities play a critical role in academic institutions by providing access to the specialized
expertise and instrumentation that are frequently out of reach to individual research laboratories. The Genomic
and RNA Profiling (GARP) Core at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) has over 12 years of experience in
operating and administering next-generation sequencers and provides sequencing services for well over 100
investigators per year. The requested instrument, the Illumina NovaSeq X, is the latest Illumina next-generation
sequencer that will replace our existing Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and enable the core to meet the rapidly changing
and growing needs of investigators at BCM. The major advances of the NovaSeq X, important for our needs
going forward, are greater output and flexibility, long-read sequencing applications, an integrated data analysis
platform, a smaller data footprint and reduced sequencing costs. To assure an optimal infrastructure and
maximum accessibility to BCM researchers, the Illumina NovaSeq X sequencer will be maintained and operated
by the GARP Core. We anticipate that the new instrument will support all of our established Illumina library prep
applications as well as allow for new applications and future growth. Most importantly, the NovaSeq X will enable
the GARP Core to remain the sequencing hub for the majority of investigators, postdocs and students at BCM
and extend support to surrounding Texas Medical Center institutions. The new instrument will enable us to
continue highly customized research projects that require control over every step of our NGS operation starting
with consultation and experimental design, sample processing, library construction, quality control and
management, and delivery of sequencing data and applying high quality standards throughout the entire process.
As the GARP Core develops additional epigenomics assays, the NovaSeq X will ensure capacity for new
applications and ensure that we can offer them as one-stop workflows to the local research community.
This new instrument will empower groups at BCM from a broad range of disciplines to understand the molecular
mechanisms of human diseases. We have identified 19 participating groups with NIH funding engaged in both
basic and clinical research that will benefit from the NovaSeq X sequencer. We believe the introduction of this
new NGS instrument will have direct, broad, and immediate impact on many medically relevant fields."

Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics is an exciting and rapidly advancing field of research, spurred by the
groundbreaking discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) by Professor Craig Mello, Nobel Laureate, at the
University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Chan). RNAi and antisense-based drugs have
shown clinical efficacy and are expected to become a significant class of therapeutic modalities. Fourteen
siRNA or ASO drugs have been approved, with many more in clinical development. The recent progress in
chemically modified guides for CRISPR-based therapies has also generated significant excitement. Advances
in oligonucleotide delivery to organs throughout the body, including liver, lung, central nervous system (CNS),
muscle, and kidneys, has led a growing number of investigators at UMass Chan to apply their disease and
target knowledge to develop transformative RNA-based therapeutics. The pharmacokinetic properties of
oligonucleotides are strongly influenced by their chemical structures, emphasizing the importance of advanced
modification patterns and design expertise. Unfortunately, academic investigators cannot readily access a
large number of therapeutic-quality, chemically modified oligonucleotides to identify drug leads. The RNA
Therapeutics Institute (RTI) at UMass Chan is widely recognized as a leading center in RNA chemical
innovation and translational research. Leveraging our expertise in chemistry, informatics, and delivery, we seek
to accelerate the development of innovative RNA-based technologies and therapeutics by establishing a high-
throughput production capability to synthesize 10,000 complex therapeutic RNA leads. This will allow
investigators to evaluate a large number of optimally modified oligonucleotides and identify the most potent
sequence-chemistry configurations. We are therefore seeking funds through a High-End Instrumentation Grant
to acquire the necessary equipment for high-throughput synthesis, purification, and quality control of
chemically modified RNA. The requested funds will be used to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, including
the Advion puriFlash XS520, Biolytic Dr. Oligo 192 XLc, Heated Pressure Chamber, Dr. Oligo Processor,
Agilent 1290 Infinity II Preparative LC/MSD and 6230B Time of Flight (TOF) LC/MS, Metrohm Compact Ion
Chromatograph (I.C. Flex), and Thermofisher SpeedVac SPD210. These cutting-edge instruments will allow us
to efficiently synthesize, purify, and analyze large numbers of chemically modified RNAs. This acquisition will
significantly enhance our basic and translational research programs, enabling the development of novel RNA-
based therapies for Huntington's Disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), organ rejection,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other diseases, including rare/orphan diseases. The equipment will
support ongoing studies funded by 17 NIH grants and multiple grants from private foundations."
10842682,"ABSTRACT/ SUMMARY
 The Immuno-modulatory Biomaterials Laboratory at the University of Florida focuses on the development
of novel biomaterial systems that can manipulate the immune system. Our goal is to design the next generation
of immunotherapeutics for applications in immune-related diseases. This multidisciplinary work incorporates
aspects of biomaterials engineering, drug delivery, immunology, biochemistry, and cell physiology. One of the
main research programs in our lab is understanding controlled vomocytosis (non-lytic exocytosis) of fungal cells
from phagocytes. Our primary motivation for elucidation of this process is the development of a hybrid fungal-
microparticle system that can accomplish phagocytic cell-mediated delivery of drugs, including vaccines to
guarded sites such as the brain and lymph nodes. Phagocytic cells (particularly macrophages [MÎ¦] and dendritic
cells [DCs])) have evolved to circulate through peripheral tissue, engulf foreign particulate matter and traffick to
specific tissues. Evidently, phagocytic cells can transport particulate materials from peripheral tissues to
lymphatic organs. Typically, following phagocytosis, materials that have been engulfed are taken into the
phagosome (vacuole in the cytoplasm of a cell containing a phagocytosed particles) where a degradative
process occurs due to secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), acidic pH and digestive enzymes. This stage
would be counterproductive to the integrity of the internalized material. Moreover, for delivery from a phagocyte
there has to be expulsion, and there is precedent for such behavior. The fungal cell, Cryptococcus neoformans,
elicits vomocytosis or (non-lytic exocytosis) from macrophages. There is still little understanding about the
mechanisms governing this phenomena. Here, we seek to demystify vomocytosis - a phenomenon that is
understudied. Ultimately, our long-term goal is to develop a universally-deployable, bug-microparticle platform
as an effective therapeutic for a plethora of immune and neurological conditions. These goals can only be
accomplished through comprehension of the interactions of this remarkable pathogen with innate immune cells.
Critically, to address gaps in our knowledge requires (i) the ability to identify vomocytosis in vivo, (ii) cognizance
of dissemination and interaction in hosts at the organ, tissue, cellular and subcellular levels and (iii) probing the
role of Ca2+ in CN vomocytosis. This proposal seeks to systematically cover these next steps using state-of-the-
art engineering tools, including those devised by the PIâs group. Therefore, the proposed program is highly
relevant to the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), which pertains to
supporting research that increases understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances
in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention."
10842805,"Project Summary
The transmission of macromolecules across biological membranes is a fundamental process in all cells. In the
earliest studies of genetic exchange in bacteria dating back to the 1940âs, the F plasmid (then termed âsex
factorâ) was shown to self-transfer and, through recombination, can mediate the transfer of the entire E. coli
chromosome to recipient bacteria. In the ensuing ~80 years, studies have established the broad medical
importance of F and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in shaping of bacterial genomes and as vectors for
dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other fitness traits among bacterial populations. MGEs also encode
conjugative pili or other cell surface adhesins, which promote intercellular contacts necessary for DNA transfer
and establishment of robust, antibiotic-resistant biofilm communities. MGEs are transmitted intercellularly
through nanomachines termed type IV secretion systems (T4SSs). The T4SSs are present in most bacterial
species, where they have functionally diversified into two large subfamilies, the DNA transfer or conjugation
systems and the âeffector translocatorsâ that deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells during infection.
In our 33 years of investigations, my group has identified many mechanistic and architectural features of these
nanomachines, including the first view of the translocation route for a DNA substrate through a T4SS. We have
consistently implemented emerging technologies and established collaborations to diversify our approaches,
which is especially evident from this cycle of MIRA-supported research. Collaboratively, we solved structures
of 4 model T4SSs in their native contexts of the bacterial cell envelope by in situ cryoelectron tomography
(CryoET), and we solved a structure of a large subassembly of the F-encoded T4SS at near-atomic resolution
by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (spCryoEM). Independently, we pioneered studies of F pilus
dynamics by labeling Cys-derivatized pilins with fluorescent maleimide conjugates, systematically deciphered
contributions of F-encoded machine subunits to assembly of the translocation channel and F pilus, and probed
functions of substrate processing factors and surface adhesins in early and late stages of substrate transfer.
Moving forward, we will address three major gaps in our knowledge of these dynamic nanomachines: 1) How
are substrates recruited to and delivered into and through the T4SS channel? 2) How do T4SSs elaborate
conjugative pili and for what biological ends? 3) How do T4SSs promote formation and disassembly of âmating
junctionsâ and how are these junctions architecturally configured? We will continue to use powerful in vivo
biochemical approaches, such as site-directed photocrosslinking, in combination with state-of-the-art super-
resolution fluorescence microscopy, in situ CryoET, and spCryoEM approaches to further probe T4SS
structure-function relationships. We anticipate our multidisciplinary and âteam scienceâ initiatives will continue to
generate important new information about the architecture, biogenesis, and mechanism of action of T4SSs and
set the stage for design of intervention therapies."
10844628,"The development of single virus tracking (SVT) methods has given insight into previously unresolved phases in
viral infection. SVT methods have revealed critical steps in viral internalization, envelope fusion, endocytic
trafficking, and even virion assembly, but these studies share a similar shortcoming. Current live-cell virus
tracking methods can not probe deep into samples and mainly capture dynamics near the coverslip surface, an
interface foreign to the cell that may not reflect actual in vivo behavior. Over the prior funding period, we
developed a powerful SVT microscopy technique for high-speed 3D tracking of single viruses. This method,
called 3D Tracking and Imaging (3D-TrIm), uses active feedback to lock on to the real-time position of freely
diffusing virions (up to 10 Âµm2/s) with high temporal resolution (down to 10 Âµsec) deep within samples (axial
ranges up to 50 Âµm). Critically, 3D-TrIm simultaneously captures volumetric images of the cellular environment,
placing these high-speed viral dynamics in context. Using 3D-TrIm, we seek to delve far beyond the coverslip to
perform single virus tracking in the complex environments where viral infection truly occurs: the epithelia. The
epithelia, be it in the lung or the gastrointestinal tract, is a complex tissue with an extended mucus layer and
glycocalyx. These act as an important barrier to viral and bacterial infection and are entirely missing in studies
on simple cultured cells. Initial experiments will focus on how the surface of cultured cells affects and inhibits the
dynamics of freely diffusing VSV-G and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus-like particles. High-speed 3D single
virus tracking will then be performed in real epithelial cultures to provide a first glimpse at the dynamics of single
viruses navigating through the viscous mucus layer and the size-excluding periciliary layer. The proposed work
will also probe how influenza A (IAV) uses a balance of receptor-binding (hemagglutinin) and receptor-destroying
(neuraminidase) envelope proteins to get through the native epithelia. We will test the hypothesis that IAV acts
as a ""molecular walker"" using a Brownian ratchet mechanism to process through the epithelia. The validity of
the ""molecular walker"" model will be further probed by tracking HA- and NA-functionalized silver nanoparticles
with nm spatial and Âµsec temporal resolution to look for processivity along sialic acid residues. Finally, we aim
to advance 3D-TrIm towards tracking in more complex tissue environments. Tracking in highly scattering and
highly autofluorescent tissues will be accomplished with recursive Bayesian filtering and information-efficient
sampling to distinguish photons from tracked particles versus background photons. The studies proposed herein
will be the first to probe viral dynamics in the complex epithelia. The dynamics of the tracked viral particles will
yield critical insight into the mechanism of viral infection through a host organism's first line of defense and
provide guidelines on designing successful therapeutics for crossing the epithelial barrier."

PPG represent independent but highly interactive proposals by experienced investigators who have a long track
record of collaborative studies. A major goal of Core A, therefore, is to ensure optimal interaction and integration
among the Projects. These interacting Projects also need the appropriate infrastructure and logistical support,
such as sample acquisition and storage, data management, and central administrative coordination. In addition,
as in the previous funding cycle, Core A will continue to provide statistical support to the investigators and
trainees associated with the Projects and, where appropriate, the Cores. However, in keeping with the evolving
bioinformatic needs of the Projects and also Core C (Drug Discovery and Development) and Core D
(Senescence Molecular Phenotyping), we have enlisted a highly qualified expert in systems biology and
bioinformatics, Dr. Hu Li, to (i) develop novel deep learning and systems biology platforms to uncover context-
specific mechanisms of aging-driven senescence in bone, muscle, and brain; and (ii) to devise and leverage
deep learning and systems-based single-cell analysis methods to decipher genes that modulate spatial
coordination of cells in the aging microenvironment. Collectively, through the coordination, integration, and
analysis of research activities and results across the three projects and four cores, Core A will ensure this PPG
yields fundamental insights into the governing roles of p16 and p21 in cellular senescence and aging, critical
data on the therapeutic potential of senotherapeutic compounds for age-related tissue dysfunction, and an
advanced understanding and new hypotheses regarding cellular senescence as a mediator of inter-organ
communication between bone, skeletal muscle, and brain."
10845136,"CORE B - Common Mouse Models Core (CMMC) â SUMMARY
Aging is a predominant risk-factor for many chronic diseases in various tissues, thus further understanding
the pathways and mechanisms underlying these disease states is of critical importance to human health.
Although both p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 have been identified as key drivers of cellular senescence in various
physiological and pathological contexts, the relative contributions of each towards age-related senescence
across tissues in vivo remains unclear. The use of novel genetic mouse models and tools to further
understand the role of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 in cellular senescence across multiple tissues has been a key
component of the previous PPG proposal. It is the overall goal of the Common Mouse Models Core (CMMC)
(Core B) is to continue this high level of productivity and innovation by providing the common genetic and
pharmacologic mouse model to the Projects [bone (Project 1), muscle (Project 2) and brain (Project 3)] and
the various Cores. In Aim 1, the CMMC will test the effects of these important senescence-related genes by
breeding the p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 single-, and the p16Ink4a;p21Cip1 double-gene floxed mouse models to a
global, inducible R26-CreERT2 mouse driver, and treat with tamoxifen to induce the gene deletions. In Aim
2, we will test novel senolytic compounds that potentially confer tissue-specific and/or p16Ink4a- and p21Cip1-
selective effects on senescence in aging across bone, muscle and brain in naturally aged wild-type mice.
These senolytic compounds will be provided and tested for in vitro functionality by Core C. Additionally, in
close coordination with Core C we will test these compounds for in vivo functionality. In both Aims 1 and 2,
the CMMC work closely with Projects 1-3 and the Cores in the sacrifice and dissemination of mouse products
for downstream analyses (Aim 3) within in each individual grant component. The CMMC will work closely
with Core A to collect, curate and manage data related to the tissue sample collection, functional parameters,
and histopathological findings. Since each of the Projects are using the same genetic and mouse models to
understand cellular senescence across tissues, the CMMC serves to both coordinate and centralize activities
to achieve high-quality data and reduce potential overlap and variability across these tissues by Projects 1-3
and the Cores in this PPG."
10896309,"In aging, myocardial injury is increased during ischemia-reperfusion and accelerates the
transition to post-infarction heart failure. In addition, most therapeutic strategies that effectively
decrease cardiac injury in younger hearts fail in aged hearts. Thus, it is a critical unmet need to
find an effective approach to decrease cardiac injury in the high risk aged heart during
myocardial infarctions and their treatment. Metformin is a currently approved drug for the
treatment of type II diabetes. We found that metformin is a reversible inhibitor of electron
transport chain complex I. Metformin (2 mM) decreased complex I activity in ischemia-damaged
heart mitochondria. Administration of metformin (2 mM) acutely during early reperfusion
decreased infarct size in both in vitro and in vivo murine models. The protection of metformin
was independent of AMPK activation, since cardiac injury was also decreased in the metformin-
treated AMPK kinase dead mouse. Thus, we propose to repurpose metformin as a complex I
inhibitor to decrease cardiac injury in aged hearts during the acute phase of reperfusion. AMPK
is also a critical stress-activated kinase that exerts longer-term cardiac protection during
prolonged recovery periods of reperfusion following myocardial infarction. Aging attenuates
AMPK activation and subsequently enhances cardiac injury during ischemia and reperfusion.
Sestrin2 is a scaffold protein critical to the activation of AMPK. Sestrin2 deficiency in the aging
heart leads to decreased AMPK activation and impairs protective autophagy and mitochondrial
biogenesis. We hypothesize that metformin treatment will activate AMPK in aged hearts through
modulation of sestrin 2 during prolonged reperfusion. Thus, we propose that high dose
metformin treatment provides acute protection in aged hearts during early reperfusion by
transiently inhibiting complex I and decreasing mitochondrial-driven injury. Modulation of
sestrin2-dependent AMPK activation in aged hearts by continued metformin treatment during
longer term reperfusion should provide prolonged protection and consolidate the benefit during
longer term recovery and decrease the transition to heart failure. Taken together, metformin
presents an attractive opportunity to repurpose a currently approved drug for a new use to
potentially attenuate both phases of the enhanced injury following a heart attack in the aged
heart in order to improve outcomes in the high risk elderly patient."
10845459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental
disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can
severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find
that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in
TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence
into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience
significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity
represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little
research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS
outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is
considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple
brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among
cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and
subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity
changes and predicting clinical outcome.
We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of
change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and
cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we
will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of
children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington
University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes
in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional
brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to
classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional
data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about
mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS
improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics.
Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions
about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every
step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel."

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and is considered a modern-day epidemic,
especially because of the high degree of heterogeneity. Multiple studies have shown that the tumor
microenvironment contributes to cancer growth and chemoresistance. Cancer-adipocyte interactions have
gained increased attention as the crosstalk between them has been shown to promote tumor proliferation and
increased cancer migration. However, the physiological relevance of previous co-culture methods is
questionable. Several past studies did not use human cells, or differentiate between white and brown
adipocytes, which have different phenotypes. In this proposal we will analyze tumor invasiveness of human
triple negative and luminal A breast cancer cells when co-cultured with human brown and white adipocytes. To
do this, we propose to use a 3D multicellular tumor spheroid system. Tumor spheroids provide a physiological
relevant environment to study cancer biology and drug discovery. Compared to 2D paradigms, research shows
3D models better recapitulate chemoresistance and tumor growth found in human in vivo tumors. In the lab, we
have developed a bioreactor that uses surface vibrations to produce Faraday waves that aggregate cells inside
a liquid chamber. Devices with similar technology have been used to assemble scaffold-free 3D cell constructs
and spheroids in a rapid and scalable way, without the need for additional chemicals or intrusive procedures. In
this grant, we also seek to determine if this technology generates multicellular spheroids with greater cell-cell
adhesion, compared to standard self-assembly. To achieve the scientific and technological goals of this grant,
two specific aims are proposed: The first aim will compare the viability and connectivity of multicellular
spheroids formed with our surface vibration bioreactor versus standard self-assembly spheroids. The second
aim will measure changes in tumor invasiveness and proliferation in tumor spheroids made with human cancer
cells and human adipocytes. We will compare two different types of breast cancer cells: triple negative and
luminal A and two different types of adipocytes: white and brown adipocytes. These combinations will allow us
to investigate the interactions of different cancer phenotypes with specific adipocyte cell types. Overall, the
proposed research will have a major scientific and technological impact by expanding our understanding of
breast cancer-adipocyte interactions and testing a technology that could deliver multicellular spheroids with
improved intracellular connectivity in a scalable manner. This will significantly impact the field of cancer biology
and therapeutics, as cancer-adipocyte associations have been observed in a multitude of tumors, including
prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer."
10845502,"Project Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness in the elderly, associated with altered
lipid (cholesterol) metabolism and altered immunity (complement). Chronic subretinal inflammation occurs during
aging in clinical and experimental AMD, and is associated many other neurodegenerative diseases. Resolving
harmful persistent inflammation is important to protect the retinas from age-related damage. Previous work
identified that retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORÎ±) a lipid (cholesterol)-sensing nuclear
receptor, is genetically linked with the risk for wet AMD. RORÎ± is a transcription factor that regulates lipid
homeostasis and inflammation, both important for AMD. Our preliminary results from mouse models of aging
and retinal degeneration indicate that: 1) RORÎ± deficiency induces subretinal deposits, accumulation of lipid-
enriched microglia/macrophages in the subretinal space in aging mice; 2) RORÎ± deficiency worsens light-
induced retinal degeneration; 3) Loss of RORÎ± induces microglia/macrophage lipogenesis and chronic
inflammation in RPE/choroid with induction of PPARÎ³, a key lipid metabolic regulator; 4) RORÎ± deficiency alters
complement factors and suppresses complement inhibitory factor H (CFH, one of the strongest AMD
susceptibility genes) in the liver and in the eyes; and 5) RORÎ± directly regulates both CFH and PPARÎ³
transcription. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that during aging, RORÎ± links lipid dysregulation with
subretinal microglia/macrophage lipogenesis and complement alteration, to suppress chronic pathogenic
subretinal inflammation; RORÎ± activation may resolve chronic inflammation associated with early AMD. We will
test this hypothesis with three aims. Aim I: To determine whether RORÎ± deficiency exacerbates pathological
subretinal inflammation and retinal degeneration in RORÎ± deficient mice during aging and with a light-induced
retinal degeneration model. Aim II: To assess if RORÎ± deficiency induces chronic subretinal inflammation by
accelerating microglia/macrophage recruitment, lipogenesis, and function through PPARÎ³, and/or by controlling
systemic and/or local CFH function and complement cascade. Aim III: to determine if RORÎ± activation resolves
chronic inflammation and protects the retinas in chronic dry AMD models and in light-induced retinal
degeneration model. This work will uncover the potential role of RORÎ± as a key mediator of lipid homeostasis
and altered innate immunity in chronic subretinal inflammation associated with AMD, and develop potential new
treatments via activating RORÎ± to resolve persistent inflammation during aging and protect retinas."
10845504,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cardiometabolic disease burden is increasing in the United States. The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)
hormone contributes to the regulation of glucose utilization, energy homeostasis and is a major determinant
of cardiometabolic health. We have demonstrated that a common genetic variant in the ANP gene (rs5068)
is associated with higher ANP levels and a more favorable cardiometabolic profile. We have also identified
that microRNA-425 (miR-425) decreases the production of ANP. The favorable genetic variant (rs5068)
prevents the binding of miR-425 and ensures adequate ANP production. Thus, miR-425 acts only among
those with low ANP genotype, i.e., those without the rs5068 genetic variant. We have also demonstrated
that an oral glucose challenge reduces ANP levels, whereas an exercise challenge increases ANP levels.
However, the impact of the ANP genotype on the ANP response to glucose challenge and exercise
challenge has not been previously examined. We have demonstrated that miR-425 is glucose-responsive
and may regulate the ANP response to metabolic perturbations. The response of miR-425 to glucose
challenge, exercise challenge, and its relationship with energy expenditure (EE) is not known in humans.
We hypothesize that individuals with low ANP genotype will (1) have a greater suppression of ANP by
glucose challenge, (2) have lower resting and exercise EE, and (3) demonstrate the responsiveness of
miR-425 to metabolic perturbations (glucose challenge and exercise challenge). We propose to conduct a
genotype-guided study by performing detailed metabolic profiling among individuals with high and low ANP
genotypes. In our Aim 1, we will enroll 200 healthy adults (50 with high ANP genotype and 150 with low
ANP genotype), and we will assess the difference in response of MRproANP to a glucose challenge by
genotype groups. We will also assess the change in the glucose and insulin levels subsequent to glucose
challenge between high and low ANP genotype groups. In Aim 2, we will assess the difference in EE
(during rest and during exercise) between the two genotype groups. We will also assess the difference
between the two genotype groups in terms of the response of ANP, glucose, insulin, and markers of fat
breakdown to the standardized exercise challenge. In Aim 3, we will assess if there is a change in miR-425
expression after glucose and exercise challenge among those with low ANP genotype. We will also assess
the association of change in miR-425 expression with the change in MRproANP, glucose, and insulin levels
following respective metabolic perturbations (glucose challenge and exercise challenge). The detailed
metabolic profiling of participants based on their ANP genotype will provide insights into the role of the ANP
system in the regulation of cardiometabolic health and generate evidence supporting the biological basis for
developing RNA-based novel treatment approaches to prevent and treat cardiometabolic diseases."

Advanced chronological age is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimerâs disease. Accumulating
evidence suggests that disease processes may begin decades prior to dementia. Therefore, cellular and
molecular processes that contribute to biological aging may also modulate Alzheimerâs disease pathogenesis.
We recently identified a fundamental cellular aging stress response, cellular senescence, as a pathogenic
process driving neurodegeneration in tauopathies, brain diseases histologically defined by tau protein
accumulation. Features of cellular senescence include stable cell cycle arrest and toxic secretory phenotype.
In this way, senescent cells escape cell death and become persistently deleterious to their surrounding
environment. We have found a causal relationship connecting tau accumulation (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles),
a neuronal senescence-like phenotype, and chronic neurodegeneration in tauopathies, including Alzheimerâs
disease. As terminally differentiated cells, neurons may seem incapable of initiating a senescence stress
response. However, our data indicate that neurons with mature neurofibrillary tangles are arrested in a
cellular senescence-like state. The objective of this project is to identify the upstream molecular mediators
and downstream cellular consequences of neuronal senescence in the human brain. High resolution profiling
methods will be applied to analyze neurons across the adult human lifespan, and throughout the progressive
stages of Alzheimerâs disease. This project will significantly advance the basic understanding of this novel
neuronal cell fate, cellular senescence, and its influence on brain health. Moreover, the cellular and molecular
pathways identified in our project may reveal novel therapeutic targets for intervention, and the age/stage of
disease where they would be most beneficial."
10845613,"ABSTRACT
It remains considerably challenging to restore vision after developmental disturbances, such as congenital
infantile nystagmus, and after injury or retinal degeneration. This is because the mechanisms establishing
functional connectivity between retinal ganglion cells and their downstream targets in the brain remain poorly
understood. This knowledge gap is partly because observing the functional emergence, stabilization, and
maintenance of entire visual neural circuits is impossible in mammals. This project will leverage the strategic
experimental advantages of the larval zebrafish, a vertebrate model system, to investigate the functional
maturation of a conserved neural circuit underlying a visual orienting behavior, the optomotor response (OMR).
This will form the basis for understanding how congenital disorders exert their effects and how new neurons
added after initial circuit development can support healthy visual processing. Recently, we described the
transformation of retinal visual motion signals into motor output and showed that it required many different types
of neurons distributed across the brain. These neurons can be classified based on their diverse eye- and
direction-specific response profiles, and they collaborate to compute how exactly visual scenes are moving.
Fascinatingly, this collaboration supports stable behavior 5 days after fertilization, even though new neurons are
added to the circuit throughout life. We will test the central hypothesis that after initial formation, the OMR circuit
expands by adding new neurons in balanced response classes, permitting the continued execution of motion-
guided behaviors. In Aim 1, we will test how the development of the behavioral repertoire and associated neural
circuitry is affected by specific disruption of direction-selective retinal input. By training recurrent neural networks,
we will generate predictive models of connectivity between direction-selective retinal ganglion cells and
downstream targets. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the functional neural representations mature, and we will
quantify the stability of individual neuronal responses over time. By computationally tracking all neurons, we will
directly investigate the trajectory of new neuron functional integration into existing circuitry and determine how
the balance of functional profiles varies over time and covaries with behavior. In Aim 3, will use holographic
photostimulation to examine the role of activity in shaping ultimate circuit role for individual neurons. Together,
these experiments will reveal how an entire motion-sensitive vertebrate circuit is functionally assembled,
providing insight about the functional connectivity between retinal ganglion cells and their downstream partners
and about the nature and utility of neurogenesis. These results will inform regenerative treatment strategies for
developmental disorders or injuries to central visual processing areas."

Growth and homeostasis of bones require calcium and inorganic phosphorus (Pi). With millions of Americans
suffering from bone mineralization disorders, there exists a need for understanding processes governing hard
tissue mineralization. Pi is implicated in not only forming hydroxyapatite, the main crystal giving bone its
compressive strength, but also regulating osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation and function. PiT-2 (gene:
Slc20a2) is the major form of sodium-dependent Pi transporters in mineralized tissue. Our laboratory is one of
the first to have identified its potent role in regulating skeleton development and mineralization. Knockout of the
PiT-2 gene in mice resulted in tooth and bone mineralization abnormalities, as evidenced by reduced osteoblast
numbers, bone density and volume, and impaired incisor development and amelogenesis. The focus of this
research is to explore further the role of PiT-2 in cellular and extracellular processes governing skeletogenesis,
dentinogenesis, and amelogenesis. Specifically, Aim 1 will confirm and extend our preliminary findings to
determine whether PiT-2 is required for regulation of odontoblast and ameloblast numbers, differentiation, and/or
mineralizing activity with deficiencies leading to impaired dentinogenesis and amelogenesis. A role of PiT-2 in
dentin repair and tertiary dentin formation will also be studied using a molar injury mouse model. In Specific Aim
2, we will define the mechanisms of action of PiT-2 in mineralizing cells using osteoblasts as an example. A Pi
transport and sensing/signaling function of PiT-2 will be dissected through engineered PiT-2 transport deficient
mutants. We expect these studies to provide a better understanding of how Pi influences functions of hard tissue
forming cells, serving as a basis to develop novel therapeutics for patients suffering from mineralization
disorders, such as osteoporosis and osteopenia. This project will take place at the University of Washington with
collaborations between the Departments of Bioengineering and Oral Health Sciences during DDS-PhD training
of the PI. The PI will develop critical thinking skills, learn state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques, in
vivo transgenic mouse models, and data analysis that will prepare him for independent research. Ultimately, a
strong mentorship team, multidisciplinary collaborative effort, and resources at the University of Washington with
support through this award will prepare the trainee for a future tenure-track faculty position to study
biomineralization processes."
10826819,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer characterized by the accumulation of abnormal
myeloid progenitors arrested in differentiation. It is the most common form of leukemia among adults and the
second most common among children. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of this disease,
prognosis for AML patients remains dismal, with five-year survival rates languishing at <30% despite the use of
intensive chemotherapy. Thus, there is a compelling need to identify novel molecular vulnerabilities of AML to
help guide the development of more effective targeted therapies. The RNA helicase DDX6 emerged as a
prominent hit in our CRISPR dropout screens aimed at identifying specific AML dependencies. DDX6 represses
the translation of target mRNAs by using its ATP-dependent helicase activity to sequester them in P-bodies,
cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules. Our preliminary data indicate that AML cells overexpress DDX6 and
harbor more P-bodies compared to normal hematopoietic progenitors. We find that loss of DDX6, triggering P-
body dissolution, attenuates self-renewal of AML cells and promotes their differentiation in vitro but has little
effect on normal hematopoietic progenitors. Congruently, we also find that loss of DDX6 abrogates the expansion
of AML cells in vivo. By purifying intact P-bodies from AML cells, we found enrichment of potent tumor
suppressors (e.g., KDM5B, TLE4, TRAF6) among the mRNAs sequestered by DDX6 in P-bodies. Together,
these data lead us to hypothesize that DDX6 is a specific AML dependency that sustains AML by
sequestering and translationally repressing mRNAs encoding tumor suppressors. We will test this
hypothesis through two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the functional requirement for DDX6 in AML using
novel mouse models. We expect that Ddx6 loss or mutation of its helicase activity will prevent or delay AML
onset in vivo. Conversely, we expect that Ddx6 overexpression will accelerate AML onset in vivo. In Aim 2, we
will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DDX6 sustains AML. We predict that we will find mRNAs
encoding tumor suppressors to be enriched in the P-bodies of AML cells and translationally repressed. We
anticipate that loss of DDX6 will de-repress these mRNAs and promote their translation and protein expression.
Collectively, these experiments will unveil the RNA helicase DDX6 as a potential therapeutic target in AML by
establishing it as a specific AML dependency and deciphering the mechanistic basis for this dependency. This
study will also provide the first evidence of an oncogenic role for P-bodies in the context of hematological
malignancies and may uncover novel tumor suppressors among DDX6 targets that can potentially be exploited
against AML."
10825995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project translates an innovative, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to patients with pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We posit efficacy of CAR T targeting mesothelin (relevant PDAC antigen) can be
enhanced by use of 1) a new subset expressing CD26 (a costimulatory molecule with enzymatic properties) termed CD26+
T cells; and 2) an innovative expansion protocol that incorporates the phosphatidyl inositol kinase-3 inhibitor
(PI3Ki), duvelisib to improve CART persistence and metabolism. Our team reported that CD26+CD4+ T cells
redirected with a Meso-CAR were polyfunctional and elicit activity against PDAC tumors in mice. Our overall
hypothesis is that PI3Ki-expanded, CD26+CD4+ T cells are an ideal template for safely redirecting
immunity to PDAC. While CD26+CD4+ T cells are polyfunctional, they fully differentiate after expansion, which
reduces potency. However, our data shows CD26+T cell differentiation can be reduced using duvelisib during
manufacturing, thus sustaining self-renewal (i.e., âstemnessâ), while enhancing in vivo cytolytic activity against
orthotopic KPC tumors. This Project pursues three specific aims. Aim 1 will test our hypothesis that CD26+CD4+
CAR T cells degrade chemokines that induce suppressive myeloid cells, favorably altering the cell composition
in the tumor microenvironment using relevant murine PDAC models (orthotopic and metastatic) in immune competent
mice. Functional impact of Meso-CAR T on endogenous T cells will be tested in parallel studies in RAG2 KO to
further define mechanism of efficacy. Aim 2 will investigate the interaction between Duvelisib-expanded
CD26+CD4+ CAR T cells and conventional CAR T cells in targeting PDAC. Also, the role of CD26 in efficacy will
be evaluated by using CD26+CD4+ MesoCAR T cells expressing enzymatically active or inactive CD26 or treating
mice with a selective CD26 inhibitor (sitagliptin). The effect of CD26 enzyme modulation on the recruitment of
myeloid cells in the PDAC TME will be tested in both human and murine in vivo systems. In Aim 3, we conduct
a novel first-in-human trial in patients with advanced PDAC to evaluate safety, persistence, and fate of co-infused
Duvelisib-expanded CD26+CD4+ and conventional CD3+ Meso CAR T cells. We will refine manufacturing and
generate foundational feasibility/reproducible CMC data for an IND application. A phase 0/1 clinical trial will use
low dose numbers of Duvelisib-expanded CD26+CD4+ Meso-CAR T cells, followed by dose escalation of
Duvelisib-expanded CD26+CD4+ Meso-CAR T cells in combination with differentially bar-coded conventional
CD3+ Meso-CAR T cells to define safety and clinically effective dose of this novel ACT therapy. Engraftment and
persistence of CAR T products in blood and patient tumor biopsies will be tested with spatial molecular imaging
and multi-parameter flow cytometry to study CART's metabolic/effector properties. Collectively, this work will
define properties of novel Duvelisib-expanded CD26+CD4+ CAR T cells in animal PDAC models and determine
safety and persistence of CD26+CD4+ CAR T cells in patients. Our results will enable subsequent trials with
CD26+CD4+ Meso-CAR T cells as an individual therapy or a component of combined cell therapy in PDAC."

10847434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including Alzheimerâs disease (AD), are associated with
immune system dysfunction. A population of perivascular and leptomeningeal macrophages (which we
now collectively refer to as parenchymal-border macrophages, or PBMs), resides at the borders of the
CNS parenchyma and interact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our preliminary data indicate that
pharmacological or genetic ablation of PBMs leads to impaired vasomotion and disrupted CSF dynamics.
Moreover, our findings show that depletion of PBMs results in buildup of perivascular extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins and shrinkage of the perivascular space. Aged mice are characterized by impaired CSF
dynamics and this is associated with an altered PBM phenotype (reduced Lyve1 expression and induction of
MHCII). Most surprisingly, injection of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) into the CSF reversed
the age-associated effects on CSF flow, further linking PBM dysfunction to abnormal CSF dynamics. We have
recently showed that the skull bone marrow supplies dural myeloid cells, and that after injury or during
neuroinflammation these cells can invade the CNS parenchyma. Our preliminary results demonstrate that skull
bone marrow-derived monocytes also contribute to PBM turnover. Given the strategic location of the PBMs and
the contribution of skull bone marrow cells to their renewal, in this proposal we will focus on PBMs to
understand their roles in AD. We hypothesize that aging promotes the activation of PBMs and their
acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, resulting in the build-up of ECM, thus leading to perivascular
spaces less permissive to flow and an overall impairment of CSF dynamics. This in turn contributes to
impaired amyloid clearance from the brain parenchyma and deposition along the vasculature, aggravating
parenchymal amyloidosis and precipitating cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We further hypothesize that
therapeutic manipulation of the PBMs may improve CSF dynamics and alleviate, at least to some extent, the
pathology associated with AD and CAA. In this project we will closely interact and collaborate with other
projects of the program, as well as the surgery and imaging core. Proof of our hypothesis will introduce a new
player, namely PBMs, in AD and CAA pathophysiology. Not less importantly, it may herald the discovery of
new therapeutic targets and interventions that can delay the onset or even improve the ongoing
pathophysiology of devastating aging-associated neurological diseases."
10847437,"Abstract: Project 2 will investigate the interplay of APOE genotype, innate immunity, and meningeal
lymphatics on cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and the translational implications of modifying lymphatic
function on passive immunotherapy of CAA. CAA occurs in ~90% of individuals who develop Alzheimerâs
disease (AD) and can occur independently of AD. The pathological hallmarks of CAA are deposition of amyloid
composed in the majority of cases of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) along small arteriole vessel walls of the cerebral
vasculature and leptomeninges. CAA leads to loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, impaired vasoreactivity,
hemorrhages, and ischemia resulting in cognitive impairment and transient ischemic episodes. CAA is also
linked with edema and microhemorrhages that are common side effects observed with several anti-AÎ²
antibodies known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). The mechanisms underlying the
development of CAA are not well understood, but prior studies indicate that APOE genotype, perivascular fluid
flux, and innate immune cells can all influence CAA pathology. Like AD, APOE4 increases the risk of
developing CAA. Recently, we demonstrated that anti-apoE antibodies that target a form of apoE that co-
deposits with vascular amyloid reduced CAA and improved vascular function. In the brain parenchyma, apoE is
predominantly expressed by astrocytes and reactive microglia. Vascular-associated cells, such as perivascular
macrophages (PVMs), pericytes, and the recently described fibroblast-like vascular leptomeningeal cells
(VLMCs) are also reported to express apoE. ApoE produced by different cell types differ in their lipidation state
and post-translational modifications which could suggest a cell-specific role for apoE in CAA or subsequent
vascular dysfunction and inflammation. Recent studies by the Kipnis lab have shown important contributions of
the meningeal lymphatic system to AÎ² deposition in parenchymal and leptomeningeal plaques. Impaired
clearance of AÎ² from perivascular spaces may also contribute to the formation of CAA, although the role of the
meningeal immune system and the meningeal lymphatics in CAA formation and pathogenesis is unexplored.
We hypothesize that 1) apoE plays a multifaceted role in CAA formation by influencing perivascular AÎ²
seeding and clearance in part via the meningeal lymphatic system and perivascular immune cells, 2)
the meningeal lymphatic system plays a key role in CAA formation; and 3) augmenting the meningeal
lymphatic system will increase the efficacy of anti-apoE immunotherapy reduction of CAA. We propose
these Aims: Aim 1: To determine effect of cell-type specific apoE expression on CAA and meningeal lymphatic
function. Aim 2: To determine the role of meningeal lymphatics on CAA pathology and associated
inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Aim 3: To determine the effect of lymphatic function on the efficacy of
anti-apoE antibody treatment on CAA and vascular dysfunction. Project 2 will collaborate extensively with all
Projects and Cores in this grant to accomplish these goals."

10861816,"Project Summary (Protein Production and Characterization Core)
The Protein Production and Characterization Core (PPCC) serves as research support for the Oklahoma COBRE
in Structural Biology (OCSB) and the greater life science research community. It is a state-of-the-art facility for
the expression, purification, and biophysical characterization of proteins for researchers. The PPCC produces
high quality proteins in a reliable and efficient manner on a fee-for-service basis and provides hands-on training
and expert advice in all aspects of protein expression, purification, and characterization available in the facility.
The PPCC staff consists of the Core Director Dr. Philip Bourne and a Graduate Student Assistant. The PPCC is
guided by an advisory committee comprised of three faculty users.
The PPCC works closely with investigators and the OCSB-supported Biomolecular Structure Core (BSC) to
produce homogeneous, highly purified protein for crystallization trials and other life science research needs. The
facility is equipped with instrumentation frequently not found within individual research laboratories due to their
cost and maintenance. Recently, instrumentation for the biophysical characterization of macromolecules was
added to the facility and fostered the expansion of services and resulting increase in the user base.
During the proposed Phase 3 of the OCSB, the PPCC will work with the BSC, the OU Mass Spectrometry,
Proteomics & Metabolomics Core, and the cryo-EM component of the OU Samuel Roberts Noble Microscopy
Laboratory to support researchers in their protein needs for structural biology methodologies. Being a dynamic
resource for the life science community will continue to grow the user base and, together with the support of the
University, provide for the long-term sustainability of this core facility."
10861819,"Project Summary (Pilot Project Program)
The objectives of the OCSB Pilot Project Program are to: (i) provide project support for researchers to obtain
preliminary data for structural biology-related projects that will enhance competitiveness of their external grant
applications, (ii) enhance the user base of the OCSB-supported core facilities, (iii) continue to support early-
stage investigators, and (iv) incentivize collaborative research. During Phases 1 and 2, the OCSB funded 16
seed or pilot projects that resulted in 14 publications and 22 new external grants awarded to these investigators,
which represents a 11.7-fold return on the investment. We intend to continue our open and competitive pilot
project program during Phase 3 of the OCSB. We will prioritize innovative and meritorious projects from early-
stage investigators, encourage collaborations between structural biologists and non-structural biologists, as well
as promote the use of our COBRE core facilities. Mentorship and training, hallmarks of our center, will continue
to contribute to the success of our proposed pilot project program. We are particularly interested in incorporating
new structural biology techniques, including cryo-EM, into the research programs of our PPLs and other center
participants."
10855273,"Neural activity directly controls the development and homeostasis of organ function. Yet, a surprising gap exists
between laboratories focused on vascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and musculoskeletal systems and those
focused on neurophysiology, neuromodulation, and neural injury. Traditionally, departments are organized by
organ system and this siloed structure leads to a physical and scientific jargon separation, impeding collaboration
and training. Hence, our understanding of how the central nervous system communicates with end organs
throughout the body is in its infancy. Neural Control of Organ Degeneration and Regeneration (NeuralCODR), a
cross-disciplinary training program unites 30 faculty members and 12 clinician researchers to form mentorship
teams within the largest medical research center in the world (Texas Medical Center). Mentorship teams include
a primary and secondary mentor (each from one of our three main areas of research: 1) neural development and
tools, 2) neural innervation and organ engineering, and 3) nervous system and peripheral organ disorders) and
a clinical mentor who provides much needed and rare exposure to real-world diseases, clinical challenges, and
human samples. NeuralCODR aims to: 1) catalyze the collision of talent and ideas that spawn research projects
bridging neuroscience with organ systems through facilitated interactions, 2) build co-mentor teams that include
neuroscience, organ systems, and clinical perspectives, ensuring trainees are guided toward a unique research
niche, and 3) train fellows in research rigor, analysis, and career skills that support their development as scientific
leaders. NeuralCODR leverages a network of faculty who collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between
organ system biology and engineering and neural function, degeneration and regeneration, as evidenced by an
impressive list of multi-laboratory shared grants, publications, and nascent collaborations. The training structure
emphasizes experiences in organ engineering and organ physiology laboratories in parallel with education in
neurophysiology and neural engineering, translational theory, and practice. Currently, two NeuralCODR Houston
Methodist-specific postdoctoral positions exist, thanks to a philanthropic endowment that has allowed us to build
the program structure and to test both the coursework and mentorship team concept. Trainees are funded for
two years, during which time they have access to a core curriculum, career development and program
enrichment opportunities, symposiums/retreats, and elective courses. Year one culminates with the submission
of an NRSA and a manuscript based on traineesâ development of a transformative research project that
incorporates non-neuroscience expertise and tools into a neuroscience problem. Year two solidifies the
relationships between the mentorship team and trainee and provides training in laboratory management, didactic
teaching, and mentorship skills. T32 funding will allow us to increase the current model to six postdoctoral training
slots. This training program will foster a new generation of scientific leaders who pioneer research on the
connected pathways between brain and organ systems to solve fundamental challenges in neuroscience."
10783685,"Relapse is the major cause of death in patients with poor-risk leukemia. Increasing the dose of conventional total
body irradiation (TBI) as preconditioning for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) potentially reduces relapse
but results in increased toxicity to vital organs and no survival benefit. Therefore, in the last several years, total
marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) preparative HCT regimens have been developed to safely target
increased doses to sites of disease. This continuation application expands on previous successful dose
escalation strategies using TMLI to enhance the therapeutic gain (dose ratio of bone marrow to vital organs) in
refractory and relapsed leukemia patients, compared to conventional TBI. Phase I TMLI trials demonstrate that
dose escalation is feasible with acceptable toxicities. Initial results are encouraging in patients with refractory or
relapsed leukemia not eligible for standard of care transplant regimens, as exemplified in one study showing a
two-year progression-free survival rate of 27%. However, the disease relapse rate is still high (~65%). To address
this problem, the investigators have developed a state-of-the-art non-invasive hybrid imaging technology, a multi-
modal imaging methodology, that detects a heterogeneous spatial association between acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and the bone marrow environment (BME) to identify areas of FLT-avid high disease burden and potential
sites for disease relapse and to uncover skeletal-wide spatial variations in BME damage or destabilization
(BMED) that may adversely affect bone marrow (BM) engraftment. Thus, based on the knowledge gained in the
last funding period, the objective is to maximize the benefit of tumor cell killing without increasing BME damage
that is reflected by reduced cellularity/hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal capacity and increased
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards adipogenesis. Initial study reveals that escalated
TMLI radiation doses lead to tolerable BMED. This work will be expanded in Aim 1 to assess spatial and temporal
effects of TMLI on BMED in an ongoing clinical trial using patient-derived biological samples and non-invasive
imaging, namely, whole body, dual energy CT (DECT) and water fat MRI (wfMRI) for longitudinal assessment of
BMED. In Aim 2, a hybrid 3â-deoxy-3â[(18)F] -fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT PET)-DECT-
wfMRI imaging system to assess skeletal-wide spatial distribution of disease and its association with treatment
response (relapse/remission) will be utilized. The feasibility of this functional TMLI (fTMLI) to allow augmented
doses (or dose painting) to areas of FLT-avid high disease burden for targeted specific dose escalation will also
be characterized. In Aim 3, the investigators will use a newly developed mouse model of clinical TMLI to study
how TMLI doses impact BMED and engraftment. Identifying an optimal dose to minimize BMED and maximize
leukemia cell killing will complement the goals of Aims 1 and 2. This strategy has the potential to significantly
improve the safety and efficacy of TMLI as HCT conditioning for AML patients by reducing disease relapse
without significantly increasing toxicity."
10855097,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In the United States, over 10,000 new diagnoses of the pediatric lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(BPD), are made annually in surviving premature infants, with costs exceeding $2.5 billion. Treatment options,
such as adrenergic receptor agonists, have variable efficacy for the obstructive airway manifestations that
characterize this disease. Furthermore, these patients have an elevated risk of mortality and early onset chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. In a neonatal hyperoxia mouse model of BPD and airway hyperreactivity, the
PIâs new data identify a viable therapy for this oxidant-related disease. Treatment with S-nitrosoglutathione
(GSNO) reverses airways hyperresponsiveness in oxygen exposed juvenile mice and room air recovered adults.
GSNO is a potent endogenous bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory, critical for the airways diseases of asthma
and cystic fibrosis. In this model, hyperoxia increases the catabolic breakdown of GSNO caused by increased
expression and activity of the enzyme, S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), in-part through hyperoxic
downregulation of a microRNA (miR-342). Furthermore, mice that do not express the GSNOR gene are protected
from hyperoxia induced alveolar simplification, airway hyperreactivity, and end-organ pulmonary hypertensive
changes. This proposal will test the overall hypotheses that (1) molecular GSNOR catabolism of beneficial GSNO
in relevant cells drives the development of BPD and (2) genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the GSNO/GSNOR
pathway will mitigate inflammation and disease. This proposal will evaluate the effects of neonatal hyperoxia in
genetic GSNOR knock-outs by investigating the molecular mechanisms in which GSNO confers protection,
distinguish gene expression profiles at a single-nucleus level in lung tissue from wild type and GSNOR knock-
outs, elucidate the roles of GSNOR in alveolar & airway epithelial cells or myeloid immune cells using Cre/loxP
cell-specific knock-outs, and test pharmacologic GSNOR inhibition or exogenous inhaled GSNO during
hyperoxia. These studies are clinically important because inhaled GSNO and GSNOR inhibitors are being
studied for airway diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis which could ultimately serve as viable new
therapies for BPD."
10855098,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing disease involving genetic abnormalities
and environmental insults. It is the leading cause of blindness for older Americans; and as the population
ages, the prevalence of AMD continues to grow. Since smoking increases AMD risk and there is a higher
incidence of smoking in veterans, disproportionally more veterans will be affected. Treatments are available
for choroidal neovascularization (CNV); but those come with risks and only target a subpopulation of AMD
patients. No treatment is available for early AMD and geographic atrophy (GA; >85% of all cases), making it
paramount to develop a treatment for early disease intervention. While mechanistic studies have shown that
inflammation and smoking are fundamental components of AMD, genetic studies have demonstrated that
polymorphisms in complement proteins each increase the risk for developing AMD. One of the most detri-
mental mutation occurs in factor H (fH) an essential inhibitor in the complement alternative pathway (AP),
suggesting that inadequate control of complement-driven inflammation is a major AMD risk factor. To date,
complement therapeutics in GA have not been FDA approved. Approaches included blocking complement
factor C3 and C5 (activators in the terminal pathway) or factor D (fD; AP activator). What these strategies
had in common was that most of the drug was wasted on non-pathophysiologically important target mole-
cules; i.e., most complement components in fluids or tissue are not engaged in complement activation and
hence to reduce complement activation at the ocular target sites [basal RPE, Bruchâs membrane (BrM) or
choriocapillaris (CC)], the majority of a given complement component has to be permanently inhibited to
achieve the desired effect. In addition, complement components are made in the eye and systemically, and
many complement components can penetrate BrM; hence an almost unlimited reservoir of complement pro-
teins exists that needs to be controlled. Given these complications, we propose to build on our data utilizing
an âaddressableâ inhibitor that target to sites of complement activation regardless of the location (CR2-fH)
delivered via gene therapy, as well as antibody to monitor complement activation. First, we will utilize hu-
man iPSC-RPE cells to examine efficacy of AAV-CR2-fH in complement-mediated RPE pathology, focusing
on control and cells with AMD genetic risk factors, assaying complement activation and deposit formation.
Second, both diagnosis and monitoring of efficacy of treatment would benefit from in vivo tools to monitor
complement activation. We have developed tools (antibodies and nanobodies) as well as fluorescence
quenched C3 convertase-specific substrate for monitoring of complement activation in tissues and ocular
fluids, which will be tested in animals and iPSC-RPE cultures. Overall, this work is designed to move anti-
complement therapy towards clinical application, with the long-term goal of developing a treatment to re-
duce the number of AMD cases and improve veteran care and quality of life."
11057743,"Reproduction is a tightly regulated function of an organism that is crucial to the perpetuation of a species. The
pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), play an essential role
in the reproductive process to control fertility by directing steroidogenesis and gametogenesis. Befitting their
important roles in endocrine physiology, the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH are under complex
regulation by hypothalamic neuropeptide inputs (most notably gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH) and
gonadal sex steroid and peptide hormones. The precisely coordinated integration of these signals leads to
appropriate LH and FSH subunit gene expression, protein synthesis, and secretion to promote sexual
maturation and control normal reproductive function.
With the support of this R01 award, we have identified molecular and cellular mechanisms and pathways by
which these factors control gonadotropin gene expression and secretion. We have identified signaling
pathways, transcription factors, and cis-regulatory elements by which varying patterns of pulsatile GnRH
differentially regulate LH and FSH subunit gene expression using cellular, animal and human models. The
overarching goal of this project is to delineate the mechanisms and pathways underlying the carefully
orchestrated control of LH and FSH release to allow for reproductive integrity and fertility. We hypothesize
that these cellular factors modulate the pathways by which varying GnRH pulse frequencies regulate
gonadotropin subunit gene expression to contribute to appropriate regulation of gonadal function, cyclicity and
fertility in vivo. Over the next five years, we propose to: (1) generate new mouse models to further translate
our cellular studies into the in vivo context; (2) extend our studies of the downstream mechanisms by which
the pulsatile GnRH signal is decoded to investigate the role of the Nr4a1 nuclear receptor family we have
identified to be highly differentially regulated by varying frequencies of pulsatile GnRH; and (3) test the
hypothesis that GnRHR couples differentially to G
Î±
s and G
Î±
q/11 depending on GnRHR numbers, serving as the
gonadotrope GnRH pulse frequency decoder to result in subsequent differential regulation of LH and FSH.
We are in a unique position to take advantage of our perifusion system combined with our molecular and
cellular biology expertise in parallel with our experience in mouse genetics and physiology to successfully
perform the proposed studies. The successful completion of these aims is expected to provide insight into the
mechanisms by which gonadotropes decode GnRH pulse frequency to differentially regulate LH and FSH,
critical for physiologic control of reproduction and fertility. The elucidation of these pathways will generate new
potential therapeutic targets for treatment of infertility, precocious or delayed puberty, hypothalamic
amenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The results obtained from this research will therefore have a
significant impact on the field of reproductive medicine."
10850006,"âPhosphorylation of Î±/Î²-Tubulin is a âToggle Switchâ in Human Breast Cancer
The Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimer is the building block of microtubules (MTs) which comprise an
essential component of the cell cytoskeleton. MTs undergo growth/shrinkage episodes as
dictated by whether GTP is bound to Î²-tubulin (Î²:GTP) (assembly) or is hydrolyzed to GDP
(disassembly). Protein kinase C (PKC) is a key signaling enzyme that controls these MT events
in human breast cells. In this regard, PKC phosphorylates Î±-tubulin at Ser165 (Î±:Ser165) resulting
in persistent MT elongation and breast cell motility while proliferation is suppressed. Molecular
dynamics simulations and validating experiments showed that phosphorylation of Î±:Ser165
misaligns the catalytic residue Glu254 in Î±-tubulin (Î±:Glu254) with its substrate Î²:GTP, leading to
diminished hydrolysis of Î²:GTP, thereby increasing GTP caps and causing persistent MT
elongation. Î²-tubulin undergoes phosphorylation at Ser172 by cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (cdk-1)
which promotes proliferation, a process that requires Î±/Î²-tubulin to form spindle fibers during
cell division. Thus, PKC and cdk1 produce opposing effects on microtubule structure, GTP
binding/hydrolysis, and cell proliferation. By alternating the phosphorylation states of Î±â and Î²-
tubulin in microtubules using phospho-mimetic mutants, a âtoggle switchâ model will be
explored as a novel decision point that governs cancer-related phenotypes. This model will be
rigorously tested by co-expression of site-directed mutants of Î±-tubulin (S165D or control S165N)
and Î²-tubulin (S172D or control S172N) in human breast cells. By use of these constructs,
proliferation and motility as well as EMT markers (E- vs. N-cadherin) will be evaluated.
Molecular dynamics simulations will be used to screen the alignment of Î±:Glu254 with Î²:GTP
both in the Î±/Î²-tubulin mutant constructs and in those mutants to be identified in tumor genomic
databases; their significance will be verified experimentally by the presence of GTP caps and cell
phenotypes (proliferation, motility). In vivo support for the Î±/Î²-tubulin toggle switch will be
sought in an orthotopic animal model with highly aggressive breast cells to evaluate: 1) the
impact of phospho-mimetic mutant constructs of Î±/Î²-tubulin, and 2) the efficacy of small
molecule inhibitors of PKC and cdk1. The purpose of these studies is to establish a novel framework for
assessing metastatic potential and to explore improved strategies for breast cancer chemotherapy."
10857158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that severely impairs quality of life
and is characterized by disfiguring scarring, hair loss, itching, and pain. It is estimated that DLE affects nearly
225,000 US persons and disproportionally affects woman of color. There are no FDA-approved treatments and
current off-label therapies are often ineffective for many patients. Emerging targeted therapies for DLE are in
early clinical development, but we lack understanding of the full spectrum of pathogenic immune cells and
cytokines that could be therapeutically targeted. Evidence suggests that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)
are a key driver of DLE and trials are starting to target pDCs for DLE therapy. Our previous work demonstrated
that immune inhibitory receptor V-domainIg suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA)inhibits DLE development
in the murine MRL/lpr lupus model. VISTA is a unique immune inhibitory receptor as it is expressed on T cells
and myeloid cell subsets. We showed that mice lacking VISTA spontaneously develop DLE-like disease and
that stimulation of VISTA reduces production of type I interferons by pDCs in MRL/lpr lupus mice. We also
found that skin biopsies from human DLE express high levels of VISTA when compared to other autoimmune
skin diseases. However, not much else is known about the role of VISTA in DLE or the function of VISTA on
pDCs. The goal of this proposal is to determine if pDCs are critical for DLE development in VISTA knockout
mice, the human DLE express VISTA, the transcriptional profile of VISTA+ pDCs in human DLE and. In Aim 1,
we will identify which immune cells subsets within human DLE express VISTA, their cellular connections,
VISTA receptor-ligand pairing and determine the transcriptional profile of VISTA+ cells by performing highly
multiplexed single cell imaging and spatial transcriptomics. In Aim 2, we will determine the critical cells involved
in DLE development in conditional VISTA knockout mice and the mechanism of pDC inhibition by VISTA using
an agonist VISTA antibody. The Principal Investigator, Matthew Vesely MD, PhD, is a dermatologist and
immunologist at Yale School of Medicine. His goal is to lead an independent academic research lab studying
the immunopathogenesis of autoimmune skin diseases such as DLE. He will pursue this goal by 1) developing
expertise in the generation and analysis of spatial proteomics and in situ transcriptomic data; 2) becoming an
expert in immune cell inhibition by VISTA; 3) establishing a community of mentors and collaborators in DLE
and single cell imaging technologies; 4) completing coursework to expand his computational and statistical
background. These mentors and his career development plan will help him acquire the skills and expertise
needed to develop his own distinct niche in immune inhibition of autoimmune skin diseases, become an expert
in single-cell imaging, and potentially develop new therapies for these diseases."
10857163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adult Granulosa Cell Tumors (aGCTs) account for about 1 in 20 ovarian cancers, forming from the hormonally
active follicle resident cells responsible for ovulation. AGCTs are treated with debulking surgery, with the
possibility of pelvic radiation. There is no standard systemic chemotherapy. Recurrence frequently comes a
decade after diagnosis, with treatment left to the discretion of the attending oncologist. FOXL2 is an
evolutionarily conserved member of the forkhead transcription factor family and is essential for gonadal
development. More than 100 compromising mutations in the FOXL2 gene promote ovarian dysfunction and
craniofacial misdevelopment. In striking contrast, a single somatic mutation, FOXL2C134W, occurs nearly
universally in aGCTs, as examined across more than 400 patients of various ethnicities. We show that this
FOXL2 gene, which is uniquely found in granulosa cell tumors, is active and potent. However, the molecular
basis underlying the oncogenic effect of FOXL2C134W remains unclear, and nothing is known about the role of the
mutation in vivo. Patients present with aGCTs at or just past menopause, suggesting an initiating circumstance
that fosters tumor development. They are commonly treated with surgery and with the same chemotherapy
offered to other unrelated types of ovarian cancer. Patients who present with advanced disease, or who recur,
do poorly. An increased understanding of aGCT may provide insights for the treatment of these women. This
proposal, submitted by two collaborating PIs who are experts in studying ovarian endocrine function (Shimasaki)
and tumor formation and progression (Stupack), consists of two complementary aims to understand the role of
FOXL2C134W in tumorigenesis. Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of in situ expression of FOXL2C134W or FOXL2C130W
(the mouse equivalent) on GC function within intact and accessible follicles ex vivo using isolated mouse follicle
organoid cultures. In Aim 2, we will directly test the sufficiency of FOXL2C134W expression for tumorigenesis, via
expression of this gene selectively GCs at an adult stage of live mice. If so, this would be the first model to
directly prove causality of this mutation and should offer new opportunities for intervention."

with multiple deleterious consequences, many of which are known features of a number of diseases, such as
loss of progenitor cells, cellular senescence, secretion of molecules that activate fibroblasts, altered gene
expression, fibrosis, organ failure, and death. Critically short telomeres also drive further telomere shortening in
a vicious cycle. By targeting TERT mRNA to PCs, we can extend the regenerative capacity of these cells,
mitigating this vicious cycle and extending the healthspan. There is an unmet medical need for vehicles to deliver
therapeutic mRNA to PCs, the primary cells of regenerative medicine. PC-targeting vehicles could deliver mRNA
encoding any gene to PCs, fostering a new era of regenerative medicine. RTI has achieved a breakthrough in
mRNA delivery with the development of a novel, broadly-transfecting (BT)-LNP formulation. BT-LNPs have been
shown to transfect 16 tissues in non-human primates (NHPs), making them the only LNPs capable of transfecting
such a broad range of tissues to our knowledge. BT-LNPs are also well-tolerated in multiple species including
NHPs. RTIâs BT-LNP formulation can serve as a âbase LNPâ for targeting ligand attachment, conferring additional
cell type-specificity. By combining this with our TERT mRNA, which has shown highly successful rescue in
mouse models of both pulmonary and liver fibrosis, we seek to extend the regenerative capacity of various PC
types, addressing multiple disease indications. In this Phase I project, RTI will add PC targeting capability to our
BT-LNPs using the following approach: 1) Generate a library of rationally designed peptides targeting three PC
types. 2) Utilize a computational structural biology pipeline to screen candidate peptide targeting ligands in silico.
3) Add the candidate targeting ligands to our broadly-transfecting base vehicle BT-LNPs. 4) Perform an efficient,
sensitive in vivo screen to quantify the ability of each candidate LNP to transfect each of the 3 PC types. This
Phase I project will produce highly efficient, well-tolerated vehicles for in vivo delivery of mRNA to three PC
types, as well as a platform for efficient development of additional vehicles. This will both advance our novel
telomere extension biologic for multiple indications and allow us to pursue out-licensing for the CVs to potential
pharma and biotech partners."
10830084,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is often effectively treated with FDA-approved first-line therapies such as
imatinib and avapritinib. However, this strategy is ineffective in a particular subset of GIST patientsâthose with
a GIST caused by inherited loss-of-function mutations or sporadic epigenetic silencing of genes encoding the
succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex. These SDH-deficient (SDH-def) GISTs exhibit quite variable biology,
ranging from indolent tumors to rapidly progressive disease that quickly leads to death, often among adolescents
and young adults. We recently reported that treatment of SDH-def GISTs with temozolomide (TMZ) resulted in
favorable responses in a small patient cohort, and these findings led to a multicenter phase II trial to investigate
the efficacy of TMZ in SDH-def GIST patients. We also developed the first and only patient-derived SDH-def
GIST cell culture biorepository, which we utilized to discover that TMZ induces expression of death receptor 5
(DR5), a TRAIL receptor. Inhibrx Inc. in La Jolla, CA has developed an entirely new therapeutic agonist that
binds to DR5 receptors, and collaboratively, we have used these together with TMZ to initiate apoptosis and
reduce cell viability in vitro. This initial finding, together with major new preliminary data we now present, suggests
that a synergistic strategy, combining DR5 agonism with TMZ, may lead to more effective treatment outcomes
for SDH-def GIST patients, and thus address this unmet medical need. The overall objective of this proposed
U01 is to unite NIH intramural and extramural SDH-def GIST clinicians and researchers with expertise in adult
and pediatric medical oncology, surgical oncology, basic and translational science, patient advocates, and an
industry partner to address two long-term goals: (1) to accurately distinguish SDH-def GIST patients who will
have indolent biology from those who will have aggressive biology; and (2) to identify and test safe, effective
therapeutic strategies for treating SDH-def GIST patients, especially those with more aggressive forms of this
cancer who will otherwise die. Supported by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SDH-def GISTs possess
underappreciated tumor heterogeneity and hence correspondingly complex biology that will require combination
therapies to achieve disease control. By accomplishing our aims, we will better understand the biology of these
tumors and identify an improved treatment strategy for this disease. We propose to leverage our existing National
Succinate Dehydrogenase-Deficient GIST Translational Research and Clinical Trial Consortium along with
unique NIH Clinical Center resources to: (1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of TMZ with INBRX-109 (a potent
DR5 agonist) among patients with progressive SDH-def GIST in a Phase I/II clinical trial; (2) create a centralized
biobank of well-annotated SDH-def GISTs; (3) develop a network of research laboratories to develop improved
preclinical models to investigate diverse SDH-def GIST biology; and (4) develop clinical tools to predict SDH-
def GIST prognosis. Our project has the potential for immediate clinical impact to manage and treat SDH-def
GIST patients, and will provide much-needed near-term hope for these patients, their families, and caregivers."

10839788,"Project Summary: Yale ADRC Imaging Core
The Yale Alzheimer Disease Research Center has the overall goal to advance understanding and treatment of
Alzheimerâs disease (AD). This effort requires integration of a wide array of core functions, including Clinical,
Neuropathology, and Neuroimaging. Human imaging studies allow for the development of imaging biomarkers
of AD, characterization of the temporal sequence of AD pathology, and lead to better assignment of patients to
clinical research studies and clinical trials. Imaging is a major strength at Yale, as exemplified by the breadth
and depth offered by the Yale PET Center and the Yale Magnetic Resonance Research Center (MRRC). In the
PET Center, an example of recent significant work is the introduction of PET synaptic imaging with the SV2A
tracer 11C-UCB-J. In MRI, the Yale MRRC has generated numerous novel methods to characterize an
individualâs functional connectome and relate the functional organization to behavior and clinical variables
Overall, these two Centers develop cutting edge imaging technologies and apply these techniques to answer
important clinical questions. By creating this Yale ADRC Imaging Core (YAIC), we leverage the vast
experience of Yaleâs imaging strengths to provide state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis of imaging data and
to focus on the development of novel approaches to AD. The YAIC will provide a common infrastructure for
acquisition, processing, and analysis of multimodal imaging data, to support and train AD investigators and
develop the next generation of imaging tools. The current and future methods will be applied to ongoing
imaging studies to acquire a rich, multi-faceted and multi-modality dataset in human subjects. In addition, the
translational component of this program examines the utility of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as a model for
human AD. The Imaging Core will perform the following specific aims: Aim 1: To develop and optimize PET
image and data analysis strategies to facilitate within- and between-subject comparisons. Multi-tracer within-
subject correlations are important, involving amyloid, tau, synaptic density, and glucose metabolism. Aim 2: To
enhance our MR-based functional connectome modeling to better functionally phenotype patients and link
brain to behavior. This approach provides a functional profile for each individual while localizing the networks
and revealing the network organizing principles supporting these functions. Aim 3: To develop and enrich multi-
modality analyses between PET and fMRI for within- and between-subject studies. The combination of fMRI-
based connectivity with the regional patterns of neurodegeneration measurable with PET provides an ideal
opportunity for understanding the pathways of disease progression. Aim 4: To extend the methodologies
developed for human analysis to NHP data. Ongoing studies in aged NHPs are being performed, providing the
opportunity to compare in vivo PET and MR imaging with post-mortem measures provided by the
Neuropathology Core."

10839786,"Increasing diversity coupled with a growing concern over persistent health inequities in the U.S. requires
nurse scientists to pay closer attention to factors operating at the social/environmental, behavioral/
psychological, and biological levels while harnessing big data and evidence-based practices through an equity
lens. In particular, participatory research that builds on strengths and resources within the community is a
transformative implementation research paradigm by bridging the gap between science and practice through
meaningful stakeholder engagement and social action to promote health equity. This T32 application is
requesting 5 years of funding to support a predoctoral research training program that aims to prepare nurse
scientists to lead rigorous, innovative research that drives improvements in health equity in disadvantaged
populations across the life course. Building on the Commission on Social Determinants of Health framework
and population health equity framework, trainees will engage in a series of structured curriculum and mentored
research experiences to focus their research skill development in the following four thematic cores: stakeholder
engagement methods, biologic and social measurement, data science, and intervention and implementation
science. These methodologic advancements are crucial to adequately characterize the nature of inequities in
healthcare and to develop more effective and sustainable strategies to promote health equity. We have
assembled an exceptional constellation of program faculty and mentors from the Schools of Nursing, Medicine,
and Public Health who lead interdisciplinary training and health equity research programs that have
significantly enhanced our understanding of health inequities and approaches to health equity in
disadvantaged populations. Their collective health equity research portfolios provide an impressive variety of
resources in a rich interdisciplinary training environment and training opportunities in stakeholder engagement
methods, biological and socio-behavioral measurement, data science, and intervention and implementation
science. The two-year training program will recruit four nurses at the predoctoral level each year. Training a
new generation of interdisciplinary nurse scientists with strong knowledge and skills in stakeholder
engagement, measurement, and methodological approaches will further advance our ability to address the
complex nature of health inequities experienced by disadvantaged populations in the nation."
10839793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a predominantly age-related disorder and is associated with accelerated
cognitive function decline. Despite epidemiological evidence linking mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia with kidney function decline, we still have an incomplete understanding of the factors involved in their
pathogenesis suggesting that there are other unidentified age-related causal risk factors that drive the
development and progression of MCI, dementia, and kidney function decline. Recent data indicates that aging
humans accumulate leukemia associated somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. These mutations
appear to provide a competitive growth advantage to the mutant cells, allowing progressive clonal expansion
which has been defined as clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and it is characterized by worsening chronic systemic
inflammation. CH is associated with several pathological conditions including cardiovascular disease, however,
its association with cognitive and kidney endpoints has not been explored. In addition, the underlying
mechanisms driving CH remain to be determined. Hence, our primary objective is to establish an association
between CH with MCI, dementia, and kidney disease progression. Given the interplay between CH and aging
related changes in the bone marrow (BM) fat microenvironment, a key secondary goal of this application is to
determine the role of BM fat in the evolution of CH. We will also examine blood metabolite signatures
associated with higher risk for clinically meaningful cognitive and CKD endpoints and higher BM fat content.
Our preliminary data demonstrated a significant occurrence of CH in patients with CKD. Also, we have shown
that BM adipocytes produce a local inflammatory signature including increased interleukin-6 that promotes CH.
These findings provide a strong premise for our hypothesis that CH associates with MCI, dementia and CKD,
and that BM fat plays a significant role in CH development. We will leverage the unique resources of the
Systolic blood Pressure Interventional Trial (SPRINT), including longitudinal data on assessment of cognitive
function and CKD, biospecimens, and DNA enabling assessment of CH. In a subset of 6,000 SPRINT
participants aged 50 or older with normal kidney function at baseline, we will determine CH at baseline using
our targeted sequencing panel and analytic pipeline for somatic mutation calling and assess whether CH
identifies those at highest risk for cognitive and kidney function impairment. We propose 3 aims; Aim 1: To
evaluate the prospective associations between CH and metabolomics with incident MCI and dementia events
among SPRINT participants with normal kidney function at baseline. Aim 2: To evaluate the prospective
associations between CH and metabolomics with kidney disease progression events among SPRINT
participants with normal kidney function at baseline. Aim 3: To define a link between BM fat and clonal
hematopoiesis in CKD. Understanding the disease related risk factors associated with CH and the related
mechanisms may uncover new ways to reduce the burden of MCI, dementia and kidney disease progression."
10849786,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
My lab is focused on the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of lineage specification. In multicellular
organisms all cells share the same genome, however different cell types acquire distinct features and perform
specialized functions. During the process of lineage specification, multipotent precursor cells give rise to progeny
cells with specialized, characteristic patterns of gene expression. Perturbations in the process of lineage
specification can result in human disorders, such as malignancies and developmental syndromes. Thus, by
uncovering the fundamental principles that ensure robust coordination of cell fate progression we can learn how
to better address diseases wherein that coordination is compromised. Lineage-specifying transcription factors
drive cell-specific gene expression programs, but their access to the DNA is finely tuned by epigenetic machinery
that regulate DNA methylation and histone modifications. Importantly, lineage-specifying transcription factors
cannot bind to methylated cytosines in DNA. A fundamental step in the establishment of cell fate is the unmasking
of specific transcription factor binding sites by targeted removal of methylated cytosines. This process is tightly
regulated by the Ten Eleven Translocation (TET) family of proteins that share a catalytic domain and can oxidize
5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and other oxidized cytosines. Each
modified cytosine is a stable epigenetic mark that can be preferentially recognized by transcription factors. In a
given cell type there can be simultaneous expression of at least two of the three TET family members. Though
the function of each protein is obscure, our previous research revealed an instrumental role of TET proteins in
fine-tuning the expression of lineage specification factors and ensuring proper cell-maturation, by tight control of
cell proliferation. We hypothesize that TET proteins act in concert with largely unknown, cell-specific, factors that
mediate their recruitment to the DNA. In progenitor cells, these pioneer factors anchor TET proteins to specific
loci. Then TET proteins initiate the process of 5mC oxidization, allowing for orchestrated recruitment of lineage
specifying transcription factors. The overarching mission of our research is to decipher the TET mediated
mechanisms that regulate cell lineage choice and specification. We will utilize genomic, genetic and biochemical
approaches to investigate changes in modified cytosine (5hmC), chromatin accessibility, and gene expression
to: 1) dissect the shared versus the distinct functions of TET proteins; 2) determine whether TET proteins function
through canonical, catalytic-dependent activities or have additional, unexpected, catalytic-independent
mechanisms; 3) identify the factors that can interact with TET proteins in sequential snapshots of lineage
specification. Upon completion of our work, we will elucidate the precise and multifaceted mechanisms by which
TET proteins influence lineage specification and affect human disorders."

This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jennifer Smith, an Assistant Adjunct
Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF). Dr. Smith's career goal is to become an independent researcher with combined expertise in parasite
genotyping and human network analyses to optimize interventions for infectious disease elimination. To
support her career development, this application proposes a study that leverages data collected as part of
ongoing research in malaria high-risk populations and uses novel genetic and social network analyses to
address an urgent challenge preventing achievement of malaria elimination targets. As malaria transmission
declines, an increasingly large proportion of the parasite reservoir is clustered in specific sub-populations with
high exposure to infection and who often face significant barriers to accessing and utilizing malaria
interventions. While normative bodies like the World Health Organization recommend a targeted response in
known malaria high-risk populations, there is limited evidence on the extent to which these populations drive
transmission, the impact of targeted interventions or how to optimize coverage. Through cross-sectional and
temporal analysis of genetic and social network data collected as part of an existing, separately funded
population-based evaluation of targeted malaria interventions in high-risk populations, this K01 proposes to
investigate genetic connectivity between infections in migrant and resident populations and the role social
networks play in uptake of malaria interventions. The specific aims are to (1) quantify parasite genetic
connectivity and transmission potential within and between migrant and resident populations at different time
points and spatial scales, (2) evaluate the influence of social network attributes on uptake of malaria prevention
measures, and (3) model transmission networks and estimate the impact of alternative intervention strategies
in migrant and resident agricultural workers. This study will provide crucial knowledge on how malaria high-risk
populations contribute to transmission dynamics, inform how social networks can be leveraged to improve
intervention uptake, and quantify the impact of targeted interventions on overall transmission. The proposed
research will build on Dr. Smith's foundation in epidemiologic methods and include a 5-year training plan
including mentorship from leaders in genetic and malaria epidemiology, social network analysis and
mathematical modelling at UCSF, University of Southern California and UC Berkeley. Dr. Smith's training goals
are to (1) gain knowledge in malaria genetic epidemiology and applied analytic approaches for genetic data, (2)
develop expertise in advanced social network theory and analytic methods, and (3) obtain training in
mathematical modelling. The findings will be used as a foundation for an R01 to implement and evaluate
network-based interventions among malaria high-risk populations in northern Namibia."
10853578,"Faster recovery, reduced hospital stays, and a quicker return to normal activities are the most evident advantages of
laparoscopic surgery. More than 13 million laparoscopic procedures are performed every year. Laparoscopic surgery has
become the technique of choice for virtually every kind of abdominal surgery. Robotâassisted laparoscopic radical
prostatectomy is the most common surgical approach performed for prostate cancer. However, the current oncological
outcome (undetectable prostateâspecific antigen with no evidence of cancer recurrence) and functional outcome
(recovery of continence and erectile function) are only achieved in 62â70% of prostate cancer patients. Unfortunately,
the endoscope used in current laparoscopic robotic surgery does not allow for the intraoperative assessment of tissue to
determine if residual tumors remain. Because of positive tumor margin, cancer recurrence inevitably leads to the need
for further treatments which are expensive as well as morbid. Though fluorescence imaging via indocyanine green has
provided insights into tissue perfusion and improved tissue contrast during laparoscopic surgery, its drawbacks include a
short halfâlife in the bloodstream and the requirement for contrast agent injection. As a result, there is an unmet need to
develop labelâfree imaging techniques that can detect cancerous tissue in real time during laparoscopic robotic surgery.
The objective of the proposed research is to develop a labelâfree hyperspectral laparoscopic stereo imaging system for
robotic surgery. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides not only highâresolution spatial images but also spectral data at each
pixel. Both spectral and spatial information can be used to identify various types of tissues including malignant tumors.
This research is based on the success of using our largeâsize HSI system in both fresh surgical specimens of human tissue
and in vivo animals. With our advanced machine learning methods, we achieved a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of
97.1% for cancer detection in fresh surgical tissue specimens of more than 200 human patients. However, current HSI
systems are too bulky and their image acquisition speed is too slow for intraoperative use. In this project, we propose to
integrate realâtime snapshot HSI cameras with a 3D stereo endoscope and test the system in the prostates of 93 human
patients (Aim 1). We will develop and evaluate advanced deep learning algorithms to automatically detect malignant
tissues on hyperspectral images (Aim 2). We will integrate our hyperspectral endoscopic stereo imaging system with a da
Vinci robot from Intuitive Surgical and perform robotâassisted laparoscopic surgery in a preclinical study (Aim 3). The new
capabilities of the proposed hyperspectral laparoscopic imaging system include: i) the capability to differentiate malignant
from benign tissue during surgery and ii) the capability to map tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), nearâinfrared perfusion
index (NIRâPI), organ hemoglobin index (OHI), and tissue water index (TWI). In this research, the utilization of quantitative
hyperspectral imaging for robotâassisted laparoscopic surgery represents a major innovation in minimally invasive surgery.
The academicâindustrial partnership among UT Southwestern, UT Dallas, and Intuitive Surgical will work in a strategic
alliance and utilize unique resources at each site to ensure the translation of the hyperspectral laparoscopic stereo imaging
technique to the commercial da Vinci robot for broad applications and improved surgical outcomes."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disease in the armed forces, and it has been estimated
that 10-20% of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) Veterans have
suffered a TBI, with many having symptoms suggestive of the residual effects of mild TBIs (mTBIs) not recognized
prior to discharge. In recognition of the latent residual effects of repeated exposures to blast, one of which may be
mTBI, The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act includes a provision mandating documentation of blast exposure
during both training and combat to inform future risk mitigation. The focus of the proposed study is to investigate the
effects of exposures to blast and related symptomology incurred during operational training. In collaboration with DoD
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) investigators, we have obtained a critical mass of anonymized
blood samples from military and law enforcement personnel from operational blast training courses, which will allow
us to perform systematic DNA methylation and transcriptional studies. We have 2387 biological sample specimens
along with demographic, symptom, and blast sensor data from both breaching and large caliber rifle protocols
reflecting the exposures incurred by Veterans who because of their specific military occupational specialty (MOS)
have repeated occupational overpressure exposure (ROPE), resulting in increased susceptibility to mTBI and
associated symptoms. The overarching goal of this study is to link transcriptional regulatory perturbations associated
with cumulative exposure to blast to chronic co-occurring physiological and psychological symptoms. Converging
evidence in the field and from our own research has revealed molecular perturbations associated with ROPE.
Specifically, we have shown blast associated alterations in DNA methylation (a highly stable epigenetic mark) in
genes involved in sleep and circadian functioning, motivating our in-depth phenotyping of sleep disturbance in
Veterans with ROPE in the proposed study. Here we will pursue the following aims: 1) Identify DNA methylation
perturbations associated with cumulative occupational exposure to blast in ongoing cohorts; 2) Identify DNA
methylation patterns that track with ROPE and associated physiological and psychological symptoms in ongoing
cohorts; and 3) Identify altered DNA methylation patterns associated with cumulative blast in Veterans with MOS
exposed to occupational blast newly recruited for this study. DNA methylation and transcriptional patterns in loci
identified in the first 2 aims will be investigated in Veterans recruited with MOS involving varying durations and
spectrum of exposures to occupational blast to determine whether these loci are also associated with cumulative
blast and related clinical symptoms including sleep disturbance, with comorbid mTBI, PTSD and/or Major
Depressive Disorder in these Veterans This will allow us to causally link blast-induced molecular changes via
DNA methylation alterations that persist long-term in our Veterans who suffer from the chronic effects of blast.
This study will lead to discovery of DNA methylation risk markers that may aid in identification of Veterans at risk
before debilitating symptoms of ROPE can emerge, potentially allowing us to intervene clinically."
10840939,"Project Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 44 million people
worldwide. While more than 95% of AD cases are late-onset AD (LOAD), the exact pathogenic mechanism of
LOAD remains unclear. As AD is a highly heritable disease, identifying risk variants associated with LOAD will
be critical for understanding the pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic targets for AD. The overarching goal
of this study is to determine if a partial loss of function mutation in CAPICUA (CIC), a gene in which complete
loss of function causes intellectual disability, can contribute to AD. CIC encodes a transcriptional repressor that
forms a co-repressor complex with Ataxin1 (ATXN1), or its paralog, Ataxn1-like (ATXN1L). Interaction with both
is critical for CIC protein stability. While the ATXN1/1L-CIC complex is essential in survival, heterozygous loss of
CIC by severe truncating mutations in patients cause intellectual disability. Additionally, we recently found
impaired ATXN1-CIC function to be implicated in AD pathology. When we knock out ATXN1 in mice, it leads to
>50% reduction of CIC protein due to the decreased stability and activates a transcriptional cascade that
increases ï¢âsecretase (BACE1), a key enzyme in generating pathogenic amyloid beta (Aï¢) species. This
ultimately leads to accelerated AD pathology. The link between loss of ATXN1-CIC complex function and increase
in BACE1 mediated AD pathology led to the overall hypothesis that mutations in CIC that lead to a partial loss of
the ATXN1-CIC complex function will potentiate AD pathology. We identified a rare heterozygous missense
variant, CICP36L, which appeared only in the LOAD patients but not in the controls. CICP36L is located within a
highly conserved ATXN1 binding domain. To determine this mutationâs effect on ATXN1-CIC interaction, I
expressed tagged CICP36L in cells, performed co-immunoprecipitation, and found that the interaction of CICP36L
with ATXN1 is reduced by ~60% compared to CICWT. This suggests that CICP36L could lead to decreased CIC
stability and reduced ATXN1-CIC complex function. Therefore, I hypothesize that the CICP36L variant leads to
a partial loss of function of the ATXN1-CIC complex and potentiates AD pathology via upregulation of
BACE1. To understand the functional consequence in a physiologically relevant system, I generated CicP36L
knock-in mice using CRISPR/Cas9 and demonstrated that CICP36L reduces CIC stability in P0 brain lysate,
supporting the hypothesis that CICP36L could lead to a partial loss of ATXN1âCIC complex function. In this
proposal, I will further determine the in vivo functional consequences of the CICP36L variant (Aim1) and determine
the impact of the CICP36L variant on AD pathology (Aim2). At the end of the study, we will determine if CICP36L is
an AD risk variant. This work will highlight the need to search for rare AD-associated variants that genome-wide
association studies could miss and potentially identify a mechanism for how a less severe mutation in a gene
that causes intellectual disability could contribute to AD pathology. Identification of such variants may reveal
previously unknown pathways important in AD pathogenesis and lead to the development of novel therapeutics."

Recent technological breakthroughs have enabled the generation of clinical, environmental, and multi-omics data
at an unprecedented scale, providing a complete proï¬le of the patient for individualized disease diagnosis, prog-
nosis, and treatment. However, the precision medicine approach is yet to realize its potential in most multi-factorial
diseases, for which their highly polygenic nature, as well as phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, complicate the
identiï¬cation of disease-associated cell type-speciï¬c transcriptional mechanisms. A better characterization of this
heterogeneity and an interpretable prediction of individuals at high risk of disease are crucial steps to deliver the
promises of precision medicine. In this context, polygenic risk scores (PRS) are likely to play a crucial role in
precision medicine for disease-risk prediction. However, it has been argued that PRS might accentuate dispari-
ties among non-European ancestries and have low stability at individual-level predictions, probably due to greater
underlying complexity in disease etiology that is not captured in a single score. Current efforts to mitigate health
disparities involve recruiting individuals from different population ancestries. However, if the underlying biological
complexity of disease etiology remains unaccounted, risk stratiï¬cation methods will continue to be limited.
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning methods to advance key computational aspects of precision
medicine. In the ï¬rst aim, an unsupervised method will be applied across large amounts of genetic studies to
detect gene sets associated with multiple human traits, which will also identify environmental risk factors. In the
second aim, new computational approaches will be developed to learn gene co-expression patterns optimized for
a better understanding of transcriptional mechanisms linked to complex traits and their therapeutical modalities.
This will detect gene modules (i.e., genes with similar expression proï¬les across the same cell types) with complex
gene relationships, and the approach will be validated by predicting known FDA-approved drug-disease links.
Finally, the outcomes of these aims will inform a gene module-based polygenic risk score for accurate and robust
disease-risk stratiï¬cation that will be portable across different population ancestries. Although the methods will
be initially applied to asthma, they are clearly extendable to other common diseases as well.
For the K99 phase of this project, the mentorship team's expertise covers all key areas of precision medicine,
including computational genetics, systems biology, environmental exposure studies, pharmacology, and trans-
lational medicine. Mentors and advisors are directly involved in precision medicine initiatives to enhance both
scientiï¬c discovery and its implementation in clinical care. For the R00 phase and beyond, all the conceptual
and methodological expertise previously learned will prepare the applicant for an independent research career
in computational methods development applied to precision medicine. The Perelman School of Medicine at the
University of Pennsylvania, consistently ranked among the top research medical schools, represents the ideal
environment for this highly collaborative project."

New treatments are desperately needed for opioid use disorder (OUD). Approved medications and available
treatments do not adequately address long-term changes in mood, motivation, and cravings. The prefrontal
cortex (PFC) is involved in persistent OUD symptoms, and preclinical studies indicate the PFC can be targeted
to attenuate opioid-seeking and affective disturbances. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an affordable,
accessible, and portable neurophysiological approach to assess PFC function in the clinic and in rodent
models. Despite these strengths, we currently have a limited understanding of how PFC EEG frequency bands
map onto discrete cell types, electroconductive molecules, and neuromodulatory elements. Delineating these
bidirectional relationships should be instrumental in developing biomarkers for individualized treatments for
OUD and in assessing target engagement for new medications. Towards these goals, this proposal aims to
characterize EEG signatures following maladaptive opioid use and PFC interneuron modulation.
Individuals with OUD, on a population level, display enhanced power in the theta (Î¸) band in frontal areas, but
how this disease signature relates to the function of discrete cell types is not known. At the cellular level,
inhibitory neurons (INs) comprise only 20% of PFC neurons, but extraordinary connectivity and specializations
enable INs to govern PFC circuit function and oscillatory activities. The two predominant IN subtypes in deep
layers of PFC exhibit mutually exclusive expression of parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST), and
optogenetic studies have revealed that these cell types differentially guide PFC oscillatory activities. Our goal
is to define how neural activity within PV-INs and SST-INs contributes to PFC EEG signatures, through
combination fiber photometry calcium imaging and quantitative EEG. In parallel, we will assess how EEG
signatures and IN function are altered by chronic opioid use by using a long-access vapor fentanyl self-
administration model. Finally, we will scrutinize underlying physiological mechanisms using whole cell
electrophysiology and assess their contribution to fentanyl-seeking and abstinence-associated affective
disturbances in behavioral studies. Our goals are:
Aim 1: Test that individual differences in Î¸ power and PFC IN physiology correlate with fentanyl self-
administration and affective disturbances in abstinence.
Aim 2: Test that PFC PV-INs and SST-INs bidirectionally modulate Î¸ power following opioid use.
Aim 3: Test that PFC PV-INs and SST-INs regulate opioid use behaviors and affective disturbances.
Together, the results of these comprehensive studies will improve our understanding of how several cell type-
specific signaling pathways regulate PFC circuit function and behavioral changes related to OUD. We expect
these findings will lay the foundation for the development of next-generation treatments for OUD."
10840169,"Recent studies have shown that RNAs are invariably bound to and often modified by RNA-binding proteins
(RBPs). Thus, it is no surprise that RBPs have been found to play key roles in regulating many aspects of coding
and non-coding RNA biology, including RNA processing, nuclear export, cellular transport, function, localization,
and stability. These efforts are carried out by >1,500 unique RBPs that utilize a variety of RNA-binding domains
to achieve oftentimes specific and high affinity interactions with target transcripts; however, non-canonical RBPs
have also been identified. Disruption of this complex network of RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) has been
implicated in a number of human diseases. Thus, the targeting of RBPs and RPIs has arisen as a new frontier
in RNA-targeted drug discovery. Recent work from our laboratory has resulted in the development of tools and
technologies applicable to the study of RPIs, including biochemical and cellular assays for the detection,
validation, and screening of RPIs; the discovery of small molecule, peptide, and natural product inhibitors of RPIs
and RBPs; and the discovery of new biological insights into the regulation of RPIs and RBPs. Building upon our
recent progress, the research proposed in this project is focused on three major research directions. For the first
project, we will continue our efforts to develop our laboratoryâs live-cell RPI assay technology, RNA interaction
with Protein-mediated Complementation Assay (RiPCA), as a scalable and robust platform for validating and
manipulating cellular RPIs. For the second project, we will utilize RiPCA to expand our access to high-quality
chemical probes for targeting cellular RPIs. For the third project, we will use mechanistically distinct chemical
probes targeting eIF4E to explore the context-dependence of RBP regulation and activity. Through these
combined research efforts, we will enable the study of RBPs and RPIs in living cells to promote our understanding
of this new frontier of cellular biology with great potential for the development of new medicines."

With the rapid growth of an aging population worldwide, the annual incidences of aging-associated lung diseases
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), are increasing. Therefore, there is a great need to comprehensively
investigate the complex process of lung aging and develop interventions to extend the health span of the elderly
population. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) function as progenitor cells that maintain epithelium
homeostasis and repair the lung after injury. A characteristic of the aging lung is progenitor cell exhaustion and,
in turn, impairs alveolar regeneration. Persistent epithelial cell injury coupled with inadequate alveolar epithelial
repair due to progenitor cell failure results in a prototype of age-associated lung disease, IPF. In fact, it has been
argued that IPF is a disease of premature aging of AEC2s. Hence, studies focusing on re-activating and/or
expanding AEC2 progenitor cells in lung aging are needed.
As we reported, AEC2 progenitor cells are exhausted in human IPF lungs. IPF AEC2s fail to regenerate in
organoid assays relative to normal AEC2s. In our preliminary studies for this application, we found a decrease
in AEC2 renewal capacity and a loss of AEC2 population occur during lung aging. We aimed to uncover the
molecular mechanisms that contribute to impaired AEC2 renewal during aging, with the long-term goal of pointing
the way to novel interventions that can rejuvenate aged AEC2s. We have found that: 1) The renewal capacity of
AEC2s in 18-20 months old aged mouse lungs are reduced just as what we observed with IPF lungs; 2) Using
single cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we identified a deficiency of a specific zinc transporter SLC39A8
(encoding ZIP8) in AEC2s from 18-20 months old aged mouse lungs and IPF lungs; 3) Sirtuin signaling pathway
was downregulated in AEC2s from bleomycin-injured old mouse lungs and IPF lungs; 4) ZIP8 regulates AEC2
progenitor function through SIRT1 and ZIP8/SIRT1 axis is required for AEC2 renewal. In addition, we have
generated a novel mouse model of Zip8 deficiency in AEC2 cells that reveals phenotypes of premature AEC2
aging. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that ZIP8 deficiency occurs in AEC2s with aging and
downregulates SIRT1, thereby impairing AEC2 progenitor cell renewal. Furthermore, we propose that
restoring critical components of the ZIP8/zinc/SIRT1 pathway will improve AEC2 progenitor activity and, thus
maintain lung epithelial integrity and prevent age-associated lung diseases."

While significant progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking among adolescents, the advent of
electronic cigarettes and vaping devices threatens to undo this progress. While e-cigarettes have potential as
harm reduction tools for adult smokers, they have become the most commonly-used tobacco product among
adolescents. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared e-cigarette use among adolescents an
âepidemicâ after observing dramatic increases in usage among this population since 2017. Evidence-based
health communication approaches can strengthen young peopleâs commitment to avoid vaping, and thus
prevent e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction. However, little research exists to provide a basis for effective
communication efforts for e-cigarette prevention. We propose 3 Aims to significantly advance the science of
how to communicate about e-cigarettes in ways that prevent use. For Aim 1, we will identify promising ways to
communicate with adolescents to prevent e-cigarette use. We will achieve this by: 1) identifying promising
prevention message themes (i.e., industry targeting, social norms, addiction) targeted to adolescents (ages 13-
17); 2) vetting these themes with the study team, expert consultants, and a teen advisory panel; and 3)
conducting focus groups to examine adolescentsâ responses to the e-cigarette prevention message themes.
For Aim 2, we will develop a set of e-cigarette prevention messages that reduce adolescentsâ inclination to try
or use e-cigarettes. We will achieve this by: 1) developing 10 e-cigarette prevention messages based on the
chosen theme(s) from Aim 1 and conducting 30 cognitive interviews to refine the messages; and 2) conducting
a nationally representative study to examine the perceived effectiveness of the e-cigarette prevention
messages in discouraging e-cigarette use. Based on the results, we will select 5 messages to carry forward to
Aim 3âs randomized controlled trial (RCT). For Aim 3, we will evaluate whether evidence-based e-cigarette
prevention messages reduce at-risk adolescentsâ willingness to use e-cigarettes (primary outcome) and e-
cigarette use behavior (secondary outcome). We will conduct a 2-arm (intervention, attention control), 3-week
RCT with 506 adolescents, with a 3-month follow up. Study participants will receive daily messages sent to
their mobile phones via text message (i.e., multimedia message service) for 20 days. Other secondary
outcomes are cognitive elaboration, negative affect, e-cigarette beliefs, and social interactions. We will also
examine whether e-cigarette prevention messages have unintended consequences (i.e., increasing willingness
to smoke cigarettes). This research is responsive to funding announcement PAR-18-847, which seeks
population-based, applied prevention research on e-cigarettes among vulnerable populations (e.g., youth). Our
work will address a critical gap in tobacco control research by developing effective communications
that strengthen adolescentsâ commitment to avoid e-cigarettes and reduce e-cigarette use, thereby
informing local, state, and national efforts to prevent e-cigarette use and nicotine addiction among adolescents."
10840956,"ABSTRACT
The goals of this study are to determine the function and mechanism of two non-coding microRNAs in regulating
osteogenesis in vitro and also in vivo in the context of bone repair/disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-
coding epigenetic regulators that target and suppress translation of numerous mRNAs within a given cell type,
resulting in modulation of many pathways and networks. We previously reported on differentially-expressed
miRNAs within the human embryonic growth plate of developing long bones and identified two miRNAs (miR-
181a-1 and miR-138) that were more highly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes compared to progenitor
chondrocytes, suggesting functional roles in regulating chondrogenesis and/or endochondral ossification. We
subsequently found that these miRNAs have opposing roles in regulating osteogenesis in vitro: miR-181a/b-1
(miR-181a-1 and its clustered miRNA, miR-181b-1) enhances while miR-138 inhibits this process. We also found
that miR-181a/b-1 enhances PI3K/AKT signaling and mitochondrial metabolism. New preliminary data suggests
that the mitochondrial enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase 4 (PDK4) is a potential target gene of miR-181a/b-1.
PDK4 functions to inhibit the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) resulting in decreased mitochondrial
metabolism. Thus, suppression of PDK4 by miR-181a/b-1 may partly explain the enhancing effects of this miRNA
cluster on mitochondrial respiration and osteogenesis. In Specific Aim 1, we therefore plan to test if miR-181a/b-
1 suppresses PDK4 directly and/or indirectly via the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway (given that FoxO1 is a known
transcriptional activator of PDK4). We also plan to test if miR-138 has opposing effects on PDK4 expression
since we found that this miRNA suppresses PI3K/AKT signaling as well as pathways associated with oxidative
phosphorylation. This aim will also explore the effects of two PDK4 inhibitor drugs on potentially enhancing
osteogenesis. Utilizing murine models of heterotopic ossification (HO) and bone fracture, we found that miR-138
over-expression suppresses HO formation and non-endochondral bone fracture repair while miR-181a/b-1 over-
expression enhances endochondral bone fracture healing. These findings highlight that the in vitro function of
both miRNAs is translatable in vivo in repair/disease models involving new bone formation. Therefore, Specific
Aims 2 and 3 will investigate the effects of modulating miR-181a/b-1 or miR-138 in vivo to attempt to suppress
HO and enhance fracture healing, respectively. Effects of PDK4 inhibitor drugs will also be tested in the fracture
models depending on findings from Aim 1. Overall, these studies are designed to test our overall hypothesis that
appropriate targeting of miR-181a/b-1 or miR-138 in vivo will modulate bone formation during HO or bone repair
and that these effects are due, in part, to regulation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO1/PDK4 signaling and mitochondrial
metabolism. These studies are important because new mechanistic information will be gained on how these
miRNAs regulate mitochondrial respiration during osteogenesis. In addition the potential therapeutic value of
targeting each miRNA as a means to treat bone fractures or HO will be determined."
10841000,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Unplanned ICU admissions from the acute care floor are common and most often related to the
development of respiratory failure or cardiac dysfunction, with respiratory or circulatory impairment the reason
for ICU admission in over 60% of cases. These admissions are associated with high morbidity and mortality
and are accompanied by other important repercussions for patients and their family members, including
inadequate communication and lower family ratings of care. Unplanned ICU admissions are strong indicators
of adverse events, yet little is known about mechanisms underlying these admissions.
 Prior work has focused on patient characteristics associated with unplanned ICU admissions, including age
and severity of illness, but there is limited evidence examining non-patient factors that also contribute, such as
human (e.g., clinician), organizational, or technical failures. It is critical to understand how these non-patient
factors affect unplanned ICU admissions, because admissions resulting from these factors may be
preventable. It is also imperative to differentiate between non-patient factors (human vs organizational vs
technical) and their associated mechanisms because they call for unique interventions.
 To fill this key knowledge gap, we propose to identify contributing factors and mechanisms for unplanned
ICU admissions and connect these factors and mechanisms to patient- and family-centered outcomes. This
objective will be met by achievement of three specific aims involving a cohort of patients transferred from acute
care to the ICU at an academic medical center, a safety-net hospital, and a community hospital. The first aim
will use root cause analysis to adapt and refine an existing framework for classification of adverse events, the
PRISMA (Prevention and Recovery Information System for Monitoring and Analysis) model. The adapted
PRISMA model will allow us to identify multiple factors â patient, human (e.g., clinician), organizational, and
technical â and associated mechanisms contributing to unplanned ICU admissions. The second aim will
examine associations between factors and mechanisms contributing to unplanned ICU admissions and family
member symptoms of psychological distress, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress. The final aim will compare ICU-free days and costs of care across factors and mechanisms contributing
to unplanned ICU admissions. Our team has extensive research experience with seriously ill patients and their
family members, with expertise in development of interventions to improve patient- and family-centered
outcomes, medical decision making, healthcare systems, and quality and safety. We are well-positioned to
identify factors and mechanisms contributing to unplanned ICU admissions and generate the knowledge
needed to develop interventions with the greatest potential to improve outcomes for patients, family members,
and the healthcare system."

Project Summary/Abstract
The Kansas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a collaborative project
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a state-specific,
population-based, surveillance system of maternal health, behaviors, and experiences during
preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum. Kansas PRAMS provides data to inform a variety of
maternal and child health issues. Two major goals of Kansas PRAMS are to reduce maternal
and infant morbidity and mortality, and reduce low birth weight.
Specific objectives of the Kansas PRAMS study include:
 1. To implement population-based surveillance within Kansas on selected maternal
 behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during, and shortly after pregnancy
 among women with a recent live birth, including emerging issues and post-disaster
 surveillance needs, as they arise.
 2. To ensure data is of high scientific quality and comparable to other jurisdictions by
 following the methodology documented in the CDC PRAMS protocol.
 3. To conduct comprehensive analyses of PRAMS data based on a written state-specific
 analysis plan designed to inform programmatic activities, research, and public health
practice.
 4. To translate and disseminate analytic results into useable information for public health
 action that can guide program development and evaluation, in collaboration with a state-
 level steering committee.
PRAMS contacts new mothers two to three months after delivering a live birth. The sample is
drawn from the Kansas birth certificate file. Mothers from this sample are mailed a survey
questionnaire. If mothers do not respond by mail, phone interviewers attempt to interview them
by phone. Incentives and rewards are used in an effort to maximize participation in the study.
Kansas PRAMS will provide quality, statewide, population-based surveillance data to inform the
Kansas Title V Maternal and Child Health Priorities for the next five years. The data will further
the Kansas Department of Health and Environment's mission to âprotect and improve the health
and environment of all Kansans.â"
10845137,"CORE C: Drug Discovery and Development Core â SUMMARY
The overall goal of this multi-disciplinary, multi-site PPG application is to build a firm foundation of discovery
science in cellular senescence that leads to a pipeline of therapeutic strategies that slow or prevent age-
associated diseases. Each of the three PPG Projects focus on the role of senescent cells in specific age-related
health outcomes: Project 1, Skeletal Fragility (Khosla/Monroe); Project 2, Skeletal Muscle Loss and Dysfunction
(LeBrasseur) and Project 3, Brain aging (Jurk). To establish cause and effect, each project will use genetic and
pharmacologic approaches to ablate senescent cells. In addition, each of these projects will test the efficacy of
senotherapeutic compounds (drugs that induce apoptosis specifically of senescent cells [senolytics] or suppress
markers of senescence, in particular SASP [senomorphics]) in treating their health outcome focus. The
identification and characterization of effective senotherapeutics for different lineages of senescent cells will be
performed by the Drug Discovery and Development Core C (DDDC), working with PIs of each of the three
projects and three additional cores. Importantly, the collaborative published and preliminary data from PPG
members establishes that no single senotherapeutic is effective in all senescent cell types. Thus, it is imperative
to have a centralized Core as part of this PPG to continue to develop and utilize standardized measures of
senescence and senotherapeutic activity to identify the most efficacious drugs or drug combinations. During the
previous funding period, the DDDC identified and optimized multiple types of senotherapeutics including
improved analogs of fisetin, a senolytic natural lipid that induces senescent cell death via ferroptosis, zoledronic
acid and optimized analogs, several natural products including tomatidine and multiple drugs targeting epigenetic
regulators. These drugs were identified and validated in our established workflow of screening for activity in
primary cells or cell lines from multiple species, testing in vivo in a rapid model of accelerated senescence/aging,
followed by testing in naturally aged mice. In addition, we identified multiple miRNAs able to drive or prevent
senescence as well as used bioinformatic analysis of the targets of senescence-associated miRNAs to identify
new senotherapeutic targets. Furthermore, we have used machine learning approaches to identify a novel class
of natural senolytics. Finally, we have collaborated with Dr. Daohong Zhou to test the efficacy of optimized
PROTACs targeting Bcl-2 family members and are co-developing novel PROTACs. Importantly, using
scRNAseq of senescent cells, we have identified subsets of SnCs with differential sensitivity to these senolytics
including differential sensitivity of p16INK4a and p21CIP1-positive SnCs. Thus, the role of the DDDC within this
multi-site PPG is to continue to develop and implement assays for measuring senotherapeutic activity in the
appropriate senescent cell types, including p16INK4a and p21CIP1-positive subsets, in order to identify optimal,
clinically relevant senotherapeutic compounds as needed by the three projects."
10845138,"Core D: PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a key driver of aging and age-related diseases. There are however many
challenges to identifying and characterizing senescent cells in tissues such as the absence of
specific markers, their relative low abundance and vast heterogeneity. Studies conducted during
the first cycle of the PPG revealed the presence of sub-populations of senescent cells in aged
tissues, which can be p21Cip1- and/or p16Ink4a-dependent and exhibit a heterogeneous SASP
profile. In the new cycle of the PPG, our team collectively aims to investigate the impact of
targeting these specific sub-populations of senescent cells using unique animal models we have
developed.
The overall goal of the Senescence Molecular Phenotyping Core (SMPC) (Core D) is to
collaborate closely with the various projects and Cores and apply emerging single-cell
technologies to provide high-resolution molecular, cellular, and spatial characterization of cellular
senescence in different tissues during aging and how it is modified by interventions targeting sub-
populations of senescent cells in situ or systemically. Our research strategy builds on recent
advances in single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics and the recognition of the significant
complexity and heterogeneity in senescent cell phenotypes in different cell-types during aging.
We will apply dissociative methods such as single-cell (Sc) and single-nuclei (Sn) RNA-
sequencing but also spatially resolved multi-plex imaging methods such as CosMx, Imaging Mass
cytometry and CODEX. We will complement these analyses with a variety of established assays
to evaluate senescence-associated markers using RNA-scope, Immuno-FISH, FISH, and
immunofluorescence. Finally, we will work closely together with Core A and utilize cutting-edge
computational tools we developed, to define and analyze the transcriptome and proteome of
senescent cells in diverse tissues, considering their spatial distribution, microenvironment, and
integrating data from various sources."
10845139,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Project 1 (formerly Project 2) builds on the accomplishments of this Project and the Program Project Grant
(PPG) as a whole and addresses a number of key unresolved issues relevant to skeletal aging that are also
applicable across aging tissues and thus best addressed in the framework of a PPG. First, although both p16Ink4a
and p21Cip1 have been identified as key drivers of cellular senescence, the relative contributions of each towards
age-related senescence across tissues in vivo remains unclear. In terms of skeletal aging, we have found that
clearing p16Ink4a+ senescent cells in the INK-ATTAC mouse model using AP20187 prevents age-related bone
loss. With regards to p21Cip1, using single cell proteomic analyses by cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), we
have identified age-related increases not only in p16+ but also in p21+ senescent cells in bone and, using
scRNAseq analyses, we found that p16Ink4a+ and p21Cip1+ cells express substantially different SASP profiles not
only in bone, but also in muscle and brain. Moreover, although genetic models using the ATTAC transgene have
been extremely useful in assessing the effects of senescent cell clearance on different tissues with aging, in Aim
1 we propose to use an alternate approach to ask a fundamentally different question: What are the specific roles
and interactions of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 in leading, in the first place, to the formation and propagation of senescent
cells across tissues? Thus, in Aim 1, we will utilize common PPG mouse models developed in Core B that have
inducible deletions in aged mice of either p16Ink4a or p21Cip1, or both, and evaluate, across bone (Project 1),
muscle (Project 2), and brain (Project 3), the resulting phenotypes and senescent cell burden across these
tissues. Aim 2 complements this genetic approach by using common PPG pharmacologic mouse models that
utilize novel senolytic compounds. These compounds, being developed in Core C, have relative propensities to
target senescence driven either by p16 or p21 and provide a unique opportunity, utilizing the senescent cell
phenotyping in Core D along with the systems biology approaches in Core A, to integrate the findings from Aims
1 and 2 and define, across tissues and using either genetic or pharmacologic tools, the contributions of p16Ink4a
vs. p21Cip1 towards senescence and the SASP across bone, muscle, and brain. Building on the integrative
strengths of the PPG, Aims 3 and 4 examine the interactions between senescent osteocytes and muscle and
brain aging (Aim 3) and interactions between systemic or bone marrow senescent adipocytes and bone, muscle,
and brain aging (Aim 4). In addition to the integration across Projects and Cores, the innovation in the proposed
studies lies in the use of novel mouse models developed by us (p16-LOX-ATTAC, SNORKEL) and others (floxed
p16Ink4a, floxed p21Cip1, bone marrow adipocyte-specific Cre [BMAd-Cre]); novel analytical tools, including the
multiparametric identification of senescent cells in vivo using CyTOF; and the cellular/molecular phenotyping
tools in Core D along with the systems biology approaches in Core A."
10845140,"PROJECT 2 Cellular Senescence and Skeletal Muscle Aging â SUMMARY
 Project 2 (formerly Project 4) has identified the cell populations in skeletal muscle that are prone to senes-
cence with chronological aging, defined their distinguishing traits, and generated compelling evidence for their
contribution to skeletal muscle loss and dysfunction. Our published and new experimental findings, robust ana-
lytical pipeline, and innovative genetic and pharmacological tools strongly position us to now determine the fun-
damental roles of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 in skeletal muscle senescence, define the therapeutic potential of novel
senotherapeutic compounds for age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction, and study the contribution of senescent
cells in inter-tissue communication between skeletal muscle, bone (Project 1), and brain (Project 3). In this
renewal, we will use new systems biology approaches (Core A), innovative genetic models (Core B), next gen-
eration pharmacological strategies (Core C), and advanced molecular phenotyping (Core D) in three comple-
mentary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the contributions of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 to core properties of
the senescence program (e.g., DNA damage response, anti-apoptosis pathway activation, heterogenoussecre-
tory phenotype), and core features of skeletal muscle aging (e.g., loss of mass, strength, and/or function) using
mice that permit inducible deletion of floxed p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, or both at advanced ages. In Aim 2, we will test
novel senotherapeutics designed for the elimination of either p16Ink4a- or p21Cip1-positive senescent cells as well
as a newskeletal-muscle targeting senolytic on the molecular phenotype of skeletal muscle and conserved fea-
tures of skeletal muscle, bone, and brain aging. In Aim 3 we will investigate the effects of genetic and pharma-
cological elimination of senescent cell populations on skeletal muscle adaptation. Here we will use innovative
mouse models that enable targeted elimination of high p16Ink4a-expressing FAPs and high p21Cip1-expressing
myofibers and a new skeletal muscle-targeting senotherapeutic compound and study their influence on skeletal
muscle regeneration in response to acute injury and adaptations of skeletal muscle, bone, and brain in older
mice to progressive exercise training. We expect that successful completion of these aims will advance the the
overall goal of this PPG to build a firm foundation of multidisciplinary discovery science in cellular senescence
that leads to a pipeline of therapeutic strategies that slow or prevent age-associated diseases to drive transla-
tional geroscience forward."
10845141,"PROJECT 3 - The role of Cellular Senescence in brain aging -SUMMARY
This Project investigates the relationship between cellular senescence and brain aging. Cellular senescence is
a well-established driver of tissue and organismal aging, a process partly mediated via a chronic Senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consequently, there is great interest in selectively targeting senescent
cells as a strategy to promote healthy aging.
We have found that senescence-associated markers p21Cip1 and p16Ink4a accumulate in microglia and Blood
Brain Barrier (BBB) endothelial cells of aged mice. Importantly, we showed that clearance of senescent cells,
using both genetic and pharmacological approaches improved cognitive function and neuroinflammation in aged
mice. This led us to hypothesize that senescence in the brain, exacerbates age-related cognitive decline and
contributes to age-related loss of BBB integrity. Importantly, we found that there is little overlap between p21Cip1
and p16Ink4a senescent sub-types in the aged hippocampus and that they have a different SASP profile,
suggesting they may play different physiological roles.
In this Project, innovative transgenic mouse models developed by the PPG, along with advancements in single-
cell molecular phenotyping and systems biology, will be leveraged to thoroughly investigate the heterogeneity of
cellular senescence in the brain and its functional consequences. Collaboration and integration between various
Projects and Cores will enable the exploration of the interplay between senescence in different organs, such as
the brain, bone, and muscle.
To achieve our goals, we will use common PPG mouse models (generated in Core B) to investigate the relative
impact of p16Ink4a vs p21Cip1 in driving age-related cognitive decline. Additionally, the efficacy of novel
senotherapeutic drugs discovered by Core C will be tested to determine their potential to target either p16Ink4a-
driven or p21Cip1-driven senescence across different tissues. Finally, we will use innovative mouse models
developed by the PPG capable of targeting specific senescent cell-types and sub-types in the brain (p16Ink4a vs
p21Cip1), to investigate if in situ clearance of senescent microglia and BBB endothelial cells impacts age-related
cognitive decline. The project will benefit from the expertise of the molecular phenotyping core (Core D) and
computational biology (Core A) to conduct comprehensive analyses of cellular senescence and its heterogeneity
using emerging single-cell multiomics technologies.
Our ultimate goal is to identify new, more targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline during aging."

10840769,"7.1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT -- CORE Project
One of the fundamental challenges to effective implementation of HIV prevention interventions is the
engagement of clients who are eligible for and would benefit most from them. This Core Project is focused on
this critical implementation problem: the need to develop and test novel implementation strategies that increase
engagement, uptake, and sustainment of proven HIV prevention interventions, including rapid testing,
PrEP/PEP, and iART. Based on a review of the research literature and data collected directly from community
members in their EHE high priority jurisdictions, the New York City Health Department (NYC HD) has identified
three core determinants of this HIV prevention implementation problem: (1) clientsâ anticipated and experienced
stigma and discrimination limit acceptability and uptake; (2) providersâ implicit and explicit bias limit offers and
dissemination; and (3) systemic emphasis on siloed services and risk-based eligibility limits access and
availability. In response to this problem, the NYC HD has chosen an implementation strategy called the GOALS
Approach to Sexual Health, which is designed to: a) universalize and normalize HIV prevention conversations
and interventions; and b) disseminate a client-centered, gender-affirming, non-discriminating, anti-stigmatizing
and trauma-informed approach to sexual history and HIV prevention conversations. This Core Project uses a
two-phase cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge implementation trial to evaluate adoption of the implementation
strategy in 20 agencies funded by the NYC HD. Based on an implementation science model, we will examine
outcomes at three levels: a) implementation outcomes (e.g., rates of HIV testing, PrEP uptake, immediate linkage
of newly diagnosed patients to care); b) service outcomes (e.g., equitable distribution of HIV prevention
interventions to highest priority populations); and c) patient outcomes (e.g., impact on city-wide HIV incidence,
engagement in care, and viral suppression). Secondary analysis will also be conducted on hypothesized
mechanisms (i.e., mediators) as defined in the programâs logic model, including dimensions of provider
competence and patientsâ experience. Model fidelity data will be collected on enactment of the GOALS Approach
implementation strategy by the NYC HD, and its ability to successfully implement the strategy at each of the
individual agencies. Finally, qualitative data will be collected to assess barriers and facilitators to implementation
at both the health department and agency levels to inform future adaptation and dissemination of the
implementation strategy.
7.2. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT -- COLLABORATIVE Project
One of the most persistent challenges in health care provision is quality. It is often easy to determine which or
how many services are being provided to clients by a given agency or program, but it is far more difficult to
determine how well these services are being delivered, or what aspects of service delivery have the greatest
impact on outcomes. This Collaborative Project is based on the scientific premise that quality can be defined,
measured, and supported by a re-envisioning of health department contract practices, and that an
implementation science approach can evaluate this innovative strategy and identify its strengths and
weaknesses for broader dissemination. In this Collaborative Project, we address the persistent problem of
quality through: a) an implementation strategy that defines quality in HIV prevention services and
operationalizes a logic model through which higher quality services will address known barriers and inequities
at the community-, system-, and client-levels; b) a data collection and quality improvement and management
(QIM) strategy that focuses on quality and quality metrics as incentive-based deliverables in HIV prevention
contracts; c) a training and technical support system that works with agencies to identify challenges to quality
service provision and supports them to identify and enact approaches to address those challenges; and d) a
collaborative research design that measures initiation, adoption, and sustainment of each component of this
implementation strategy, and applies a programmatic logic model to examine the impact of each component on
hypothesized determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes. The New York City Health Department (NYC HD)
has selected a Quality-Based Financing (QBF) model to fund its HIV prevention contracts (in contrast to a
traditional fee-for-service model) as an implementation strategy to decrease inequities in access, utilization,
and outcomes for HIV prevention services, and to equitably decrease the HIV incidence among NYCâs highest
priority populations. This Collaborative Project has four main objectives: (1) conduct an interrupted time
series (ITS) analysis to evaluate the impact of implementing the QBF model; (2) qualitatively explore factors
that potentially explain differences in successful implementation of QBF across different agencies; (3) Identify
factors significantly associated with differential effectiveness of the QBF model using longitudinal multiple
regression analysis; and (4) Measure model fidelity and monitor QBF implementation at the level of the health
department and funded agencies."

The nucleus is the defining feature of eukaryotic cells; it is also the largest and stiffest cell organelle. Increasing
evidence suggest that these physical properties of the nucleus can affect diverse cellular functions, and that
mechanical forces acting on the nucleus conversely modulate nuclear structure and function, including chromatin
organization, gene expression, and genomic integrity. This ânuclear mechanobiologyâ is particularly relevant in
the context of cell migration in 3D in vivo environments, where cells frequently move through tight interstitial
spaces that require substantial deformation of the cell nucleus. Examples include cell migration during
development, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer metastasis. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that
the required deformation of the nucleus limits the ability of cells to migrate through tight spaces, with highly
migratory cells often having more deformable nuclei, and that nuclear deformation associated with confined
migration can lead to transient nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin organization.
These findings point to an exciting new concept in which the deformation of the nucleus as cells move through
tight spaces could activate or suppress transcriptional programs that further enhance migration and modulate
other functions, or that could lead to the selection of cells particularly adept at such confined migration.
Nonetheless, many questions remain. Over the next five years, we will focus on three complementary and
synergistic overarching research areas: (1) investigate how cells generate, apply, and coordinate the large
cytoskeletal forces required to move and deform the nucleus through confined spaces; (2) identify the
mechanism(s) responsible for confined migration induced changes in chromatin organization, and (3) determine
the functional consequences of confined migration on cellular fate and functions, along with the underlying
mechanisms. Towards this goal, we have developed several novel experimental platforms that enable extended
live-cell imaging of cells migrating through precisely-defined microenvironments while visualizing nuclear
deformation, nuclear envelope rupture, DNA damage, and chromatin modifications, and that allow collection of
cells after confined migration for subsequent analysis. We will pair these platforms with molecular biology
approaches and assays for genome-wide analysis of changes in 3D chromatin organization and gene expression
in a range of different cell types, reflecting physiological and pathological scenarios. Our ultimate goal is to
uncover general principles in nuclear mechanobiology that will lead to an improved understanding of the impact
of migration through tight spaces on cellular function and fate, including the activation or suppression of specific
transcriptional programs that may further enhance cell migration or modulate other cellular functions. Insights
gained from these studies may help guide therapeutic approach for a variety of clinical conditions, from wound
healing and immune-responses to therapies targeting metastatic tumor cells."

The overall vision of the Bevilacqua lab is that human health can be advanced by combining
holistic genomic and detailed molecular views of fundamental problems in RNA biology. Over the
next five years, the work outlined in this MIRA will advance RNA folding and catalysis under in
vivo and in vivo-like conditions using a combination of traditional and high-throughput (HT)
experimental and computational approaches, many of which the lab has helped develop. There
will be a balance of development of fundamental methods and new technologies with their
application. The molecular perspective employs both traditional biophysical and biochemical
approaches, while the holistic perspective uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches.
A major goal of this MIRA proposal is to connect these two approaches to discover novel RNA
structures and functions and to understand them from both gene regulatory and molecular
perspectives. This proposal brings multiple high-throughput (HT) approaches to bear including
experimental approaches such as fluorescence-detected binding isotherms (FDBI), massively
parallel oligonucleotide synthesis (MPOS), and Structure-seq NGS, as well as computational
approaches ranging from cheminformatics to bioinformatics. Goals for the next five years
encompass probing RNA folding under biological conditions that include deriving an expanded
set of nearest neighbor (NN) parameters for describing RNA folding in the presence of bacterial
and human metabolite mixtures. The lab will also explore the dynamics of RNA folding in such in
vivo-like conditions using time-resolved studies such as fluorescence-detected stopped-flow
kinetics, as well as temperature-dependent probing of RNA structure in vivo to uncover cases
where only a fraction of the RNA molecules form a given pairing. Additional efforts will focus on
discovery of and novel functions for ribozymes including tolerance of mutation, metabolite
assistance of cleavage, occurrence of zymogens (âribozymogensâ) and their activation, ribozymes
being split across exons (âsplit ribozymesâ), multiple turnover ribozymes, and pseudoribozymes
(loss-of-function ribozymes) and their function. Another goal will be to identify unusual charged
and tautomeric forms of the nucleobases using a combination of cheminformatics and NGS
approaches and to target these with therapeutics. The balance of traditional mechanistic
characterization and NGS approaches, as well as the widespread development and application
of HT methods, provides an ideal pathway for discovery of and insight into novel RNA biology."
10845582,"Project Summary/Abstract
Abnormal chromosomes are hallmark features of human diseases and genetic disorders. Cancer genome
sequencing has uncovered a complex class of localized genomic rearrangements, known as chromothripsis,
that arises from the catastrophic fragmentation of individual chromosomes. Chromothripsis is initiated by mitotic
cell division errors resulting in the formation of micronuclei, aberrant nuclear structures that transiently
encapsulate mis-segregated chromosomes outside of the nucleus. Micronuclei serve as hotspots for the
accumulation of extensive DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by restricting DNA damage to a confined region of
the genome. A detailed mechanistic understanding of chromothripsis, however, has been limited by inherent
challenges in monitoring micronucleated chromosomes for more than one cell cycle. We recently bypassed this
limitation by developing a platform that enables the controlled induction of chromosome-specific micronuclei in
human cells. By reconstructing the cascade of events resulting in chromothripsis, we found that damaged
micronuclear DNAs are susceptible to fragmentation upon premature chromosome condensation triggered by
mitotic entry. These fragments undergo error-prone DSB repair during the subsequent cell cycle to generate
diverse chromosomal rearrangements that are identical to those found in cancers and genomic disorders.
Moreover, we identified that short DNA fragments entrapped in the cytoplasm can activate a cell-autonomous
immune response. Despite this knowledge, we currently have a limited mechanistic understanding of the
consequences of chromosome fragmentation. For example, it remains unclear how pulverized fragments from
micronuclei re-incorporate into daughter cell genomes during mitosis and become reassembled by one or more
DSB repair mechanisms throughout interphase. Additionally, it is unknown whether chromosome fragmentation
can elicit a non-cell autonomous response. Here we outline our research program over the next five years aimed
at understanding the fate of micronucleated chromosomes across different phases of the cell cycle and its
mutagenic consequences on genome integrity. Using time-lapse light-sheet microscopy, we will interrogate the
spatiotemporal dynamics of chromosome fragmentation, movement, and reassembly during mitosis and
interphase. This will be achieved by engineering a CRISPR-based labeling strategy to visualize micronucleated
chromosomes undergoing chromothripsis in living cells. Next, we will identify how the DNA damage response
and distinct DSB repair pathways orchestrate the reassembly of chromosome fragments to shape the genomic
rearrangement landscape of mitotic errors. Lastly, we will investigate how chromosome fragments residing in
the cytoplasm can elicit inter-cellular consequences with neighboring cells in the environment, including the
lateral exchange of genetic material. Altogether, these studies aim to define fundamental principles governing
the intrinsic and extrinsic fate of micronuclei in initiating catastrophic genomic alterations. The proposed research
will fill a critical gap in our understanding of how cell cycle errors can rapidly drive somatic mutagenesis."
10845588,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An important aspect of successful genomic medicine implementation is developing effective approaches for
screening at-risk family members after probands are identified, also known as cascade screening. Most cascade
screening studies conducted to date have been conducted outside the US, and very few studies have used a
rigorous approach involving a comparator group or randomized controlled design. As such, a critical gap exists
in our knowledge of the most effective delivery strategies of cascade screening and their ethical acceptability.
The goal of the research we propose is to compare direct (i.e., contacting relatives of probands directly by study
team) vs indirect (i.e., traditional, proband-initiated contact) implementation of cascade screening using familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH) and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) as model cases. We will focus on screening two
pathogenic variants, KCNQ1 Met224Thr, which causes LQTS, and APOB Arg3527Gln, a variant known to cause
FH. Both variants have a high carrier frequency (2% and 12%, respectively) in the Amish due to founder effects.
Cascade screening for FH is recommended as a tier 1 condition by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. This very large number of subjects carrying the same actionable variants for LQTS and FH, coupled
with our history of engagement in the Amish community, provides an outstanding opportunity to address the
knowledge gap. Specifically, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of participants with pathogenic
variants causing LQTS and FH to compare direct vs indirect methods for cascade screening coupled with
implementation evaluation outcomes to assess the ethical and social impacts of the intervention. We
hypothesize that, compared to traditional proband-initiated contact, direct contact will lead to greater efficiency
of cascade screening, greater patient knowledge, and promote autonomous decision-making by relatives, while
still maintaining acceptable levels of privacy and autonomy. In Aim 1 we will assess efficacy of the cascade
screening strategies by comparing uptake in the direct versus indirect arms. In Aim 2 we will assess the mode
of contact on self-reported alignment with ethical principles, anxiety, perceived pressure to undergo testing, and
knowledge of disease. Aim 3 will characterize implementation evaluation outcomes such as reach, fidelity, and
cost of the two contact approaches based on the RE-AIM Framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, maintenance) and CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease. Although many drug targets have been identified that
were successful in preclinical studies, clinical trials on disease modifying OA drugs thus far have failed and
pain management remains unsatisfactory. Approaches such as testing disease-related differences in
expression of selected genes or proteins and analyzing their function in preclinical models has yielded a large
number of pathways and molecules that are abnormal in OA. The limitations of these approaches are (i) that
they provide only a selective view of molecular changes in OA and (ii) there has been no successful effort in
integrating these findings into networks and prioritizing targets by their relevance as drivers of the OA process.
This project leverages (i) our access to and expertise in working with human knee tissues from donors across
the entire adult age spectrum and at all stages of OA development; (ii) existing and growing human knee tissue
libraries; (iii) technical advances in genome wide analyses of transcriptomic changes, which provide an
unbiased and comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of cartilage homeostasis and OA; (iv) our
expertise in developing pipelines for integrative network analysis of multi-Omics data sets.
 Our hypothesis is that dysregulation transcription factors (TFs) is a major determinant of the abnormal gene
expression pattern that drives OA pathogenesis. Our approach is to generate data from gene expression
(mRNAseq) and enhancer activation analysis (GRO-seq) at the tissue level and more precisely at the single
cell level to identify novel signatures, pathways and key regulators of cartilage homeostasis and OA.
Aim 1. The transcriptomic landscape of normal and OA human articular cartilage single cell levels. We will
perform single-cell RNAseq to identify chondrocyte subpopulations in normal and OA human articular
cartilage.
Aim 2. Enhancer profiling to identify drivers of pathogenic gene expression patterns in OA. Active enhancers
are characterized by the presence of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). We will use GRO-seq to assay eRNA
transcription in normal and OA chondrocytes. These results will reveal pathways and networks that are
disrupted in OA and identify principal regulators of OA pathogenesis.
Aim 3. Validation: Confirm differences in TF expression and activation in joint tissues and analyze function in
joint tissue cells. We will assess differences in TF protein expression and activity in cartilage and other joint
tissues and determine the role of candidate TFs in mediating expression of OA-associated gene patterns.
 Impact: To our knowledge, this is the first project to examine genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in
healthy and OA-affected knee cartilage at tissue and single cell levels and linking this transcriptomic data with
analysis of TF expression and activity. The study has potential discover novel pathways and principal
molecular switches as therapeutic targets. Ultimately this may lead to interventions to delay or treat OA."

The proposed MARC Program at Louisiana State University (LSU) will ensure the training of underrepresented
(UR) minority, disabled or economically disadvantaged undergraduate (UG) students for research careers and
leadership positions in the biomedical or behavioral sciences. LSU has emerged as a national model for
advancing and promoting inclusion, equity, and diversity and improving the success rates of underrepresented
students. The design of our proposed MARC program is based on evidence-based practices, previous
experiences, particularly with the NIH/NIGMS-sponsored LSU IMSD program, which has supported 20 UG
students/year (2004-2019), and guidance from nationally renowned faculty. In fact, five faculty at LSU,
including the PI, Co-PI, and two of the Advisory Committee members, are recipients of Presidential Awards for
Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM). The overall goal of the LSU
MARC program is to provide high impact research experiences, mentoring, and advance professional and
career development for students, enhance the pool of students from underrepresented groups who
successfully enroll and complete Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degrees, and to further develop and sustain a long-term
mentoring community of scientists. Our vision is that this program will produce highly skilled, competitive,
motivated and productive young scientists who will fill a national need, and will expand LSU faculty mentoring,
inclusion, and community outreach activities. The LSU MARC program will provide valuable biomedical
research training and career and curriculum development for 4 cohorts consisting of 12 undergraduate
scholars each through their junior and senior years. The five-year project will directly impact 60 total students.
Program scholars will receive individual counseling and mentoring, research training, mentoring, and various
other career and personal development activities. The four guiding objectives of the LSU MARC program are:
(1) Provide high-impact biomedical research training opportunities to high achieving students from UR groups;
(2) Improve MARC scholars' competitiveness through holistic academic, research, and social development and
enrichment activities; (3) Prepare MARC scholars for research careers; and (4) Develop and sustain a
mentoring community for MARC participants. The LSU MARC program will provide a holistic, student-centered
spectrum of educational activities, training opportunities, professional experiences, and personal development,
with the aim to increase student matriculation and persistence into Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. programs. Our
proposed innovative strategies include expanded biomedical research opportunities at LSU laboratories and
local research intensive facilities, research skills course, impactful mentoring training for scholars and faculty,
summer research experiences, field trips/site visits, outreach activities, a Gulf Coast MARC Symposium and
publication of MARC outcomes and best practices. The proposed MARC program activities are expected to
have high impact at LSU and maximize the benefits for its scholars, faculty participants, and the community."

Gonorrhea is the second most common notifiable disease in the United States with 555,608 cases reported in
2017. In recognition of the high prevalence of gonorrhea and increasing antibiotic resistance, in 2013, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) gonorrhea among the three
most urgent infection threats in the United States. The continued evolution of AMR gonorrhea highlights the
importance of surveillance systems that provide timely and accurate data to inform public health strategies to
combat the spread of AMR gonorrhea. In this context, important questions remain on how best to configure a
surveillance system: Where should the surveillance sites be located? How many isolates should be tested for
drug susceptibility among risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, men who have sex with women,
and women? How should sampling be distributed among the anatomical sites of infection (urethra, rectum,
and/or pharynx)? This proposal describes a rigorous, simulation model-based investigation to evaluate
strategies for the surveillance of AMR gonorrhea in the United States. Toward this goal, we will develop a
simulation model of gonorrhea transmission in the 50 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States.
The model will allow us to enumerate several performance measures including: 1) the clinically-effective
lifespan of antibiotics, 2) the incidence of drug-susceptible and AMR gonorrhea, and 3) the overall cost of
surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea. We will use this model to project the impact of various
strategies for the surveillance of AMR gonorrhea on these performance measures. This study will provide
essential information to help policy makers identify strategies for the surveillance of AMR gonorrhea that are
both cost-effective and expected to extend the clinically-effective lifespan of antibiotics. To ensure the
successful completion of these aims, we have assembled a team of experts in gonococcal antimicrobial
resistance, mathematical and computer simulation modeling, decision science, and health economics who are
committed to working together to slow the spread of AMR gonorrhea in the United States by identifying
strategies to optimize the surveillance of AMR gonorrhea."

We are requesting continued support for the short term research training program at the
New England College of Optometry (NECO), to run from 5/1/2020 through 4/30/2025.
Each year the program will support 8 eligible pre-doctoral students, mainly from NECO.
The program will introduce these future optometrists to laboratory-based research, with
the goal of encouraging future career choices as clinician-scientists or academic faculty.
During the program students will learn how to perform a rigorous research project,
through participation in their assigned laboratory and in weekly seminars on topics such
as the ethical conduct of science, critical literature review, and statistical analysis of
data. They will gain experience in oral presentations and scientific writing, and learn
how research results can be translated into clinical practice. Students will be exposed to
research on topics such as low vision, ocular aberrations, ROP, circadian rhythms of
eye growth, and effects of lighting on myopia. By the end of the program students
should have a clear understanding of what is involved in conducting rigorous research
and presenting results, both orally and in writing.
Applications are solicited from students at NECO and other colleges of optometry. The
applicants with the strongest academic records and recommendations are accepted into
the program. They have a wide range of research ability and experience, which we take
into account in assigning mentors. The mentor is responsible for guiding the student
through all stages of the program. Most of our mentors are established researchers,
with a few new junior faculty members added to the list, to be supervised by the
program director and co-director. Most of the participating faculty members have
funding from NIH or other external or internal sources.
If past performance is any indication, some of these new students will choose to pursue
a Masterâs degree in addition to the OD, and a few will include research as part of their
career plans. Research-trained doctors can have a significant impact on patient care or
in the classroom when training future optometrists."

The incidence of kidney dysfunction and hypertension increases with age. The prevalence of chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension is higher in the aged than in the young population. Salt
sensitivity is more prevalent in the elderly population. The aging-associated salt sensitivity is an
important factor that contributes to the increased prevalence of hypertension in the elderly population.
However, the underlying mechanism of aging-associated salt-sensitive hypertension is poorly
understood. Exosomes are small bi-lipid membrane-bound vesicles that are produced in the
endosomal compartment and released to extracellular spaces as intercellular messengers which
regulate cell functions via a paracrine manner. The objective of the proposed research is to determine
whether renal stem cell-derived exosomes (RSC-exosomes) play a role in the maintenance of normal
kidney function and blood pressure and whether RSC-exosomes is involved in the pathogenesis of
aging-associated kidney dysfunction, salt sensitivity and hypertension. This objective will be achieved
by pursuing two interrelated specific aims using a combination of several novel technical approaches.
The specific aims are: (1) Determine whether RSC-exosomes play a role in the regulation of renal
function and blood pressure. (2) Investigate whether downregulation of RSC-exosomes contributes to
aging-associated kidney dysfunction, salt sensitivity and hypertension. These studies will
demonstrate, for the first time, an important role of RSC-exosomes in the regulation of kidney function
and blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. The results will reveal novel mechanisms
that RSC-exosomes may protect the kidney. Completion of the project may offer new insights into
therapeutic strategies for aging-associated kidney dysfunction and hypertension and related
cardiovascular disorder."

Age-related decline in physical and cognitive health are pressing public health concerns. Developmental science
shows that variation in adult physical and cognitive health is reliably associated with individualsâ early
experiences in their families of origin. Risky families, characterized by greater conflict and lower-quality
parenting, tend to disrupt psychosocial and biological functioning, resulting in increased risk for diseases,
including Alzheimerâs Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Children who receive less warmth, support, and
responsiveness from their parents typically have higher inflammation levels, blood pressure, and allostatic load,
indicators that predict future cardiovascular problems. These pathways are also implicated in altered midlife
cognitive functioning and confer risk for Alzheimerâs Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). This project takes
advantage of an unparalleled opportunity to further this important line of work on the significance of family
experiences in adolescence for health outcomes in adulthood by conducting a follow-up into midlife of the Sibling
Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS). SIBS is a longitudinal study of 409 adoptive and 208 non-adoptive
families. The offspring in these families have already completed intake (in mid-adolescence), and three follow-
up assessments. In the first assessment of SIBS, already coded direct observations of parent-child interactions,
as well as parent-reports and child-reports of the quality of the parent-child relationship, were acquired. The
availability of these relationship data at a key developmental phase in an adoption cohort provides a strong
platform for the addition of follow-up data on the target participants/younger generation (YG; M age = 38 years)
and their parents/older generation (OG; M age = 71 years). Our overarching objective is to investigate the degree
to which family experiences in adolescence predict key indicators of health in adulthood among adoptive and
non-adoptive adults and their aging parents. Specific aims of this project include: AIM 1: Determine the
longitudinal effect of adolescent family experiences on later physical health and cognitive functioning in adult
children (YG) and their aging parents (OG); AIM 2: Model the environmental impact of adolescent family
experiences on later physical health and cognitive functioning; AIM 3: (a) Test whether the effects of family
experiences extend to subtle indicators of physical health; (b; exploratory) and are moderated by APOE status."

Myocardial infarction (MI) and the resulting left ventricular remodeling may compromise cardiac function and
eventually result in heart failure. Although there are limited current treatment options for these patients beyond
re-perfusion, a number of biomaterial therapies are currently being developed and have even progressed to
clinical trials. Our lab with our clinical collaborators have been exploring the use of injectable hydrogels for over
a decade to provide both mechanical and biological signals to the heart during the acute phase of MI, to alter
the LV remodeling response and to improve cardiac function. Often, these hydrogels are delivered as a
âpocketâ of material within the myocardium with initial cell interactions only at the hydrogel periphery; however,
we now look to design âactiveâ strategies where the material design can guide tissue repair through porosity
and engineered hydrogel signals. To accomplish this, we propose the development and application of granular
hydrogels â comprised of assembled microgel subunits that exhibit shear-thinning properties for injectability
and inherent interstitial porosity for cell invasion. Our guiding hypothesis is that the injection of granular
hydrogels will permit cellular invasion to increase vascular density, matrix accumulation, and improve
functional outcomes after MI. Importantly, particle-based materials are also known to promote a pro-healing
response based on their structure, leading to early collagen deposition, which can be leveraged to promote
infarct stabilization. Due to the modular nature of granular hydrogels, we propose three Aims to better
understand their structure-function properties towards their translation as an MI therapy. In Aim 1, we fabricate
microgels with high-throughput microfluidic approaches to form granular hydrogels where biophysical features,
namely particle size and the introduction of inter-particle interactions, are altered. We explore how these
parameters influence cell invasion, the maturation of vascular structures, and improve cardiac function when
assessed in an ischemia-reperfusion MI model in rodents. In Aim 2, we then seek to understand how the
addition of biochemical signals in granular hydrogels, including the protease-degradation of select microgel
populations and local release of the chemoattractant stromal cell derived factor 1a further improve outcomes.
Lastly, in Aim 3, we look towards translation with the development of advanced microfluidics for the rapid
fabrication of granular hydrogels and then evaluate select compositions in a clinically-relevant ischemia-
reperfusion model in pigs. Our study is supported by extensive preliminary work and expertise, including
biomaterials development for cardiac repair (Burdick), microfluidic design for particle fabrication and scale-up
(Issadore), and animal models for the assessment of therapies for MI (Atluri/Gorman). The significance of
this work is potentially profound, as it develops an acellular injectable hydrogel treatment for MI by
recruiting endogenous cell populations in the early post-MI period to limit adverse LV remodeling."

The majority of medical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures depend on invasive methods and
sophisticated tools. These medical practices are non-convenient for the patients, are expensive, are time-
consuming, and require intensive use of equipment and professional resources. Therefore, there exists a
critical need for medical devices and procedures that minimize the inconvenience, cost, and resource
allocation. The PI's long-term goal is to develop intelligent molecular robots that detect diseases and treat
them by providing appropriate responses that are timely, inexpensive, and convenient.
PI's overall objectives for the proposed project are to construct a prototype of the envisioned robot, produce
the preliminary data that will support submitting a targeted R01 grant at NIH, and establish a translational
research program with support from his team. The PI's team will build a programmable DNA-based robot
that aims at i) detecting specific RNA molecules and ii) generating amplified signals and select gene
products. Leveraging PI's background, qualifications, and expertise that this proposal will advocate and the
strong team he has assembled, he and his team are well-positioned to pursue this research. The proposed
idea is likely to succeed because the PI's preliminary data demonstrates the project's feasibility. As a proof
of concept, the team will design the robot to detect specific microRNA molecules that are known markers
of breast cancer cells. The robot responds to the existence of the microRNAs by overexpressing the
accompanying therapeutic gene. Modifying and altering domain properties of DNA-based molecular
machines are inexpensive, fast, and efficient. Hence, the proposed work potentially has a broad reach â
given the team can readily change the robot to enable detection of a host of biomolecules, including but not
limited to various microRNAs. To achieve the goal of the proposed project, the PI will address the following
three specific aims:
 â¢ Aim 1: Design, construct, and characterize the robot's structural, optical, and functional properties,
 resulting in the construction of an efficient robot.
 â¢ Aim 2: Develop target specificity and demonstrate the robot's diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities
 that enable both colorimetric detection and elimination of the target cancer cells.
 â¢ Aim 3: Establish a vigorous translational research program and involve students in the research,
 provide mentorship and training for students to train the impactful workforce, scientists, and leaders
 of the future; in alignment with the mission of NIH.
If successful, the proposed research will result in preliminary data that informs larger grant applications to
develop molecular robots that perform diagnostic and therapeutics."

While the effects of alcohol use disorder (AUD) on glutamatergic signaling have been widely reported, the role
of delta glutamate receptors (GluD1 and GluD2) in AUD remains unknown. Although they are not involved in
traditional excitatory synaptic responses to glutamate, the GluD family is known to mediate many subtler aspects
of excitatory signaling which may contribute to the dysfunctions of neuronal activity observed in models of AUD.
GluD1 has also been implicated in AUD by several genome-wide association studies. However, no research has
been conducted directly evaluating the effect of alcohol exposure on GluD1 function.
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a forebrain nucleus that has been heavily implicated as a critical
hub for neuromodulation following alcohol exposure. Previous work has shown that alcohol exposure regulates
synaptic glutamate in the BNST, but the exact mechanisms by which this happen remain unclear. Synaptic
glutamatergic transmission is in part mediated by AMPA receptors, ~30% of which can pass calcium (calcium-
permeable AMPARs, CP-AMPARs). Our preliminary data suggests that acute withdrawal from chronic
intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) decreases both CP-AMPAR synaptic current and reduces a GluD1
mediated tonic excitatory current in the BNST. Although it has been observed before that GluD1 is expressed in
the BNST, these are the first data to that they may be involved in regulating BNST signaling. These data also
implicate GluD1 modulation as a possible novel target for neuromodulation following alcohol exposure. This
proposal aims to further examine the role of CP-AMPARs and GluD1 in the BNST, how they may interact, and
how they are affected by alcohol exposure using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization, patch-clamp
electrophysiology, and ex vivo calcium imaging. Aim 1 will use GluD1 knockout (GluD1 KO) mice and wildtype
(WT) littermates to establish a functional profile of GluD1 in the BNST, as well as its overlap with CP-AMPAR
expressing BNST cells. Aim 2 will then evaluate the impact of CIE on BNST CP-AMPAR and GluD1 expression
and signaling, neuronal excitability, and spontaneous calcium dynamics in these mouse models. Finally, Aim 3
will use these approaches to examine the translational relevance of BNST CP-AMPAR and GluD1 signaling
across different models of AUD."

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small bilateral nucleus located in the dorsal pons of the brainstem, and serves as
the brainâs primary site for producing the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE). NE-producing neurons in the
LC project to many regions of the central nervous system to modulate highly divergent functions including
cognition, arousal, and mood. The LC is one of the earliest sites of degeneration in Alzheimerâs disease (AD),
and profound loss of LC-NE neurons accelerates with disease progression. Several unique anatomical,
morphological and neurochemical properties likely contribute to vulnerability of LC-NE neurons. First, LC-NE
neurons synthesize neuromelanin (NM), a property shared by only a few cell types in the human brain. NM
accumulates with aging, and one hypothesis is that it initially protects LC-NE neurons by sequestering or
chelating neurotoxic substances. However, in late life and disease states, NM deposition may be detrimental
when it overwhelms cellular machinery, and accumulated toxins are released from degenerating cells. Second,
accumulation of phosphorylated tau (pTau), a primary AD neuropathology, is detected in the LC prior to any
other brain region. In this application, we generate transcriptomic-scale spatial maps that incorporate
localization of NM and pTau in the human LC in brain donors diagnosed with AD and contrast these
expression patterns to both middle-aged and age-matched elderly neurotypical donors. We will use the 10x
Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression and the Visium Spatial Proteogenomics platforms, which combine
transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing with detailed high-resolution histology and immunofluorescence imaging
to segment and quantify NM and pTau, respectively. We will computationally align adjacent tissue sections
from the same donor across platforms to determine how joint accumulation of NM and pTau during aging and
disease impacts the local tissue microenvironment in the human LC. Results will be validated and extended
using complementary in situ hybridization platforms with cellular resolution and simultaneous protein detection.
Accumulation of NM and pTau represent two key biological hypotheses underlying the vulnerability and
resiliency of LC-NE neurons to neurodegeneration in the human brain. Hence, generation of these data are
important because understanding the molecular sequelae downstream of this accumulation is critical to
develop strategies to target cells in the LC for disease treatment or prevention."
10827137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive, highly heterogeneous fibrotic lung disease. The median
survival from the time of diagnosis is ~3 years, demonstrating that IPF is considered more lethal than many
cancers. There is no identifiable cause for most patients with IPF. Current FDA-approved drugs only slow
progression but do not cure IPF. The pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis relies on repeated local micro-
injuries to the alveolar epithelium triggering DNA damage, cell death, and aberrant lung tissue remodeling.
Elevated levels of cell-free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) serve as a negative predictive factor for fatal
outcomes in IPF patients. dsDNA in the cytoplasm is recognized by cGAS-STING (stimulator of interferon
genes); cGAS-STING is activated in fibrotic lung tissue from interstitial lung disease patients. cGAS-STING
promotes the translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-ÎºB to the nucleus, inducing type I IFNs and
other proinflammatory cytokines. Using a well-defined, murine model of pulmonary fibrosis, we find increased
dsDNA in BALF of injured mice. Critically, Cgas-/- mice show reduced inflammation, decreased lung collagen
levels, and improved static lung compliance compared to WT mice. Recently, STING was found to interact with
vimentin, a protein critical for cell structure and organelle positioning. Given our previous report that Vimentin-/-
mice are protected from bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis, together with evidence that vimentin
facilitates STING ER-to-Golgi trafficking, an essential and rate-limiting step in activating cGAS-STING, we
hypothesize persistent activation of cGAS-STING signaling in alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar
macrophages contributes to aberrant lung tissue repair.
Specific Aim 1: Determine whether cGAS-STING-mediated IRF3 and NF-kB activation in monocyte-
derived alveolar macrophages is necessary for aberrant lung tissue remodeling associated with
pulmonary fibrosis. We will genetically inhibit cGAS-STING-mediated IRF3 and NF-kB signaling in MoAM
during the fibrotic phase of bleomycin injury and use complementary physiologic and molecular techniques to
assess lung repair. Specific Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which VIM-cGAS-STING axis contributes
to aberrant lung tissue repair and pulmonary fibrosis. We will define the mechanism by which VIM, a STING-
interacting protein, traffics STING from the ER-to-Golgi, initiating STING-dependent IRF3 and NF-ÎºB signaling
leading to the expression of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. Specific Aim 3. Determine whether cGAS-
STINGâPERK signaling is required for alveolar epithelial cell damage/stress and pulmonary fibrosis. Our
data shows that cGAS-STING is activated in alveolar epithelial cells from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Upon
binding to cGAMP, STING binds to and directly activates the ER-located kinase PERK in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). We will address whether the STING-PERK axis is required for alveolar epithelial cell
damage/stress and contributes to aberrant lung tissue remodeling associated with pulmonary fibrosis."
10828346,"ABSTRACT: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) poses an urgent threat to human health
in the United States and globally. Metallo-Î²-lactamases (MBL), which confer high-level carbapenem resistance,
warrant significant attention. The paucity of treatment options for CRPA MBL-producing Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (MBL PA) and the broken antibiotic pipeline demands the development of new therapeutic strategies
that target non-traditional, unexploited pathways. There is mounting evidence that âhypermutatorâ strains, which
show a significantly increased spontaneous mutation frequency (ï³10-fold higher than non-mutator control), serve
as the basis for pathoadaptation and antimicrobial tolerance, inevitably increasing the likelihood of treatment
failure and bacterial persistence in PA infections. Importantly, errors made during DNA replication and
translesion DNA synthesis (TLS Pol IV) serve as the mechanistic basis for mutations in PA hypermutator strains.
We have pioneered the synthesis and testing of novel non-natural nucleotides as remarkably safe and effective
anti-cancer therapies, which is supported by our preliminary data. For the first time, we now propose to study
non-natural nucleotides by defining the underlying mechanism of hypermutators in pathoadaptation, persistence
and antimicrobial resistance and develop combination regimens to combat MBL PA. Our overarching goal is to
develop new combinatorial treatment strategies for MBL PA using novel anti-mutator non-natural nucleotides
together with available Î²-lactam antibiotics. One promising bridge therapy for MBL Gram-negatives is
ceftazidime-avibactam combined with aztreonam; however, this strategy has not been studied in MBL PA. In
preliminary studies, we observed long filamentous persisters due to inhibition of penicillin binding protein 3 in
MBL PA exposed to the ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam combination. Since the SOS response to DNA
damage is required for filamentation, while TLS DNA polymerases (Pols) are required to bypass DNA lesions
generated in persister cell DNA leading to antimicrobial resistance, we hypothesize that in the absence of repair
functions, the ability of persisters to cope with DNA damage and subsequently septate and grow becomes
increasingly dependent on TLS Pol IV. Given this critically important role of PA Pol IV, our overarching
hypothesis that novel, non-natural nucleotides that target Pol IV to block replication of damaged DNA will be
highly effective together with existing Î²-lactam antibiotics. To test these hypotheses, we will: (Aim 1) define the
contributions of hypermutators to resistance and persistence of MBL PA exposed to Î²-lactam combinations;
(Aim 2) develop small molecule, non-natural nucleotides targeting TLS Pol IV to combat mutation in MBL PA;
(Aim 3) define optimal combinatorial treatment regimens of non-natural nucleosides and Î²-lactams that
suppresses resistance, and prevents persistence of MBL PA in hollow fiber and animal models. Taken together,
our results will provide unprecedented insight into novel combination therapies for Gram-negatives, and will set
the cornerstone for future testing of anti-mutator non-natural nucleotides in clinical trials."
10827107,"Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Current treatments are available only
advanced stages of DR. There is a great need for identifying regulators and therapeutic targets.
Research advances have expanded our understanding of DR. These include the role of protective
factors in DR, the pathophysiologic effect of oxidative stress, and the multi-faceted nature of DR as a
disease of the neurovascular unit that involves multiple cell types. This includes neuroretinal
dysfunction and neurodegeneration that are early abnormities in DR which can contribute to disease
progression. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a key enzyme for nitric oxide (NO) signaling.
Oxidative stress is known to inhibit sGC in systemic settings, including diabetes, via oxidation of the
sGC prosthetic heme, leading to its inactivation and eventual loss. This is notable since oxidative
stress is known to be an important driver of DR progression. Drugs promoting sGC are in use for
some systemic conditions and are continuing to be actively developed, highlighting the translational
potential of targeting this molecule. Our lab has found that an sGC activator drug exerts
neuroprotective effects in rodent models of diabetic retinopathy. We have further found evidence for
a functional role for sGC in the retina. In this proposal, we seek to expand our studies of sGC with
respect to its role in diabetic retinopathy. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches
to explore the potential inactivation of sGC in retina by diabetes and its stressors. In addition, we will
explore the cell-specific roles of sGC in the retina using conditional knockout mice. The proposal
could advance sGC as an important regulator and target in DR and also increase understanding of
the interplay of retinal cell types in this condition, shedding further light into DR as a disease of the
neurovascular unit."
10847440,"ABSTRACT â project 3
The Randolph lab studies vascular inflammation and has a long-standing interest in the egress of cells and
molecules that impact chronic vascular diseases. With a track record in studying the trafficking of monocytes
(and the cells they become), we later began studying the transit of apoA1-enriched high-density lipoprotein
(HDLA1) through tissues. We demonstrated that liver-derived HDLA1 leaves most tissue parenchyma through
lymphatics to mediate reverse cholesterol transport, a process whereby cholesterol from cells in various body
organs is picked up by HDLA1 and returned to the liver for disposal in bile. Reverse cholesterol transport
regulates macrophage phenotype in various diseases, as macrophages readily accumulate cholesterol. On the
other hand, macrophages also efficiently transfer cholesterol to HDLA1 via the membrane transporter ABCA1 in
a process called cholesterol efflux. If cholesterol efflux is impaired, for example from reduction of HDLA1,
cholesterol accumulates in signaling domains at the plasma membrane to affect the phenotype and activation
status of macrophages. Overall, macrophages and lymphatics provide two distinct means for tissue clearance
of metabolites, debris, and other mediators--one via endocytosis or phagocytosis and the other via fluid
transport--and HDLA1 bridges these mechanisms. We have developed and validated a knock-in mouse line
expressing photoactivatable GFP linked to apoA1, to quantitatively track endogenous HDLA1 after photo-
activating a tissue of interest. Although little HDLA1 crosses the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain, HDLA1
enters the meningeal interstitium. Indeed, preliminary data reveal that the HDLA1 can be tagged by shining 405
nm light on the thinned skullbone as the HDLA1 passes through the meninges. Phototagged meningeal HDLA1
reaches the blood circulation one hour later, but only under conditions when the meningeal draining lymphatic
vasculature is intact. Epidemiological studies in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a disease broadly
associated with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and characterized by Aï¢ deposition in the adventitia of the
penetrating and meningeal arterioles, identify HDLA1 levels as inversely correlated with cerebral hemorrhage
associated with CAA. A connection between HDLA1 and CAA is directly supported by genetic and experimental
therapeutic interventions in mice. However, detailed mechanistic studies to unravel how HDLA1 affects CAA
have not been conducted. Using the 5XE4fl/fl murine model of CAA developed by the Holtzman laboratory, we
will herein focus on unraveling the role of HDLA1 in CAA by coupling use of our HDLA1 phototag tool with
approaches to interrogate its connection to lymphatic and blood flow (aim 1), to monocyte/macrophage
phenotype (aim 2), and to disease progression overall (aim 3). We here will test the hypothesis that HDLA1
restrains CAA and that its meningeal transit is impaired during CAA. By contrast, in states of health, we
propose that it functionally maintains meningeal interstitial flow into lymphatics by interacting with and
governing the phenotype of meningeal macrophages, including parenchymal border macrophages (PBM)."
10847441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular
amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles of tau aggregates, and neuronal death. There are
no approved therapies that can halt or reverse AD progression. The greatest risk factors of AD include age and
genetics. Among genetic risk factors, a DNA variant of the receptor TREM2, TREM2R47H, impairs the ability of
microglia to restrict spreading of AÎ² plaques. TREM2 transmits intracellular signals through the adaptor DAP12
that recruits the protein tyrosine kinase SYK, which promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple downstream
mediators. Highlighting the importance of SYK signaling in AD, microglia associated with AÎ² plaques upregulate
the expression of CD300LB, CD200R4, and CLEC7A, all of which activate SYK either through DAP12 or by
directly recruiting SYK. However, not much is known about SYK signaling in AD. Project 4 will explore this black
box, elucidating the impact of SYK on microglia and parenchymal border macrophage (PBM) function in AD and
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) models. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SYK is a major driver of microglia
responses to AÎ² and tau. Our preliminary data indicate that SYK deficiency impairs microglia clustering around
AÎ² plaques, which facilitates AÎ² accumulation, neurite dystrophy and memory deficits. Moreover, SYK-deficient
microglia show evidence of increased autophagy and lipid dysmetabolism. However, microglia proliferation and
ApoE production are maintained through a SYK-independent pathway. Based on these premises, we will test
the following hypotheses: a) microglia require SYK to control both AÎ² and tau pathology; b) SYK-deficient
microglia are impaired because of a major metabolic defect involving the mTOR pathway, autophagy and lipid
metabolism; c) ApoE production and proliferation of SYK-deficient microglia are sustained by a DAP10 pathway
associated with TREM2. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that SYK activation by anti-CLEC7A alleviates AÎ²
pathology. Our preliminary data demonstrate that engagement of CLEC7A rescues microglia activation in the
TREM2R47H-5xFAD model, in which microglia are defective due to the TREM2 variant. CLEC7A is a C-type lectin
receptor that directly recruits SYK and is expressed by microglia in mice with AD pathology. To test our
hypothesis, we will determine whether systemic administration of an anti-CLEC7A antibody as a surrogate ligand
ameliorates pathology and behavior in TREM2R47H-5xFAD mice. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that PBMs require
SYK to clear AÎ² in CAA. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PBMs express SYK. PBMs have been shown to
diminish the AÎ² load in CAA independently of microglia. We will test our hypothesis in a model for CAA, 5xFAD-
APOE4 mice, crossed with mice lacking SYK in PBMs. We will assess vascular amyloid pathology, vasomotion
by photoacoustic imaging and 2P-microscopy, as well as microhemorrhages in collaboration with the Kipnis and
Randolph labs. Through integration with projects 1, 2, 3 and Core B, Project 4 will provide deep comprehension
of mechanisms underlying microglia and PBM responses in AD and CAA and unearth a novel therapeutic target."
10854276,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment presents a significant hurdle in controlling tumor growth.
Activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein initiates innate immune responses, potentially
overcoming tumor immunosuppression and eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. However, in clinical
trials, STING agonist therapy has encountered profound tumor resistance, and the mechanisms remain unclear.
There is a significant gap in our understanding of the negative regulatory effects of STING on antitumor immunity
that underlies resistance development in STING agonist therapy. STING is a crucial innate immune sensor that
senses 2â3â-Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) produced by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to activate interferon
(IFN) signaling. Within the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), extracellular cGAMP can be imported into
various cell types, including myeloid cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and fibroblasts, inducing STING-mediated
IFN signaling and eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. However, our research has demonstrated that
cGAMP importation into tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) can adversely induce STING-mediated cell death of the
T cells, and that this is an important mechanism by which tumors evade immune destruction in mouse tumor
models. Thus, STING activation in the TME both positively and negatively regulates antitumor immunity. These
results lead us to propose the hypothesis that tumors evade T cell mediated immune surveillance through
cGAMP importation into tumor-infiltrating T cells that induces a STING-mediated cell death pathway
independently of IFN. The objective of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms of cGAMP-STING-mediated
T cell death, and to develop strategies for blocking STING-mediated T cell death. Given that STING agonists
are now in development for use as cancer therapeutics, directing activation of STING-mediated IFN signaling
while avoiding STING-mediated death of TILs will improve the success of STING agonist therapy. Aim 1 will
identify cGAMP importers and IFN-induced mediators facilitating cGAMP importation into T cells. Aim 2 will
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cooperative activation of STING with TCR signaling in triggering
T cell pyroptosis. Aim 3 will develop novel immunotherapies via blockade of STING-mediated T cell death. The
proposed studies here will elucidate a novel mechanism by which cGAMP is imported into tumor-infiltrating T
cells to activate STING-mediated cell pyroptosis. We anticipate that the insights gained from our studies will
have a significant impact on STING-based cancer immunotherapies."

 Cell fates are important intermediates between age-related molecular events, including damage and

10855101,"Cholangiopathies are incurable bile duct disorders often affecting patients younger than 40 years old and
characterized by biliary obstruction, inflammation, and hyperproliferation leading to cirrhosis and deadly cancer
development in more than 10% of patients. This application aims to answer fundamental questions about the
poorly understood mechanisms promoting inflammation and hyperproliferation during extrahepatic bile duct
(EHBD) injury. The rationale for these studies is that unveiling mechanisms of cellular crosstalk in EHBD
responses to injury can improve understanding of cholangiopathy pathogenesis. Our preliminary data shows
profound cholangiocyte hyperproliferation 24 hours after acute EHBD injury with bile duct ligation (BDL). This is
associated with an upregulation of the Indian Hedgehog (IHH) ligand in cholangiocytes, which targets GLI1+
fibroblasts. IHH upregulation is linked with increased chemokine CXCL1 expression and neutrophil recruitment
to injured EHBDs. In turn, neutrophils promote biliary proliferation. Our data also shows that post-BDL, biliary
hyperproliferation is associated with increased expression of pro-proliferative IL1Î² in neutrophils and AP-1
transcription factor complex in cholangiocytes. Our project will uncover molecular signaling in the complex
crosstalk between cholangiocytes, fibroblasts and neutrophils. The overarching hypothesis for this proposal is
that IHH orchestrates EHBD response to injury by inducing CXCL1 in GLI1+ fibroblasts to recruit
neutrophils, which in turn upregulates the IL1Î²/AP-1 axis to promote cholangiocyte proliferation. We will
use state-of-the art in vivo mouse approaches combined with in vitro human and mouse organoid, fibroblast, and
neutrophil culture models. BDL will model obstructive cholangiopathy. Aim 1 will focus on mechanisms of GLI1+
fibroblast-mediated neutrophil recruitment into injured EHBDs and test the effects of HH-activated fibroblasts
and CXCL1 on neutrophil migration. We will use primary fibroblast and neutrophil cultures for in vitro analyses.
Mouse loss-of-function models will be used to test the effects of CXCL1 inhibition on neutrophil influx. Aim 2 will
test if neutrophils promote biliary proliferation via an IL1Î²/AP-1-dependent mechanism. We will use
genetic/pharmacologic mouse models to test the effects of cell-specific Il1Î² and AP-1 deletion on biliary
proliferation post-BDL. RNAseq and ATACseq approaches will define transcriptional changes to IL1Î²/AP-1
signaling/targets and accessibility of AP-1 binding sites post-BDL. Aim 3 will define GLI1 target genes relevant
to EHBD injury response. We will map GLI1 DNA targets using epitope-tagged mouse fibroblasts and determine
HH/GLI1-mediated gene expression changes with RNAseq from EHBDs of ligated mice treated with a HH
inhibitor. In addition, in Aims 1-3 we will analyze archived biliary tissues from patients with/without
cholangiopathies for HH, CXCL1, IL1Î² and AP-1 expression. Ultimately, defining the mechanisms that regulate
cellular crosstalk in EHBD injury responses may inform novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in
patients with cholangiopathies."

10862178,"Project 3: ABSTRACT
Smell deficits detected by established psychophysical measures are reproducibly reported in patients with
schizophrenia (SZ). Importantly, smell deficits are correlated with specific clinical features, such as negative
symptoms (e.g., avolition, anhedonia) and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social cognitive deficits), but not with
positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion). Smell deficits are found in SZ from the early stages of the
disease, and to a milder extent, in the first-degree relatives, indicating that smell deficits are a reflection of
fundamental disease pathophysiology rather than mere secondary outcomes of confounding factors (e.g.,
medications) in SZ. The olfactory epithelium (OE) is the most peripheral component of the olfactory system,
located outside the cranium. Thus, OE is highly influenced by environmental stressors, such as viral infection
and air pollution. Molecular changes in the OE in SZ have been reported from many groups. Nevertheless,
whether and how pathological changes in OE contributes to clinical manifestation in SZ still remains to be
elucidated. We have recently obtained evidence that immune/inflammatory changes associated with redox
imbalance may be one of the most prominent alterations in the OE pathology in SZ. Furthermore, we have
observed that the OE molecular changes (inflammation, redox) are significantly correlated with OB volume
changes and negative symptoms in SZ. In parallel, we observed that a mouse model of local chronic OE
inflammation affects the pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and resultant behavioral changes
(including those in positive valence systems), which may be mediated by the olfactory-prefrontal circuits.
Based on these compelling evidence, we hypothesize that molecular and cellular changes in the OE
significantly contribute to specific clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits in SZ patients, which
is mediated by the olfactory-prefrontal circuits. We expect that OE pathology in SZ is a major contributory
mechanism for negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits. In this Project, we will define OE pathology in
SZ patients at the tissue level via immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing (Aim 1). By
leveraging the homogeneity of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs), we will further define OE pathology in SZ in
greater detail using bulk RNA sequencing and aim to identify key molecules for OE pathology in SZ (Aim 2).
By using the key molecules, we will aim to stratify SZ patients. Lastly, we will study the relationship between
OE pathology and anatomical/clinical characteristics in SZ (Aim 3). We will conduct correlation analysis and
mediation analysis by utilizing the multimodal data (OE, OB, PFC, and clinical data) from the same subjects.
We will also perform a longitudinal cohort maintenance. Through this study, we plan to establish the OE
pathology and its contributory role to negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits via the olfactory-
prefrontal circuits in early-stage SZ patients."
10862179,"CORE B: ABSTRACT
Core B (Clinical and Imaging Core) will support Projects 1-3 for new clinical and translational research in
schizophrenia (SZ) and relevant animal models. Core B is built on our established cohesive and committed
team of investigators, with experts in clinical enrollment and characterization, olfactory imaging, and cortical
imaging [as a productive outcome of long-term collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Schizophrenia Center
(JHSZC) and the Center for Imaging Science (CIS) at Johns Hopkins University]. Smell deficits are one of the
most reproducible changes in SZ. One key feature of the deficits is their tight association with specific clinical
features, such as negative symptoms (e.g., avolition, anhedonia) and some cognitive deficits (e.g., social
cognitive deficits), but not with positive symptoms (e.g., hallucination, delusion). Since 2009, the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework has facilitated studies that focus on neurobiological processes
underlying behavioral domains/constructs, instead of considering each psychiatric diagnosis as one
homogeneous entity. One innovation of this P50 is translational research with both human and mouse studies
under specific behavioral domains/constructs of interest (mainly, positive valence systems and social
processes) in a mechanistic association with the olfactory-prefrontal circuits to account for specific clinical
domains in SZ. Thus, we will leverage the RDoC research framework to organize our research design. Based
on this framework, this Core B will assist Projects in addressing the central hypothesis that, mediated by the
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, molecular and cellular changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE) significantly
contribute to specific clinical manifestations that correlate with smell deficits in SZ patients. Accordingly, Core
B will recruit new study participants and conduct clinical assessments, combining with the existing cohort (Aim
1). We will leverage a recently established alliance of patient recruitment with the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Center (MPRC) and 10 hospitals in the MedStar Health network. We will pay a special attention to
the confounding factors associated with COVID-19 in study participant recruitment and data analysis in
collaboration with Core C (Core for data analysis). Core B will also collect and process brain imaging data
(Aim 2) to provide ex vivo mouse olfactory bulb (OB) imaging (for Project 1), process 3T resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human healthy subjects (for Project 2), and obtain 3T
structural imaging of the OB and prefrontal cortex from newly recruited subjects in this grant proposal (for

Top Scoring Pairs (kTSP) that was originally invented by Dr. Geman (a PI of this Core) in 2004. Core C MPIs
have made fundamental contributions to computational biology (e.g., the introduction of Gibbs sampler and
random forests). Taking advantage of their expertise, Core C will provide standardized analytic pipelines for
general data analysis, such as power analysis and sample size estimation, group comparison, correlation

and guidance for molecular data analysis (Aim 2), and neuroimaging and multimodal data analysis (Aim 3).
Core C will also provide guidelines for controlling confounding factors and biological variables in molecular,
neuroimaging, and multimodal data analyses. Core C will assist Projects 1 and 3 in investigating pathological
changes in the olfactory epithelium (OE), particularly immune/inflammatory changes and redox imbalance,
across humans and mice through immunohistochemistry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and bulk RNA-
sequencing. To study the impact of the OE pathology on clinical manifestations in schizophrenia (SZ) via the
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, Core C will guide Project 3 to identify key molecules for the OE pathology in SZ,
sub-stratify SZ patients, and perform causal mediation analysis to study relationships among OE pathology,
olfactory-prefrontal circuits, and clinical manifestation. Core C will also guide Project 1 to analyze mouse ex
vivo brain imaging data, assist Project 2 in analyzing mouse electrophysiological data and comparing the
connectivity of the olfactory-prefrontal circuits between control mice and human healthy subjects. In addition,
Core C will guide Project 3 to conduct a pilot longitudinal study. In summary, Core C will support Projects by
central guidance in data analysis using conventional methods in psychiatry and other medical research (Aims
1-3). The other important and innovative role of Core C is to implement a new method (SPA) (Aim 4). This is a
modified version of kTSP, which has been used in cancer and other disease research, in particular enormously
contributing to biomarker exploration. But this method has not yet been applied to psychiatry. SPA is
advantageous in prioritizing key molecules in samples with high heterogeneity via analyzing relationships
between variables, which is less affected by confounding factors. SPA will be used in Projects as an
explorative approach to validate the results in a more sensitive manner. Together, Core C will provide
integrative data science support with both solid/conventional and innovative/novel analytical pipelines."

pathophysiology of disease in order to bring precision medicine to clinical practice. In so doing, RADIANT will
expand and manage a database and biospecimen repository for storage of data and samples from individuals
with rare/atypical forms of diabetes for future analyses.
RADIANT includes 14 clinical centers: Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), University of Chicago, University of
Washington, Seattle Childrenâs Hospital, University of Colorado, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University,
Indiana University, Columbia University, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of Maryland, University of
Michigan, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University in St. Louis. The Data
Coordinating Center at the University of South Florida is responsible for the coordination and support of the
study protocol, data collection and analysis.
The RADIANT Central Laboratory at the University of Florida is responsible for all biochemical analyses,
autoantibody testing, DNA and RNA extraction. Whole-genome sequencing and interpretation is conducted at
the Broad Institute and RNA sequencing at BCM. Plasma metabolomic profiling is performed at Duke
University and monocytes are preserved for pluripotent stem cell derivation at BCM. The study is overseen by
the University of Utah Institutional Review Board.
The genotypic and phenotypic analyses should enhance the identification of cases with atypical diabetes.
Whole-genome sequencing could help identify new genetic variants and metabolomics and transcriptomics
analysis novel pathogenic mechanisms and biomarkers for atypical forms of the disease. Its ultimate goal is to
enable a more precise, etiologically based clinical classification of diabetes."
10862192,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE â PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core is to further RADIANT goals by managing RADIANT resources and demonstrating
leadership to RADIANT committees and special interest groups. RADIANT has an administrative committee
structure and a scientific committee structure. Committee leadership, membership and overall responsibilities
are approved by the Steering Committee. Committee chairs are appointed for a minimum term of 1 year at
which point they will be reassessed by the Steering Committee to ensure committee objectives and goals are
being reached. Administrative committees focus on protocol operations and are overseen by the Steering
Committee. The following are the administrative committees: Coordinators, Recruitment and Retention,
Protocol Oversight (previously Protocol Implementation), and Laboratory Implementation. Scientific committees
are focused on the identification of rare and atypical forms of diabetes (Adjudication Committee, Discovery
Team, Publications and Presentations), Ancillary Studies/Data Access, and the analysis of accumulating data
(Special Interest Groups (SIG)) to ensure comprehensive oversight of study outcomes, additional scientific
discovery (e.g., deeper phenotyping) and data analysis. 14 SIGs have been established thus far to focus on
next steps for phenotypic cohorts, cases with promising genetic variants, and genome exploration. The
Administrative Core also oversees the design and implementation of the RADIANT website. The RADIANT
DCC continues to expand and implement the RADIANT platform, an enterprise level web-based portal for the
RADIANT network which provides applications and services that enables users to identify, screen, enroll, and
collect data from individuals with atypical diabetes, as well as store, manage, analyze, and share those
data. The system also includes applications for specimen collection, tracking, laboratory results and analysis,
adverse events tracking, reporting, data compliance, and study staff and committee communications and
collaboration."
10862193,"DATABASE AND REPOSITORY CORE â PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The specific aim of this Core is to support the establishment and management of a database and to manage a
biospecimen repository of individuals/families with new/atypical forms of diabetes. The database consists of
information provided on electronic case report forms by RADIANT enrollees, supplemental information from
their health care providers, laboratory and physical findings (including images) from a standard in-person visit,
whole genomic, RNA, and mitochondrial sequencing data collected over the three stages of the protocol. The
database also include metabolomics data on all enrolled participants. These data are augmented by
phenotypic and genomic interpretations provided by RADIANT investigators as new and atypical forms of
diabetes are studied.
The data management system developed for RADIANT utilizes a web browser user interface interacting with
an Oracle database backend. This approach is utilized on other multi-institutional settings and offers enhanced
functionality through minimal deployment effort, advanced user experiences and suitability for multi-institutional
or multinational use. The system emphasizes development of electronic interfaces from the laboratories or any
other electronic clinical record and, in such cases, no manual data entry is required. The application software
designed for data collection are primarily developed in Microsoft Integrated Development Environment utilizing
the Microsoft .NET Framework. The .NET Framework includes components such as ASP.NET, Web API,
Entity Framework, and JavaScript support. The main programming languages used to develop applications
include C#, JavaScript, and PL/SQL. The data are collected via interactive web interfaces, data uploads, and
XML/JSON formatted web services and APIs. Server-side services are used for dynamic data processing.
Data collected are primarily stored in an Oracle and SQL Servers databases. Data persistence is
accomplished with a combination of object relational frameworks and database stored procedures.
RADIANT also is building a biosample repository to support future testing, deeper phenotyping and the long
term goal of providing samples to the NIDDK Biorepository to be made available to the wider scientific
community. The biospecimen tracking platform, along with the RADIANT database, implements data
standards, terminologies, ontologies, models, and guidelines to the greatest extent possible and in compliance
with NIH direction. Data standards, terminologies, and ontologies exist throughout clinical medicine from
diagnoses to medications and laboratory identifiers. Leveraging these standards extensively will make
RADIANT data computable and classifiable while facilitating data sharing and integration."
10851503,"Olfactory perception relies on the brainâs ability to extract and represent different features of an odor stimulus.
For example, stimulus intensity and identity are fundamental stimulus features that must be segmented for
accurate perception; the same odor can be encountered in the environment at different strengths. Rodent work
has identified a number of neural correlates of odor concentration and chemical structure, but it remains
unclear how these representations relate to perceptual intensity and identity. A major gap in our understanding
of odor perception is the missing link between direct perceptual ratings (easily obtainable in humans) and
neural responses (much easier to obtain in rodents). Research proposed here aims to determine how odor
intensity and identity are presented in human brain, both in human piriform cortex and across distinct
networks defined by low and high frequency oscillations. We will accomplish these aims using direct invasive
recordings of neural activity from human olfactory cortex, while single-trial perceptual ratings are collected.
Our findings will reveal how odor features are represented in the human brain, contributing fundamental basic
understanding of the olfactory system. Olfactory brain areas are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimerâs Disease, Parkinsonâs Disease and epilepsy. Increased understanding of coding mechanisms in
these areas, and interactions between these areas and the rest of the brain may lead to better understanding of
the mechanisms of diseases that involve olfactory cortical areas."
10850293,"ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses a serious global health issue, affecting millions globally, with a
concerning rise in younger age groups. T2DM patients often suffer from hypoglycemia, typically medication-
induced, leading to severe consequences and cognitive impairment. Frequent hypoglycemic episodes can give
rise to 'hypoglycemia unawareness,' escalating the risk of severe hypoglycemia and cognitive decline, including
dementia. Investigating cognitive alterations induced by hypoglycemia in T2DM patients is complex due to the
interplay of vascular responses, brain activity, and cognitive functions. Current functional imaging techniques
can visualize brain vascular parameters but lack compatibility with behavioral assessments, creating a challenge
to correlate brain activity with cognitive functions.
Our research project aims to unravel the intricate connections between vascular responses and cognitive
dysfunction influenced by recurrent hypoglycemia. To achieve this, we will employ a novel head-mounted dual-
modality photoacoustic/ultrasound localization (PAUL) imaging technique. With its exceptional resolution, PAUL
imaging allows us to visualize detailed patterns of brain blood flow and blood oxygenation, providing data on par
with fMRI. We anticipate that this advanced imaging method will enable the visualization of dynamic changes
in brain vascular signatures during cognitive assessments. Through this innovative approach, we expect to gain
valuable insights into the association between hypoglycemia and cognitive impairment.
Our approach involves three distinct aims. First, we plan to investigate the effects of various hypoglycemia
conditions on brain vascular responses in anesthetized rats with T2DM. By inducing diabetes in middle-aged
rats and employing PAUL imaging, we aim to record vascular responses under varying insulin-induced
hypoglycemia levels, frequencies, and recurrent lengths. Second, we will design a lightweight head-mounted
probe for high-quality PAUL imaging of brain vascular responses in freely moving rats, reducing stress during
cognitive assessments. Lastly, we aim to scrutinize the brain vascular signatures and cognitive functions in rats
with recurrent hypoglycemia. This will involve assessing cognitive behaviors while simultaneously imaging brain
blood flow and oxygenation, alongside monitoring glucose levels."
10850295,"Project Summary
The overall prevalence of human voice disorders is relatively high, particularly among professions that rely on
proper voice production. The primary source of voice production in humans is the vibration of the vocal folds
(a.k.a. vocal cords) of the larynx. Precise contraction of laryngeal muscles, which changes the tension on the
vocal folds, is responsible for controlling the primary pitch of our voice, as process called vocal fold posturing.
While experiments on excised tissue and computational models can help elucidate the role that the muscle
contraction plays in controlling vocal pitch, clinical voice assessment is still required to diagnose disfunction, plan
treatment strategies, and monitor patient recovery following surgeries or other therapies. Recommended clinical
protocols for voice assessment include laryngeal endoscopy, acoustic measurements, and aerodynamic
pressure and flow measurements. Of these, only high-speed endoscopy, an invasive technique that inhibits
proper feedback, can image the vocal fold vibrations in live subjects.
Recently, however, Ultrasound imaging has been shown to improve the assessment of certain pathologies of
the vocal folds, which is less invasive, cheaper and allows for better visualization of internal anatomy. This study
proposes to develop a novel US elastography technique to allow for the non-invasive measurement of patient
specific, non-linear elastic VF properties on a live subject who can provide biofeedback during evaluation.
Our long-term goal is to develop a technique that will allow for the patient-specific evaluation of vocal fold
vibratory characteristics to improve diagnosis and monitoring of voice pathologies. This proposal serves as a
critical first step toward this goal, with the objective herein to demonstrate that our technique can accurately
measure the changes in the vocal fold mechanical properties with increasing FFP. Our central hypothesis is that
the measurement of vocal fold vibrations will allow us to study the relationship between the apparent vocal fold
stiffness and voice pitch, and that characterizing this relationship will lead to a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of
a range of voice disorders, including atrophy, the scarring or stiffening of the folds, vocal fold nodules, and
paralysis, which could lead to more effective treatment and better outcomes for patients with voice disorders."
10853103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The impact of mitochondrial biology on human cancers is broad because these organelles are critical regulators
of metabolism, proliferation, metastasis, and cell death. Indeed, mitochondrial aberrations are common in
multiple cancer types â not only do mitochondrial dysfunctions correlate with disease pathogenesis, but aberrant
mitochondria also negatively impact upon chemotherapeutic success. Within a cell, mitochondrial homeostasis
is maintained by a process referred to as âmitochondrial dynamicsâ, which is essential for efficient ATP
generation, mitochondrial metabolites/substrates distribution, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity.
Homeostatic mitochondrial dynamics result from the cumulative nature of complementary cycles of mitochondrial
division and fusion. Work from my laboratory demonstrates: (1) the mitochondrial division machinery is essential
for cellular transformation, (2) mitochondrial division is chronically activated in RAS-transformed murine cells
and human cancer lines harboring oncogenic mutations within the MAPK pathway, (3) chronic mitochondrial
division is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell metabolism, and (4) FDA-approved
targeted therapies that inhibit oncogenic MAPK signaling turn off the mitochondrial division machinery. While the
above studies link chronic mitochondrial division to cancer biology, mechanistic explanations for how chronic
mitochondrial division promotes organelle dysfunction and cancer phenotypes are scarce. In this R01
application, our goals are to (1) provide key mechanistic details into the process and contributions of
mitochondrial dysfunction during oncogenic transformation, and (2) develop novel translational tools focused on
the detection and inhibition of chronic mitochondrial division to enhance cancer prognosis and treatment. As our
expertise and resources are in dermatology, we will focus on melanoma. The presence of mtDNA mutations and
mitochondrial aberrations in cancer have been described for decades, but the molecular events that drive these
changes and their impact on cancer biology remain speculative. To address this knowledge gap, we recently
completed an unbiased screen using normal melanocytes and melanoma cell lines to understand how chronic
mitochondrial division impacts on mitochondrial function, and identified that loss-of-function mtDNA mutations
are essential for cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that oncogene-
induced chronic mitochondrial division promotes mtDNA mutations and organelle heterogeneity to instigate
transformation. Based on our data, chronic mitochondrial division is an early event during melanomagenesis,
and provides strong prognostic value and therapeutic potential. This project emerged following years of effort to
identify how chronic mitochondrial division impacts cancer mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment."
10850133,"Antibodies and other binding proteins are indispensable tools for molecular recognition, but these protein-
based reagents lack key chemical features found in small molecules that mediate enzyme inhibition, covalent

that cannot be accessed using conventional proteins or small molecules. To realize the full potential of this

previously A) characterized and improved genetic code expansion in yeast to broaden access to ncAAs during
yeast display; and B) discovered potent, âchemically expandedâ enzyme inhibitors in high-throughput screens.
Building off of these initial successes, we propose to pursue the following three directions:
 Direction 1: âHarmonizeâ yeast ncAA incorporation systems with tools available in other cell

 use in yeast. Our engineering approach leverages our OTS engineering expertise and has the potential
 to dramatically but efficiently expand the chemistries available for genetic code expansion in yeast.
 Direction 2: Elucidate combinations of molecular and genetic/genomic engineering strategies
 that improve ncAA incorporation in yeast. Our prior work has identified several approaches to
 enhancing ncAA incorporation in yeast, including unprecedented strain engineering and translation
 apparatus engineering. We propose to investigate which combinations of strategies yield additive or
 synergistic improvements to ncAA incorporation. These are fundamentally important investigations of
 genetic code expansion systems that, to our knowledge, have never been studied in any organism.
 Direction 3: Illuminate the interplay between chemical functionality and synthetic antibody
 diversity during enzyme inhibitor discovery. NcAAs enable presentation of chemistries that inhibit
 enzymes via rapid bioorthogonal conjugations and directly through ncAA side chain chemistries. We
 propose to use first-generation and newly designed second-generation ncAA-containing antibody
 libraries in combination with metalloproteinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase targets to understand
 how to best leverage both conjugates and directly encoded chemistries during inhibitor discovery.
Our uniquely positioned research program will reveal crucial principles of protein biosynthesis and enzyme

10857272,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Work capacity is a measure of health expressed in relation to the functional demands of the work
environment. Specifically, it is the capacity to perform a job or set of jobs, and represents the interaction
between an individualâs cognitive, physical, psychomotor, and sensory abilities and the demands of the
job. However, in existing data, individualsâ health-related functional abilities are not measured in a way
that permits direct comparison to the functional demands of occupations. The goal of the proposed
research is to investigate how functional abilities increase and limit work capacity, how these effects
interact with human capital acquired earlier in life, and how opportunities for people with different
functional ability profiles and skills vary across local areas and industries, shaping their prospects for
independence and healthy aging. We will first develop a new conceptual framework for assessing
health-related work capacity which integrates measurement of cognitive, physical, psychomotor, and
sensory abilities with the measurement of occupational ability requirements. Based on this framework,
we will design two surveys that will enable us to assess functional abilities and skills on the same scale
and in the same way in which the ability and skill requirements of occupations in the national economy
are measured. The surveys will be fielded to a nationally representative sample of individuals
regardless of their current work status. We will use the new data to integrate functional abilities and
skills with federal data on occupational requirements to produce individualized estimates of work
capacity. We will analyze how the new measures of health-related work capacity vary by age, how they
differ across demographic groups, and how they are potentially constrained by functional decline in
abilities, skill limitations, and lack of occupational opportunities in local areas and across industries."
10833093,"Myelinating glial function is fundamental for brain health and its impairment is detected in a growing number of
psychiatric and neurological disorders. Studying the basic mechanisms regulating the progression of progenitors into
myelinating oligodendrocytes in the developing and adult brain therefore has substantial implications for a better
understanding of the mechanisms regulating proper brain function, while informing on potential causes for dysfunction,
and providing the framework for the design of novel therapeutic strategies.
Our lab has pioneered the concept of epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. We identified
DNA and histone changes responsible for repression of gene expression during developmental myelination and in adult
remyelination, identified the responsible enzymes and defined their functional significance using transgenic mice,
characterized them in the context of neuropathology and evaluated translational implications. We also reported impaired
epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation in aging, in animal models of depression and in post-mortem
Multiple Sclerosis human brains. We collaborated with chemical engineers to develop compounds with the ability to
reverse some of the epigenetic changes. We also made unanticipated discoveries on the cross-talk between gut
metabolites, social experiences, mechanical stimuli and myelination.
In broad terms our objective is to understand the mechanisms that allow the chemical, metabolic and physical
environment to induce a biological response in progenitor cells and result in the formation of myelin, proliferation and
transformation of persistence of an undifferentiated state in the developing and adult brain. Our ultimate goal is to
decipher the signals driving the differentiation of progenitors into myelinating glia, in order to inform on the design of
regenerative strategies. In this application we propose an interdisciplinary approach, which includes the integration of
several disciplines to develop new tools and experimental approaches for the discovery of novel modalities of signal
transduction. We propose to use cell biology, biophysics, advanced imaging spectroscopy, nanotechnology and super
resolution microscopy and new transgenic lines, epigenomic and proteomic approaches to addresses key open questions in
the field.
The proposed studies will develop new concepts and set the foundation on how progenitors interpret specific metabolic
signals, mechanical forces, neuronal activity to regulate brain function. We expect that the results of the proposed
experimental plan will set the stage for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for several neurological and
psychiatric disorders, while advancing current knowledge of brain development and myelin formation."
10833094,"ABSTRACT
A progressive breakdown in the bilayered structure of the mammary gland is the hallmark of all breast cancers,
but the structural change that occurs between ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC) is of particular importance because it represents a major inflection point in risk for patients. Breast cancers
originate in the inner luminal layer of the mammary epithelium, where transformed luminal epithelial cells (LEP)
proliferate to fill the ducts and lobules in DCIS. Surprisingly, LEP in DCIS have acquired all the necessary
genetic aberrations to invade, but remain constrained within the tissue by an intact outer myoepithelial (MEP)
layerâa group of cells that forms a dynamic barrier blocking access of the in situ tumor to the basement
membrane (BM, the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the mammary epithelium). Thus, we
propose that translocation of transformed LEP past the MEP layer, and not genetic mutations, is a key rate-
limiting step in progression to IDC. Here, we aim to identify the physical and molecular changes that must occur
in LEP to facilitate this structural transition. We approach this challenge through the lens of mammary epithelial
self-organization. We previously demonstrated that normal human LEP and MEP can self-organize in vitro, and
that the capacity of MEP to exclude LEP from the BM is determined by hard-wired and lineage-specific interfacial
tensions at each cell-cell and cell-ECM interface. We showed using experiments and mathematical modeling
that the LEP-ECM interface is highly unfavorable energetically compared to the MEP-ECM interface, which
prevents LEP from positioning themselves next to the BM. We hypothesize the existence of a rate-limiting and
high-energy structural intermediate during the progression of DCIS to IDC, where LEP translocate into the MEP
layer, next to the BM. We propose a statistical mechanical framework for understanding how perturbations to
the interfacial properties and dynamics of tumor cells facilitate the formation of this intermediate. Specifically, we
predict that changes to the LEP-ECM interfacial energy are a critical physical change necessary to promote
basal translocation of transformed LEP. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis: we found that a frequently
dysregulated geneâPIK3CAâdisrupts self-organization when activated in LEP by rendering the LEP-ECM
interface more energetically favorable. In this proposal, we will determine whether this and other physical
changes to LEP are necessary for their basal translocation, and identify the molecular changes downstream of
PIK3CA that give rise to these physical changes. We will test our hypothesis using complementary in vitro and
in vivo experimental systems: using organoids reconstituted from human reduction mammoplasty tissues and
genetically engineered mouse models. Our long-term goal is to reveal the changes that promote and inhibit
progression from DCIS to IDC. Better physical and molecular predictors of progression would benefit DCIS
patients who would otherwise be over-treated, as only a third of DCIS cases progress to IDC. Further, blocking
LEP translocation would represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent breast cancer progression."

Autoimmune epilepsy has been treated with immunomodulation with promising results in clinical observational
studies, but the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune epilepsy remains problematic. The value of neural
autoantibodies as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers of an autoimmune etiology of seizures has been limited
because of imperfect sensitivity and lack of correlation with clinical course. In this proposal, we propose to bridge
the diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker gap in this field by using novel imaging methods that could be broadly
applicable tools and help elucidate neuroinflammatory mechanisms of disease in this group of patients who may
be candidates for etiology-targeted treatment. In aim 1, we will perform TSPO-PET imaging, with a novel
radioligand ([11C]ER176), to quantify and visualize microglial activation in patients with definite autoantibody
positive autoimmune epilepsy, and clinically suspected but antibody negative autoimmune epilepsy, and
compare them to disease controls (focal epilepsy of known structural cause) and healthy controls. In aim 2, we
will perform traditional and novel DCE MRI to quantify and visualize blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in the
same definite and clinically suspected autoimmune epilepsy groups, compared to disease and healthy controls.
In a small validation cohort, we will also perform CSF to serum albumin ratios to validate our imaging
measurements of BBB disruption. In aim 3, we will repeat TSPO-PET and DCE-MRI after standard of care
immunomodulation is administered to subjects with definite autoimmune epilepsy and correlate changes in 1)
TSPO uptake and 2) BBB disruption as measured by DCE-MRI, with subacute seizure outcomes. These aims
will be achieved through a collaboration between the Division of Epilepsy and the Center for Advanced Imaging
Innovation and Research at NYU, including epileptologists, clinical neuroradiologists, and imaging scientists. By
using novel imaging methods that measure different neuroinflammatory mechanisms, we will move beyond the
sole reliance on neural autoantibodies for the diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy and develop potential surrogate
markers of disease that may be able to not only detect, but track disease activity in the context of treatment."

Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively
impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will
develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment
decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (âconnectomeâ) is
significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to
any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with
machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The
proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the
overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients
with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any
treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again
1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked
intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a
total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment
status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for
comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post-
chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient-
related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome
organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as
changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory-
motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI
and may also help us refine our prediction models."
10832988,"This is an application for a first renewal of the T32 Fellowship Program in Global Mental Health at the
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (JHSPH). We are currently the only NIH-funded predoctoral program
specifically focused on Global Mental Health and the only Global Mental Health postdoctoral program located
in a school of public health. The global mental health training program is an important part of the Department of
Mental Health academic program, with nearly a third of all doctoral applicants indicating an interest in global
issues annually. Each year, an average of 3-5 competitive applicants to the Departments of International
Health and Epidemiology, two other departments that participate in this training program, indicate an interest in
mental and behavioral health issues from a cross-cultural and global perspective. In the initial funding years of
this training program we have trained 11 T32 trainees including 6 predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral Fellows. In
the initial years of this program, 73% of our predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees have been women, 33% of
our predoctoral trainees have been from Under-Represented Minority (URM) ethnic groups, 20% of our
postdoctoral trainees have had a disability and 40% of our postdoctoral trainees are new immigrants/green
card holders which is a particularly relevant category for global mental health capacity building. All trainees
with at least one year in the program have published multiple peer-reviewed papers. Trainees who have
completed our postdoctoral fellowship have obtained 1 K award and 1 Gates Grand Challenges award. Three
of our first four predoctoral trainees have obtained individual NRSA awards; two of our predoctoral trainees
have completed their doctoral education and have obtained a postdoctoral fellowship and a scientist position at
the American Psychiatric Association. We place major emphasis on career development. A personalized
Individual Development Plan (IDP) is created with each trainee early in the course of the Fellowship. The
Fellowship program includes individual mentoring along with field-based experiences in low- and middle-
income countries. This renewal application proposes to increase the number of predoctoral training slots from
4 to 6 and maintain 2 postdoctoral slots to support expansion to a broader range of mental health problems,
including Autism and Suicide, and more opportunities to work with highly vulnerable populations such as those
affected by HIV. Over the next 5 years, we will increase our focus on prevention and early intervention
research, integrating mental health services into other care systems, and add a focus on implementation
science through research on sustaining mental health services. We will continue to emphasize professional
development in grantsmanship and manuscript development, applied research with colleagues from diverse
cultural and contextual backgrounds, and diversity of trainees. We have developed a strong plan for evaluation
of the training process including short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term outcomes, including research
productivity for fellows."

 The neural circuits controlling motor behaviors vital to mammals, including walking, breathing, and
balance, rely on the ability of neurons within the spinal cord to establish selective connections during
development. Work over the past decade has provided a fairly comprehensive understanding of the
genetic pathways that determine the identity of each major neuronal class within the neural tube. The
mechanisms through which neurons acquire subtype identities necessary for the incorporation into a
particular motor circuit are, however, still poorly defined. Our studies on the specification of spinal
motor neurons indicate that the large family of Hox transcription factors play key roles in generating
the hundreds of subtypes required for selective innervation of muscle. Hox proteins orchestrate
genetic programs that control diverse aspects of motor neuron maturation, including their topographic
organization, peripheral target muscle specificity, and presynaptic partners. Emerging studies from
our group also indicate that Hox genes function in multiple neuronal classes to shape synaptic
specificity during development, suggesting a broader role in circuit assembly. The overall goals of the
proposed research are to elucidate the mechanisms of neural diversification and connectivity within
the spinal cord, and to determine how Hox-dependent and -independent genetic programs establish
the circuit architectures necessary for motor control. Ultimately, we hope to uncover the pathways
through which genetically encoded developmental programs contribute to the emergence of specific
motor behaviors. Our approach integrates selective genetic manipulations of neuronal subtypes,
genome-wide interrogation of regulatory networks, modern circuit-tracing methods, comparative
analyses in multiple vertebrate organisms, and rigorous analyses of behavior. Elucidating the basic
mechanisms of motor circuit assembly will provide foundational insights relevant to the design of
therapeutic strategies to treat degenerative diseases of spinal neurons or repair motor circuits
damaged by injury."

 Project Summary
 The general body plan of most animals follows a bilateral symmetry. Some organs such as the heart and
liver break this gross anatomical symmetry, while other structures such as the brain display a superficial
bilaterally symmetric anatomy. Nonetheless, it has been known for a long time that the two hemispheres of the
human brain serve distinct functions, and many classical examples in neuroscience and psychology have
shown the importance of asymmetry in brain function. For example, higher order cognitive abilities such as
language, spatial orientation, attention, and visual processing exhibit left-right (L-R) functional asymmetries in
humans. Of note, many neuropsychiatric conditions including autism spectrum disorders, depression,
schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder display defects in brain laterality, further underscoring the
importance of lateralized brain function. Not surprisingly, neuropsychiatric conditions often have a genetic and,
hence possibly, a developmental component. Most of these conditions are also influenced by environmental
factors, yet how the environment interfaces with connectivity remains largely unknown. We have identified an
asymmetric synaptic connection between two pairs of sensory neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans that changes in response to experience. Importantly, this connection is controlled cell-non-
autonomously from other cells by insulin signaling, which in turn is regulated by experience. This provides a
paradigm to investigate, on a molecular level and in single cell resolution, how the environment can change
hardwiring of a neural circuit in an experience-dependent manner. The goal of this proposal is to investigate
the developmental, plastic and functional aspects of this connection using C. elegans as a model system. In
Specific Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which experience changes connectivity. We will
determine whether transcription or translation is required and whether neuronal activity is necessary and
sufficient, and in which cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of insulin signaling in controlling
synaptic connectivity. Specifically, we will test which insulin-like agonists and antagonists function in which
cells to effect the changes in connectivity; where the receptor functions and in which genetic context. Lastly, in
Specific Aim 3, we will determine how changes in connectivity translate into changes in information flow and
behavior using whole brain calcium imaging and behavioral experiments. In sum, our research program aims
to establish the mechanisms, by which the environment changes synaptic hardwiring and behavior in the
context of an asymmetric synaptic connection."

 Cell death is a powerful immune defense mechanism to limit viral replication within the infected host. In
response, viruses often encode inhibitors that counteract host cell death. For example, many herpesviruses
and poxviruses encode inhibitors of caspases, the key enzymes that execute apoptosis. By subverting host
cell death and the associated inflammatory response, viral cell death inhibitors can also dramatically alter the
outcome of viral diseases.
 Necroptosis is a lytic form of cell death that is optimally induced in the presence of caspase 8 inhibition.
As such, necroptosis has critical roles in controlling viruses that encode caspase inhibitors. Moreover, the
release of âdamage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)â from necroptotic cells can further stimulate anti-
viral inflammation. These anti-viral effects suggest that necroptosis may also be a target of viral inhibition. To
test this hypothesis, we conducted a siRNA screen and found a viral inhibitor from cowpox virus that we have
termed âviral inducer of RIPK3 degradation (vIRD)â. In preliminary studies, we found that vIRD functions by
targeting the essential necroptosis kinase RIPK3 for proteasomal degradation.
 Based on these observations, we propose three aims to further elucidate the function and mechanism
of vIRD. In the first aim, we will evaluate the mechanism by which vIRD from cowpox virus and other related
orthopoxviruses promotes RIPK3 degradation. Studies will include mapping the domain and residues within
vIRD and RIPK3 that are responsible for their physical interaction and ubiquitination. In the second aim, we
will interrogate the role of the host SKP1-Cullin-F box (SCF) complex in vIRD-mediated RIPK3 degradation.
We will also evaluate the effect of vIRD on the global ubiquitination landscape of the infected cell. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate the biological function of vIRD using mouse infection as model. We will infect mice with cowpox
virus or vaccinia virus that differ in their expression of vIRD. The effect of vIRD on cell death, inflammation,
viral replication and tissue pathology will be examined. Collectively, these studies will reveal medically relevant
information on how viruses manipulate the immune system and alter the outcome of viral disease. We expect
the knowledge gained from the proposed study will provide important insight in the design of better and more
efficacious vaccines."

Liquid biopsy is a clinical test that involves the analysis of various biomarkers present in the blood or other
types of body fluids. It enables the detection of cancer at an earlier stage than traditional imaging or tissue
biopsy methods, and thus can lead to reduction of cancer mobility and mortality. As one of the most promising
solutions for cancer early detection, liquid biopsy has the potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis, providing
patients with more effective and less invasive care. The liquid biopsy analytes include circulating tumor cells
(CTCs), circulating tumor DNA, which is part of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), extracellular vesicles, as well other
tumor associated RNAs, proteins and metabolites. These analytes typically have very low levels in blood or
other types of body fluid of early-stage cancer patients, leading to difficulties in obtaining reproducible results
and low sensitivity and specificity for cancer early detection. While many new assays and techniques have
been developed to tackle these challenges, validation of these assays/techniques in different populations
and/or cancer types poses many challenges, and these are the main areas of research supported by the liquid
biopsy consortium (LBC). As Data Management and Coordinating Unit (DMCU) of LBC, we will support state-
of-the-art statistical methods for study design and data analysis, the coordination, implementation, and conduct
of collaborative studies across the consortium and work closely with LBC investigators on data analysis by
statistical methods, machine Learning modeling and Artificial Intelligence. We will also support consortium
coordination and data management, including identification and adoption of standard data elements for liquid
biopsy studies. We seek to establish the DMCU as a leading center for innovation and resources in liquid
biopsy research, and to enhance, improve and maintain LBC network integration and coordination."

The overall objective of the UCLA CBI Training Program is to educate a diverse group of scientists who will
ethically lead rigorous research and training at the interface between chemistry and biology in the decades to
come. Specifically, it is proposed that brilliant chemists who are amateurs in biology will be trained to identify
and rigorously solve the most important problems in biology and be highly collaborative with biologists.
Likewise, it is proposed that the biologist using a chemical technique as a black box will be converted into an
expert who can identify new chemical approaches to solve their biological problems, and who are comfortable
collaborating with chemists. The UCLA CBI Program provides this by breaking down the isolation between
departments, and immersing trainees in state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research that spans the interface of
chemistry and biology. The following specific aims are proposed: First, CBI will train graduate students in the
language and techniques of research at the interface of chemistry and biology. Specifically, chemists will learn
to be able to critically evaluate papers, be familiar with techniques and be able to rigorously discuss research
topics in biology, and vice versa. Second, CBI will teach students the background to understand both the
fundamentals and cutting edge research at the chemistry biology interface to enable them to distill this
information in order to independently apply it to their own research and to develop new ideas. Third, CBI will
enable students to hone their speaking skills and to work effectively in teams, especially with people in biology
for chemists and vice versa. Fourth, the students will be instructed about ethical and responsible conduct of
research so that they follow the ethical principals in their own research and hold these standards to others.
Fifth, CBI trainees will be educated on the fundamentals of rigor and reproducibility in order to apply this to
their own research and enable identification and interpretation of these factors in the work of others. Sixth and
seventh, CBI will empower students to develop to their full potential professionally, providing them with all the
tools necessary to make informed and successful career trajectory decisions and deliver additional mentoring
and oversight on each trainee to enable them to graduate within the average time period for graduate students
at UCLA. Eighth, CBI will provide an inclusive, supportive and diverse environment with approximately equal
numbers of chemically and biologically oriented students, equal numbers of males and females, and 30%
persons from underrepresented groups, as well as individuals with disabilities that have a strong identity as the
UCLA CBI both as trainees and as alumni. To reach these aims a rigorous program of classes, training, and
mentoring, coupled with recruitment and retention of persons from all groups and physical and learning abilities
and a building of a strong UCLA CBI identity are proposed. An excellent team of world class faculty scholars is
assembled who are also focused and serious about training and mentoring. UCLA provides extensive support
and a large and diverse pool of excellent students to draw from to successfully reach these goals."
10839901,"Abstract:
Stress hyperglycemia (SH), defined as a blood glucose (BG) >140 mg/dL, is reported in over 30% of general
surgery patients without a prior history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is associated with an increased risk of
complications and mortality compared to patients maintaining normoglycemia or those with a known history of
DM. It is hypothesized that stress-related increases in counter-regulatory hormones and inflammatory/oxidative
stress markers in susceptible individuals may lead to significant insulin resistance and the development of SH.
However, no prospective studies have determined clinical predictors and underlying mechanisms of SH in
surgical patients. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) examine clinical, metabolic and inflammatory/oxidative
stress profiles of patients at high risk for dysglycemia undergoing general and vascular surgery with, a)
dynamic assessment of insulin secretion and sensitivity, and b) levels of inflammatory/oxidative stress
biomarkers [adiponectin, cortisol, free fatty acids (FFA), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF-Î±), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)]; 2) determine the timing, duration and
severity of SH by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and point of care glucose testing and its association
with biomarker changes; 3) explore the relationship of SH with a composite of perioperative complications
(wound infection, respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute kidney injury and major adverse cardiac events); 4)
conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to determine if single dose administration of dulaglutide, a once
a week antidiabetic agent with low-risk of hypoglycemia, can improve glycemic control in surgical patients
with underlying dysglycemia (prediabetes and newly-diagnosed diabetes) at high risk for developing SH. The
clinical, metabolic, and inflammatory information most strongly associated with SH will be used to develop a
risk stratification model for the identification of surgical patients at high-risk for SH postoperatively.
In addition to delineating risk factors and underlying mechanisms of SH, this proposal will enhance the multi-
faceted research training and career development plan necessary for the PI to become an independent
clinical investigator. The PI will continue to work alongside an experienced mentorship and advisory team
with expertise in inpatient diabetes management, clinical trials in hospital settings, diabetes technology and
biostatistics. This aforementioned training is supported by an institutional commitment to establishing
interdisciplinary research collaborations and advancing the PIâs career in academic research."
10839904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
HIV treatment and prevention approaches are evolving in response to advancements in pharmacotherapies. Yet
in the United States substance using members of key populations such as men of color who have sex with men
(MoCSM) face socio-behavioral barriers that inhibit access and adherence across the HIV Care and Prevention
Cascades that produce HIV relevant biological changes. Elucidation of how substance use affects basic,
biological, behavioral, and social aspects of HIV is vital to advance HIV prevention and treatment. In response
to NIDA RFA-DA-18-011 Cohort Studies of HIV/AIDS and Substance Use (U01), the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA) seeks to continue the MSM and Substances Cohort at UCLA Linking Infections Noting Effects
(MASCULINE or the âmSTUDYâ) established in 2013 and to extend the scientific opportunities it offers for another
five years. Our proposed competitive renewal will sustain and dynamically refresh the cohort of substance-using
HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and high-risk HIV-seronegative (HIV-) MoCSM by retiring older, non-substance-using
members and adding younger substance-users. If renewed, this cohort will continue to add specimens to our
well-characterized, extensive biobehavioral repository and to provide a platform for high-impact science.
Substance use continues to effect adherence to treatment and prevention regimens thereby sustaining high
prevalence networks. Proposed investigators lead the science on studying associations between drug use,
behaviors, and infectious disease and will contribute a broad portfolio of interdisciplinary work from immunology
and basic science to epidemiology, prevention and treatment. This cohort of MoCSM will characterize: (i) effects
of substance use on acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs: gonorrhea, Chlamydia,
syphilis); (ii) the extent to which substance use in MoCSM facilitates behaviors that transmit HIV compared to
non-drug using MoCSM (iii) the effects of substance use and HIV on the mucosal environment; (iv) effect of
substance use on HIV disease progression; and interactions between substance use and HIV infection on the
inflammatory response. We identify the direct ways stimulants, cannabis and other substance use in
combination with specific behaviors can change HIV transmission and progression dynamics in multiple
compartments via immune function and the microbiome. The application also proposes to expand an already
robust biorepository with specimens available for the broader research community. This cohort will be comprised
of 514 MoCSM with repeated data visits. At least half will be active substance users and younger than age 30.
With a fully enrolled cohort, the mSTUDY has begun to produce high impact publications and spinoff research
projects with newly integrated datasets of large sample sizes. The next cycle will further stimulate basic and
biologically innovative science from collaborating investigators, newly established collaborations with other NIDA
cohorts, and externally funded scientists and generate high impact future science."
10839909,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed project, âMapping Cellular Resolution Connectopathies in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease,â will
systematically and comprehensively characterize cell-type specific anatomical and molecular phenotypes across
aging and Alzheimerâs disease (AD) in the entorhinal cortex (ENT): the ground zero of AD pathology. We will
map cellular resolution, age-dependent morpho-molecular phenotypes of ENT projection neurons by performing
single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and methylomic analysis in 2m, 9m, 18m APPSAA-(KI/KI) male and female mice.
Novel genetic sparse labeling will be used to label and characterize morphology of ENT pyramidal neurons in
different cortical layers in APPSAA-(KI/KI)/MORF3/Cux2-CreER and APPSAA-(KI/KI)/MORF3/Etv1-CreER mice.
These studies will provide comprehensive data on how molecularly defined ENT neuronal cell types interact with
age-, sex- and AÎ² pathology to confer progressive transcriptomic/epigenomic, morphological, and synaptic
deficits in vivo. In addition, we will map the age-dependent morpho-molecular phenotypes of ENT projection
neurons in humanized Tau models, MAPT(H1)-GR*N279K and their MAPT(H1) controls. A combined single-
nucleus transcriptomics and genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays will be applied to MAPT(H1)-
GR*N279K and MAPT(H1) male and female mice at 2m, 9m, and 18m to define integrated
transcriptomic/epigenomic ENT neuronal cell types, and to identify neuronal subsets undergoing age-dependent
multi-modal molecular dysregulation in mutant âhumanizedâ Tau mouse models. RNAscope multiplex in situ
hybridization and GeoMX digital spatial profiling analyses will be performed to identify morpho-molecular types
of neurons in ENT that are most affected in MAPT(H1)-GR*N279K knock-in mice compared to MAPT(H1) mice
during aging. To identify age-related connectional vulnerabilities and to map connectivity disruptions in AD, we
will systematically quantify changes of axonal outputs arising from genetically and connectionally defined ENT
cell types using 2m, 9m, 18m male and female Cux2-CreER and Etv1-CreER mice. Cell-type specific connectivity
disruptions also will be examined in two next generation AD mouse models, APP knock-in (APPSAA-KI/KI with
wildtype controls) and MAPT(H1)-GR*N279K [with MAPT(H1) controls], across ages and in both sexes. Novel
viral sparse labeling will be used to characterize age- and AD-related axonal dystrophy, while genetic sparse
labeling in newly generated MORF3 mouse lines will help to identify local morphological changes in ENT cell
types. Age- and AD-related morphological compromises to ENT input neurons will be studied along with their
synaptic disruptions onto different ENT cell types. Finally, we will establish a cloud-based visualization platform
to map the integrated molecular-anatomic circuit deficits of aging and AD to the Allen Common Coordinate
Framework to facilitate dissemination and analysis of the data. Although the focus of the current project is the
ENT, the pipelines established for data production, collection, and analysis can be scaled up to identify brainwide
cell-type specific anatomic-molecular deficits in aging and other late-onset AD mouse models."
10849837,"SUMMARY
Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease which in turn is the major cause of morbidity
and mortality in diabetes. The prevalence of insulin resistance is increasing in the setting of a global obesity
epidemic. The long-term goal is to understand the role of the integrin family of cell surface matrix receptors in
regulating obesity and insulin resistance. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the role of the
Î±vÎ²5 integrin and its ligand, Milk Fat Globule Epidermal Growth Factor like 8 (Mfge8), in regulating skeletal
muscle insulin resistance. The central hypothesis is that insulin accelerates movement of MFGE8 through the
endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi network and subsequently to the outer plasma membrane where it binds Î±vÎ²5;
Î±vÎ²5 subsequently interacts with a complex containing the insulin receptor leading to dampening of insulin
receptor signaling and that disruption of the MFGE8-integrin pathway will ameliorate insulin resistance. These
hypotheses are based on data showing that acute disruption of the MFGE8/Î±vÎ²5 pathway modulates skeletal
muscle insulin-mediated glucose uptake and tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of the Insulin Receptor Î²
subunit (IRÎ²) and the Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS1) coupled with evidence that the insulin receptor
interacts directly with the Î±vÎ²5 integrin and that this interaction is strengthened by insulin as well as by MFGE8
(1). These hypotheses will be tested through 3 specific aims: 1) determining the cellular mechanism by which
insulin induces cell surface enrichment of MFGE8; 2) investigating whether the MFGE8-Î±vÎ²5 pathway induces
insulin resistance by regulating dephosphorylation of IRÎ² and IRS1; 3) investigating the contribution of skeletal
muscle MFGE8/Î²5 signaling in regulating basal and obesity-induced insulin resistance. Aim 1 will determine
how insulin promotes skeletal muscle plasma membrane Mfge8 localization and binding to Î±vÎ²5 which then
activates downstream signaling leading to reduced insulin sensitivity. Aim 2 will examine how activation of the
Mfge8-integrin axis leads to increase activity of the phosphatase PTP1Î² which subsequently dephosphorylates
and inactivates the insulin receptor in skeletal muscle leading to reduced plasma membrane translocation of
Glucose Transporter 4 and reduced glucose uptake. Aim 3 will examine the therapeutic potential of systemic
blockade of the Î²5 integrin or MFGE8 in ameliorating insulin resistance in a mouse model of diet-induced
obesity and insulin resistance and the relative contribution of skeletal muscle to this process. The proposed
research is innovative, because it identifies a mechanism by which insulin activates an integrin pathway that
subsequently feeds back to terminate insulin signaling. The proposed research is significant because it has the
potential to inform the development of novel therapeutics that treat insulin resistance."

Obesity, nutrition, and diabetes research in the United States suffers from a lack of diversity in the research
community, as underrepresented (UR) investigators face more challenges than their majority counterparts and
leave academic research positions at a higher rate. We propose a comprehensive longitudinal career
advancement program, Creating Opportunities for Underrepresented Researchers to Achieve Growth and
Excellence (COURAGE), to provide skill-building, leadership development, hands-on mentored experience in
manuscript writing and grant preparation, and multi-level mentoring to support UR researchers in obesity,
nutrition, and diabetes. Two cohorts of 10 COURAGE Scholars will be recruited to participate in a 3+ year
program. The first two years will consist of group and individualized curricula, mentored research and writing
experiences, execution of the pilot project, and multi-level mentoring. Year 3 onward will consist of ongoing
mentoring from faculty and program leadership, continued engagement with COURAGE peers, and access to
program resources. The MPIs leading COURAGE are accomplished researchers who bring complementary
expertise in implementing programs to advance early-career researchers from UR backgrounds. Dr. Morone
led a successful UR career development program at the University of Pittsburg and is now MPI of an NIH U01
testing this year-long intervention at sites around the country. Her expertise in implementing skill-building
curricula makes her ideally suited to lead Aim 1, to provide a longitudinal program of skill-building to promote
success in obesity, nutrition, and diabetes research. Dr. Stanley has extensive experience mentoring fellows
and junior faculty, and she leads the successful pilot and feasibility program for the Nutrition Obesity Research
Center at Harvard. She is thus ideally suited to lead Aim 2, to mentor COURAGE Scholars in the successful
completion of pilot projects and application for an NIH grant. Dr. Stanford is an accomplished national leader
and advocate for diversity within academic medicine; she is ideally suited to lead Aim 3, to prepare Scholars
for academic leadership. Scholars will build a mentorship network that includes their peers, the MPIs, the
Program Director, Dr. Mattei, the COURAGE epidemiologist Dr. Fox, and COURAGE faculty mentors. Scholars
will complete the program with key deliverables including at least one submitted manuscript, a completed pilot
project, and a submitted grant application. This program is a collaboration between multiple academic
institutions: Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University, Boston Medical Center/Boston University,
Morehouse School of Medicine, and University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. COURAGE program
leadership and mentors represent all these institutions, and Scholars will be recruited representing each of
these institutions. At the completion of COURAGE, Scholars will have enhanced academic and leadership
skills, mentored research and writing experience with completed manuscript(s) and grant submissions, and a
robust mentoring network that will continue supporting them as they move forward in their careers."

This application seeks support for early-stage training of doctoral students in the neurosciences at Duke
University. The goal of this comprehensive, broad-based, interdisciplinary Neurobiology Training Program
(NBTP) is to train top-level neurobiologists for research-oriented positions in academia, industry, and related
arenas. The application seeks funding for 8 predoctoral trainees each year, 4 in their first year and 4 in their
second year. Drs. Richard Mooney, JÃ¶rg Grandl, and Lindsey Glickfeld serve as the Program Director, Director
of Graduate Studies, and Assisting Student Advisor, respectively, and direct the program in concert.
Preceptors are drawn from 16 departments across the School of Medicine, the School of Engineering and the
College of Arts and Sciences and represent a broad diversity of fields including molecular, cellular, circuits,
systems, behavioral, computational, translational and cognitive neuroscience. Preceptors include scientists
with long and distinguished records of achievement as well as recently recruited, talented young faculty. A
large pool of >250 applicants per year permits recruitment of a talented, diverse class of ~10 new trainees
each fall. Close to half of the matriculants will be supported in their first year by the Duke Graduate School,
which enables the program to pull from international as well as domestic pools.
Trainees undergo extensive training including demanding coursework addressing the depth and breadth of
fundamental and translational neuroscience, including experimental design, technical implementation, data
analysis, and interpretation. Required course work emphasizes molecular and cellular neuroscience; circuits
and systems neuroscience; the neurobiology of disease; quantitative, statistical and computational
neuroscience methods; scientific writing and grant writing; written and oral presentation; teaching and career
development. Individual thesis committees, the Director of Graduate Studies and Assisting Student Advisor,
and the Program Steering Committee carefully monitor trainees progress throughout the entire period of
graduate training.
Students in our program are expected to obtain their doctoral degree within 5-6 years and to publish original
research articles stemming from their doctoral studies. Upon completion of postdoctoral fellowships and clinical
training (where applicable), we expect that our graduates will secure tenure-track faculty positions in research
institutions, obtain neuroscience-related jobs in industry, use their neuroscience training to practice medicine,
and teach and train the next generation of neuroscientists at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
The NBTP makes extensive efforts to recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups. The goal of
the program is to train a new and diverse generation of scientists equipped with the knowledge, imagination
and insight needed to cross disciplinary boundaries in search of a new and deeper understanding of the basis
of nervous system function in health and disease."

The growing role of imaging in clinical care and biomedical research has resulted in an acute shortage of well-
trained clinician-scientists in Radiology. Only a small fraction of current Radiology residents pursue an
academic career and much fewer get funded. Dr. Mattrey has improved upon the successful training model he
developed at UC San Diego 20-year ago that he recreated at UT Southwestern (UTSW) in 2016. Applicants
are selected only if they added 1+ years of mentored research during medical school while engaged in
fundable research rather than rely on recruiting from clinically bound trainees. UTSW is fortunate to receive
over 150 T32-qualified such applicants/year to choose from. We interview about 30/year that also performed
well in medical school to ensure that they can compete with their highly competitive clinical colleagues.
We also improved the UTSW training model since the last cycle by: 1) including the internship year to form a 6-
year comprehensive training program, which is now mandatory for recent medical school graduates; 2) Interns
will spend the 1st 9 months on clinical rotations and the last 3 months in Radiology to prepare for their research
year; 3) trainees will now meet with all program faculty to compare interests rather than a select few and will
rotate through a subset of faculty laboratories; 4) we have added and funded the option for trainees to spend
up to 7.5 months on research after they pass their comprehensive board examination; 5) we added a mock
NIH study section to the workshop run by NIH reviewers of a grant being submitted to give the PI feedback and
the trainees a first-hand experience of NIH review; and 6) provided a career path from trainee to faculty for
those that excelled in both clinical and research, particularly if they submit a K-award in their last year.
The training model immerses trainees in mentored research and clinical training over the entire 6 years guided
by both research and career mentors. Trainees are kept engaged with their research team during clinical
training by providing them with 6 weeks of dedicated research time per year, and more so in their final year.
This provides trainees with 21-28 months of mentored research over the 6 years giving them the opportunity to
publish their results and submit grants. Their clinical training is identical and synchronized with their clinical
peers making them equally skilled. Using this model our trainees over the past 6 years have published 24
papers with 9 as 1st author, presented 60 oral or poster presentations, received national awards, and were
granted 6 RSNA R&E Foundation Resident Research grants 1/year the 1st 2 years and 2/year the last 2 years.
UTSW and the UTSW Department of Radiology with their extensive physical and human resources are well
suited to train the next generation of imaging scientists. Radiology has outstanding and well-funded mentors 11
of whom are themselves clinician scientists. Our mentors have trained over 280 postdocs in the past 10 years
and have 61 current trainees. Each trainee has published on average 5.34 papers. Of the 25 mentors, 18 are
currently funded as PIs. Including all 25 mentors, the average support is ~371K/year on 1.8 awards."
10847563,"SUMMARY. My research program focuses on understanding the organization and regulation of
phosphorylation-dependent signaling networks in health and disease. In particular, we are interested in
deciphering the biochemical and cellular mechanisms of crosstalk between phosphorylation-dependent
signaling and other signaling pathways at the level of posttranslational modification of protein kinases. One
attractive modification is reversible oxidation, mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are emerging
as critical second messengers in signaling pathways related to many pervasive diseases, including diabetes,
cancer, and cardiovascular disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that protein kinases are directly
regulated by redox modifications. For instance, the reversible oxidation of Cys residues in redox-sensitive
kinases has been shown to influence their activity (both positively and negatively), subcellular localization, and
protein-protein interactions. In many cases, the modified Cys is conserved among other members in the same
kinase family. This raises the intriguing possibility that reversible oxidation may be a general means of regulating
kinase function inside cells. To explore this possibility further, we are examining the impact of H2O2-depedent
oxidation on the global substrate selection of several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AGC family
members using functional protein microarrays and complementary biochemical, biophysical, mutational,
computational, and cell-based strategies. Our data suggest that H2O2-dependent oxidation shifts the substrate
preference of many kinases, leading to distinct substrate profiles in the oxidized and reduced states. For
instance, with support of an NIGMS SC1 award (5SC1GM130545), we are currently studying the biochemical
mechanisms underlying the H2O2-induced shifts in the substrate selection of the canonical AGC and MAPK
family members, PKA-CÎ± and ERK2. These studies suggest that reversible oxidation of PKA-CÎ± and ERK2
increases their affinity for some substrates while decreasing or having little effect on others. Interestingly,
different types of redox modification (e.g., diamide-mediated oxidation, H2O2-dependent oxidation, or
glutathionylation) led to different activity profiles toward the same model substrates. With support from the
proposed MIRA, we propose to build on these studies by asking questions about 1) the effects of redox
modification of kinase substrate selection in various cellular contexts and their impact on signaling outcomes
related to disease; 2) the impact of redox modification on the spatiotemporal regulation of kinase activity profiles
in cells; and 3) how the global substrate profiles of other protein kinases, including understudied kinases in the
âdark kinomeâ, are affected by H2O2-dependent oxidation and/or different types of redox modifications. Together,
these studies will offer unique insights into mechanisms of crosstalk between redox- and phosphorylation-
dependent signaling pathways in physiological & pathological processes. Importantly, a MIRA will also facilitate
mentoring of trainees from underrepresented minority groups, promoting diversity of the biomedical workforce."
10847868,"The population of older adults with chronic disease states and functional and cognitive decline is growing
rapidly in the US. In parallel, there has been a rapid expansion in the understanding of aging-related biology
that may drive these changes, and a rapid expansion in the development of bioengineering and engineering
approaches that can be utilized to help solve health care-related issues. Despite this progress, there remains a
gap in the ability to translate biological understanding and engineered approaches into modalities that improve
the health and well-being of older adults. In order to further accelerate the pace of discovery in this space, The
Translational Aging Research Training Program was successfully implemented in 2018. Despite COVID-19
related disruptions, 14 fellows from clinical, engineering, and biological disciplines were trained to work in this
space during the first cycle. The Johns Hopkins Human Aging Project (HAP) has been intentionally designed
as a hub that provides interdisciplinary connections with focus on accelerating improvements in the healthspan
of older adults. This renewal application describes an updated training program that will take place within the
unique HAP ecosystem. The scientific leadership, the research infrastructure, and the diverse and inclusive
environment in this ecosystem will continue to provide an outstanding translational research training venue in
the next cycle. Specific aims include: 1) the implementation of a diverse, inclusive and rigorous interdisciplinary
training program in translational aging research for post-doctoral fellows with MD and PhD degrees through a
structured program consisting of a core series of required coursework, interdisciplinary scientific meetings,
weekly trainee focused translational aging seminars, individualized training programs, and leadership and
career development seminars; 2) the provision of trainees with a primary directed translational aging laboratory
experience (either engineering or biology focused) or clinically oriented research project in collaboration with
an experienced mentor with research resources; 3) the provision of trainees with access to the robust
interdisciplinary and translation-focused aging research infrastructure and collaborative research opportunities

knowledge of aging biology, engineering and bioengineering approaches to problem solving, and major clinical
issues facing older adults, a broad knowledge of translational science, and the tools necessary to start a

sets that will facilitate the future development of influential interdisciplinary translational aging careers and
research programs."

The 5-year survival of pancreatic cancer patients remains at 10% primarily due to the tumor resistance to
standard chemo and immunotherapies. The profound immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment contributes
to treatment resistance. Notably, 82% of the neoadjuvant-treated pancreatic cancers carry loss of function
mutations for KMT2D, a histone modification enzyme. Epigenetics is known to impact cancer cell behavior.
However, how tumor cell-intrinsic epigenetic alterations modulate the pancreatic tumor microenvironment
remains elusive. The long-term goal is to develop new treatments to convert pancreatic cancer to an
immunologically hot tumor and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and patient survival. The overall
objectives in this application are to 1) determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the tumor
microenvironment and 2) characterize the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates activin A expression. The
central hypothesis is that upregulation of activin A upon KMT2D loss in pancreatic cancer reprograms cancer-
associated fibroblasts and immune cells to promote a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive microenvironment. The
rationale for this project is that the knowledge of the mechanisms by which KMT2D regulates the tumor
microenvironment will pave the way for future preclinical and clinical development of new strategies to treat
pancreatic cancer. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the
impact of KMT2D signaling on the immune composition in the tumor microenvironment; 2) Define the
regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts by KMT2D signaling; and 3) Determine the
molecular mechanisms of activin A regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer. Under the first and second
aims, we will use our established pancreatic cancer genetic mouse models with pancreas-specific inactivation
of KMT2D to determine the impact of KMT2D signaling on the differentiation and activation of cancer-
associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells, and ligand-receptor interactions in the tumor
microenvironment and the underlying mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing technology, mass cytometry,
and multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry will be used. For the third aim, we will characterize the
interactions between KMT2D and co-factors and the mechanisms of KMT2D-mediated regulation of activin A
transcription and enhancer activity using ChIP-seq, BruUV-seq, and functional luciferase reporter assays. The
research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on a novel concept that epigenetic
signaling from tumor cells remodels the tumor microenvironment and contributes to cancer progression and
uses state-of-the-art animal models and approaches. The proposed research is significant because it will shed
light on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by KMT2D in pancreatic cancer and the effect of KMT2D
signaling on pancreatic tumor microenvironment, which will set the stage for future preclinical and clinical
development of new tumor microenvironment-targeting treatment strategies."

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes are chromatin-modifying proteins that have emerged as an important
lead in understanding CNS dysfunction. To date, HDAC expression has been measured in a small number of
postmortem brain tissue samples from healthy and diseased patients affected by brain disorders including
opioid addiction (heroin), schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimerâs disease and provides evidence that altered
expression of HDACs in cortex and some subcortical regions (such as the ventral tegmental area), may play a
central role in the underpinnings of brain disease. Research in animal models supports that HDAC expression
is a critical mediator of neural development/plasticity, aging, cognition, learning and memory. Further,
synthetic small molecules targeting HDACs have been shown to normalize HDAC expression levels and
alleviate disease-related behaviors in animals. These preclinical evidence underscoring the great need to
improve understanding of the relationship between HDAC expressions, brain function and disease
pathogenesis in the living human brain.
We have recently achieved a major research goal by resolving a PET imaging agent, [11C]Martinostat that
selectively binds to a subset of HDAC enzymes. Our imaging studies to date, including more than 40 healthy
human volunteers, have identified key features that make [11C]Martinostat a rare and promising CNS HDAC
probe including robust brain uptake and high specific binding. We are extremely excited to take a large step
forward in understanding neural dysregulation in chronic pain patients by visualizing HDAC in the brains. As a
first towards this goal, we propose to investigate the distribution and availability of [11C]Martinostat in chronic
low back pain patients with and without taking prescription opioids. When comparing to healthy control group,
we can attribute changes in [11C]Martinostat binding related to chronic pain. In addition, our study design allow
further investigations on the effects of prescription opioids and sex differences on HDACs availability. Our team
at the Martinos Center is one of few in the world that can directly translate basic science advancements to
knowledge of the human system.
Our preliminary data on [11C]Martinostat in humans age 18-79 years strongly supports the feasibility and
success of our proposal for clinical imaging in healthy subjects in adulthood. PET/MR imaging in humans with
[11C]Martinostat will deliver answers to fundamental questions about chromatin modifying enzymes in the living
human brain in a way that has not been possible until now. Importantly, using [11C]Martinostat to understand
the alternation of HDAC expression in chronic pain patients will enable validation of an epigenetic drug target,
refine patient selection based on HDAC expression, and facilitate proof of mechanism/target engagement in
developing novel analgesics."

 Dry eyes and contact lens wear often cause foreign body sensation. This abnormal mechanosensation
is associated with âLid Wiper Epitheliopathyâ (LWE), a condition induced by the mechanical damage to the
marginal palpebral conjunctiva (also known as âlid wiperâ). However, the underlying neurosensory mechanism
remains elusive. We recently found that a population of primary sensory neurons defined by the expression of
MrgprD selectively innervates the lid wiper and is sensitive to shear force. This proposal aims to determine
whether MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers mediate ocular mechanosensation and regulate lacrimation. In Aim
1, we will characterize the innervations and mechanosensitivity of MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers in the lid
wiper. Using genetic labeling and axonal tracing approaches, we will perform detailed anatomical analysis of
organization and terminal ultrastructure of MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers in the lid wiper. In addition, we will
test whether MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers in the lid wiper can be activated by shear force by conducting ex
vivo calcium imaging. These studies will shed light on the role of MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers in ocular
mechanosensation. In Aim 2, we will further determine whether MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers sense shear
force during eye movements. We will determine whether genetic ablation or pharmacological silencing of
MrgprD-expressing neurons alleviates the ocular mechanosensation induced by enhanced shear force. This
study will provide insight on the neurosensory mechanism of the lid wiper mechanosensation. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether the lid wiper mechanosensation regulates lacrimation to maintain the lubrication of the ocular
surface. Specifically, we will examine whether ablation of MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers affects basal
lacrimation and mechanically-induced lacrimation. Furthermore, we will test whether chemogenetic activation of
MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers in the lid wiper promotes lacrimation. Finally, we will determine whether
pharmacological activation of MrgprD-expressing sensory fibers is a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting
lacrimation under dry eye conditions. These studies will reveal the neural basis of ocular mechanosensation
associated with physiological tear evaporations and pathological dryness of the ocular surface, which will have
a significant impact in our understanding of ocular mechanosensation as a protective mechanism and its clinical
implication in dry eye treatments."

The long-term goal of our ADAR Program is the increased diversity of MSTEM students that pursue
graduate degrees and research careers in aging-related areas. For this, we propose to enhance the UC
Davis ADAR Scholars Program, a comprehensive three-year program with two major components. The
first is the one-year ADAR Program, which will support eight diverse sophomore students selected from the
freshmen participating in our pre-ADAR program [the Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program]. This
component is designed to enhance retention, foster academic excellence, and kindle interest and
engagement in aging research; it involves course work, advising, and research experience. The second
component, the ADAR-Honors Program (ADAR-HR), is a research-intensive two-year program designed
to encourage and support eight diverse juniors and seniors to matriculate into aging-related graduate
programs. ADAR-HR provides a two-year research-intensive experience, including one summer at another
institution. It will promote student retention and academic excellence through activities that facilitate social
and academic integration and scientific identity formation within a supportive peer group; it will engage
students in research as well as in discussions of aging research topics, integrity in research, and
experimental design. It will also provide them with career information, experience in proposal writing and
oral and written scientific presentations, and guidance in the graduate school application process. To
achieve these goals, ADAR-HR will have four main components: advising, research experience,
professional development, and community activities that enhance science identity formation and provide
important sources of social support. ADAR-HR has the following measurable objectives: (1) Four diverse
juniors per year will be recruited into ADAR-HR; (2) Ninety percent of ADAR-HR students will graduate in an
MSTEM field with a GPA â¥ 3.25; (3) ADAR-HR students will have increased expertise as student
researchers with respect to understanding experimental design and data interpretation in aging-research
areas; (4) ADAR-HR students will develop professional communication skills by presenting their research
locally and nationally; (5) ADAR-HR students will develop awareness of graduate program application
processes; (6) ADAR-HR students will develop scientific identity through storytelling and outreach activities;
(7) The majority (>50%) of ADAR-HR students will matriculate into graduate programs involving aging-
related research within two years of receiving their Bachelor's degree."

Washington University in St. Louis has a rich tradition of radiation research and is a world leader in the field of
radiation oncology for clinical care, as well as physics and biological research. Over the past twenty years, much
emphasis has been placed on the development of instrumentation for the non-invasive imaging of biological
processes in small animals, thereby providing investigators with a better understanding of the biology and the
potential of therapeutic interventions in preclinical models. In this regard, Washington University is a recognized
leader, with outstanding programs and instrumentation for preclinical magnetic resonance, nuclear, and optical
imaging. Preclinical photon irradiators that can deliver radiation to precise anatomical locations in small animals
are an important component of these research efforts. We currently have an XStrahl small animal radiation
research platform (SARRP) irradiator, however, it is nearing the end its useful lifetime and the technology is
outdated. We therefore request funds to purchase a new, state-of-the-art Precision X-Ray SmART+ Biological
Irradiator for small animal radiation delivery. We believe this irradiator is superior to the latest irradiator produced
by Xstrahl. The state-of-the-art SmART+, is an image-guided, isocentric (360Â°rotation, with arc therapy
capability), self-shielded research irradiator with integrated safety interlock system. It combines a high resolution
(100 Âµm) cone-beam CT imaging system and a high-dose rate (up to approximately 6.5 Gy/min) therapeutic X-
ray source into a single integrated, computer-controlled platform. It comes standard with a 4500W generator and
has the highest degree of targeting accuracy 0.05mm about the isocenter. Research projects for seven major
users with NIH funding and a critical need for the SmART+ are described, along with two minor users. The PI
has managed the current small animal irradiator for the past eight years and has of expertise in preclinical
radiation and cancer biology research. He has assembled a strong team to oversee operations and QA of the
instrument. In addition, Washington University has made a significant institutional commitment to ensure the
successful use of the device after its installation. The irradiator will allow investigators to study basic questions
regarding radiation research in an in vivo, preclinical model that will eventually lead to new paradigms in the way
we treat disease in the clinical setting."
10853704,"A 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer
The Analytical Resources Core (ARC) at Colorado State University is requesting funds
to purchase a new 400 MHz NMR spectrometer to expand the capacity of our NMR
facility for routine 1D and 2D NMR data collection by undergraduate and graduate
student researchers and postdoctoral associates in the chemical sciences. The current
NMR systems in the ARC can no longer support the growing number of researchers
who need daily access to 400 MHz NMR due to recent growth in research programs
and new faculty hires in synthetic chemistry all of whom will rely heavily on NMR to
operate their research programs. The instrument will be managed within the ARC that is
a Colorado State University institutional shared use Core facility homed in the Office of
the Vice President for Research. The instrument will be located in the ARCâs NMR
laboratory in the Chemistry Research Building, home to all the synthetic chemistry
research groups at CSU. At the present time, we do the greatest portion of our routine
NMR work on two walkup 400 MHz Bruker NMR systems. One of these lacks
automation limiting high throughput sample analysis. The other system is
oversubscribed with usage in excess of accessible user time. The proposed 400 MHz
NMR will support full automation and be equipped with a sample changer and an
automated high performance broadband probe. The magnet solenoid will be actively
shielded, have a long hold helium Dewar and will be fully equipped with a helium
recovery system. Recovered helium will be purified and reliquefied on the ARCâs helium
liquification system making this spectrometer a highly efficient and sustainable system
in the current uncertain helium supply environment. The combination of magnet field
control, console technology, broadband probe, sample changer and advanced software
will provide required sensitivity, resolution and performance to the NIH-supported
research at CSU.
The new 400 NMR will serve NIH and other funded projects involved with synthesis,
catalysis, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, sustainable polymer chemistry,
nanoparticle design for biological imaging and many others. There are five NIH projects
supported by this proposal and a similar number of projects funded by other agencies or
CSU new faculty startup funds."

 The goal of this project is to improve a genome-driven, correlation-based platform to unearth and produce
new bioactive compounds from fungi. This platform and research will deliver access to a large repertoire of fungal
natural products (NPs), which historically have been a great source of new medicines and useful compounds.
Typical estimates have NPs and their derivatives accounting for ca. 75% of currently used antibiotics and nearly
60% of anti-cancer drugs along with numerous antiviral, antiparasitic, antifungal, and immunosuppressive
medicines. Despite their historical successes, traditional screening programs have been severely curtailed due
to declining numbers of promising new candidates and lack of ready access to new compounds. At the same
time, analysis of over one thousand fungal genomes suggests that tens of thousands of high-value NPs have
yet to be identified and screened. Thus, new technologies are needed and here we describe an integrated plan
to systematically tap into this vast potential of fungal metabolites through genomics, metabolomics, bioactivity
screening and molecular biology. In the previous funding period, we developed an untargeted approach called
`metabologenomics' that correlates genomic content with metabolite output to uncover hundreds of new NPs
and their gene clusters from soil actinobacteria. In this competing renewal, we now propose to extend the method
to 300 fungi while integrating bioactivity screening in Aim 1. Activities described in this proposal will reduce
technical barriers by establishing new workflows, improving experimental methodology, and refining scoring
metrics to create a discovery platform with the ability to help unlock the medicinal potential of NPs in the fungal
kingdom. In Aim 2, we focus on the targeted capture and expression of BGCs in specific euchromatic loci in a
widely used host for NP heterologous expression, Aspergillus nidulans. The two Aims of the project describe the
generation of genomic, metabolomics, bioactivity, and expression data. We further propose to make data- and
milestone-driven progress on the combination of these complementary data types to systematically examine a
set of 300 fungal strains. With a proven track record of deep collaboration among the team members involved,
we will deliver a robust implementation of the proposed activities to provide a well-defined path to discovery of
bioactive NP/BGC pairs, and study the production of new molecules from diverse fungi."

TRIM-NHL proteins (named after their TRIpartite Motif and founding members NCL-1, HT2A, LIN-41) are
essential for animal development and control of stem cell fate. Their dysfunction causes cancer, infertility, and
neurological disorders including congenital hydrocephalus. The recent discovery that multiple TRIM-NHL
proteins bind to mRNAs provided a crucial insight into their molecular functions. The long term goal of this
research is to discover how TRIM-NHL proteins regulate gene expression to control crucial developmental
processes. This proposal focuses on the Drosophila melanogaster TRIM-NHL protein, Brain Tumor (Brat),
which binds to specific mRNAs and functions in neurogenesis, oogenesis, and embryogenesis. In stem cells,
Brat suppresses stemness and promotes differentiation whereas loss-of-function leads to over-proliferation in
the brain and germline. We pursue the central hypothesis that Brat negatively regulates gene expression by
causing mRNA degradation and inhibiting translation to control stem cell fate. Our research plan will determine
the effect of Brat on translation, mRNA decay, and stem cell fate during neurogenesis and oogenesis. A major
strength of our work is that it integrates both molecular regulatory mechanisms of Brat and its biological
functions at the organismal level. First, using quantitative assays that specifically measure Brat activity, we will
dissect its repressive domains and identify the required pathways and corepressors in cultured cells. Second,
we will identify the network of genes that are regulated by Brat. We will map Brat-binding sites across the
transcriptome and measure BratÊ¹s effect on the abundance and translation status of expressed mRNAs. By
integrating the resulting data, our data will provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between Brat-RNA
occupancy, location of functional binding sites, and impact on mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Third,
we use precision genome editing to interrogate the roles of RNA-binding and repression domains of the brat
gene during neurogenesis and oogenesis in Drosophila. We also created tissue specific reporter gene assays
that specifically measure BratÊ¹s repressive activity in stem cells. The results of this research will provide a
mechanistic understanding of Brat mediated gene regulation and provide a global view of its impact on gene
expression. Our results will establish the role of Bratâs mRNA regulatory activities in the control of the stem cell
proliferation-differentiation axis. Brat serves as an archetype for the TRIM-NHL family, and our discoveries will
also broadly enhance the understanding of TRIM-NHL protein functions in development and disease."

 As diabetes technologies have become more innovative and effective in the management of pediatric type
1 diabetes (T1D), research and usage has preferentially increased only in those of higher socioeconomic
status (SES). Studies have consistently demonstrated 50% lower rates of diabetes technology use in youth of
lower SES. Although diabetes technology has the potential to reduce disparities in pediatric T1D outcomes,
inequitable access has resulted in worsening of T1D outcomes for low SES youth. This proposal aims to build
an evidence base for data-driven interventions designed to reduce disparities in diabetes innovations by
addressing barriers and supporting promoters of diabetes technology use.
 Ananta Addala, D.O., M.P.H, is a physician scientist committed to a career as an independent investigator
addressing disparities in T1D management and outcomes. Dr. Addalaâs longstanding research and clinical
interests are to promote equitable care for youth with T1D. As a physician with a background in pediatric
endocrinology, epidemiology, and behavioral health, Dr. Addala is uniquely qualified to address the drivers of
inequities in diverse youth with T1D. Dr. Addala has enlisted a multi-disciplinary mentorship team comprised of
experts in the fields of pediatric T1D, health disparities, statistics, and mixed method study design to
successfully execute this proposal and launch an independent research career in pediatric T1D disparities.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to discover drivers of disparities in diabetes technology use in youth
with T1D and public insurance and develop a brief intervention, as a means to understand and address
pediatric T1D disparities. This will be accomplished through two aims. In aim 1, focusing on the family, Dr.
Addala will construct an evidence base of barriers and promoters to diabetes technology use in youth with
public insurance in order to formulate and test a brief pilot intervention aimed at increasing uptake. In aim 2,
this time focusing on the providers, Dr. Addala will construct the evidence base on barriers and promoters to
recommending diabetes technology to youth with public insurance in order to formulate and test a brief pilot
intervention to increase provider recommendation of diabetes technology.
 Taken together, findings from Aims 1 and 2 will result in the development of an intervention aimed at
increasing diabetes technology uptake and access in youth from low socioeconomic and racial/ethnic minority
groups, thereby improving T1D outcomes. Dr. Addala will use the K23 mentored award to execute an in-depth
training plan which includes formal coursework and structured mentorship by her mentors to advance her
understanding of mixed methods research, intervention development, and expertise on disparities. This proposal
is foundational to a future independent clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the interventions developed on

Abstract
This project will identify and characterize key characteristics of human immune responses to the pre-erythrocytic
(PE) falciparum malaria infection and vaccination that targets this stage with a focus on responses that correlate
with protection or infection. We hypothesize that responses by protected vs. not protected, and infected subjects
will identify the relevant immune constituents and processes. We will use complementary immunological
analyses and systems immunology approaches and characterize responses in the innate and adaptive immune
compartments to identify cellular and humoral responses that correlate with protection or infection. We will: 1.
Define cellular and soluble mediators of early innate responses and test the hypothesis that innate response
variations affect adaptive responses and are predictive of protective immunity development. We will also analyze
the influence of prior malaria exposure on vaccine efficacy. 2. Define the stimulation and temporal programming
of vaccine-elicited protective adaptive immune cells with a focus on the stimulation, signaling, and programming
of T and B cells and which pathways lead to protective phenotypes. We hypothesize that key signaling and
maturation pathways lead to protective adaptive immunity. Details of antigen receptor usage, cell lineages,
transcriptional programming, and phenotypic changes will be integrated with innate signaling events to define
events that shepherd cells through recall and maturation during immunization. 3. Connect protective phenotypes
with adaptive immune functional activity to identify functional characteristics of cellular and humoral
responses that correlate with protection. Antigen specific reactive T cell responses will be analyzed by
cytometric, functional, single-cell sequencing, and multi-omics methods. B functions will be analyzed by
deep multi-parametric analysis of sera and monoclonal antibodies. This will identify key functional characteristics
of cell populations and antibodies that are associated with immune protection. Integration of cell phenotypes and
functional activities of multiple immune compartments will give insights into immune signatures and processes
that define protective responses to malaria vaccines and provide benchmarks to guide vaccine development.
Overall, our integrated immunological and systems biology analyses of samples from malaria vaccine trials will
identify immune signatures during critical stages following vaccination which correlate with protection against
malaria or result from its infection and advance understanding of factors that impact development of elicited
protective immune responses."

derstand at single bp resolution the molecular organization (architecture) of proteins assembled on the Sac-
charomyces (budding yeast) genome. Budding yeast represent an ideal model cellular system due to its simple
genome, ease of genetic manipulation, and conservation of transcription and chromatin regulators with human
cells. By understanding the precise molecular architecture of epigenomes, we gain a holistic view of genome
regulation mechanisms. This project will build on our published set of genome-wide ChIP-exo data that com-
prehensively measures the yeast epigenome consisting of over 400 distinct proteins. This expansion will in-
volve understanding how epigenomes are reprogrammed by environmental signals. Two broad classes of re-
programming will be examined: acute stress responses (e.g., heat shock and oxidative stress) and long-term
unfolding of developmental pathways (e.g., starvation responses) brought on by chronic stress. Responses to
acute stress reveal molecular architectures that pre-exist in the cell and then re-organize within a few minutes
of sensing extracellular signaling. These events are typically transient and so must be captured upon reaching
their temporal maxima. In contrast, developmental pathways unfold over hours in yeast and typically rely on
de novo synthesis of gene-specific transcription factors. This project will map the precise positional organiza-
tion of hundreds of epigenomic components in response to heat shock and oxidative stress, and smaller set of
components in response to a much broader array of acute stresses and developmental pathways. This project
will also define the functional interdependencies of epigenomic factors, with particular focus on the gene in-
duction cofactors Mediator and SAGA. Relevant components of induced transcription will be rapidly depleted,
then their impact on Mediator and SAGA binding to promoters examined. Other interdependencies, informed
by the organization of epigenomes that will be defined during reprogramming/induction will also be examined.
Together these aims will help provide a more thorough understanding of the protein architecture of gene regu-
lation that should allow computational prediction of novel gene-environment interactions in diseased tissue."
10861024,"The gram-negative outer membrane (OM) is asymmetric, with phospholipids on the inner leaflet and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the outer leaflet. A defining part of the gram-negative cell envelope, LPS is a
major signal for infection in animals and is a target of last resort antibiotics, such as colistin. Normally essential,
clinical use of colistin has selected for Acinetobacter baumannii strains that do not produce LPS. Although LPS
has been implicated in diverse functions, its precise role in gram-negative biology is unclear. Recent work in E.
coli suggests LPS is capable of contributing as much rigidity to the cell envelope as the cell wall, a function that
requires polyionic interactions between negative moieties on LPS and divalent cations. Analysis of conditional
E. coli mutants defective in LPS synthesis and transport revealed formation of filaments and cell chains,
suggesting an additional role for LPS in cell division and separation. The essentiality of LPS in either process is
unclear.
To evaluate the essential role(s) of LPS in gram-negative biology, I will leverage a set of E. coli mutants to
conditionally knockdown LPS synthesis and transport, manipulate LPS charge (and thereby its interactions
with divalent cations to provide rigidity), and produce a minimal LPS structure. Using this collection in Aim 1, I
will systematically characterize the effect(s) of LPS defects on cell growth and morphology to understand the
contribution of LPS to both phenomena. In Aim 2, I will test my hypothesis that providing cell envelope rigidity
is a primary, essential function of LPS. Aim 2.1 will evaluate the ability of hyperosmotic conditions (which
reduce the force exerted by turgor pressure on the cell envelope) to compensate for LPS defects. Because the
force of turgor pressure is spread between the cell wall and the OM, Aim 2.2 will test whether increasing rigidity
of the cell envelope via cell wall crosslinking can compensate for LPS defects. In Aim 3, I will identify the steps
in cell division and separation impacted by defects in LPS synthesis and transport, respectively. This effort will
illuminate the mechanistic basis of filamentation and chaining in LPS mutants. Examination of A. baumannii
LPS deletion mutants identified a correlation between division and cell survival. I am thus particularly interested
in testing whether enhancing division using complementary genetic strategies promotes growth of LPS
deficient E. coli. If enhancing cell envelope rigidity is an essential role of LPS, additional septa may offset
lethality associated with LPS defects through a positive impact on the structural integrity of the cell as a whole.
A major signaling molecule for the immune system and target for last resort antibiotics, a better understanding
of the essential role of LPS in gram-negative biology will provide insights into mitigation and treatment of gram-
negative pathogens. Through this F31 fellowship, I will develop expertise in microscopy, protein biochemistry,
and single cell analysis. Further, it will grant me the time and support necessary to hone my skills as a
scientific mentor and communicator to prepare me for a career as a professor and independent investigator."

Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures that protect chromosome ends and confer genome stability
in eukaryotic cells. Without telomeres, chromosomes undergo misguided end-to-end fusions, leading to
chromosomal aberrations and eventual genome instability. Hence, deregulation of telomere maintenance
results in human diseases such as cancer and dyskeratosis congenita. The human telomeric DNA comprises
thousands of tandem repeats of the conserved hexameric sequence, TTAGGG. The telomeric DNA has a
unique structure, a several kilobases long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) region that ends with a 3' single-
stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang. The cornerstone of telomere maintenance is the two-part process of
telomeric DNA synthesis. In the first step, the ribonucleoprotein telomerase extends the telomere G-rich 3'
overhang. Telomerase adds telomeric repeats to the ssDNA overhang. Next, telomeric ssDNA-binding protein
complex, CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST), coordinates with DNA polymerase alpha-primase (PolÎ±-primase) to fill in
the newly-synthesized telomeric G-overhang by de novo C-strand synthesis. While the mechanism of the
extension of telomeric G-overhang by telomerase is an area of intense study since the discovery of telomerase
almost four decades ago, that for the telomeric C-strand fill-in by CST-polÎ±-primase is much less understood.
Telomere C-strand fill-in is equally essential in telomere maintenance as the G-overhang extension process. As
such, this proposal aims to study the molecular mechanism of the human telomere C-strand fill-in machinery
by providing biochemical and structure-function relationship understandings of template-bound CST-PolÎ±-
primase at key catalytic steps. Multiple novel models and hypotheses from this proposal are based on the
premises of our recent cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human template-bound CST-
PolÎ±-primase preinitiation complex (PIC). For the first aim, we will establish an unprecedented consensus
template sequence for CST-PolÎ±-primase assembly and C-strand synthesis initiation. For the second aim, we
will use cryo-EM single-particle analysis to determine the structural basis of how CST-PolÎ±-primase initiates de
novo RNA primer synthesis after PIC assembly at telomeric overhangs. For the third aim, we will elucidate the
molecular mechanism of how CST-PolÎ±-primase âcountsâ the RNA primer length during synthesis and promptly
terminate the âmaturedâ RNA primer for the intramolecular primer handover to the DNA polymerase domain.
The findings from this proposed work will provide a timely advancement to our understanding of the human
telomere C-strand fill-in mechanism and mammalian telomeric DNA synthesis in general. The proposal
structure-function studies provide a missing platform to connect CST and PolÎ±-primase human disease
mutations to mechanistic understandings. From a broader perspective, telomere C-strand fill-in is an excellent
model for studying lagging-strand synthesis by PolÎ±-primase in replisomes."

The objective of this proposal is to broaden the capabilities of current synthetic biology tools by specifically
focusing on yeast as biosensors, therapeutics, and as sense-and-respond communities. Living cells are
positioned to be one of the next transformative technologies for therapeutic treatment. Rather than giving a
purified small molecule or a purified protein as the drug, the living cell, in this case yeast, can be applied in situ
at the site of disease that will continuously produce the necessary therapeutic. There are many advantages to
using living yeast, as opposed to bacteria or mammalian cells as the in situ therapeutic, as they are cheap, easily
scalable, easy to store, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae arguably has the most powerful genetic and synthetic
biology tools for cell engineering. This project involves several different arms working in tandem: we plan to
develop yeast that can sense different bacterial infections in wounds, yeast that can secrete different antibiotics
in wounds, and finally yeast that secrete specific antibiotics in response to the bacteria present in the wound. This
research combines our expertise working with antibiotics and wound healing to become a more sophisticated
method of disease treatment. Yeast that can sense bacterial infections and secrete different antibiotics ultimately
can be broadly applied beyond wound healing. The sensing and therapeutic approaches developed here should
be broadly enabling in the longer term for making yeast sense-respond communities for treating human disease
beyond bacterial infections and antibiotics."

The objective of this Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Veterinary Laboratory Investigation
and Response Network (Vet-LIRN) Cooperative Agreement Program is to maintain increased
sample analysis capabilities for the FDA through partnership with Vet-LIRN laboratories. An
animal food- or drug-related illness or other large scale animal food/feed emergency event
requires surge capacity testing of implicated diagnostic or animal food samples. Testing
includes chemical and microbiological analysis of samples such as animal food/feed/drugs,
environmental samples related to animal food/feed/drug production, and animal diagnostic
necropsy or clinical samples. In the event of a large-scale chemical or biological contamination
affecting animal food or drug products, the UKVDL performs selected analyses of diagnostic
samples collected and supplied to the laboratory by FDA or other government agencies. Federal
or State surveillance assignments will also be a source of samples for analyses.
The overall goal of the cooperative agreement is to continue developing, improving, and using
university, state, and federal veterinary diagnostic laboratory testing capabilities in concert to
respond to large-scale events. The cooperative program will also continue to standardize
analyses performed at member laboratories by encouraging use of standardized analytical
methods and equipment, analytical worksheets, and electronic reporting of results. Training and
proficiency testing will continue to be provided for new methods, and Quality Management
systems will be further enhanced. Small scale method development and method validation
projects will continue as directed by the Vet-LIRN Program Office. Funding will be used for
supplies, equipment maintenance, and personnel time."
10845283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric critical illness exposes children to painful and stressful experiences. High levels of stress and pain
increase the risk for adverse acute health outcomes (e.g., delirium) and long-term functional impairment, known
as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Pediatrics (PICS-p). Respiratory support with intubation and mechanical
ventilation (MV) exacerbates a child's stress and pain, for which the standard of care includes narcotics and
sedation medication. However, these medications increase the risk of delirium, posttraumatic stress disorder,
and impaired cognition. My long-term career goal is to develop mechanistically-based, nonpharmacologic
interventions to remediate PICS-p and improve survivorship for children and their families following pediatric
critical illness. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The training proposed for this K23 award period is crucial for me to
successfully launch this program of research as an independent researcher.
Listening to music to increase comfort (âmusic listeningâ) decreases stress and pain symptoms and related
outcomes (e.g., medication use, heart rate) during MV in adults and there is emerging data on feasibility and
preliminary efficacy for music listening during MV in pediatrics. However, the mechanisms through which music
listening impacts stress and pain is unclear, which limits identifying the `active ingredient' of music listening
interventions, resulting in significant variability in intervention components and delivery. These data would result
in an optimized music listening intervention for testing in future trials. We hypothesize live music from certified
music therapists of child preferred songs may be most efficacious in decreasing stress and pain among children
receiving MV compared to recorded music or usual care, due to rhythmic entrainment (active ingredient) and
modulated through the autonomic nervous system (primary mechanism). This proposed research uses a
mechanistic design, a randomized crossover trial with three conditions to compare their effects on biomarkers of
stress and pain across three conditions in children with respiratory failure: Live music listening provided by a
music therapist, recorded music listening, and usual care.
To fill crucial gaps in my expertise, I propose five training objectives: (1) gain skills in the identification and use
of biomarkers in pediatric critical care clinical trials; (2) obtain training in stress and pain physiology; (3) develop
expertise in PICS-p outcomes; (4) develop skills in conducting interventional clinical trials; and (5) cultivate
practical skills in team science, study implementation, and management. I have assembled a multidisciplinary
mentorship team of NIH-funded investigators with expertise in each of my training areas. Completion of the
proposed training and research will result in a competitive R21 application to test an optimized music listening
intervention to decrease stress and pain among pediatric patients receiving MV."

 Two groups that are under-researched but at the highest risk for problems stemming from opioid use
disorder are (1) public system-involved emerging adults (EAs; ages 16-25) and (2) individuals who are justice-
involved (including EAs). Compared to all other age groups, EAs report the highest rates of drug use, including
use of opiates, and public system-involved EAs are more likely to have negative outcomes. For adults of all ages,
opioid use results in a 13-fold increased probability of justice system contact. And, among the prison re-entry
population, the leading cause of death is overdose, mostly from opioids. Further, polysubstance use is nearly
universal for EAs and justice-involved adults (of any age) using opioids. Peer recovery support services and
recovery residences are proliferating nationally and may have tremendous benefit for these two high-risk groups,
but research on them is limited and lacks scientific rigor. The ultimate goal of this Initiative is rapid advancement
of the recovery support services field through developing actionable research such that continued network
funding will no longer be necessary to sustain growth. To accomplish this, it is essential to identify and equip
investigators willing to dedicate or redirect their research efforts to this topic. However, a fundamental challenge
for evaluating recovery support services (and any other community-based program) is the inherent
incompatibility of rigorous research methods and the context of real-world services efforts. This requires
adaptation or development of innovative and comprehensive methods that thoughtfully combine adaptable
designs, advanced measurement, and sophisticated statistical analyses. Investigators also must be competent
and well-trained to collaborate with community stakeholders so that rigorous research can be conducted in real-
world settings. Optimally, though, people impacted by recovery support services and the research conducted on
them must help drive the research agenda; rather than priorities being researcher-initiated, persons in recovery
from the target populations and stakeholders in that community (recovery support service providers and payors)
must be effectively engaged. Thus, this Initiative is a partnership between advanced researchers, persons in
recovery from the target high-risk populations, providers, and payors. The Initiative will advance research on the
efficacy/effectiveness of peer recovery supports and recovery residences for public-system involved emerging
adults and justice-involved adults with opioid use disorders and medication assisted treatment experience
through ambitious but achievable goals: (1) identify priority areas of research via engaging individuals in recovery
and providers/payors, (2) grow the field of skilled early career investigators focused on this research, (3) provide
seed funds and guidance to produce preliminary studies for NIH funding, and (4) conduct dissemination and
outreach to the larger field. With these aims, the Initiative is poised to be a catalyst that provokes rapid expansion
in the number of skilled investigators and high-quality research tackling this critical public health issue."

 Gastroparesis is defined as a gastrointestinal motility disorder with objectively delayed gastric emptying of
solids in the absence of mechanical obstruction, associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms including
early satiety, postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. The
pathophysiology of gastroparesis includes postprandial antral hypomotility and pylorospasm, which may reflect
extrinsic (vagal) denervation, enteric (intrinsic) neuropathy involving excitatory or inhibitory neurons or
electrical syncytium (such as interstitial cells of Cajal) which may result from imbalance of CD206-positive
macrophages that protect these intrinsic mechanisms. The introduction of G-POEM involving endoscopic
pyloromyotomy has focused attention on pyloric dysfunction as a potentially important factor in the
pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, many unknowns remain. First, the reported trials are uncontrolled
with results that are short-term and inconsistent so the true efficacy of this procedure is not clear. Second,
given that it is unlikely that G-POEM is a panacea for all patients, it is important to determine which of several
possible factors influence outcome e.g. etiology (specifically diabetic versus idiopathic gastroparesis);
demographic factors (age, BMI, psychological factors, duration of illness), baseline severity of gastric retention;
gastric dysrhythmia, pyloric distensibility or scarring (as measured by EndoFLIP), postprandial antral motility
and âisolatedâ pylorospasm (tonic elevation of baseline pressure independent of antral contractions).
Our general hypothesis is that G-POEM is efficacious in relieving some or all symptoms of gastroparesis and
that efficacy differs according to diagnosis, baseline retardation of gastric emptying, antropyloroduodenal
motility and pyloric sphincter diameter and compliance. We will examine this hypothesis in a controlled short-
term study that will inform future, more definitive trials on G-POEM on the optimal patient selection and
outcome criteria. The aims of this pilot and feasibility, hypothesis-generating study are:
Aim 1: To evaluate the 12-month treatment effect of peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) vs. sham
surgery in patients with drug-refractory gastroparesis, as measured by validated questionnaires and to perform
a pilot analysis of factors predictive of the outcome including demographics, etiology, vagal dysfunction, in vivo
gastric physiology, (emptying of solids, postprandial antral motility, gastric dysrhythmia and pyloric motor
functions).
Aim 2. To compare the long-term (1 year or more) outcomes in patients randomized to G-POEM with matched
patients prospectively followed in the national Gastroparesis registry run by the Gastroparesis Clinical
Research Consortium (GpCRC).

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia currently without an effective cure. A number of
clinical trial failures has been reported due to a lack of complete understanding of Alzheimerâs disease etiology.
Neuronal activity disruptions have been described as contributing factors to the disease etiology and its
progression. Anomalies in slow wave activity, specifically slow oscillations (oscillations <1Hz) important for
consolidation of memories during NREM sleep, have been reported in Alzheimerâs patients and might have
contributed to their dementia. The cellular mechanisms of such disruptions however are unclear. Contributions
of neuronal hyperactivity have been suggested. It is unknown whether macroglia contribute to hyperactivity and
slow wave aberrations. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of macroglia on neuronal
activity disruptions, such as slow waves, to better understand AD etiology and to alleviate its dementia burden.
We will use transgenic mouse models of Alzheimerâs disease to systematically assess whether macroglia
contributes to neuronal activity disruptions using calcium imaging with multiphoton microscopy. We will also
investigate whether macroglia play a causal role in disruption of slow wave activity using optogenetics. We
hypothesize that macroglia play a role greater than that of a homeostatic regulator of neuronal activity. We
propose to employ optogenetics to control neuronal circuits aimed to restore neuronal activity and slow
Alzheimerâs disease progression. Thus, our findings will determine the cellular and molecular relationships
between neuronal activity and AD, with the targeting of macroglia as a novel therapeutic approach."

Unhealthy diets and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have led to an epidemic rise in obesity and obesity-related
disorders such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the latter of which can
progress to the more severe condition nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Despite their prevalence, limited
options exist to treat obesity-linked diseases, particularly NAFLD/NASH. This has led to significant interest in
developing new therapeutic strategies to mitigate the tissue-specific metabolic dysfunction implicated in obesity
and obesity-driven pathologies. Clinical, biological, and biochemical evidence demonstrates that dysregulated
signaling through the unfolded protein response (UPR), the stress-responsive signaling pathway that remodels
cellular physiology to counter endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is a critical determinant in dictating the
metabolic imbalances associated with obesity and obesity-linked conditions. The UPR comprises three signaling
pathways activated downstream of the ER stress sensing proteins IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. Signaling through
the PERK arm of the UPR is generally associated with pathologic outcomes in obesity. In contrast, signaling
downstream of IRE1 and ATF6, primarily mediated by the adaptive stress-responsive transcription factors XBP1s
and ATF6, respectively, has been shown to protect various organs from obesity-linked alterations. This suggests
that activation of protective IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 signaling may represent a new strategy to alleviate metabolic
dysfunction in obesity-linked diseases. We hypothesize that pharmacologic activation of protective
IRE1/XBP1s or ATF6 signaling will foster adaptive remodeling in multiple key metabolic tissues to
broadly ameliorate tissue-specific pathologies associated with obesity. We recently developed first-in-
class, highly-selective IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 activating compounds that enable us, for the first time, to
determine the impact of pharmacologic activation of these protective UPR pathways in mouse models of T2D
and NAFLD/NASH. Using these compounds, we have shown that pharmacologic IRE1/XBP1s or ATF6 activation
stimulates adaptive remodeling that mitigates damage in multiple organs central to obesity-related conditions,
including liver and pancreas. Here, we expand these findings to define how increased protective IRE1/XBP1s or
ATF6 signaling corrects tissue-specific metabolic defects to enhance overall metabolic health in mouse models
of T2D and NAFLD/NASH. Through these efforts, we will reveal new mechanisms whereby protective
IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 signaling remodel tissue-specific and organismal metabolism in obesity-linked disorders
and establish pharmacologic IRE1/XBP1s and ATF6 activation as broadly-applicable therapeutic strategies to
mitigate the systemic metabolic dysfunction seen in obesity-driven conditions such as T2D and NAFLD/NASH."

 The immune system needs to distinguish between self and non-self, and between pathogen and
commensal. In part it does through the function of regulatory T cells, a specialized subset of CD4 T cells that
are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, as well as maintaining tolerance toward self-antigens. Their
importance to maintaining peripheral tolerance was illustrated from experiments of nature in both humans (IPEX
syndrome) and mice (scurfy mutation) where loss of this subset of T cells results in the onset of fatal
autoimmunity. Treg dysfunction has also been found to play a role in autoimmune diseases such as type 1
diabetes and multiple sclerosis.
 Tregs have the ability to potently suppress CD4 effector T cells (Teff) either directly or through the
modulation of antigen presenting cells (mainly DCs) to ultimately suppress activation, proliferation, and
subsequent effector functions of Teff cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed for Treg-mediated
suppression, including release of suppressive cytokines and expression of inhibitory receptors. However, very
little is known mechanistically as to the effect of suppression on Teff cell function. We found that Tregs promoted
a significant drop in overall translational activity of CD4 Teff cells. Rather than inducing a global, non-specific
translational shutdown in Teff cells, Tregs induced a specific remodeling of the translatome, with several mRNAs
whose transcription was unaffected no longer present on ribosomes. These data provide novel insights into
Treg function and identify new pathways that are potentially available for therapeutic intervention. The goal of
the studies in this proposal are to determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie Treg-mediated translatome
remodeling in Teffs, and to ask whether this mechanism is altered in human autoimmune disease. To achieve
this we will: determine the role of RNA and RNA-binding proteins in Treg-mediated suppression of translation
(Aim 1) and determine the role of translation control in human Treg function (Aim 2)."

Presbyopia is a loss of the dynamic accommodation response of our vision and affects everybody as they age.
Presbyopia is not a static defect such as myopia since the lens must be capable of changing size and shape to
achieve different focal lengths. However, current treatment options today are based on spectacles, or static
corrections of vision, and do not treat the underlying cause to restore dynamic accommodation, resulting in
subpar corrections and problems with quality of life. Growing evidence suggests that stiffening of the lens is
critical to the inability of the eye to accommodate, and recent therapies have been developed targeting both the
optical and biomechanical nature of presbyopia, with varying levels of success. However, the major barrier to
innovation in this space is the lack of in vivo characterization and monitoring of lens accommodation mechanics,
which would aid both diagnostic monitoring and therapeutic planning. The lens presents spatially varying
mechanical properties that change with age, and thus monitoring this variation in vivo is important. Optical
coherence elastography (OCE) and Brillouin microscopy are two promising techniques in early clinical stages
but suffer from complementary limitations. While OCE can quantitatively measure elastic modulus in
physiological conditions, the contrast is limited in transparent tissues like the lens. Brillouin microscopy is capable
of high spatial resolution but so far has only provided relative stiffness measurements because the high-
frequency longitudinal modulus needs calibration, which is currently lacking in clinical settings. To address this
unmet need, we propose a combination OCE/Brillouin system capable of measuring co-located Brillouin spectra
and OCE information to map the depth-dependent elastic moduli. Combining OCE/Brillouin will allow for
quantitative evaluation of depth-dependent biomechanical properties of the lens in 3D and for the use of forward-
models to predict accommodation power and guide novel therapies. In Aim 1, the combined elastography system
specifications will be quantified to meet criteria for evaluating a human lens. In Aim 2, the effective elastic
modulus will be validated in an ex-vivo porcine lens for generating a biophysical model of accommodation.
Finally, the system will be field-tested in Aim 3 using in vivo lens measurements combined with a forward finite-
element model and validated against experimentally measured accommodation power. This research will
ultimately result in enabling patient-specific predictive models of accommodation changes from lens softening
procedures for presbyopia treatment."

Parkinson's disease is the leading cause of movement disorders and currently there are no diseaseâ
modifying therapies available. Parkinson's disease is associated with progressive and selective
degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, however the exact biological
mechanisms underlying dopamine neuron susceptibility remains unknown. Current working models for
many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, is that runaway activation of cell stress
response pathways in response to diseaseârelevant pathology exacerbate and drive neuronal death.
However, stress response pathways are also required for cell survival and restoring homeostasis. One
such pathway is the integrated stress response (ISR), which is a biochemical pathway that responds to
various forms of internal and external cellular stress to regulate protein translation. Activation of the ISR
results in a global reduction of protein synthesis, and also a selective increase in cell survival genes that
are regulated by the transcription factor ATF4. While triggering the ISR is a key mechanism to protect a
cell from a stressor, prolonged and excessive activation of the ISR can lead to cell death through
apoptosis.
In advanced disease stages of Parkinson's, both human pathological studies and mouse models show
evidence of high ISR activation. This has led to the idea that dysregulation of the ISR could be one driver
of PD pathophysiology, and that inhibiting the ISR would be beneficial. However, no studies have
investigated the role of the ISR in preâdisease states or the role of the ISR specifically in brain
dopaminergic neurons. It was recently discovered by our lab that the ISR is not just used as a stress
response pathway in a class of neuromodulatory cells (cholinergic interneurons), but rather, these cells
basally constitutively engage this pathway to maintain proper biological and electrophysiological
function. This work unveiled a novel role for the ISR in some neurons in a normal, nonâdisease or
exogenous cell stress state. When looking at other high firing neuromodulatory cells, we found that
dopaminergic neurons showed a broad range of ISR activity states, from low/off to high.
I hypothesize that subclasses of dopamine neurons share the cholinergic neuron phenotype of having an
activated ISR state normally. I further hypothesize that, in contrast to the idea that a high ISR accelerates
disease pathogenesis, a higher ISR state basally, preâinsult protects neurons better from future cell
stressors. This hypothesis is based on the concept of hormesis. In this proposal, I will examine ISR states
in dopamine neuron subclasses in health and PD mouse models and bidirectionally test how dopamine
neuron ISR state modifies cell death and disease progression."
10827169,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the largest environmental interface of the mammalian body, which faces the
challenge of maintaining tolerance to dietary and microbial antigens while protecting against pathogen invasion.
In addition to hosting a large collection of immune cells, the GI tract contains diverse and numerous populations
of glial cells and neurons, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Enteric neurons are responsible for controlling various
physiological functions but can be targeted during enteric infections, resulting in functional gastrointestinal
disorders after pathogen clearance. While some mechanisms underlying neuronal damage have been
uncovered, the host and microbial factors that trigger enteric neuron loss and regeneration remain unclear. Over
the past three years, we have uncovered new mechanisms of enteric neuronal cell death following infection or
microbiota depletion and described the role of the gut microbiota and intestinal immune cells in regulating enteric
neuron maintenance and function. In new preliminary data presented in the application, we provide evidence
that enteric glial cells (EGC) experience a similar loss as enteric neurons following infection and antibiotic
treatment. Additionally, our new data strongly suggest that EGC de-differentiation may play a role in neuronal
recovery observed after microbiota transplantation. Finally, candidate metabolites involved in dysbiosis-
associated neuronal death and neuronal recovery were identified. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that dysbiosis triggered by infection or antibiotic treatment generates ligands that trigger inflammasome-
associated neuronal loss. Upon injury, glia-to-neuron dedifferentiation mediates neuronal recovery in a
microbiota-dependent manner. The three complementary aims will delve deeper into these observations to
reveal novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of microbiota-dependent neuronal death and regeneration,
using novel imaging, state-of-the-art single-nuclei transcriptomics and chromatic accessibility, metabolomics,
murine genetic fate-mapping, gain- and loss-of-function, and gnotobiotic approaches. In Aim 1, we will define
the bacterial species and metabolites associated with specific glia and neuronal cell death after infection or
antibiotic treatment. In Aim 2, we will assess the cellular dynamics of EGC and neuronal recovery after microbiota
transplantation, followed by fate-mapping studies to define the possible role of glial cell de-differentiation in this
process. Finally, Aim 3 will use complementary gnotobiotic and metabolomic approaches to identify bacterial
signals and host pathways that induce gliogenesis and neurogenesis in different contexts. Overall, this proposal
seeks to uncover novel mechanisms of microbiota-dependent neuronal death and regeneration with implications
for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders."
10827168,"Study Title: Sleep and emotion processing in adolescent Post-traumatic stress disorder
Principal Investigators: Stephanie Jones, PhD and Ryan Herringa, MD, PhD
Project Summary
Although nearly all affective disorders are associated with sleep pathology, PTSD is singularly conceptualized as one in
which functionally impairing symptoms, including trauma re-experiencing and hyperarousal, are present across the 24-
hour periodâduring both wake and sleep. As such, sleep pathology has been reconceptualized from a highly comorbid
symptom with little mechanistic value to a function that is fundamentally involved in the development, maintenance,
and severity of the disorder.
Remarkably, sleep research in youth with PTSD has relied almost exclusively on subjective assessments of sleep, which
afford no information about the sleeping brain. This gap is particularly relevant given the overlap between the
functional impairments, both neural and behavioral, associated with PTSD and those associated with poor quality
sleep.
In this proposal, we will explore sleepâs relationship to emotion processing and daily affect in 165 adolescents between
15-18 years spilt into 3 groups: PTSD, TEC (trauma-exposed comparison) and TD (typically developing). We will use
advanced sleep assessment methodologies including: (1) high-density EEG (256 channels) in the laboratory to explore
the regional distribution of sleep before and after an emotional learning task and; (2) a sleep-wearable EEG recording
headband, SmartSleep, to record sleep in the ecologically relevant home-environment, longitudinally, (14 days) and
explore its relationship to daily measures of affect and symptom severity. Finally, to determine whether the deepest
sleep (e.g. slow-wave activity (SWA); EEG frequency 1-4 hertz) of non-rapid eye-movement sleep (NREM)) can be
reliably increased over time in youth, during one 5-day period of sleep recording, we will increase SWA using
SmartSleepâs acoustic enhancement algorithms. These algorithms represent the first validated, non-pharmacological
method available for enhancing slow-waves.
Our long-term goal is to understand the role sleep plays in the maintenance and progression of adolescent PTSD. We
expect our results will have a significant impact on our understanding of sleep pathophysiology in adolescent PTSD and
to lay groundwork for larger clinical trials to test novel sleep neuromodulatory interventions."

10860929,"Hearing loss is a pervasive problem that can result from exposure to loud sounds, to drugs for treatment
of cancer and infections, from aging, or from individual genetic factors. Noise-induce hearing loss (NIHL),
from both occupational and recreational causes, is a growing issue that is currently is thought to affect
more than 40 million Americans. Nearly 25% of adults have audiological signs consistent with causation
by NIHL. Hearing loss leads to difficulties in communication, social isolation, and possibly to changes in
cognition. Most causes of hearing loss are caused by dysfunctional changes in the cochlea and spiral
ganglion cells, which in turn provided a degraded sensory representation to the cochlear nucleus (CN)
where the axons of spiral ganglion cells, the auditory nerve fibers (ANFs), terminate. The consequences
of cochlear NIHL then propagate throughout the central auditory system, engaging pathophysiological
increases in excitability and altering synaptic function. The CN consists of networks of neurons with distinct
patterns of synaptic innervation from ANFs, and these neurons create parallel, yet intertwined, pathways
for upstream analysis. Although sensory processing in the CN has been well studied in animals with normal
cochleae, how the mechanisms and functions of CN circuits change after hearing loss, and the
consequences of those changes for sensory processing, is not as well understood. Many cellular
mechanisms have only been studied in juvenile mice during a developmental sensitive period. There is an
unmet need to understand the unique cellular mechanisms underlying NIHL that occur in adults. Here, we
propose to use controlled NIHL to perturb the ANF inputs to the CN, and then to examine specific synapses
and cellular excitability mechanisms related to sensory processing in noisy environments in the CN. First,
we will examine the hypothesis that NIHL leads to increased excitability of three specific populations of CN
neurons, two of which have not been studied, and one that has only been studied in very young animals,
in brain slices in adult mice. We will determine which specific mechanisms and ion channels are causal to
changes in excitability. Second, we will examine how the synaptic inputs to different neurons of the CN are
affected by NIHL, testing the hypotheses that NIHL induces mechanisms that amplify residual dendritic
excitatory synaptic inputs, and alter the functional organization and strength of inhibition at specific local
connections. Third, we will examine how the detection of sounds in noise is affected by NIHL in these three
populations of CN neurons, using an established acoustic paradigm, in both computational models and in
vivo. Together the results from these studies will provide insights into how the early stage processing of
sound is affected by hearing loss, and can contribute identifying approaches to optimize sensory
discrimination after hearing loss."

10861910,"CORE C: PROTEIN PHENOTYPES OF AGING - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
It is now clear that genetics alone cannot explain the majority of the observed phenotypic traits and cellular
response to perturbation. One of the fundamental questions in aging biology is to understand the complexity
with which cellular systems respond to stimuli and stress. Proteins perform nearly all the work of the cell. It is
therefore important to measure directly the effects of aging on the proteome itself, as opposed to an indirect
molecular phenotype like the transcriptome. The direct analysis of proteins, their modifications, and their flux
has the potential to greatly enhance our ability to identify and understand the functional pathways that underlie
the biology of aging. A challenge to this task has been that the field of MS-based proteomics has long suffered
from a reputation of difficulty in reproducing experimental measurements. This irreproducibility has been
primarily due to the semi-stochastic way in which shotgun proteomics measurements have been made. To
address these issues, the MacCoss and Villen labs has been at the forefront of developing technologies to
perform large-scale targeted proteomics assays that generate near complete data matrices, accurate
quantitation, and high reproducibility â even across multiple laboratories. The primary goal of Core C is to
apply these improved methods to studies of aging, to obtain accurate quantitative measurements of peptides
from samples provided by its users, and to aid geroscience researchers in linking these high-dimensional data
to biologically meaningful outcomes. In addition, the Core will develop and apply new assays especially suited
to aging. This Core will work closely with Core D (Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging), which will share some of
the same facilities, and with Core E (Invertebrate Longevity and Healthspan) and Core F (Artificial Intelligence
and Bioinformatics). The resources offered here include methods that can be applied to a wide range of
species, including humans. Core C will also play a key role in collaborative efforts between the University of
Washington Nathan Shock Center (NSC) and other NSCs throughout the country. Core C will devote
considerable resources to technology and software development, ensuring that we are constantly pushing the
scientific boundaries in this field. In the long term, Core C will help to make comprehensive, age-specific
protein phenotypes an essential and invaluable component of any study of aging phenotypes. The core will
impact on biogerontology at the broadest level, enabling our collaborators to identify new mechanistic
pathways linking genes with aging, including pathways that have the potential to reveal new drugs to target
aging. Moreover, these capabilities will lead to resources of value not just to collaborating Nathan Shock
Centers but to others in the biogerontology community, and ultimately, to all researchers interested in the
proteomic foundations of biomedically relevant problems."
10861913,"CORE D: METABOLITE PHENOTYPES OF AGING â PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Molecular genetic approaches have led to tremendous advances in the study of the basic biology of aging,
shedding light on the causes and consequences of senescence. But there remains a significant gap between
our ability to identify genetic and experimental perturbations that extend lifespan, and our understanding of the
mechanisms by which these perturbations extend lifespan. Metabolomics offers a relatively simple yet powerful
approach to close this gap. The metabolome consists of the thousands of unique small molecules that make up
the building blocks of all organisms, and its analysis has the potential to greatly enhance our ability to identify
and understand the functional pathways that underlie senescence. The primary goal of Core D is to assist
collaborating geroscientists in experimental design, sample collection and data analysis of accurate metabolite
profiles in studies on the basic biology of aging. The statistical support provided by the core has proven to be an
invaluable step in helping collaborators not only to obtain metabolomic data, but also to analyze the complex,
high-dimensional datasets that arise from metabolomic profiling. This Core will work closely with Core C (Protein
Phenotypes of Aging), which will be housed in the same facility, and with Core E (Invertebrate Longevity and
Healthspan). Cores C and D will collaborate with Core F (Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics) on a novel
project to develop metabolome-proteome networks for researchers interested in studying both domains
simultaneously. The resources offered here include methods that can be applied to a wide range of non-model
species, including humans. Core D will also play a key role in collaborative efforts between the University of
Washington NSC and other NSCs throughout the country. Core D has already collaborated with three Nathan
Shock centers (Albert Einstein, Oklahoma, and Alabama), and over 40 collaborating researchers around the
country. This Core will devote considerable effort to hardware and software development, ensuring that we are
constantly pushing the scientific boundaries in this field. The Core will also serve as a central repository for aging-
related metabolomic data. In the long term, Core D will help to make age-specific metabolite phenotypes an
essential and invaluable component of any study of aging phenotypes. The Core will have a major impact on
biogerontology at the broadest level, making these resources available to the broadest possible community of
geroscientists, and enabling our collaborators to identify new mechanistic pathways linking genes with aging,
including pathways that have the potential to reveal new drug targets."
10857287,"ABSTRACT BIOMARKER CORE
The Biomarker Core will oversee the assessment of multiple blood-based biomarkers and an MRI sub-study
that will support and inform the EAS Program Project. Biomarkers were selected to index the most common
mechanisms of non-normative cognitive decline in older adults, in particular, those related to Alzheimerâs
disease and related dementias (ADRD) and those linked to vascular disease, as well as genomic markers and
markers of processes that play a crucial role in aging such as autophagy. Blood-based biomarkers will include
four categories: 1) Blood biomarkers of AD pathologic change and neurodegeneration: Î²-amyloid (AÎ²40,
AÎ²42), tau (pTau181, pTau217, pTau231) and biomarkers of generalized neuronal damage, including glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) chain; 2) Genomics: single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) including apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status, and genome-wide association study (GWAS)
conducted through the Alzheimerâs Disease Genetics Consortium; 3) Blood chemistry: e.g., lipids, cholesterol,
C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin; 4) Autophagy biomarkers:
macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy activity (CMA).
In addition, this Core will conduct a cross-sectional MRI sub-study in 250 individuals to quantify
macrostructural, microstructural, and physiologic features that index neurodegenerative changes and vascular
disease. The domains assessed include macrostructure, including indicators of AD, neurodegeneration and
vascular disease, microstructural pathology with measures of anisotropy within tracts, and altered
cerebrovascular physiology through assessment of global and regional resting cerebral blood flow (CBF).
Other related biomarkers which complement the Core are assessed in Project 1 (Cerebral Blood Flow by
Transcranial Doppler ultrasound), Project 2 (blood-based assessment of basal and stimulated inflammatory
markers and markers of biological age [telomere length, DNA methylation]), and Project 4 (glucose regulation).
The Biomarker Core will work with the Technology and Data Management Core to ensure that biomarker data
are shared across all Projects and will assist in interpretation. Biomarkers will be used to improve
diagnostic accuracy and inform the assessment of mechanistic associations between project-specific
risk factors and short-term and long-term cognitive outcomes as assessed by conventional and
ambulatory approaches in the Clinical Core."

The Technology and Data Management (TDM) Core serves two primary functions that are essential for the
success of the EAS program project: (1) the management and integration of data, and (2) providing
consultative and technical support for data operations. The aims of the TDM Core are as follow: Aim 1. To
implement and oversee a central data repository and pipeline to facilitate the seamless exchange, integration
and management of data among EAS Cores and Projects. Aim 2. To provide consultative and technical
support to facilitate data collection and integration from different data sources (e.g., clinic, self-reports,
wearable devices, sensors, biomarkers), and execute an operation plan for running and maintaining the central
data infrastructure and management system. Aim 3. To score and evaluate basic psychometric properties
(e.g., items and scores distributions, correlations, reliability) of clinical measures, conventional psychosocial
scales and ambulatory assessments across Projects in order to provide tidy and analysis-ready datasets for
further validation and analyses in the Statistical Core. Aim 4. To support and facilitate data dissemination and
consortium collaborations with the scientific community and the public. In line with NIH Policy for data
management and sharing (NOT-OD-21-013), and following the governance procedures distributed by the
Dissemination Committee, the TDM Core will support the sharing of data, protocols, measurement and testing
procedures, and relevant data dictionaries with the broader research community and lay public, by depositing
data and metadata using various established repositories and platforms. The TDM Core follows the FAIR
principles for scientific data management (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), and will develop
and operate a central data management and technical support system that will meet the scientific aims and
research needs of the EAS P01, while also facilitating collaborations and dissemination with the broader
research community and public."

The Statistics Core (SC) serves as the statistical support hub of the Einstein Aging Study (EAS). A primary
scientific goal of this Core is to advance our understanding of how individual in-depth characterization of health
behaviors, biomarkers, physical and psychosocial health, and environmental factors impact cognitive
performance and decline prior to onset of Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias and assessing the role of
multiple exposures that influence cognition on a short-term and long-term basis. To achieve this goal, the EAS
collects data across multiple timescales ranging from real-time to annual assessments, combining conventional
in-person interviews, self-reports and clinical assessments with data streams from wearables (e.g., actigraphy
for measurement of sleep and physical activity, air quality monitors, continuous glucose monitors â CGM) and
collected via mobile devices (e.g., ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys and ambulatory cognitive
assessments). The SC will continue in its long history of developing and applying cutting-edge analytic
approaches to address the research questions described in the four scientific Projects and to assist in service
to the other Cores. It serves two functions that are essential for the success of EAS. First, the SC will provide
collaborative and consultative support to Project investigators for data analyses and interpretation of results.
Second, the SC will engage in methodological development to meet the challenges posed from complications
encountered in analyses and study design. The SC team plays a key role in assisting EAS investigators with all
stages of data analysis, such as tailoring analysis plans to specific scientific hypotheses, conducting data
analysis, interpreting results, and addressing challenges and potential threats to validity. In particular, the SC
will work closely with the Technology and Data Management Core to insure data quality. In short, the SC will
continue its long history of contributions to aging research through developing new statistical methodology and
through innovative application of existing methodologies."

The enzymatic transition state structures of mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylases
(PNPs) were solved experimentally in this laboratory by a combination of intrinsic kinetic isotope
effects (KIEs) and computational quantum chemistry. The resulting bond geometry and
electrostatic potential maps enabled the design and synthesis of transition state analogs.
Immucillin-H (aka BCX1777, Forodesine, Mundesine) inhibits human PNP with picomolar affinity.
The PNP blockade causes dGTP accumulation and apoptotic cell death specifically in activated
and malignant T cells. Forodesine entered clinical trials and was approved as an oral therapy for
refractory or relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma in Japan in 2017. Approximately 10% of
otherwise refractory patients treated with Forodesine therapy undergo complete remission.
Others show stable disease or no response. Genomic analysis of Forodesine responder vs non-
responder T-cells from cancer patients revealed drug efficacy inversely proportional to SAMHD1
expression (sterile alpha motif and HD-domain-containing protein 1). SAMHD1 is a dNTP
triphosphohydrolase (dNTP + H2O ï  dNuc + PPPi), preventing dGTP accululation from inducing
apoptosis in targeted cancer T cells. Therefore, the combination of SAMHD1 inhibitors with
Forodesine is expected to extend the therapeutic profile of human PNP inhibitors, a synthetic
lethal interaction.
Drug design by transition state analysis will be extended to SAMHD1, a rare triphosphohydrolase
activity. SAMHD1 inhibition has potential to enhance T-cell anticancer outcomes. The privilidged
enzyme-reactant geometry at the transtion state will be enlisted as one inhibitor design element.
Drug candidates designed to stablize the SAMHD1 protein geometry at the transition state will be
powerful inhibitors. Chemical screening with fragment libraries, some with covalent potential,
coupled by click chemistries, will be used in combinatorial inhibitor design as an alternative
approach. SAMHD1 inhibitors, used in combination with Forodesine, are expected to provide
improved therapeutic approaches to the spectrum of T-cell malignancies.
SAMHD1 docked to its transition state to define the enzymatic cavity at the transition state will be
used to grow complimentary, protein-stabilizing structures from library fragments to mimic the
transition state configuration. SAMHD1 conformational traps of transition state geometry will be
tight-binders. A Bronx-based novel patient-derived cancer T-cell library will be tested in culture
and in mouse xenografts with SAMHD1 inhibitors to explore the scope of synthetic lethal
interactions across genetically defined human T-cell cancers. The program will be achieved with
specific aims to: 1) solve the transition state structure of SAMHD1 from reactant and catalytic site
perspectives, 2) discover SAMHD1 inhibitors by conformational transition state stabilization,
fragment screening and growth into the catalytic site cavity, structural biology approaches and 3)
use cell culture and mouse xenografts to characterize the biological effects of this synthetic lethal
interaction."
10849890,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a condition of subjective dry mouth caused by radiation therapy
to the head and neck and manifested as hyposalivation and altered sialochemistry. RIX is the most common
chronic side effect observed in HNC patients receiving radiation therapy and despite improvements in radiation
delivery remains a critical issue for patients. Currently available treatments provide temporary palliation and in
some cases (e.g. pilocarpine) can be accompanied by side effects that are as bad or worse than xerostomia.
There is a critical need for a treatment that will safely and effectively alleviate RIX without compromising
patient quality of life. A small phase I study suggested that MSC therapy could improve the perception of dry
mouth and salivary gland function in patients with RIX. However, the mechanisms by which MSCs elicit this
effect remain unknown and none of the successful studies investigated to use of cryopreserved MSCs. We aim
to fill this important knowledge gap by identifying an optimal source of MSCs for treatment and understanding
how MSCs improve salivary function to optimize treatment to maximize patient benefit. This proposal intends to
fill this knowledge gap which will potentially lead to the development of novel and effective therapies for RIX.
 We hypothesize that MSCs provide a reparative effect to the salivary gland through paracrine signaling.
We will investigate the short-term and long-term functions of MSCs following injection into the submandibular
gland and identify whether there is an ideal potential tissue source for MSCs in terms of cryo-recovery and RIX
treatment. We seek to address three questions critical to understand and treat RIX: 1) identify an ideal tissue
source for MSC to treat RIX; 2) investigate the effects of MSC treatment on the salivary gland in acute and
late-phase radiation damage; and 3) determine if MSC-based products elicit the same effects as MSCs alone.
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the ability of MSCs derived from marrow, adipose, and submandibular gland tissue
to recover after cryopreservation following IFN-É£ pre-licensing and evaluate the effects of these MSCs on
salivary tissue in vivo and in vitro. We will characterize the secretome of MSCs from different tissue origins
alone and investigate bi-directional effects of salivary gland tissue on this secretome using a salivary organoid
model. Finally, we will confirm in vivo, differences in reparative effects based on MSC source. In Aim 2, we will
define the effects of IFN-É£ pre-licensed, cryopreserved MSCs in RIX by studying both acute and long-term
effects on saliva production and salivary gland architecture in-vivo. We will also investigate the effects of MSC-
based products like MSC conditioned media and MSC-derived exosomes on salivary function in vivo and in
vitro. Together this work will provide an improved understanding of how MSCs ameliorate radiation damage,
support the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of RIX, and provide an outstanding training
opportunity for the PI."
10846981,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Despite decades of research effort directed towards understanding the basic biology, etiology, prevention, and
means of treatment of malignancy, cancer remains one of the most serious health problems for the US
population with almost 2 million new cases of cancer diagnosed annually and over 600,000 persons dying as a
consequence. Addressing the burden of cancer in the US and worldwide depends on development of a cadre
of population-oriented quantitative scientists with skills and knowledge to excel in an increasingly data-rich
world. The explosion of biomedical big data has dramatically and irrevocably changed the landscape of cancer
research. From molecular investigations studying genomic drivers of cancer to population studies tracking
health behaviors and utilization, new data resources are creating unprecedented opportunities to solve the
many unanswered questions about cancer. Optimizing the use of these resources and many other complex
dataâfrom âomics to administrative databasesâwill require, in addition to the standard âtools of the tradeâ
garnered through training in the traditional quantitative disciplines of epidemiology and biostatistics, a deep
understanding of different types of data and how they are generated, proficiency in data management and
visualization, and knowledge of statistical and machine learning approaches for data analytics. To prepare
junior scientists to address the cancer research needs of a data-rich 21st century, we propose to continue our
four and one-half decade old training program for University of Washington (UW) pre-doctoral students and
post-doctoral fellows by focusing on âDeveloping Data-Driven Cancer Researchers.â Six predoctoral and
two postdoctoral positions will be filled from established, highly-ranked academic programs in the UW
Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Health Systems and Population Health as well as
interdisciplinary programs such as Nutritional Sciences, Public Health Genetics, and Comparative Health
Outcomes, Policy, and Economics. Through interdisciplinary didactic and practical experiences, trainees will
learn to approach decisions about cancer research strategies from the perspective of the strengths,
weaknesses, value, and key analytic features of different types of big data e.g., âomics, clinical, survey, social
network, and personal wearable technology-derived health metrics. Features of the training program will
include: 1) existing UW courses (such as âCancer: Epidemiology and Biology,â âBiological Basis of Neoplasia,â
âAdvanced Health Services Research Methods I: Large Public Databases: Big Data,â âMachine Learning for
Biomedical and Public Health Big Dataâ); 2) an interactive âThe Data of Cancer Researchâ seminar focused on
the generation of cancer data; and 3) completion of a âBig Data practicumâ research exercise that build
proficiency in working with cancer data. Thus, the proposed training program will meld extant educational
elements with original components unique to the theme of big data to create a unique, value-added learning
environment for the next generation of cancer researchers."
10849891,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 It is now clear that poor sleep quality has dramatic health consequences, yet sleep medicine is still in great
need for safe and efficient sleep aids. Recent major advances in understanding how the brain regulates sleep-
wake cycles have opened new lines of investigations, revealing a complex regulatory network for non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep control that includes multiple new sleep-promoting neuronal populations. A series of
recent work by our laboratory have demonstrated the critical importance of parafacial zone (PZ) neurons in sleep
induction and maintenance, and of the GABAergic neurons in this region in promoting the deep, restorative stage
of NREM sleep known as slow-wave sleep (SWS). There is a fundamental gap, however, in understanding the
cellular and synaptic circuit basis by which PZ neurons control sleep. The long-term goal is to understand the
cellular and circuit bases by which PZ neurons promote sleep. The central hypothesis is that the brainstem
contains a sub-population of PZ GABAergic neurons that are both sufficient and necessary for the generation of
SWS and cortical slow-wave activity (SWA). The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how
the PZ promotes sleep is a critical first step towards manipulating this sleep-promoting circuit and will lead to
subsequent translational studies centered on the PZ aimed at reducing the burden of sleep disruption associated
with sleep-wake disorders but also other neurologic disorders. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) uncover a PZ GABAergic sub-population that is specifically sleep promoting; and 2) elucidate
the neuronal circuits by which PZ GABAergic neurons directly influence cortical activity. Guided by strong
preliminary data, in aim 1, we will uncover the role of PZ Parvalbumin expressing GABAergic neurons in sleep-
wake control using a combination of genetically-driven lesions, chemogenetic/optogenetic activation/inhibition,
fiber photometry and neuronal tracing; and in Aim 2, we will uncover a direct pathway by which the PZ directly
affects thalamo-cortical activity and drives the SWA characteristic of SWS, using in vitro electrophysiology,
optogenetic activation of PZ GABAergic projections to the thalamus, in vivo Ca2+ imaging of PZ GABAergic
neurons projecting to the thalamus, and chemogenetic activation of PZGABA in thalamic lesioned mice. The
approach is intellectually and technically innovative because it represents a new and substantive substrate of
understanding sleep regulation and because it employs a novel combination of state-of-the-art approaches. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide critical knowledge of the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which sleep is regulated. Ultimately, such knowledge is expected to guide the development of
therapeutic and interventional strategies to better regulate sleep-wake behavior and to reduce the burden
associated with sleep disruption, not only associated with sleep disorders but also with many neurological and
psychological disorders that represent a tremendous cost in the United States and worldwide."

In the United States, 60% of adults have a chronic disease and 40% have two or more. Collectively these
diseases are the leading causes of death and disability accounting for >90% of our nationâs $3.3 trillion
annual health care costs.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic underpiinings of disease and enabled the
development of polygenic risk scores (PRS) that may help to predict the occurrence and progression of
common dieases.
Working with the eMERGE team, we will select the fifteen diseases of public health impact. For these diseases,
we will finalize the PRS to be adopted including adaptations (if any) for minority race groups, the genotyping
array, the family history (FHx) tool and key clinical variables to be used in calculating genomic risk estimates
(GRE). We will identify GRE thresholds at which genomic risk assessment (GRA) with risk reduction
recommendations (RRR) in concordance with practice guidelines. To strengthen the evaluation of race-specific
PRS, we bring an additional cohort of 30,0000 AAs.
We will conduct a pilot ethical legal social implications study, to explore patient perspectives on use of FHx and
PRS for estimating disease risk among Alabama Genomic Health Initiative (a state wide cohort) participants.
The results will inform the development of consent, educational materials and a communication strategy to
enhance recruitment and retention of eMERGE participants.
We will prospectively recruit 2,500 patients with >75% patients from medically underserved communities,
incorporate PRS, FHX and clinical data to compute GRE for the selected fifteen diseases for all patients. For
high-risk patients, where GRE exceeds pre-specified thresholds (n~ 5000 of the 20,000 recruited across the
network), deploy clinical decision support (CDS) and present the GRA and RRR. We expect â¥50% uptake of
RRRs.
We will assess whether the uptake of GRA-RRR improve outcomes. We will assess three outcomes: uptake of
GRA-RRR (implementation outcome), adherence to clinic visits (engagement outcome), and surrogates of
disease / control (clinical outcome; e.g. blood sugar, cholesterol).
Although research has identified genomic signatures of common diseases, genomic risk assessments to
identify, and if appropriate, pre-treat at-risk patients have not been implemented in clinical care. This is the vital
first step to leverage the power of genomics to prevent disease. We bring our expertise and experience to
collaborate with the eMERGE investigative team to take this vital first step."

(MSARI) builds on the success of the previous funding cycle. We propose to support seven students to work
with alcohol researchers within the Department of Physiology, Comprehensive Alcohol Research Center (CARC;
P60), and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Center of Excellence (ADACE). The experience is designed to introduce
medical students to research, cultivate their interest in research, and develop a better appreciation of the
significant impact of alcohol use as a behavioral and environmental factor in comorbidity risk. Students will
conduct intensive hands-on basic science or translational research for 8-10 weeks in the summer prior to
entering Medical School or between their L1 and L2 years. Students will be peer-mentored by PhD candidates
and post-doctoral fellows supported by the NIAAA-funded T32, providing an important mentoring opportunity for
our senior trainees. The goals of this program are to 1) provide medical students with research experiences; 2)
provide students with strong career and research mentoring; 3) increase the participation in research by women
and students traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research; 4) provide summer interns with the career
skills needed to succeed in academic medicine. In addition to their research experience, students will receive
didactic training on lab safety, responsible conduct of research, rigor and reproducibility, HIPPA, use of animals
in research, and instruction on writing abstracts and presenting research results (oral and poster presentations).
All participating students will prepare a poster presentation for LSUHSC School of Medicine (SoM) Research
Day. Outstanding trainees will have the opportunity to submit abstracts to regional or national scientific meetings
and will receive partial support from the SoM Deanâs office to attend and present their work. In addition, the
LSUHSC Chancellor will provide support for reagents and supplies directly to mentors participating in the
program. We are committed to recruiting individuals underrepresented in biomedical research. The impact of
the program will be assessed at the trainee and mentor level by surveys deployed at the end of the summer
experience. In addition, we will conduct formative and summative evaluations concerning the entire program and
will continuously evaluate the need for programmatic changes to improve and refine the program to better meet
student needs. Lastly, working with the Office of Student Affairs, we will continue to track progress of MSARI
participants to measure the long-term impact of their summer experience on career choices and research
participation. This program leverages the outstanding scientific infrastructure provided by the NIAAA-funded
Comprehensive Alcohol Research Center, will help create the next generation of alcohol researchers, and will
prepare physicians to recognize and treat alcohol use disorders and associated comorbidities."

Environmental chemicals and stressors are major contributors to disease. Our ability to reduce harm is limited
by uncertainties about exposure, poor understanding of the exposures or exposure mixtures that cause health
effects and the mechanisms by which they do so, as well as by limited ability to remediate polluted sites and

assess and manage risk, and to develop novel tools for exposure reduction, remediation of polluted sites, and
treatment of disease.
The Duke University Program in Environmental Health (UPEH) rigorously prepares students for the
complexity of research careers in environmental health by leveraging and integrating the highly complementary
disciplinary strengths of Dukeâs internationally-renowned Schools of Medicine, Environment, and Engineering,
and Departments of Biology and Statistics. The UPEH is a critical, keystone element of Environmental Health
research and training at Duke. It makes possible a larger, interdepartmental, transdisciplinary program called
the Integrated Toxicology and Environmental Health Program, which was initially created in 1978 in the Duke
Medical Center. By supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral training, the UPEH T32 creates a force-
multiplying environment that trains many more PhD students and postdoctoral Environmental Health
researchers than are supported financially by the T32. Importantly, Duke is fully invested in supporting this
training program, offering very extensive support for Environmental Health training that complements the
UPEH, and hosting twelve additional major environmental health-related centers and initiatives that
enormously enrich the learning environment for our trainees. Finally, while the outstanding Duke UPEH faculty
serve as primary advisors for trainees, the Program is further enriched by adjunct faculty and external advisors
from our neighboring Research Triangle Park-based institutions such as the NIEHS, US EPA, and RTI, and our
sister triangle universities (North Carolina Central University, NC State University, and UNC Chapel Hill).
UPEH trainees receive high-quality training including: (1) development of essential research skillsets including
content mastery in core disciplinary areas (Environmental Health, Toxicology, Exposure Science,
Epidemiology, Environmental Engineering, etc.), quantitative methods (Biostatistics, Exposure Science
Modelling, Big Data Analytics, etc.), and training in responsible conduct of research and rigorous and
reproducible experimental design; (2) critical and creative thinking, and a research mindset focused on
interdisciplinary problem-solving via cutting-edge, innovative research; and (3) knowledge, professional skills,
and experiences required to identify and transition into environmental health careers. The UPEH fosters a
supportive and inclusive training environment in which all trainees will prosper, evidenced by our increasingly
diverse trainee population and by the success of alumni."
10831918,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The high and increasing prevalence as well as the staggering social and financial costs of Alzheimerâs Disease
(AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) emphasize the importance of finding strategies to prevent or slow their
progression. Here we aim to elucidate the basic biology of neuronal maintenance and energy homeostasis to
enable us to design new therapeutic strategies independent of tau or beta-amyloid theories. Almost all neurons
are born early in life and require an active neuroprotection program for their survival in response to the myriad
of internal and external challenges they face throughout life. NMNAT2 is a bifunctional protein that we and
others have identified as an important neuronal maintenance factor. NMNAT2 synthesizes nicotinamide
mononucleotide (NAD+) and serves as a molecular chaperone for day-to-day axonal function and to protect
neurons from proteinopathies such as hyperphosphorylated tau. In AD patients, NMNAT2 abundance is
greatly reduced to less than 50% of normal level and its level correlates with cognitive function. We found that
deleting NMNAT2 from mouse cortical glutamatergic neurons results in AD/ADRD-like phenotypes, such as
glucose hypometabolism, axonopathy and neuroinflammation. The current mouse and human results strongly
support a causal relationship between NMNAT2 hypofunction and neurodegeneration.
 Axonal degeneration is a key step in AD/ADRD and many neurodegenerative diseases. Axonal
transport plays critical roles in neuronal function and survival and is extremely energy demanding. Abnormal
axonal transport is an early defect in axons destined to degenerate. Increasing evidence reveals dysregulated
glucose metabolism in AD. Our preliminary studies suggest that NMNAT2 plays a critical role in fast axonal
transport by maintaining axonal energy homeostasis. Deleting NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons reduces
glycolysis while at the same time augmenting the pentose phosphate. These findings raise the following
questions: Does NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis for
normal axonal function? Does glucose hypometabolism caused by loss of NMNAT2 cause axonopathy? Will
supplement strategies bypassing NMNAT2 support neurons and attenuate axonopathy? To answer these
questions, we propose the following aims:
1. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 is required in cortical neurons for axonal transport.
2. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 contributes to axonal energy homeostasis.
3. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 in cortical neurons is essential for glucose metabolism
 The knowledge gained from our proposed studies will help us gain mechanistic understanding into how
NMNAT2 contributes to active neuronal maintenance and will provide necessary insights to assist in drug
discovery using NMNAT2 as a therapeutic target for neurodegeneration."

The increasing rate of severe maternal morbidity and mortality events in the U.S.
disproportionately burdens Black women. Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely than white
women to suffer or die from complications during or after pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy (HDP) (e.g., preeclampsia, gestational hypertension) are major contributors to severe
maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD). Black
women are more likely than white women to have severe forms of HDP and severe post-partum
complications such as chronic hypertension, stroke and CVD. We have compelling preliminary
data that documents racial disparities in the post-partum blood pressure recovery profile among
women with HDP at 6 weeks and 12 months after delivery. Despite an overall downward trend in
post-partum blood pressures among women with HDP, Black women have higher blood
pressures and are more likely to have stage 2 hypertension (â¥140/90 mmHg) at 6 weeks
postpartum compared to white women (32.4% versus.18.2%, p <0.001); trends that persist to one
year after delivery. We propose to decrease the racial disparity in blood pressure control at one
year postpartum among women with HDP by leveraging our hospital-initiated 6-week home blood
pressure monitoring program (HBPM) for women with HDP and our novel community-partnered
multi-level intervention with Healthy Start Inc. We aim to: 1) test an enhanced care intervention
strategy (6 weeks of HBPM, postpartum doula education and support, 12 months of wireless
HBPM and weight monitoring) compared to usual care control (6 weeks of HBPM) to improve the
blood pressure profile among women with HDP; 2) determine if an enhanced care strategy will
eliminate racial disparities in BP profiles, and 3) determine the access to and delivery of equitable
clinical care that is essential for all women to successfully recover from HDP within one year
postpartum. We hypothesize that the enhanced care intervention rooted within a health equity
framework will improve the post-partum blood pressure recovery profile among women with HDP
and will close the blood pressure disparity between Black and White women in the year after
delivery. Our approach will be to conduct a parallel, two-arm trial that randomizes 454 women
with HDP (75% Black, 25% White) into usual care or an enhanced care intervention to improve
blood pressure control in the year after delivery. Improving blood pressure control is essential to
prevent progression to chronic hypertension, reduce racial disparities in hypertension, and
improve womenâs health overall."
10832079,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). With the
epidemic burden of obesity and metabolic diseases, NAFLD occurrence is steadily rising, along with the need
for therapeutic options of this disease. Preliminary data from rodent and human studies provide strong
evidence to support the hypothesis that monocyte/macrophage-derived TSP1 in obesity downregulates liver
macrophage SMPDL3B and this downregulation feeds back to increase TSP1 binding to its receptor-CD36.
This positive feedback loop together with SMPDL3Bâs action on TLR pathways further amplifies liver
macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling and leads to NAFLD progression. In this proposal, how SMPDL3B
regulates CD36 function and then TSP1-CD36 dependent pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages will be
determined in Aim 1. The in vivo importance of macrophage SMPDL3B in NAFLD development and
progression in both animal models and human liver organoids will be determined in Aim 2. Whether specific
blockade of TSP1/CD36 interaction upregulates liver macrophage SMPDL3B and attenuates liver pro-
inflammatory signaling and NAFLD development and progression will be determined in Aim 3. Completing
these studies will provide novel information on the mechanisms by which suppressed macrophage SMPDL3B
enhances liver macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling and its critical role in the progression of obesity-
associated NAFLD to NASH. Further, testing a novel therapeutic application of a peptide nanoparticle
conjugate to block TSP1/CD36 interaction in obesity-associated NASH in vivo will have translational
significance."
10832582,"Project Summary
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is twice as prevalent in females as in males, with a proportion of
individuals also developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Using predator odor stress (PS) as an animal
model of PTSD, we determined that two PS exposures significantly increased anxiety-related behavior and
neuronal activation in the hippocampus (HC) of male and female C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Notably, intermittent PS
significantly increased alcohol (ethanol) intake by 60% (males) and 71% (females), with heterogeneity in the
response. Further, âsensitivityâ to PS-enhanced ethanol intake conferred significantly greater corticotropin
releasing factor receptor-1 (CRFR1) protein levels in female versus male HC, consistent with evidence for sex
differences in CRFR1 signaling following stress. The proposed studies build on the above evidence by testing
the hypothesis that comorbidity of PTSD and AUD is due to increased CRFR1 expression in HC
neurons projecting to mPFC and that sex differences in CRFR1 induction by PS contribute to this
comorbidity. Aim 1 will determine whether sex differences exist in the association between PS-enhanced
ethanol drinking and alteration in anxiety, heart rate (HR), and/or compulsive ethanol drinking in B6 mice. We
predict that PS-enhanced drinking in âsensitiveâ mice will be associated with an increase in anxiety, HR, and
compulsive drinking and that there will be sex differences in the pattern of changes. Aim 2 will map changes in
CRFR1 expression and neuronal activation by PS and by PS-enhanced drinking in crfr1-gfp mice. We predict
that there will be sex differences in brain regional CRFR1-colabelled activity patterns in response to
intermittent PS and in the relationship with ethanol intake. Aim 3 will manipulate the activity of CRFR1-
expressing neurons using chemogenetic or pharmacologic approaches and determine the impact on PS-
enhanced drinking. Two studies will use Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs
(DREADDs) in crfr1-cre mice to test the necessity and sufficiency of CRFR1 in ventral CA1, with inhibitory (Gi)
and excitatory (Gq) DREADDs, respectively. We predict that preventing PS-induced activation of ventral CA1
(Gi DREADD) will block PS-enhanced drinking only in âsensitiveâ mice, whereas activating the ventral CA1 (Gq
DREADD) will enhance ethanol intake in mice drinking ethanol without intermittent PS. A complementary study
will determine whether systemic administration of a CRFR1 antagonist will reduce PS-enhanced drinking
intake in B6 mice, with the prediction that the antagonist will be most effective in âsensitiveâ mice. Aim 4 will
determine whether manipulation of the projection from ventral CA1 to mPFC is important for PS-enhanced
drinking in B6 mice, by injecting Gi DREADDs into ventral CA1 and clozapine-N-oxide into mPFC. We predict
that preventing PS-induced activation of the ventral CA1 to mPFC projection will block PS-enhanced drinking.
Collectively, the information will elucidate sex differences in mechanisms underlying sensitivity to PS-
enhanced drinking that can be targeted for the treatment of PTSD-induced AUD."

10839398,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Vision loss caused by the death of photoreceptors is a leading cause of irreversible blindness
worldwide, yet therapeutic options remain limited. For this reason, the NEI's Retinal Disease Program has
identiï¬ed the development of strategies for the treatment of retinal degenerations as a core program goal.
Recently, several laboratories have derived photoreceptors from stem cells, making cell-replacement
therapies particularly promising. Additionally, important advances have been made into manipulations that
could stimulate retinal regeneration from the retinal MÃ¼ller glia. The critical barrier for the success of such
therapies is the integration of derived photoreceptors into existing retinal circuits to reestablish their
function. Yet, we still lack a complete understanding on the mechanisms that underlie the normal wiring of
photoreceptors into retinal circuits, especially for cone photoreceptors.
 Cone photoreceptors of different subtypes are wired into speciï¬c retinal circuits, so that functional
differences (like spectral sensitivity) may be exploited to extract speciï¬c information (like color) from the
visual scene. Our main hypothesis for this proposal is that each cone subtype expresses speciï¬c genes that
allow recognition by its postsynaptic partners (bipolar and horizontal cells), and our main goal is to identify
these genes. To accomplish this, we will ï¬rst generate a complete transcriptomic proï¬ling of the four
different cone subtypes in zebraï¬sh, and identify genes that are differentially expressed (aim #1). Based on
this differential expression, we will perform a reverse-genetic screen, where we will assess the functional,
structural and ultrastructural integrity of the cone synapses (aim #2). This will allow us to identify genes that
control the control the formation of synapses between cones and other retinal cells, and that promote the
integration of cones into retinal circuits. We believe that this new knowledge could have direct applications
in the improvement of cell-replacement or regenerative therapies for retinal degenerations. Moreover, wiring
speciï¬city is a key feature of neural circuits in general. This proposal beneï¬ts from the experimental
accessibility of the retina and our deep knowledge of retinal cell types and circuits, but our approach has the
potential to impact the study of other neuronal degenerative diseases."
10840471,"ABSTRACT:
Adolescence is a period of strong cortical plasticity accompanied by significant changes in cognitive, social,
and adaptive functioning. Despite the promise characteristic of this period, it is also a time when social
relationships and emotion processing may intensify, and depression and other forms of psychopathology first
emerge. The lack of longitudinal studies of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), coupled with the
disorder's heterogeneity, clouds our understanding of development during this complex period, and hinders
treatment development. We thus propose to extend our longitudinal investigation of children from the UC Davis
MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project cohort into adolescence. In Specific Aim #1, we predict aspects of
cognitive development in adolescents with ASD based on grant period studies. We hypothesize that ASD will
continue to exhibit at least three trajectories of intellectual functioning (IQ) -- a group with persistently below
average IQs (< 75) from early childhood through adolescence (Persistently Low or P-Low), a group with IQs <
75 in early childhood that increase by at least 1 standard deviation by adolescence (Positive Changers or
+CHG), and a group with persistently average or better IQs (>75) (Persistently High or P-High). We also
predict that preparatory cognitive control will continue to be comparable to TYP, but will be associated with
behavioral inflexibility; that all groups will exhibit comparable performance on aspects of episodic memory; and
that P-Low will show fewer negative emotional false memories. In Specific Aim #2, we examine social
awareness, motivation, and adaptive functioning in between middle childhood and adolescence in ASD. We
predict that +CHG will show improved social awareness and functioning compared to P-Low and P-High,
while all groups show declining social motivation, and that resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
functional connectivity (FC) between the executive/cognitive control (ECN), default mode (DMN), and salience
(SN) networks will be predictive of adolescent social awareness and social functioning while social motivation
is predicted by concurrent engagement of the striatum. Specific Aim #3 investigates the emergence of
depression in ASD between middle childhood and adolescence. We test a prominent model predicting that
increased depression between middle childhood and adolescence will be more common in P-High and +CHG,
and will be associated with increased social awareness, greater retention of negative emotional memories, and
less flexible cognitive control. Additionally, we predict that during a well-validated task-based fMRI Sadness
Introspection Paradigm, functional connectivity between the ECN, DMN, SN, amygdala, and hippocampus
during sadness introspection will be associated with adolescent depression in P-High and +CHG. We also
predict that parent questionnaires, compared to gold standard clinician interviews, will under-report depression
in P-Low. This longitudinal examination of cognition, social functioning, and depression in adolescents with
ASD holds the potential to identify early markers of depression and more tailored precision medicine solutions."
10846563,"Abstract: 
The goal of this proposal is to elucidate how LC-NA promotes specific sleep features to directly facilitate insight gain. Sleep oscillations during NREM sleep have been identified that mediate memory updating and consolidation. LC noradrenergic neurons fire prior of slow waves, whereas LC becomes silent during spindle events all through NREM. A recent study from the Poe lab provided evidence that abnormal LC activity decreases sleep spindle density and affects memory consolidation. However, it is unclear how LC-NA activity gates sleep-dependent neural circuits to improve memory updating and temporal pattern recognition. Thus Aim 1 will use extracellular recordings, EGG/EMG and computational approaches to characterize LC noradrenergic activity patterns during sleep in animals that gain insight after a sleep period. Then in Aim 2 we will evaluate if LC noradrenergic activation or inhibition during sleep is essential to promote insight learning using optogenetic tools. Finally, in Aim 3 utilizing multi-structure extracellular recordings and optogenetic tools we will assess the effects of LC-NA projections to hippocampus (Hipp) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Taken together, the experiments to be performed in this proposal will provide valuable knowledge on how patterns of activity during sleep promote off-line mechanisms that allow for memory updating and provide novel therapeutic venues."
10846564,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Bacteria mount a physiologic stress response to survive hostile or stringent conditions. These stress responses
shape the microbial communities that live in, on, and around us. Despite the importance of stress responses, we
know little about how microbes tolerate complex combinations of stressors.
 This proposal will answer three overarching questions regarding microbial stress responses. 1.) How do
bacteria response to multiple stressors? 2.) How does stress reshape the composition and stability of microbial
communities? 3.) How quickly can we learn the stress responses of newly discovered bacteria? In answering
these questions, several hypotheses will be evaluated using a consistent experimental and theoretical framework.
The stress response networks of pathogenic streptococci will be characterized across multiple scales. Long term,
our goal is to develop tools to analyze and target complex stress responses in the human microbiome."
10846628,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Circadian rhythms drastically alter animal behavior through diverse actions on cellular targets throughout the
body. Disruptions of sleep-activity cycles account for a wide range of diseases affecting behavior, neurology,
metabolism, and muscle physiology. This proposal presents a set of studies designed to understand the
mechanisms and interactions of circadian effects on cells and systems spanning the body. Circadian rhythms
manifest downstream of pacemakers via signaling molecules that act directly on targets to regulate physiology.
Understanding how distinct targets are modified to achieve a constellation of physiological and behavioral
rhythms is a major goal in chronobiological research. We study how neurons, muscles, and biomechanics
interact in larval zebrafish, a tractable diurnal vertebrate, and our preliminary experiments suggest these animals
experience a breadth of circadian changes far more diverse than previously known. Although the zebrafish is an
imperfect model of sleep behavior, its clear circadian rhythms combined with its tractability for physiological,
behavioral, and genetic approaches make it an ideal system for understanding how circadian rhythms organize
and interact across cells and organs. We propose to define how diverse circadian effects on nervous system
output and muscle physiology amount to complex behavioral output, by tracking and modeling zebrafish behavior
and arousal across the diel cycle. We will manipulate light exposure to disentangle circadian and photic effects
on target systems, and we will use computational models to understand how circadian effects interact to shape
behavioral output. Furthermore, we will evaluate the breadth of circadian regulation of physiology across cellular
targets by performing in vivo electrophysiology and functional imaging. Combining this approach with cellular-
resolution transcriptional profiling enables us to define how circadian effector molecules signal divergently across
targets. Finally, we will test for interactions across circadian targets by examining rhythms following focal lesions
throughout the nervous system. Together these experiments will provide detailed information and models
regarding the interaction of circadian effects across cells and systems."
10844703,"ABSTRACT
 Tumor antigen-triggered T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in the cytoplasm and transcriptional/epigenetic
control in the nucleus are central to CD8+ T cell-dependent antitumor immunity. However, strong and persistent
antigen stimulation leads to immune exhaustion. Compared to tumor drainage lymph nodes, the tumor
microenvironment (TME) contains higher amounts of tumor antigens and their prolonged presentation to tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ T cells can exacerbate T cell exhaustion and immune evasion. Except for co-inhibitory receptors,
it is largely unknown how T cells adapt to the antigen-rich milieu of TME. Better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying TME-unique regulation of T cell functions could inform novel therapies aimed at reinvigorating the
antitumor potential of exhausted CD8+ T cells.
 The overarching scientific objective of our proposed work is to determine how negative elongation factor
(NELF), known for its function in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, regulates CD8+ T cell activities in a TME-
unique manner. Our preliminary work suggests that NELF is both necessary and rate-limiting in promoting the
antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells. Of note, this NELF function is unique to CD8+ T cells within the TME, but not
in tumor drainage lymph nodes. Furthermore, our published and unpublished data point to potential dual actions
of distinct subcellular pools of NELF: while nuclear NELF participates in transcriptional and epigenetic programs,
cytoplasmic NELF attenuates TCR signaling. We hypothesize that the combined actions of NELF likely
contribute to stronger T cell memory and less T cell exhaustion. Built upon rigorous scientific premises and
multidisciplinary expertise, we will validate this novel hypothesis by deciphering the TME-unique function of
NELF (Aim 1), interrogating its dual molecular actions in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Aim 2), and exploring the
utility of NELF overexpression in boosting efficacy of anticancer immunotherapies (Aim 3).
 The concept that NELF has a TME-unique function in antitumor immunity is novel. Furthermore, the proposed
dual actions of NELF clearly deviate from the Pol II pausing-exclusive paradigm of NELF biology. The proposed
work in this multi-PI R01 proposal promises to shed light on a previously unappreciated regulator of TME-unique
functions of tumor-infiltrating T cells, with potential for a sustained impact on the understanding of antitumor
immunity. From a translational perspective, discoveries from this project could inform more effective approaches
to boost T cell memory and overcome T cell exhaustion, thus helping address a significant barrier and unmet
clinical need in anticancer immunotherapies."
10847511,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A substantial number of people at hereditary risk for cancer could benefit from novel genetic counseling (GC)
approaches that promote education, engagement, and outreach to at-risk relatives (ARR). When probands
carrying pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PV) are asked to share medically actionable genetic results with
their ARR, less than 30% of ARR complete predictive âcascadeâ testing, putting lives at risk. Provider -facilitated
outreach to ARR leads to improved cascade testing uptake. Yet, rigorous experimental study designs have not
been used to demonstrate comparative effectiveness of this approach for sustainably expanding ARR access
to cancer GC and testing, or to investigate whether digital technology may enhance provider-facilitated
outreach. Patients with a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) may also benefit from enhanced GC
engagement; current standard of care leaves serious risks for misinterpretation by patients and non-genetics
providers, and consequent medical mismanagement. Patients may experience negative responses to VUS,
particularly when encountering discordant interpretations or recommendations between providers and
confusion about how they will receive variant updates. In addition, best practices for follow-up and
reassessment of a VUS would benefit from technology to support continuity of patient care with local primary
care providers (PCPs). The proposed study addresses these needs by assessing the impact of a new GC
model that leverages the increasing digitization of healthcare on psychosocial, behavioral, and implementation
outcomes for probands with PV and their ARR, and for patients with a VUS result. We will first enhance an
existing digital tool to include linguistically tailored and end-user vetted features that increase patient access,
education, and sustained engagement. We will incorporate feedback on this enhanced Digital Genetics
Platform (eDGP) from relevant end-user cognitive interviews (n=60) and a focus group (nâ10). Next, we will
conduct two RCTs involving either probands with a PV (n=350) and their ARR (nâ3150), or patients with a
VUS (n=280). Probands and their ARR will be randomized to the standard of care arm, wherein probands
outreach to ARR to encourage testing, or the intervention arm, wherein the GC team is given permission to
outreach to ARR with support from the eDGP to expand service access across the U.S. Patients with a VUS
will be randomized to obtain follow-up care through the standard of care arm, wherein they are recommended
to re-contact the GC care team in 1-2 years, or the intervention arm, wherein they access the eDGP to remain
engaged with the GC care team, and receive education and reminders for update appointments. We will also
directly assess PCPsâ uptake of digital VUS education. Participants will complete surveys to assess uptake,
psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, and intervention implementation readiness and cost. This research
has the potential to improve care for patients with a PV and their families, and patients with a VUS, and will
ultimately be applicable to the practice of GC and genomic medicine across diseases and clinical settings."

10849751,"Program Abstract
The extensive water networks of the United States maritime industry carry over 65 percent of
the products transported in and around the country. Every United States region has supply lines
to navigable waterways and/or coastal or inland ports that are used to transport these goods. In
an industry that handles such a wide variety and abundance of material within and out of ports,
incidental exposures are impossible to prevent, although they can be reduced through
recognition of the hazardous nature of certain materials and training to minimize incidental
exposure as well as accidents and mishandling. It is important that all workers at all levels in the
maritime industry receive proper training on how to recognize and handle hazardous materials,
along with risk reduction methods. Training for workers within and ancillary to the maritime
industry that handle hazardous materials as well as training related to worker safety and health
has been limited. Over nearly a decade, Project South East Area Maritime Industry Safety
Training (SEAMIST), a Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP) funded by a
cooperative agreement with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
has addressed this unmet need. Specifically, Project SEAMIST provides health and safety
training for personnel whose jobs may bring them in contact with hazardous materials in ports.
To date, the program has been very successful, training approximately 7,000 participants,
logging close to 70,000 contact hours and targeting several occupational areas in the maritime
industry within Florida, Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, South
Carolina, New York, and California. Project SEAMIST continues to aim to resolve the lack of
economical and specialized training courses available to the maritime industry workers,
especially as there has been numerous hazardous material incidents that have occurred within
the maritime industry. At the Port of Miami in Florida, a steel container leaked ammonia that
closed a section of the cargo area. At the Port of Long Beach in California, a container leaked
propyl acetate and injured twelve people. These incidents demonstrate a continued occurrence
of hazardous material events and thus the need for expanded and ongoing training for the
health and safety of the maritime workers involved. In carrying Project SEAMIS forward, we aim
to provide safety and hazardous preparedness training to over 9,000 maritime workers in both
English and Spanish, and continue to revise, optimize and enhance our training curricula and
evaluation protocols to reduce and possibly eliminate incidences of injuries and deaths among
maritime workers."
10849752,"Program Abstract
Accidents, natural disasters, exposure to hazardous agents and terrorism are constant threats
in the maritime industry. Hazardous materials incidents are generally infrequent but can be
catastrophic when they occur, resulting in serious injury and death. Workers in the maritime
environment have limited experience responding to hazmat emergencies, limited knowledge of
emergency procedures and often limited rapid access to qualified emergency responders or
hazmat units. The Institute for Disaster and Emergency Preparedness (IDEP) within Nova
Southeastern University (NSU)'s Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine (KPCOM)
is a regional, national and international resource for the provision of educational services,
trainings and programs focused on all-hazards preparedness, disaster and emergency
preparedness and hazardous waste worker safety training. IDEP began as a task force shortly
after 9/11 and is now formally an Institute that is widely recognized for its expertise with major
support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA) and the Florida Department of Health. For nearly five years, Project
Hazardous Material Maritime Industry Response Training Initiative (HazMIRTSI), a Hazmat
Preparedness Disaster Training Program (HPDTP), funded by a cooperative agreement with the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), builds on existing programs and
relationships established by IDEP and the greater SEAMIST program (a Hazardous Waste
Worker Training Program (HWWTP) targeting health and safety for personnel whose jobs may
bring them into contact with hazardous materials). Specifically, Project HazMIRTSI has
extended our presence from the Gulf and Atlantic states to the northern Atlantic states of
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maine, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
Project HazMIRTSI trains fire rescue and emergency medicine service (EMS) personnel to
respond to emergencies at sea and in port as well as preparedness and recovery training to
healthcare workers, volunteers and communities impacted by disasters, with emphasis on
hurricanes and flooding. To date, HazMIRTSI has trained approximately 1,000 first responders
to effectively handle disasters on our waterways, reducing and possibly eliminating incidences
of injuries and deaths among first responders and community members. In carrying Project
HazMIRTSI forward, we aim plans to expand our disaster response training to 3,000 skilled
response personnel, provide new disaster preparedness training to 1,000 community members
and continue to revise, optimize and enhance our training curricula and evaluation protocols."
10849756,"The Research Development Core is a required (and essential) component of the San Antonio (SA) Nathan
Shock Center. The core provides support for research career development of junior faculty and for more senior
investigators who wish to apply their expertise in related research areas to basic aging research. To accomplish
these aims, the core administers the Access to Core Services for investigators at any institution in the country
and the Pilot Project Program for local investigators. The Access to Core Services program invites applications
from other institutions to collaborate with researchers at the SA Shock Center, enabling scientists anywhere in
the aging research community to take advantage of the unique resources available at this center. These activities
of the Research Development Core serve to coordinate Research Career Development Activities for
junior/new investigators and scientists entering geroscience at any level. For career development activities, the
core coordinates its activities with the Administrative/Program Enrichment Core.
 The Research Development Core's Specific Aims are to:
 1. Facilitate research in the basic biology of aging across the country by providing funding that makes the
core services of our center available to all qualified investigators on a competitive basis. The new Access
to Core Services program provides a means for any investigator at any institution to use the services of any of
the cores (Animal, Pathology, Pharmacology, Integrative Physiology of Aging) for their innovative research in
geroscience.
 2. Administer a Pilot Project Program for local investigators that aims to expand the scope of research in
the basic biology of aging at UTHSCSA. The program will continue to support the large numbers of faculty
members at the institution with research in geroscience, particularly those newly recruited to the university.
 3. Assist new investigators in research career development and assist investigators at all levels to pursue
novel ideas in aging research. The core will provide a variety of assistance with grant and project development,
as well as aspects of career advancement. Mentoring will be carried out by the core leadership in association
with senior faculty of the Barshop Institute and will be coordinated with mentoring activities of the awardees'
departments and home institutions.
 4. Evaluate the success of these programs by tracking grants and publications of awardees; recommend
changes to our Executive Committee when necessary. The overall metrics of the success of the core's activities
are the awardees' success in publishing high-impact papers and obtaining sustained extramural grant support.
In association with the Administrative Core, the Research Development Core will maintain continuing records of
the success of awardees and make recommendations for adjustment of the programs as needed."
10844705,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic pain is a global healthcare problem that reduces the quality of patientsâ lives and increases med-
ical expenditures. Inadequate pain control with available treatments indicates a need to understand mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis to develop novel treatment strategies in chronic pain. The GHC1 gene (Gch1 in
rodents) encodes GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1). GTPCH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4) synthesis which is an essential cofactor for catecholamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine),
serotonin, and nitric oxide production. Alterations in Gch1 gene expression are implicated in the development
and maintenance of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rodents. Genetic mutations in the GCH1 gene are also
linked with pain perception in humans. Thus far, evidence regarding the role of Gch1 in chronic pain has come
from animal models of sciatic nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, cancer, or visceral pain and these studies
have focused on the role of Gch1 in the peripheral nervous system. To date, no study has investigated the role
of Gch1 in a chronic orofacial neuropathic pain model and no study has investigated Gch1 in reward and brain
regions involved in pain modulation and reward. We hypothesize that orofacial neuropathic pain increases the
expression of Gch1 in trigeminal ganglia and central pain- and reward-related pathways, and inhibition of
GTPCH1 via the GTP cyclohydrolase inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) will alleviate nerve in-
jury-induced pain responses concordant with altering Gch1 gene expression and monoamine turnover in the
brain and the periphery. As there is legitimate concern that any novel analgesic could have misuse potential, we
will also study the motivating and rewarding effects of DAHP in naÃ¯ve and chronic pain conditions. Here we
hypothesize that DAHP acquires rewarding properties only in a chronic pain state. We will address these ques-
tions using an operant orofacial pain assay, an orofacial neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constriction
injury of the infraorbital nerve, targeted molecular methods and place conditioning behavior in rats. Data gener-
ated from the current application is expected to provide avenues towards new non-addictive safe treatment
strategies for the management of chronic pain via modulation of GTPCH1."
10847789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are induced by genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic
agents, and during encounters of the DNA replication machinery with DNA damage. The two major, mechanistically
distinct DSB repair pathways are non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and DNA homology-directed repair
(HDR). NHEJ is efficient but error-prone. HDR is inherently accurate and represents the preferred repair tool for
DNA replication-associated DSBs. HDR commences with the resection of the 5â-terminated strand at break ends
to generate a DNA tail that serves as the template for assembly of the RAD51 recombinase filament. DSB repair
pathway choice is linked to cell cycle progression and is determined by whether or not a DSB undergoes extensive
resection. Long-range resection is principally mediated by the 5â-3â exonuclease EXO1 or the BLM helicase-
DNA2 endonuclease. The chromatin reader 53BP1 nucleates the formation of a higher order ensemble that harbors
the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex at DSB ends to block end resection in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The
restrictive action of the 53BP1 axis is alleviated by BRCA1-BARD1 in S and G2 phases via mechanisms that are
poorly understood. Thus, BRCA1-deficient tumors, on account of their HDR-deficiency, are particularly vulnerable
to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to synthetic lethality. However, dysfunction in the 53BP1 axis leads to HDR
restoration and PARPi resistance.
 We have discovered that 53BP1 binds double-stranded DNA. We hypothesize that DNA binding by 53BP1 is
germane for its role in the recruitment of downstream factors and the imposition of DSB repair pathway choice.
Importantly, we find that the CST complex physically interacts with and inhibits EXO1 as well as BLM-DNA2, while
BRCA1-BARD1 efficiently overcomes these restrictive activities of CST. We hypothesize that CST acts via
physical interaction with resection enzymes and association with ssDNA to attenuate DNA end resection while
BRCA1-BARD1 counters CST by disrupting these inhibitory interactions and by stimulating resection enzymes.
To elucidate the underpinnings of the DNA end resection restriction circuitry, we will (1) determine the biological
role of DNA binding by 53BP1, (2) delineate how CST interferes with the activity of the 5â-3â exonuclease EXO1
and of the helicase-endonuclease complex BLM-DNA2 in DNA end resection, and (3) interrogate BRCA1-BARD1
for its ability to overcome the restriction of DNA end resection imposed by CST.
 Our studies and synergy with Project 1 and Project 3 will elucidate the intricate regulatory networks that control
DNA end resection onset and efficiency. These collaborative endeavors will not only illuminate the mechanistic
principles of DSB repair pathway choice but will also exert a major impact in our understanding of how DSBs and
stressed DNA replication forks lead to cancer and will provide actionable information to help guide the development
of targeted cancer therapies to treat BRCA-deficient cancers."
10830353,"Project Description
Antibiotics effective against Gram-negative pathogens are a critical area of unmet need. Infections caused by
these pathogens are not only difficult to treat but finding new therapies to overcome Gram-negative resistance
is also a challenge. The major obstacle in antibiotic discovery pipeline is the lack of understanding how to breach
antibiotic permeability barriers of these pathogens. Furthermore, these permeability barriers are one of the major
resistance mechanisms to antibiotics in clinical settings. The long-term goal of this project is to establish
structure-activity relationships between drug uptake, efflux and inhibitory activities of antibiotics in the context of
permeation barriers with different properties. During the previous funding period, we made significant progress
in understanding the functional and regulatory interactions between efflux pumps and cellular membranes in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia thailandensis. These pathogens are
notorious for their virtually unbreachable permeability barriers and understanding how these barriers can be
penetrated is critical for successful development of new therapeutics and for effective management of emerging
antibiotic resistance. The major objective of this application is to characterize how changes in the expression
and functions of efflux pumps are integrated into bacterial physiology and how drug permeability barriers are
modified during bacterial infections. To achieve this objective, we will analyze relationships between efflux pumps
and permeability barriers in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and B. thailandensis pathogens that differ significantly
in the composition of their outer membranes and efflux pumps. We will next extend these relationships into the
bacteria-host cell interface and will determine how bacterial infections affects drug fluxes across both bacterial
and host cell membranes."
10830305,"Abstract
Cocaine abuse remains a major burden on public health with significant numbers of overdose deaths
each year. The proposed work characterizes a neural circuit that underlies the increased drug
consumption that takes place by some individuals following chronic drug use. This application leverages
previous work demonstrating that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), dynorphin and dopamine
signaling can individually impact drug intake and that each of these systems changes with chronic
cocaine use. Specifically, the proposed experiments ask how these three neuromodulatory systems
interact with each other in the regulation drug consumption. The working hypothesis is that escalation
of drug intake following chronic drug use, comes about through a serial pathway where elevated CRF
levels causes an increase in dynorphin which consequently reduces dopamine release, producing
escalation. However, the experiments are designed to systematically test the functional connections
between each of these nodes in the regulation of cocaine intake and, in doing so, discern between eight
competing models of the interactions. Therefore, regardless, of whether the results match the working
hypothesis or not, the experiments will yield new insight into the interactions between these systems.
This information will inform potential treatment targets for moderating intake in substance abusers and
thereby reducing harm."

Elizabeth Bowdridge, Ph.D., is a reproductive toxicologist whose overarching career goal is to establish a
successful laboratory focused on the effects of occupational and environmental factors on microvascular
adaptations during gestation that ultimately impact fetal outcomes. Her proposed project combines an
occupationally relevant inhalation exposure model during gestation and epigenetic analysis of offspring, which
will establish the impact of hormones and vascular adaptations that are critical for healthy reproductive
outcomes. Acquiring this knowledge is a critical step for ensuring optimal maternal and fetal health.
 Career Development Plan: Dr. Bowdridge is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of
Physiology and Pharmacology at West Virginia University (WVU). The proposed career development plan will
build upon her previous training with four training goals to enhance her trajectory toward becoming an
independent investigator: 1) Acquire advanced training in placental pathologies and identification of
nanomaterials using techniques such as FESEM and TEM; 2) Broaden my knowledge of how the dose of
specific toxicants are applicable in an occupational setting and ways in which these affect critical windows of
embryonic and fetal developmental, oxidant formation, and epigenetics; 3) Increase technical expertise in
occupational exposure relevance, dose deposition and epigenetic analysis across generations; 4) Develop
professional skills in grant writing, research and laboratory leadership, statistical analysis, and research ethics.
Mentors/environment: Dr. Bowdridge and her primary mentor, Dr. Timothy Nurkiewicz, Ph.D., have
assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors to guide her through the proposed training and research
activities. The proposed career development plan utilizes the intellectual, microscopy, free radical biology, and
genomics resources available through WVU and at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
The WVU Genomics and Bioinformatics cores provide centralized genomic and biostatistical analysis training
to investigators at WVU and other universities across WV. As an institution WVU is committed to supporting
junior faculty members through internal grants, administrative support and structured opportunities for faculty
networking and education.
Research: Adverse reproductive outcomes, such as miscarriages, are common in pregnant women working in
occupational settings. These women are exposed to ENM such as, nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TIO2) via
inhalation. One likely, but uninvestigated, way that ENM may mediate these poor outcomes in an occupational
setting is by decreasing hormones critical pregnancy hormones such as estradiol (E2). This proposal is the first
step in linking E2 and the peptide Kiss with vascular dysfunction and adverse reproductive outcomes due to
occupationally relevant maternal nano-TiO2 inhalation exposure. Aim 1 identifies the roles of E2 and Kiss and
oxidant load across timepoints in gestation on uterine microvascular function and fetal health following
maternal nano-TiO2 inhalation exposure. Aim 2 determines the impact of maternal nano-TiO2 inhalation
exposure on reproductive health of F1 female progeny. The completion of these aims will identify the roles of
E2 and Kiss in establishing a healthy fetal environment by regulating vascular and endocrine function during
occupational exposures."

 Approximately 280,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States in 2021
and more than 40,000 will die from the disease. It is well documented that early detection results in improved
morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound imaging is an important screening and diagnostic breast cancer detection
tool, particularly for women with dense breasts when mammography tends to be suboptimal. While suspicious
ï¬ndings may be clariï¬ed with ultrasound imaging, a subset of ultrasound images yield inconclusive results, ne-
cessitating biopsies or follow-up imaging, which increase patient anxiety and places additional burdens on the
time available for clinical care and the resource allocations of our healthcare system. One reason for this out-
standing challenge is that dense breasts tend to create images with signiï¬cant acoustic clutter, which confounds
the differentiation of an otherwise anechoic mass (which is indicative of a benign cyst) from a truly hypoechoic
mass (which could be indicative of malignancy). In addition, it can be difï¬cult to distinguish a complicated cyst
(which has internal echoes due to proteinaceous material and is benign) from either a solid mass or a complex
cystic and solid mass (which could be malignant) using standard ultrasound imaging methods alone.
 The objective of this proposal is to develop new, real-time ultrasound imaging technology that will simplify clin-
ical workï¬ows by distinguishing ï¬uid-ï¬lled masses from solid masses and from complex cystic and solid masses,
which all appear hypoechoic in traditional ultrasound B-mode images. Our novel approach, Robust Short-Lag
Spatial Coherence (R-SLSC) imaging, has demonstrated feasibility to make this distinction by incorporating
coherence-based beamforming to augment existing beamforming methods available in clinical ultrasound scan-
ners. Aim 1 will focus on development of a real-time system for implementing matched B-mode and R-SLSC
imaging. Aim 2 will evaluate and compare real-time system performance. Aim 3 will assess the ability of our
novel methods to distinguish ï¬uid from solid or complex cystic and solid masses utilizing a combination of quanti-
tative analyses and task-oriented reader studies. Aim 4 will investigate advanced methods to retrieve coherence
information and diagnostic information regarding mass contents from ultrasound channel data, including recently
discovered options that rely on coherence lengths and lag-one coherence values without requiring reader input.
 Successful completion of these aims will lead to a real-time, ultrasound-based tool to conï¬dently distinguish
solid from ï¬uid hypoechoic breast masses and provide a more simpliï¬ed clinical workï¬ow for the most challenging
of these cases. In addition, results from the proposed studies will be applicable to clarifying the content of masses
that may appear in multiple organs throughout the human body (e.g., testicular, liver, or pancreatic masses)."

Pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) experience an excess risk of adverse outcomes related to their cancer
diagnosis and the treatment they receive. The accumulation and severity of these acute and chronic health
conditions broadly impact PCS functioning, quality of life, and health care resource utilization. Consequently,
PCS are more likely to live in financial hardship, have lower educational attainment, be unemployed due to poor
health, and be under- or uninsured compared with their age-based peers. Latino PCS are at particularly high risk
for having a lower socioeconomic status (SES compared with non-Latino PCS. These factors contribute to
reduced access to routine medical care, and lower overall survival of Latino children diagnosed with cancer.
Existing and well-established patient cohorts of PCS largely include long-term (at least 5 years) survivors and a
relatively small proportion of Latino PCS, so that the outcome data that inform our understanding of risk for
cancer treatment late effects, and therefore our clinical practice guidelines, are largely derived from the
experiences of NHW PCS. The over-arching objective of this proposal is to identify and comprehensively assess
adverse outcomes among Latino PCS that will inform clinical guidelines and lay the foundation for early, targeted
interventions to mitigate such outcomes in this vulnerable and growing population of PCS. Key to the success of
our proposal is the prospective establishment of a Latino PCS cohort in Texas that is linked with genomic and
geographic data (UG3 planning phase), which will permit analyses of the interaction between ancestry and SES
on risk for adverse cancer treatment outcomes during the UH3 implementation phase. There is a significant
unmet need to comprehensively characterize the socioeconomic, psychosocial, genomic, and metabolomic risk
determinants of treatment-related toxicities and relapse in Latino PCS in the context of known clinical risk factors.
In addition, among under-represented minorities there is a critical need to identify facilitators and barriers to
obtaining survivorship care. Therefore, utilizing existing and prospectively collected longitudinal data, we will: (1)
Identify demographic, clinical, and genetic/molecular determinants of treatment-related toxicities and their
association with chronic health conditions, patient-reported symptoms, and neurocognitive/ psychological and
functional outcomes in Latino PCS; (2) Identify demographic, clinical, and genetic/molecular determinants of the
excess risk of cancer relapse/recurrence in a cohort of Latino PCS; and (3) Determine Latino PCS understanding
of risk for late effects and rationale for survivorship care, and identify perceived facilitators and barriers to
obtaining survivorship care. This proposal synergizes multidisciplinary expertise and data collected from clinical
and epidemiological resources to establish a prospective, comprehensive biobank and database inclusive of a
large population of Latino PCS. Our aims represent the largest assessment to date of genetic and SES
contributors to outcomes in Latino PCS, an effort that is imperative to inform risk assessments for adverse
outcomes in an ethno-diverse population, as well as potential barriers to obtaining optimal survivorship care."
10848236,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Addiction Connectome Core
The pattern of connections between brain regions (the brainâs wiring diagram) determines how they communicate
and ultimately, how they contribute to behavior. Understanding how connectivity changes with drugs is essential
for determining the mechanisms of addiction. Recent innovations in neuroimaging have allowed scientists to
study neural connectivity across the whole brain. This work has taken place mostly in humans. At the same time,
invasive methods in animal models have led to a wealth of information on cellular changes. However, these two
approaches remain largely disconnected. The Addiction Connectome Core (ACC) will bridge this translational
gap by supporting the development of a whole-brain, multimodal connectome in mice and monkeys. The
connectome will shed light of the predictors and consequences of addiction. In addition to developing the
infrastructure and collecting core data for the connectome, we will develop a web-based searchable database
that also facilitates integration of data in mice and monkeys from multiple methodological sources before and
after exposure to two types of drugs. The ACC will integrate and make publicly available data bearing on its
mission from three sources: (1) data specifically collected for the Core, (2) data collected by the other Cores
(Structural Circuits Core and Imaging Cells during Behavior Core), and (3) data collected by extramural
scientists. As such, the core will lead to the generation and curation of a searchable, discoverable, and organized
integrated database of brain anatomy as it relates to addiction."
10848239,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pilot Projects Core
The primary goal of the proposed NIDA Center for Neural Circuits in Addiction is to extend and enhance the
research capabilities of NIH-funded addiction research projects at the University of Minnesota (UMN). The
proposed Viral Innovation Core (VIC), Imaging Cells during Behavior Core (ICBC), Structural Circuits Core
(SCC) and Addiction Connectome Core (ACC) will provide extensive technical expertise and infrastructure to
individual investigators. To complement these efforts, the Pilot Project Core (PPC) will provide necessary
means to foster new research and interactions by selecting and funding innovative projects that can
synergistically combine the capabilities of the Research Cores to push the envelope in neural circuit research.
The PPC, led by Center Director, Dr. Thomas, will engage a panel of Center faculty and External Advisors
(i.e. the Pilot Panel) who will review proposals and present finalists to the Steering Committee for final
determination. Following consultation with Program staff at NIDA, two to four projects will be funded each
fiscal year. Proposals will be reviewed in accordance with standard NIH review criteria (significance,
innovation, rigor and feasibility) and should address one or more of the following priorities: 1) ESIs; 2) New
entrants to addiction research; 3) Demonstrate translational potential; 4) Engage a team of PIs who have not
previously collaborated with one another; 5) Use Research Cores in a novel way; and/or 6) Develop substantial
new capabilities for one or more Research Cores. Inclusion of preliminary data is not required. Applications
for ""bridge funds"" or to extend ongoing projects will not be entertained. Finally, the Pilot Panel will also work
on research dissemination so that Center members have the opportunity on a regular basis to see specific
applications of Research Core functions, which we expect will stimulate creative new uses for these functions
and new collaborations.
The Core has two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will establish the Pilot Research Program with the first two recipient
teams. These include a project from New Investigators, Drs. Patrick Rothwell and Esther Krook-Magnuson
entitled: âParsing Interneuron Diversity in the Nucleus Accumbens to Understand the Actions of Fentanylâ and
a project from Drs. Matthew Chafee, Benjamin Hayden, and Jan Zimmernann titled âFront-Parietal Circuit
Manipulation in Macaques.â Their team is composed of an ESI (Zimmermann) and two established investigators,
forming a new collaborative team. Proposed awards are $50k over a period of up to two years. In Aim 2, the
Pilot Panel, in consultation with the Steering Committee, will establish and maintain infrastructure, policies and
procedures for award selection, ongoing evaluation and research dissemination of innovative pilot projects."
10848333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral diagnosis, is a
heterogeneous disorder linked to poor adult outcomes including high rates of academic underachievement,
mental illness, substance abuse, and criminal activity. A critical obstacle to improving long-term ADHD
outcomes is the current lack of quantitative neurophysiologic markers that could be used to improve precision
treatment (behavioral and pharmacologic). In research funded during two grant periods, we addressed this
barrier: Leveraging observed associations of ADHD-associated impairments in motor control with core
impairments in cognitive and emotional control to pursue motor physiologic biomarkers linked to ADHD
diagnosis and symptom severity. Engaging expertise of two research teams in different cities, we developed,
refined, and effectively implemented innovative methods for evaluating motor physiology in school-age children
with ADHD. During the first grant period we initiated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) investigations of
motor cortex, discovering that Short Interval Cortical Inhibition (SICI) is reduced in children with ADHD and that
this reduced SICI correlates with parent-ratings of ADHD symptom severity, with consistent findings across the
two sites. During the second grant period, we developed (TMS-compatible) child-friendly games as paradigms
for evaluation of motor cortex physiology under conditions requiring cognitive and emotional control. We found
that SICI is reduced in children with ADHD during action selection and inhibition (as well as rest). Further, we
discovered that TMS-evoked increases in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude from rest to task
engagement (which we have denoted as âTask Related Up Modulationâ - TRUM) are significantly diminished in
ADHD. Interestingly, while both TRUM and SICI robustly correlate with ADHD severity, they show limited
correlation with each other. These published findings, in conjunction promising preliminary analyses of TMS-
behavioral associations, suggest a model in which these two promising, distinct physiologic biomarkers reflect
differential domains of dysfunction in ADHD, with SICI reflecting mechanisms linked to maintaining attention
and filtering distractions, while TRUM reflects the capacity to modulate response control particularly under
cognitively and emotionally demanding conditions. To pursue validation of SICI and TRUM as physiologic
biomarkers, we now propose: AIM 1 To establish test-retest reliability of SICI and TRUM in children with ADHD
and typically developing (TD) controls. AIM 2 To quantify stimulant treatment-induced changes in SICI and
TRUM in children with ADHD as a validation of utility of these biomarkers for treatment focused studies. AIM 3
To explore the differential association of SICI and TRUM with ADHD-relevant RDoC constructs of Cognitive
Control and Emotional Positive/Negative Valence. Achieving these aims will lay groundwork for future use of
SICI and TRUM as a pragmatic and biologically meaningful quantitative measure that can be applied to
investigations of precision ADHD treatment, genetics, and risk factors for serious long-term outcomes."
10848418,"Abstract:
The 2019 nCoV (SARS-CoV2 or nCoV2) is currently causing a global pandemic, and is on track to cause millions
of infections, hundreds of thousands of deaths, and significantly disrupt healthcare systems and economies
globally. nCoV2 is a group 2B coronavirus that is 75% identical to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2003. Approximately 10% of nCoV2 infections result in COVID-19
pneumonia that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while a significant fraction of other
individuals are asymptomatic or develop mild disease. While age, gender, and underlying health conditions
predispose individuals to severe disease/death, we have a poor understanding of the factors that drive disease
outcome. This knowledge is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and for
developing and testing safe and effective nCoV vaccines and therapies. However, while patient studies
can provide insights into the disease risk factors, mechanistic analysis of these factors will require robust animal
models of COVID-19 disease. Unfortunately, nCoV does not replicate in standard laboratory mice, and a
significant need exists for new animal models that reproduce human-like COVID-19 disease, including ARDS.
Collaborative Cross (CC) mice vary significantly in their response to SARS-CoV, and we were able to take
advantage of this variation both to develop new models SARS-CoV-induced disease, while also identifying host
genetic factors that regulate disease outcome. Based on this experience, we propose take advantage of a new
mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 virus (maCoV2), which was recently developed in the Baric laboratory, to screen a
panel of CC mouse strains for susceptibility to maCoV2-induced disease. This work will accomplish two critical
research objectives by: 1) developing critically needed mouse models of nCoV2-induced disease, and 2)
identifying polymorphic host genes/pathways that regulate resistance or susceptibility to nCoV2-disease."
10848676,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
ABSTRACT
The goal of Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) at Roswell Park is to assist investigators in the
development, implementation, conduct, completion, and reporting of clinical trials in a scientifically rigorous and
regulatory compliant manner. This goal is carried out by Clinical Research Services (CRS), a centralized
resource that oversees a broad portfolio of clinical trials, including institutional trials (e.g., investigator-initiated
trials or IITs), trials in association with national clinical trial networks (LAPS/NCTN), other National Cancer
Institute (NCI)-sponsored trials (ETCTN, CITN, EDDOP, COG), I-SPY Network and industry-sponsored trials.
CPDM staff assist investigators in assembling clinical and scientific content for protocols, developing budgets,
and facilitating timely initiation and completion of trial activities such as effective protocol reviews and
implementation. Training and educational materials are provided to all faculty and staff engaged in clinical trial
activities. CPDM oversight of clinical research extends to submission of the protocol, development of
amendments, and continuing reviews in conjunction with the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and Institutional
Review Board (IRB), quality assurance, and management and tracking of all regulatory documents. CPDM staff
provide critical administrative support to the Clinical Disease Teams (CDTs) for protocol prioritization and
assessments of ongoing scientific relevance, and for interactions with the SRC (see Protocol Review and
Monitoring System) and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).
The work of CPDM is organized around four specific aims:
1. Provide central infrastructure foundational to collaboration and productivity, including a clinical

10848677,"ABSTRACT â PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
The overall goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to promote rigorous review of the
scientific merit, priorities, and progress of all clinical research, and to ensure that adequate resources are available
at Roswell Park for such research. To address this goal, PRMS employs 3 Specific Aims: 1) Develop and determine
the feasibility and prioritization of protocols; 2) Review protocols for scientific merit, study design, catchment area
needs and relevance to the mission of Roswell Park; and 3) Track and evaluate safety, quality, ongoing scientific
relevance and accrual progress of each study. Operationally, the PRMS manages protocol prioritization, scientific
review, operational implementation and scientific progress of protocols through its committees and charters. PRMS
is comprised of four components, the Clinical Disease Teams (CDTs), the Operational Feasibility Committee, the
Scientific Review Committee, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. CDTs are responsible for
prioritization of disease specific therapeutic interventional trials, with emphasis on prioritizing studies related to
cancers seen in the catchment area and to improve inclusion of minoritized populations, as well as ongoing
scientific relevance of the existing trials. The Operational Feasibility Committee assures adequate resources are
available for each protocol. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) performs reviews on the scientific merit of
each protocol and determines alignment with the scientific priorities for Roswell Park. In addition, the SRC
evaluates the degree of risk associated with each protocol and monitors progress from recruitment to completion
of clinical research. The SRC has the authority to terminate protocols that do not demonstrate sufficient progress.
Roswell Park continually strives to improve its processes and operations to maximize efficiency and ensure all
clinical research meets high scientific standards. In the previous funding period multiple procedural changes were
made that improved efficiency and refined scientific review. These changes included implementation of disease
site protocol prioritization and portfolio management by CDTs, biannual review of disease site portfolios and closure
of low or slow accruing studies that did not involve rare diseases, and continuing assessment of catchment area
relevance. These procedural changes have been instrumental in achieving a decreased time to SRC approval.
The median time from submission to final SRC approval for all trials decreased from 38 days in 2018 to 19 days in
2022. The number of days from activation date to the first accrual date decreased from 69 days in 2018 to 35 days
in 2022. Clinical Research Services, which is the implementation arm of PRMS, provides Protocol Editors, who
assist investigators in refining their protocols, assuring all required elements are included and improving the overall
quality of protocols submitted. and resources including templates, process instructions, and guidelines, and links
to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, NCI Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), and Investigational New Drug exemption criteria."
10848817,"CF1: Biospecimen Repository and Pathology Core
ABSTRACT
The Biospecimen Repository and Pathology Core (CF1) is designed to provide support to the basic and
translational research efforts of the SPORE. CF1 will play a central role in collecting, annotating, storing,
distributing, and tracking of tissue and blood biospecimens from patients enrolled in research protocols. The
Core will provide SPORE investigators with expert histopathological evaluation of tumor samples both from
patients enrolled on research protocols and from murine and xenograft models. Additionally it will assist in
selecting appropriate formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and snap-frozen tissue for research and
pilot projects, as well as enable the creation of tissue microarrays (TMAs) for SPORE investigator studies. CF1
will assist in performing and interpreting immunohistochemical studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) assays. It will provide scanning and digital archiving of TMA images and reliable interpretation, scoring,
and archiving of IHC results from FFPE or TMA sections. CF1 will also provide systematic assessment of tumor
response to therapy in human tissues and in sarcoma murine models, including interpretation of
immunohistochemical markers for drug response, such as changes in kinase phosphorylation, proliferation
inhibition, and induction of apoptosis. It will also provide a centralized resource for mutational annotation of
sarcoma samples and cell lines using the MSK-IMPACT platform. Finally, CF1 ensures linkage of specimens to
the clinical sarcoma database (within CRDB) in collaboration with project leaders, the Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core (CF2 Qin/Socci) and the Administrative Core (Singer). This establishes a substantial
infrastructure and allows us to provide the required services in a cost-effective manner. CF1 is tightly integrated
with the MSK institutional Pathology Core (supported by the MSK Cancer Center Core Grant) and the sarcoma
clinical database managed by the Administrative Core."
10848818,"CF2: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core
ABSTRACT
The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will support investigators of the SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma in the
computational and statistical aspects of their research efforts, including the design and analysis of laboratory
experiments, molecular profiling assays, and clinical trials. Prior to the initiation of all studies, Core members will
consult with SPORE investigators to discuss the underlying scientific premise and translational goals of the
project, to help the investigators select the most efficient and robust analytical methods, and to estimate sample
sizes to ensure adequate power to address study objectives. In laboratory experiments, Core members will assist
in formulating the experimental design and in data analysis and interpretation at the conclusion of the study. For
molecular profiling studies of cell line and human tumor samples, Core members will closely interface with the
members of the Biospecimen and Pathology Core (CF1) for merging molecular and clinical data, perform
appropriate statistical and bioinformatics analyses to identify biomarkers of drug response and survival outcome,
and work with SPORE investigators to assist with deposition of genomic data into public repositories to facilitate
research dissemination and study replication. When designing a clinical trial, a Core member will conduct a
protocol review with the trial PI; based on this review, a statistical section for the protocol will be provided,
outlining major scientific objectives, population to be studied, primary and secondary endpoints, experimental
design, analysis plans, and a targeted sample size justified in probabilistic terms. At the conclusion of the trial,
data will be analyzed to assess the primary and secondary endpoints stated in the protocol. CF2 will perform
statistical and bioinformatic analyses using appropriate state-of-the-art methodologies and will develop
alternative methods if current methodology does not adequately address a research question. CF2 will also
assist investigators with the preparation of any necessary graphs and tables, formatting data for publication, and
the preparation of presentations and manuscripts. In addition, the Core will facilitate the management and
updating of the clinical sarcoma database in collaboration with the leaders of research projects and the other
three cores of the SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma. We believe that this experienced and collaborative Core is
well configured to provide the SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma with a high level of statistical and bioinformatics
leadership and support that will enhance the efficiency, quality, and quantitative rigor of its science."
10848819,"CF3: Clinical Trials and Patient Advocacy Core
ABSTRACT
Sarcomas are a rare and heterogeneous group of malignancies of mesenchymal origin that affect individuals of
all ages. Sarcomas portend a poor prognosis with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 25â35% for patients with
metastatic disease. Improvements in treatment for patients with sarcoma have greatly lagged behind those
available for the epithelial and hematopoietic malignancies. Sarcoma therefore represents an area of unmet
potential in which there is a tremendous need for preclinical and clinical advancement. Clinical research on
sarcoma presents unique challenges that are inherent to serving a patient population with a variety of rare
diseases; each disease subtype has a unique biologic, pathogenic, genetic, and epigenetic basis that requires
a tailored therapeutic strategy. The conduct of clinical trials on sarcoma is a labor-intensive undertaking that
requires specific attention, initiatives, infrastructure, and expertise, apart from and in addition to those of any
major cancer center.
The main objective of the Clinical Trials and Patient Advocacy Core (CF3) is to support the translational and
clinical efforts of the MSK SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma. CF3 will be jointly run by key members of the adult
and pediatric sarcoma programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), ensuring the fluid
application of novel therapies across all age groups. CF3 will bridge the adult and pediatric sarcoma programs
at MSK; the basic science, translational, and clinical aspects of the various SPORE projects; and the
Administrative, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, and Biospecimen and Pathology Cores. Additionally, CF3 will
facilitate seamless clinical collaboration with other SPOREs, cooperative/government mechanisms for clinical
trials (NCI cooperative groups), pharmaceutical companies, and patient support and advocacy groups. CF3 will
provide SPORE investigators with expertise in clinical trial development and administration, support staff for the
clinical trials, expertise in and administration of clinical trial correlates, financial support for conducting clinical
trials and performing correlative studies, and mechanisms for developing and acquiring novel therapies for rare
diseases. CF3, in close collaboration with the other SPORE cores, will provide the much-needed infrastructure
to ensure that the translational mission of the SPORE is realized across age groups in a timely, cost-effective,
and cooperative manner.
CF3 will work to facilitate the engagement and involvement of underrepresented populations in our clinical
research. CF3 will also collaborate with patient advocates to ensure that MSKâs sarcoma clinical trial protocols
best serve the needs of patients and to develop educational programming for patients and caregivers."
10848820,"Developmental Research Program
ABSTRACT
The purpose of the Developmental Research Program of the MSK SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma is to support
innovative translational research projects in sarcoma. The translational research projects in this program aim to
use knowledge of animal and human sarcoma biology to develop and test interventions related to improving
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma. This program will allow us to respond
quickly to new opportunities in translational research and will help us recruit new scientific talent into our SPORE
and, more broadly, into sarcoma-relevant research. The specific aims of the Developmental Research Program
are: 1) to provide seed funding for innovative, investigator-initiated research in the biology, pathogenesis,
progression, and natural history of sarcoma, and 2) to fund research with exceptional potential to advance the
translational research goals of the SPORE. We are budgeting $400,000 yearly for this program including $50,000
from the SPORE award itself and $350,000 in MSK institutional and philanthropic funds (via the MSK Sarcoma
Center) to support at least two awards per year. The priority for funding will be those initiatives considered most
creative and of the highest scientific quality. Preference will be given to projects that complement the long-term
research goals of the SPORE and advance our translational research objectives. The executive committee may
also solicit and fund experimental or clinical proposals that address an urgent and specific need in the MSK
SPORE in Soft Tissue Sarcoma program or a unique research opportunity. We will prioritize projects submitted
by early-stage investigators and are committed to promoting diversity and strengthening the participation of
women and underrepresented groups in translational research. Applications will be reviewed by leaders at MSK,
including members of the Internal Scientific Advisory Board, selected based on the relevance of their scientific
expertise, and funding decisions will be made by the SPORE Executive Committee. The scientific progress of
DRP projects will be evaluated every six months by the DRP Co-leaders. Long-term metrics of success for DRP
awardees include presentation/publication of original research, successful competition for independent research
support, successful development and completion of clinical trials stemming from DRP research, establishment
of new collaborations, and institutional recognition by academic promotion. Projects may apply for a second year
of funding through the same competitive process, and the projects that appear most promising will be considered
for incorporation into the SPORE as Research Projects, either in current or future funding cycles."
10848569,"SUMMARY: While mammals are characterized by dramatic differences in lifespan, from about 2 years in shrews
to more than 200 years in the bowhead whale, how Nature achieves such diversity in the rate of aging is
unknown. This also applies to diseases, including Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease related
dementias (ADRD), as some species are more susceptible to them than others. Projects 4 aims to uncover the
molecular basis for natural changes in longevity and develop and apply tools to quantify these differences at the
level of molecular signatures of longevity and biomarkers of aging across mammals. We recently sequenced
and analyzed the genomes of mammals differing in lifespan, described omics-based patterns that reflect their
longevity and developed quantitative biomarkers to predict the biological age of species and the effects of
longevity interventions. Our long-term goal is to employ these molecular tools to better explain aging and its
drastically different rates across species, and ultimately develop better, unbiased approaches to extend human
lifespan, healthspan and counteract ADRD. In the current phase of the PPG, we obtained exciting data that
further support our general approach to lifespan control. We generated chromosome-level assemblies of the
genomes of longest-lived rodents, described comprehensive molecular profiles across mammals, and developed
quantitative biomarkers of aging for various mammals. We propose to benefit from these developments and, in
close collaboration with Projects 1, 2 and 3 and Cores B and C, address critical questions in our understanding
of natural differences in the aging rates and ADRD across mammals. (1) Development of species-specific and
pan-mammalian biomarkers of aging. We will develop advanced tissue-specific and pan-tissue transcriptomic
clocks for the mouse, rat, naked mole rat, and pan-rodent clocks; Alzheimerâs disease and ADRD-related aging
clocks; epigenetic clocks based on long-range sequencing; and multi-omic clocks integrating the epigenome and
transcriptome. (2) Comparative multi-omics of longevity at the basal life state. We will generate induced
pluripotent stem cells for various species of mammals, carry out comparative cross-species analyses of these
cells at the level of the transcriptome, metabolome, and epigenome, develop molecular signatures of longevity
at the embryonic state; differentiate these cells to different lineages and develop cell type-specific longevity
signatures; compare mammalian embryonic longevity signatures with the signatures of adult tissues. (3)
Applications of multi-omics biomarkers to animal models of longevity and Alzheimerâs disease. We will apply
biomarker tools to various animal models developed by this Program Project, testing the effects of interventions
in mice based on our findings in long-lived species including epigenetic modifications, whale, beaver and human
SIRT6 expression, whale CIRBP, cGAS-STING and PYHIN mutations in wild type and Alzheimerâs disease mice,
and quantifying biological age and Alzheimerâs disease signatures in the brains of naked mole rat, degu, and
nmrHAS2 and MSR-deficient mouse models."
10846159,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose and objectives of this training grant are to increase recruitment and retention of
outstanding scientists in alcohol research careers, through providing high-quality alcohol research
training and career development support for pre- and postdoctoral trainees in psychology and
related disciplines. The Psychology Training in Alcohol Research (PTAR) program has been
successfully producing skilled alcohol research scholars for the past 39 years. The program provides
research training in the combined areas of etiology, prevention, and treatment of alcohol use
disorder, approaching these questions from both psychosocial and bio-behavioral perspectives and
supporting research with both human subjects and animal models. Psychology is in a unique
position to provide this combined emphasis as the field encompasses a number of specialty areas
that bear directly on the study of alcohol and bridge to other key disciplines relevant to alcohol
research. The training faculty includes 35 individuals within these specialty areas who maintain
appointments in Psychology, Psychiatry, or related departments at the University of Washington.
Faculty provide apprenticeship training and research supervision for trainees and contribute to the
core educational components of the program. Funds are requested to support 5 postdoctoral and 3
pre-doctoral trainees each year. Trainees will participate in the required PTAR Core curriculum, which
involves a series of courses and seminars in the field of alcohol and addiction research, as well as a
grant writing/career development seminar designed to promote the transition to independence. Pre-
doctoral trainees are also required to complete a core curriculum consistent with departmental
requirements for a Ph.D. Required courses include: (1) statistics and general methodology, (2) a
major area of study in clinical, physiological, developmental, experimental, behavioral or molecular
neuroscience, animal behavior, or health psychology, or closely related areas approved by the
training faculty; (3) breadth requirements intended to assure broad exposure to other areas of
psychology, and (4) out of area coursework relevant to the study of alcohol use disorder and
addictive behaviors. Trainees in the course of the program will be expected to (a) acquire research
knowledge and methodologies relevant to the alcohol field with both human and animal subjects; (b)
apply such skills and knowledge in the design and execution of both basic and applied research
related to the etiology, prevention, and treatment of alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder; and (c)
develop skills in mentoring the next generation of diverse alcohol and addiction researchers,
clinicians, and policymakers."
10846195,"SUMMARY
Surgeon-scientists are an underrepresented population in academic medicine, and federally funded physician-
scientist-led research has been in decline over the past decade. Substantial challenges are faced by surgical
trainees seeking research training. Importantly, surgical resident training programs with ample protected time for
dedicated experiential research training have effectively contributed to the âpipelineâ of successful, independently
funded surgeon-scientists. These researchers have meaningfully impacted surgical oncology patient care and
scientific knowledge. The proposed Surgical Oncology Research Training at Indiana (SORTI) program brings
together the extensive multidisciplinary oncologic expertise at the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM)
and the Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center to create a multidisciplinary, two-year research training program
consisting of (1) a Health Services and Outcomes Research (HSOR) Track and (2) a Basic Science and
Translational (BTS) Research Track. The SORTI program will draw upon the Department of Surgeryâs 30-year
experience of training in BTS oncology research and the 15-year surgical oncology HSOR resident training
collaboration between the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center (SOQIC), the Regenstrief
Institute, and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Cancer Programs. Since 2011, SOQIC has trained 44
surgical research trainees who have gone on to oncology-focused academic careers. During a two-year,
intensive training period (100% protected time), trainees in the SORTI program will be immersed in
multidisciplinary, experiential research training, using a team science approach, with tailored mentorship and
focused didactic teaching (Masterâs degree for those without prior advanced degrees). Each trainee will have an
experienced and diverse Mentor Team (content and methodological experts), tailored to their training needs.
The SORTI program core curriculum will include courses in study design and analytic approaches, best practices
and ethics in research, communicating research, and career development. Trainees will participate in the
workshops, seminars, and research training opportunities at Indiana University and at relevant surgical and
oncologic professional societies. Trainees will design and execute research projects that culminate in
presentations at major national conferences and publications in high-impact journals. Continuous monitoring and
iterative program improvement will be achieved by engagement of a highly accomplished External Advisory
Committee and robust evaluation by Indiana Universityâs Center for Evaluation, Policy, and Research. The
ultimate goal of the SORTI program is to increase the number of investigators who successfully achieve
academic careers as independently funded surgical oncologic scientists. Indiana University School of Medicine
is uniquely positioned to assure the success of the SORTI program and continuing to develop future surgical
oncology scientist leaders and mentors."

This renewal application requests support for integrated, broad-based, fundamental, multidisciplinary
predoctoral training of first- and second-year students in Neuroscience at the University of Iowa. The
application builds on more than three and a half decades of success in matriculating, training, and placing top-
caliber PhD students. Our Program features mature leadership, with Daniel Tranel, PhD, having led the
Program and T32 since 2000. For the next cycle, in response to Program growth, leadership will be enhanced
by the addition of two MPIs, Sheila Baker, PhD, and Gordon Buchanan, MD, PhD. During the past 5 years, the
Program has seen sharp increases in student enrollment and funded neuroscience faculty, reflecting the strong
institutional emphasis on Neuroscience and the major infusion of resources from the Iowa Neuroscience
Institute (including new buildings and numerous new faculty hires). The Program draws on a long Iowa
tradition of collaborations between basic and clinical scientists (many of our preceptors are clinician-scientists),
a strong translational focus, and a major emphasis on quantitative training. The Training Faculty is comprised
by 79 experienced, well-funded, diverse neuroscientists with research interests that span the gamut of
neuroscience. Students participate in a carefully honed curriculum that offers broad and fundamental training in
levels of analysis and breadth of approaches, with a special focus on the neuroscience of disease and
disorders (including a highly successful Neurobiology of Disease course). There is intensive training in
experimental design, statistical methodology, quantitative skills, reproducibility, and professional skills
development (enhanced by new curricular components in teaching, oral/written communication,
networking/skill building, and grantsmanship), and detailed annual student evaluation using the Individual
Developmental Plan. The Program incorporates three laboratory rotations, regular programmatic activities
(Seminar, Research Day, journal clubs), and comprehensive training in responsible conduct of research and
reproducibility. Program evaluation includes detailed internal and external reviews that evaluate all aspects of
the Program and recommend changes. The âvalue-addedâ is especially compellingâNIH training grant dollars
enhance every aspect of our Program and have contributed directly to sustained successes marked by
outstanding time to degree (5.1 years), productivity (5.8 publications per student, 2.4 as first author),
completion rate (86%), and placement of graduates in stellar neuroscience careers (54% of our graduates are
in tenured or tenure-track academic positions). Our Program has a strong record of recruiting and training
students from underrepresented backgrounds (a third of our student cohort is diverse; half of our training grant
appointees are from diverse backgrounds), and this T32 is the parent grant to a new R25 Doctoral Readiness
Program that includes 27 of the preceptors from the T32 training faculty. To maintain and extend these
accomplishments, this renewal request asks for 10 slots per year to support first- and second-year students."

Northeastern University (NEU) and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) to provide immersive
research training and education at the interface of nanotechnology, cancer biology, and medicine to attract,
retain, and encourage young scientists and engineers to pursue careers in cancer research. The central
hypothesis of CaNCURE is that a 6-month, full-time, mentored research experience, accompanied by a rich
educational environment providing intellectual immersion in cancer nanomedicine, will lead to persistence in
college and motivation for a career in cancer research. With the support of two consecutive NCI R25 awards
(2014-24), the CaNCURE program has provided 6-month mentored research experiences for 133 students
from 14 different STEM disciplines, 42.8% of whom came from underrepresented minorities or disadvantaged
backgrounds. Trainees conducted high-impact research in 43 NCI-funded laboratories, published 67 peer-
reviewed manuscripts in high-impact cancer and nanomedicine journals, and won 68 research awards. 67% of
trainees continued to volunteer in their CaNCURE lab after co-op completion and 36% went on to complete
one or more additional cancer research experiences before graduation. Of the 109 students who graduated,
38% went to medical school, 16% went to graduate school, and 40% pursued research careers in the healthcare
field. 23 more undergraduates will complete this program by June 2024. Here we seek to renew and expand
the CaNCURE program to train 90 new undergraduates during 2024-2029. Traineeships will be provided to 18
students per year spread across 2 co-op cycles (January-June and July-December). To further strengthen the
existing program, we propose the addition of 11 new faculty mentors aligned with the NCIâs 2024 strategic
goals, formal mentor training, hands-on research training workshops, small-group patient case study
discussions, and a CaNCURE advising system to support trainee research efforts after the co-op. The program
will achieve its goals through the following specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Provide a hands-on, full-time research experience with a focus in cancer nanomedicine
mentored by world-class cancer researchers at NEU and DF/HCC.
 Specific Aim 2: Provide year-round activities for training enrichment, including weekly seminars, patient case
studies, hands-on research training, a reflective e-portfolio, and conference travel.
 Specific Aim 3: Provide professional preparation for a career in cancer research, including professional skills
training, opportunities to network and present research, and resources to enhance career preparation both
during and after co-op.
 Specific Aim 4: Increase the diversity of the cancer research workforce by targeted recruitment and retention
of students from underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities."

Obesity disparities in children and adolescents have persisted for decades. The reasons for these disparities
are not fully understood, despite research into factors such as diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic
position. Discrimination has been implicated as a social determinant for obesity. While discrimination is
understood as a multidimensional construct that operates at multiple levels and in different social contexts, the
association between multiple forms of discrimination and obesity among youth remains understudied, as well
as the underlying mechanisms by which discrimination may affect obesity. This study aims to define the
relationship between multiple forms of discrimination and obesity using longitudinal data from the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, in order to increase the efficacy of prevention efforts and
treatment to reduce obesity and obesity disparities. The study will assess the association between different
forms of discrimination (neighborhood and interpersonal) and the growth trajectory of anthropometric outcomes
(i.e., BMI and waist circumference), examine the role of discrimination in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in
anthropometric outcomes, investigate the extent to which obesity-related health behaviors mediates the
relationship between discrimination and adiposity, and evaluate the potential buffering effect of psychosocial
resources (e.g., family support and positive school environment). Overall, this study has the potential to inform
the optimization of existing clinical and place-based interventions aimed at reducing obesity by highlighting the
importance of addressing discrimination and identifying the context and most at-risk groups that can benefit
from these interventions to reduce health disparities."
10849387,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The number of Native Americans (NA) entering the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
workforce is the smallest proportion of any ethnicity. At the same time, this group faces tremendous health
disparities, with many directly linked to aging health. Education in, and awareness of, aging-related health issues
in NA communities involves three inter-related challenges: lack of a workforce culturally attuned to NA
communities, systemic lack of capacity for on-site biomedical research, and significant mistrust of western
scientific research and researchers. The proposed programs focus on developing NA health professionals and
academic researchers who possess both cultural competence and trust from their communities, elements critical
to eliminating health disparities and minority representation in STEM fields.
In addressing these challenges, we first recognize that many Native American students approach the world and
the means to investigate it from fundamentally different philosophical perspectives. In contrast to highly
reductionist Western models, traditional NA epistemological models are more holistic and narrative-based.
Importantly, these models, in which animate and inanimate entities are connected and interdependent, should
not be seen as pedagogic deficits, but rather as an innate strength that may allow these students to construct
and expand upon sophisticated mental models of current scientific knowledge. We have developed an
educational program that integrates established best pedagogical practices with aging research learning
experience. By integrating the holistic perspective of the Navajo culture with the scientific problem-based
approach of aging, we will advance and enrich both perspectives.
The training program proposed herein is designed to create a pipeline of NA/AI students to advance from their
colleges to aging programs at top tier research universities, creating a model of culturally grounded MSTEM
education while bolstering NIH workforce and cultural diversity. We will accomplish this goal through a series of
interrelated aims. Our first specific aim is to develop and institute a recruitment plan to attract NA/AI students
interested in aging sciences. Our second specific aim is to develop a research experience and scientific training
that integrates established best pedagogical practices with aging research. Specifically, we will focus on
developing the scientific literacy of the students, providing them with professional development opportunities and
a sense of belonging within the academic community. Our third specific aim is focused on providing a support
and retention system for NA/AI students to complete their undergraduate studies and move into the workforce
or enter graduate school."
10860936,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our long-term goal is to develop effective physical rehabilitation approaches to improve mobility and prevent
falls in people with Parkinsonâs disease (PD). To reach this goal, the purpose of our proposal is to identify
objective measures of turning, gait and mobility activity during daily life that best reflect fall risk and to explore
the use of daily life monitoring of mobility as outcome measures for rehabilitation to improve turning quality.
Quantification of turning ability with new technology involving body-worn, inertial sensors could provide
powerful, new outcomes for clinical trials and clinical practice focused on mobility disability. We hypothesize
that objective measures of turning will best discriminate fallers versus nonfallers, predict falls in people with PD
without a fall history, and turning can be improved with rehabilitation in PD.
Two cross-sectional studies will determine the usefulness of innovative, objective measures of turning, gait,
and activity over 7 days of daily living with body-worn inertial sensors for use in rehabilitation. Aim I is a
retrospective, observational, study comparing turning, gait, and activity with body-worn sensors in people with
PD with and without a history of falls in the previous 12 months. Aim II is a prospective study, only in the
nonfallers, investigating the best set of measures of mobility during daily life to predict the first falls in the 12
months after 7 days of daily life monitoring. Aim III is an exploratory, randomized, exercise intervention study to
plan a future clinical trial for improving turning in daily life. Specifically, the fallers collected in Aim I will be
randomized into a novel, 6-week, Turning Boot Camp group or an Active Control Strengthening) group.
This study is designed to advance healthcare of people with PD by improving their mobility function and the
quality of their lives by developing more effective rehabilitation for mobility disability. Balance and gait disorders
affect most people with chronic disease or neurological disease, resulting in inability to control a critical
balance task â quickly change walking direction (turning). This proposal will improve our understanding of the
contribution of turning impairments during community living to falls and parkinsonian impairments and explore
whether rehabilitation can improve quality of turning for functional mobility in daily life. Based on these studies,
clinicians will be able to use body-worn sensors to quickly and accurately assess quality of turning and
implement a novel Turning Boot Camp program focused on improving mobility disability."

Inner ear dysfunction and the associated problems with hearing and balance affect about 30 million Americans
and that number is expected to grow as the population ages. Despite the enormous socioeconomic impact,
however, hearing and balance are the most poorly understood of all the senses. One significant reason for this
gap in our knowledge is the technical difficulties unique to inner ear research that are a discouraging barrier to
new investigators. To address this challenge, we have designed an ambitious three-week course, the Biology
of the Inner Ear (BIE) course, to train new investigators in advanced research approaches to the biology of
hearing and balance. In each course, 18 students are taught by a team of leading scientists and clinicians.
The course will be held in the summers of 2021, 2023 and 2025 at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in
Woods Hole, MA. For the intervening summers of 2022 and 2024, we plan on-site orientation programs for
faculty from under-represented groups or who are hearing impaired, with the goals of increasing the diversity of
faculty role models at the BIE course and attracting a greater diversity of students. The BIE course was first
offered in 2007 and thereafter biennially through 2019. Each course was very well-received by students and
faculty, and their feedback provided successive improvements, culminating in the present curriculum. Using
the focused approach that typifies other highly successful MBL courses, BIE is designed to meet specific
needs of new researchers in auditory and vestibular science. The course will continue to enroll a class
comprising graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, clinician-scientists, and established investigators
entering the field for the first time. These talented students will be provided with instruction and hands-on
laboratory training in cutting-edge, rigorous techniques and specialized methods that are unique to
investigations of the inner ear and auditory, vestibular, and lateral line systems. Through lectures, research
seminars, roundtable discussions, tutorials, and informal interactions as students and instructors work side-by-
side in the laboratory, the BIE course will foster the development of the students as investigators and provide
the opportunity to establish long-lasting mentoring relationships. These interactions will emphasize problems,
concepts, and theories that are driving current research; innovative approaches; and strategies to translate
discoveries into meaningful improvements in human health. BIE is designed to enhance the pipeline of
talented, highly motivated scientists entering the field, providing instruction that will challenge them and help
them undertake independent and original research, and introducing them to networks within the hearing and
balance community that will encourage their career development. This training will advance the pace of
scientific discoveries and promote their translation into treatments that improve the lives of those suffering from
hearing and balance disorders."

It has now been two decades since the clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) criteria were first formulated in service of
the goal of preventing psychotic disorders, one of the most urgent unmet clinical needs in behavioral health if not in all of
medicine. As with most psychiatric patients, CHR patients benefit from psychotherapies but are also often left with important
treatment needs not fully addressed. Despite the critical public health need, drug development for CHR is viewed in many
quarters as risky. The most daunting obstacle may be the heterogeneity of CHR course. In Aim 1 we will deeply pheno-
type 1040 CHR patients across the ProNET network of 26 international sites with multi-modal biomarkers that span brain
structure-function (MRI and EEG), psychopathology and cognition, genetics, body fluid analytes, natural speech/language,
and passive/ecological momentary digital phenotyping, and map these biomarkers onto a core set of clinical outcome mea-
sures and trajectories over a treatment-relevant time window at eight timepoints over 24 months. Biomarkers will be collected
at two timepoints to map brain-behavior trajectories. Healthy volunteers (N=260) will complete a baseline assessment to quan-
tify typical variation. We will also conduct exploratory studies to assess real-time behavioral data from smartphone sensors
and symptom reports from surveys; novel repetition positivity and alpha-desynchronization measures derived from standard
EEG paradigms; and pilot an evaluation of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance with MR spectroscopy for glutamate, glutamine,
and GABA at 7 Tesla. In Aim 2 we will partner with the NIMH-selected Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordinating
Center for rapid data integration and NIMH Data Archive (NDA) uploads with the proposed informatics platform. We will
implement ProNET-wide standardized and near real-time data integration with the DPACC architecture to facilitate on-site
monitoring, unification of standard operating procedures, and rapid data aggregation across ProNET for seamless DPACC to
NDA transfer. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that data-driven variation assessed by multivariate neural, genetic, and
behavioral measures within the CHR syndrome predicts individualized clinical trajectories, expanding CHR stratification
for broad clinical endpoints encompassing affect, anxiety, cognition, and APS with the goal of identifying behavioral and
biomarker-driven patterns that can refine the CHR syndrome and promote personalized treatment decisions. These analy-
ses will yield expanded outcome stratification calculators for the CHR syndrome that can predict actionable mental health
trajectories in individual patients. The stratification calculators will allow future clinical trial designers to select optimal
samples for determining whether a novel compound improves the particular CHR outcome of interest and pave the way for
phase-specific and safe new interventions to benefit patients and their families and communities."
10849925,"Sensing and responding to changes in environmental oxygen is critical for
aerobic organisms. Metazoans accomplish this by destabilizing a transcription
factor called hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in oxygen sufficiency. This is achieved
by an oxygen-dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PHD) that hydroxylates proline
residues in the HIF-1Î± transcription factor that targets it for ubiquitin-dependent
proteasomal degradation. Protozoans have PHDs but lack HIF and thus respond
to changes in oxygen differently and we use the evolutionary distant protists
Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma to address this question. Initial studies in
Dictyostelium revealed that its PHD, DdPHYa, modifies a proline in Skp1, which
is a component of the Skp1/Cullin1/F-box protein/Rbx1 polyubiquitin ligase
complex. Skp1 prolyl hydroxylation does not affect its stability, but allows it to be
modified by a pentasaccharide that acts to alter the repertoire of associated F-
Box proteins. Genome analysis and biochemical assays demonstrated that this
Skp1 modification pathway is conserved in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma,
but not in metazoans. Loss of Toxoplasma PHYa leads decreases virulence in
vivo and decreased growth in vitro under limited O2 and amino acid conditions.
Unlike Dictyostelium, Toxoplasma expresses a second PHD, PHYb, which is
required for colonization of oxygen rich tissues as well as Toxoplasma growth at
high oxygen. In contrast to PHYa, PHYb functions by regulating elongation
during protein synthesis and specifically does so at elevated O2 levels. Because
of its medical importance, we will focus on Toxoplasma and pursue three specific
aims: i) Determine how PHYa mediates growth at low oxygen and amino acids;
ii) Define how PHYb regulates elongation; and iii) Test whether PHYa and PHYb
work in tandem as an oxygen-sensing rheostat to grow in whatever oxygen
tension in encounters as it infects a host and causes disease."

In the United States, the average American can expect to undergo seven surgical operations during a lifetime.
Each year 150,000 surgical patients die, and 1.5 million develop a complication after surgery. Progress in
medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains halted by limited datasets and models with insufficient interpretability,
transparency, fairness, and reproducibility that are difficult to implement and share across institutions. In the
previous funding period, in addition to 98 publications and 3 patents, a real-time intelligent surgical risk
assessment system was successfully implemented at University of Florida. The overall objective of this
renewal application is to develop a new conceptual framework for âExplainable, Fair, Reproducible, and
Collaborative Medical AIâ to provide a foundation for clinical implementation at scale. It will leverage the
OneFlorida, a large clinical consortium of 22 hospitals serving 10 million patients in Florida, the nationâs third
largest state. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims.
(1) External and prospective validation of novel interpretable, dynamic, actionable, fair and reproducible
algorithmic toolkit for real-time surgical risk surveillance. (2) Developing and evaluating explainable AI platform
(XAI-IDEALIST) for real-time surgical risk surveillance using human-grounded benchmarks. (3) Implementing
and evaluating a federated learning approach with advanced privacy features for collaborative surgical risk
model training. The approach is innovative, because it represents the first attempt to (1) build the first surgical
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) AI-ready, large multicenter multimodal dataset, (2)
Novel computational approaches accompanied by assessing fairness and reproducibility, (3) a multifaceted
and full-stack explainable AI framework, and (4) federated learning capacity for privacy-preserving model
trainingacross institutions. The proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and
critical barriers, including (1) lack of AI-ready large surgical datasets, (2) lack of interpretable, dynamic,
actionable, fair and reproducible surgical risk algorithms, (2) lack of a medical AI explainability platform, and (4)
lack of a systematic approach for collaborative model training and sharing across institutions. Ultimately, the
results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization costs, as well as lifelong
complications."
10849929,"Summary:
 The environment on Earth is rhythmically changing, and organisms need to adapt to and anticipate
these cyclical variations. For us humans, the most striking and impactful environmental cycle is the
alternance of day and night, and we organize our activities around it. For example, we usually work and eat
during the day, and sleep preferentially at night. Actually, our metabolism, physiology and behavior are all
controlled by intracellular molecular timers called circadian clocks, that optimize most of our bodily functions
with the time-of-day. When these biological clocks are disrupted, for example in shift workers, the incidence
of cancers, metabolic diseases and mood disorders is increased. Circadian clocks are present in most
organisms, and the use of potent genetically-tractable models in cyanobacteria, plants, fungi and mammals
has shed light on the basic principles underlying circadian rhythms. In all eukaryotes, transcriptional feedback
loops modulated by post-translational modifications are at the core of the molecular circadian clock.
 Drosophila melanogaster has proved to be a particularly potent model for the study of circadian
rhythms, and the molecular and neural mechanisms uncovered in fruit flies have been found to be particularly
well conserved in mammals. Drosophila is also a very efficient system to study sleep, a key circadian output.
Our long-term goals are to understand in detail how Drosophila circadian rhythms are generated and how
they are synchronized with the day/night cycle. More recently, we have also studied how sleep is controlled in
fruit flies. We propose here to tackle three critical questions. First, we aim to determine comprehensively how
post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms control circadian rhythms. Indeed, while circadian transcriptional
and post-translational controls have been characterized in detail, the regulation of circadian rhythms at the
mRNA processing and translational levels remains poorly understood. Second, we aim to understand the
phenomenon of temperature compensation. This property ensures that the period of circadian clocks is
insensitive to ambient temperature and is therefore necessary for these biological timers to be of adaptative
value. However, how circadian temperature compensation is achieved remains unclear. Third, we aim to
uncover the mechanisms by which glia regulate sleep, with a focus on glial transporters. Indeed, glia is
emerging as an important modulator of neural sleep circuits in fruit flies and mammals.
 These three innovative aims should decisively advance our understanding of circadian rhythms and
sleep in Drosophila. Given the conservation of the mechanisms underlying circadian clocks and sleep, and
the essential role they play for the well-being and survival of animals including humans, we expect that our
work will have broad implications, including for human health."
10849931,"ABSTRACT
It has been believed that infection-fighting T cells primarily use glucose to fuel host defense against viruses
and bacteria; however, using new in vivo metabolite profiling techniques, it has recently been found that
glucose is not the primary fuel for mitochondrial energy (ATP) production in CD8+ T cells responding to
infection in vivo, particularly in later phases of infection. This presents the immunometabolism community with
a critical need to define and understand the metabolites that sustain infection-fighting CD8+ T cells. This
knowledge is crucial for developing effective immuno-metabolic interventions that strengthen host defense
and/or enhance immunization strategies. Preliminary data point to ketone bodiesâa metabolite class enriched
in the blood in response to infection, fasting, and certain dietsâas a key fuel for CD8+ T cell effector function,
with data suggesting that ketone body availability influences T cell-mediated adaptive immunity by regulating
effector function (i.e., cytokine production) at the epigenetic level. However, the full impact of T cell-intrinsic
ketone body metabolism on CD8+ T cell responses remains uncharacterized.
OVERALL OBJECTIVE: to characterize the mechanisms by which T cell-intrinsic ketone body metabolism
(âketolysisâ) impacts CD8+ T cell metabolism and function during immune responses to infection, and to
determine the role of systemic ketone body metabolism in CD8+ T cell function and host defense.
HYPOTHESIS: T cell-intrinsic ketone body metabolism is a non-redundant pathway supporting host defense
by fueling and directing CD8+ T cell bioenergetics and effector function in vivo. SPECIFIC AIMS: (1)
Characterize ketone body metabolism in CD8+ T cells and its impact on CD8+ T cell-mediated immune
responses, (2) Deconstruct the mechanisms by which ketone body metabolism impacts T cell effector function,
(3) Dissect the impact of systemic ketone body metabolism on CD8+ T cell responses.
IMPACT: Upon completion, this proposed research will have determined how activated CD8+ T cells utilize
ketone bodies, dissected the impact of ketone bodies on CD8+ T cell effector function (primary infection
clearance) and memory responses (long-term immunity), and defined how systemic ketone body availability is
controlled and impacts CD8+ T cell-mediated host defense. By defining the role of ketone body metabolism in
protective CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses, we will have laid the groundwork for defining dietary and
pharmacological interventions to optimize endogenous host defenses to boost clearance of infections as well
as enhance immunization strategies."
10931572,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 25,000 individuals in the US are currently living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an
ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease that progressively impacts motor function. Patients may live for years
after the onset of symptoms that result in complete loss of written and verbal communication, which drastically
decreases quality of life, increases caregiver burden, and creates a significant barrier to life extending care and
ALS research efforts. Communication brain computer interfaces (cBCIs) offer a unique opportunity for completely
movement-free communication for those with severe paralysis due to ALS or other causes. Prior work with
Blackrock Neurotech cBCI technology has developed methods to control keyboards, decode handwriting, restore
speech, and restore verbal communication in locked-in ALS patients. In conjunction with development of our
ground-breaking cBCI technologies, we hope to lead the market in the development of a comprehensive
knowledgebase of how cBCIs affect ALS patients and how future advancements can better improve the lives of
those with this irreversible, fatal condition. Our long-term goal is to establish and validate standardized clinical
outcome assessments (COAs) to capture (1) the needs and values of ALS patients, their caregivers, and
healthcare providers as they relate to communication and cBCIs, (2) patient perceptions of cBCIs, (3) capacity
and efficacy of communication using cBCIs, (4) healthcare and quality of life impacts of cBCIs on patients and
caregivers, and (5) financial and health economic impacts of cBCIs in the ALS population. Given the relative
novelty of cBCIs as an option for ALS patients and the variation within and across cBCI technologies, there is a
critical need to better understand how cBCIs are clinically assessed and to establish a framework for future
development of COAs for cBCIs in patients with ALS. Our objective is to develop a deep and wide-ranging
understanding of (1) the current clinical and scientific landscape surrounding cBCIs, (2) the assessment of their
impacts and efficacy, (3) the strengths and weaknesses of current COAs, (4) patient needs and their perceptions
of cBCIs, and (5) to evaluate areas for future COA development. UH2 development will comprise a
comprehensive literature review and a series of interviews with key opinion leaders to establish a base of
knowledge as well as expert perspectives on the current COA landscape related to cBCIs and the ALS patient
population. UH3 development will occur in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, Rancho Los Amigos
National Rehabilitation Center, and the University of Utah and will consist of a series of patient and caregiver
focus groups to gain insight into clinically meaningful concepts and endpoints related to communication and cBCI
technologies. At the conclusion of this project, our expectation is that we will have comprehensively assessed
the current landscape of COAs for cBCIs and identified a clear path toward future development of COAs to aid
in clinical application and assessment of cBCIs to enhance the lives of those with advanced ALS."

The long-term objective of the Vanderbilt Training in Gastroenterology T32 Program is to identify, recruit,
train, and mentor a diverse workforce of compassionate and dedicated investigators by providing a rigorous
scientific foundation in 1) basic research, to reveal new disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic
targets; or 2) clinical/translational research, with the opportunity for formal studies in clinical science,
epidemiology, or informatics. Richard Peek serves as Director and is assisted by an Associate Director, Keith
Wilson, as well as a Steering Committee and Internal and External Advisory Committees composed of senior
faculty deeply invested in training young investigators and cultivating diversity. The design of this
multidisciplinary program is to support 5 postdoctoral fellows/year (1-2 years in duration) who show exceptional
aptitude for pursuing research careers. Trainees are selected from a curated pool of fellows accepted into the
Gastroenterology training programs, physician-scientist applicants from other clinical training programs, and
applicants that apply directly to preceptor laboratories. A customized mentoring team is constructed for each
trainee consisting of a Mentor with nationally recognized expertise and a Research Advisory Committee to
provide additional guidance, mentoring, and feedback. Each trainee becomes part of a translational research
group that includes basic and clinical investigators (40 Preceptors/10 Departments), enabling an in-depth
understanding of specific diseases from bench-to-bedside. The trainee experience is enriched by an extensive
program of seminars and coursework tailored to meet individual needs and via the Academy of Investigators,
which provides comprehensive career development and a Diversity Program focused on underrepresented
minority (URM) investigators. This T32 is also engrafted into a continuum that provides a wealth of funding
opportunities only available to fellows and junior faculty to facilitate an uninterrupted research focus resulting
from funding stability. In the last 15 years, 51 trainee scientists have been or will be supported by this Program
(33 MD or MD/PhD, 16 PhD, 2 DO); 26 (51%) have been female, and 10 (20%) have been from URM groups.
Further, the number of female trainees and URM trainees increased substantially in the current funding period
(female: n=12, 60%; URM: n=5, 25%) compared to the previous funding period (female: n=5, 36%; URM:
n=1, 7%). At present, 41/51 (80%) of these trainees are pursuing research-intensive or research-related
careers or are still in training, 81% of Program graduates have received research funding and, since 2014, the
average number of publications by all trainees is 16.4/year. Collectively, the unique environment that supports
digestive diseases research at Vanderbilt, catalyzed by rich collaborative interactions between basic and
clinical researchers, a wide range of supporting Cores and Centers, robust institutional support, and exposure
to state-of-the-art clinical care, provides an outstanding opportunity to train successful investigators using a
team-science approach, whose discoveries can be rapidly translated into improved patient care."

Existential challenges to all organisms result from DNA damaging agents present naturally in the environment,
e.g., UV radiation and oxygen, and from toxic industrial chemicals. The induction of âhypermutationâ, while
perhaps counterintuitive, is essential to counter exposure to environmental stress by ensuring cell and
organismic fitness. Hypermutations, mutations occurring at frequencies ~ 10-2 â 10-3 per base pair, straddle a
range between death and fitness in bacteria and humans. The key to fitness is to carefully regulate
hypermutation. Our grant proposal is to elucidate the regulation of two essential hypermutator enzymes, DNA
polymerase V mutasome (pol V Mut) in Escherichia coli that catalyzes translesion DNA synthesis on damaged
DNA templates, and activation-induced deoxycytidine deaminase (AID) required for a robust immune response
in humans. Pol V Mut has a multisubunit structure that includes a RecA molecule, the E. coli recombinase, and
a molecule of ATP. Along with its polymerase activity, pol V Mut also has an intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase
activity different from all other ATPases. Pol V Mut exists in two conformationally distinct states, activated and
deactivated depending on the location of RecA. We hypothesize that the internal ATPase provides an energy
source to switch between conformation states, akin to an âon-offâ toggle switch. We propose to test this
hypothesis using TIRF-FRET microscopy to visualize the dynamics of switching between each conformational
state of pol V Mut at single-molecule resolution, and to use Cryo-EM to determine the location of each pol V
subunit, most importantly RecA, in activated and deactivated forms. AID plays an essential role in the immune
response by initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B-cells by
deaminating CâU during transcription of immunoglobulin variable (IgV) and switch (IgS) region DNA. We
propose to reconstitute the first biochemical system to investigate AID targeting and catalysis during IgV and
IgS transcription by human RNA polymerase II. This study is intended to establish a biochemical basis for the
hypermutation reactions required in the generation of antibody (Ab) diversity. We propose to use TIRF-FRET
microscopy to visualize the action of AID during IgV and IgS transcription, including the influence of proteins
believed to be involved in targeting AID to stalled transcription bubbles. In 2016, we obtained a crystal
structure for AID. We now propose a strategy to obtain an AID-ssDNA co-crystal structure. Environmental
allergens can cause asthma. We will use the co-crystal structure to design AID inhibitors that suppress IgE
production to treat asthma. A novel high-risk high-reward project, designed to achieve affinity maturation in a
test tube, using AID and error-prone human DNA polymerase Î·, is aimed at generating monoclonal Abs
against any antigen. As a proof of principal, we propose to generate Abs against three critical ion channel
receptors involved in pain, heat and cold. The availability of ion channel receptor Abs would provide a major
medical breakthrough to relieve pain and itching in hypersensitive individuals."
10934594,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cirrhosis complication producing an alarming rise in mortality. The
prognosis for HCC is poor due to extremely high recurrence rate even after curative-intent surgical therapies and
limited efficacy of available medical therapies. Given its refractory nature, prevention of HCC in cirrhosis patients
will be the most impactful strategy to improve its poor prognosis; however, effective HCC prevention remains a
major unmet need. Retrospective and pre-clinical studies have suggested that statins are a viable form of HCC
chemoprevention, with a differential effect between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. Further evidence suggests
that statins may modulate HCC risk through Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways. However, the clinical
validation of statins has been hampered by the requirement for large and lengthy clinical trials to define their
clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a serum-based HCC risk biomarker, the
Prognostic Liver Secretome signature (PLSec). Of note, PLSec is therapeutically modifiable and the magnitude
of PLSec modulation is associated with future HCC incidence as demonstrated by our previous and preliminary
studies. In a retrospective case-control series, PLSec-based HCC risk level was lower in cirrhosis patients on
statins compared to non-users. Based on these observations, PLSec is now being tested as a surrogate endpoint
in HCC chemoprevention trials of atorvastatin (TORCH trial). To achieve the goal of establishing statins as viable
HCC chemoprevention with PLSec as a surrogate endpoint, we have assembled a team of cirrhosis and HCC
experts to analyze serum samples from three nation-wide multi-center prospective cohorts (Liver Cirrhosis
Network, Southern Liver Health Study, and Mass General Brigham cohorts) and two randomized controlled trials
(TORCH and LCN RESCU trials). Aim 1. Validate lower biomarker-based HCC risk level in cirrhosis patients on
statins compared to non-users. We will validate our preliminary finding in prospective case-control series of
cirrhosis patients form the three cohorts. We will explore patient characteristics and types of statins associated
with the PLSec-based HCC risk level, along with mechanistic markers of Hedgehog/Hippo signaling. Aim 2.
Determine magnitude of biomarker-based HCC risk modulation after starting or stopping statins. We will conduct
target trial emulation mimicking single-arm clinical trials with statins to determine the magnitude of PLSec
modulation in patients who start or stop statins from three cohorts. We will explore patient characteristics and
types of statins associated with PLSec-based HCC risk modulation, along with mechanistic markers. Aim 3.
Compare biomarker-based HCC risk modulation between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. We will compare the
magnitude of placebo-adjusted PLSec modulation between lipophilic (atorvastatin) and hydrophilic (rosuvastatin)
statins by analyzing serum samples from two parallel randomized clinical trials. We will explore patient
characteristics associated with differential PLSec modulation, along with mechanistic markers. Our strategy
showcases a novel approach to substantially advance clinical translation of HCC chemoprevention therapies."
10853849,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is the most prevalent heart valve disorder affecting up to 50% of adolescents with
congenital valve disease and over 25% of those over age 75, following life-long exposure to risk factors.
Independent of age, outcomes are poor following the onset of aortic stenotic (AS) symptoms, unless outflow
obstruction is relieved. CAS is progressive and manifests as cusp thickening with osteogenic-like remodeling,
calcium deposition in regions of high mechanical demand and narrowing of the valve opening. Despite this, the
mechanisms underlying these phenotypes and their contributions to the severity of AS pathogenesis are not well
defined, but biomechanical stress was implicated. This is best illustrated in congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)
disease, causing structural narrowing of the aortic valve (AoV) opening and increased biomechanical stress over
the cusp surface. In more than half of BAV patients, CAS develops at least 10-15 years earlier than tri-leaflet
AoVs and up to 25 years sooner in those born with fusion between right and non-coronary cusps (R/NC). Current
clinical management is limited to periodic surveillance of AoV dysfunction and only when the valve becomes
stenotic during late stages, is intervention recommended. Historically, surgical AoV replacement has been the
most effective treatment for CAS, and BAV patients account for almost 50% of these cases. However, due to
surgical-related complications, especially in high-risk patients, less-invasive transcatheter AoV replacement
(TAVR) approaches have been introduced that show significantly reduced mortality in low-risk patients, but
similar poor post-procedure outcomes in high-risk groups, including BAV patients. Therefore, there is a critical
need to develop more effective treatments of CAS, but what do we therapeutically target, and when? To address
this deficit, we have initiated studies in humans and mouse models of R/NC and right/left (R/L) BAV to temporally
examine CAS pathogenesis, based on structure, function, biomechanical and molecular phenotypes, and
mechanistically understand how these pathological milestones interact to initiate and advance CAS. Based on
our data thus far, we hypothesize that CAS progression is a multi-step process, initiated by structural valve
abnormalities (i.e. BAV) that increase wall shear stress on the valve endothelial cells to a threshold sufficient to
activate mechanosensitive pathways and promote osteogenic changes in valve interstitial cells. To do this, we
will: 1) Determine subject- and structure-specific biomechanical stress along the cusps of young patients with
congenital BAV disease types, prior to the onset of calcification, using fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulations;
2) Determine the pathophysiological milestones and outcomes predictors of calcific aortic stenosis in mouse
models of R/L and R/NC BAV; and 3) Mechanistically delineate the mechanotransduction of abnormal
biomechanical stress on osteogenic signaling pathways in CAS. Outcomes from these studies will provide
insights for the development of predictive diagnostics and mechanistic-based therapeutic targets that can be
administered early to prevent CAS onset, or halt progression."
10853640,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with severe pandemic SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia suffered damage of alveolar epithelial cells due to direct
viral injury, subsequent immune response, and secondary bacterial pneumonia, which presents clinically as the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite a similar severity of ARDS, some patients recover their
lung function without sequelae, while others develop persistent respiratory symptoms and radiographic
abnormalities, or progressive lung fibrosis resulting in death or requiring lung transplantation. The mechanisms
driving the heterogeneous outcomes remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic changes are
commonly observed in patients with severe pneumonia/ARDS and in patients with lung fibrosis but whether this
dysfunction is causally related to failed epithelial repair after injury is not known.
We focus on an intermediate epithelial cell population expressing genes characteristic of both alveolar epithelial
type 2 (AT2) and type 1 (AT1) cells. These âtransitional cellsâ are expanded during postnatal development and
in several models of lung injury and fibrosis, and human fibrotic lungs. In our published and preliminary studies,
we observed that mitochondrial complex I (MCI)-dependent NAD+ regeneration, independent of ATP synthesis,
is necessary for postnatal alveologenesis. Rather than inducing a metabolic crisis and cell death, lung epithelial-
specific deletion of NDUFS2, an essential MCI subunit protein, prevented AT2-to-AT1 differentiation resulting in
a dramatic expansion of transitional cells and subsequent death of the animal from respiratory failure.
Transitional cells lacking MCI function demonstrate activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) and a small
molecule inhibitor of the ISR rescued the lethality of the knockout mice. I also observed that loss of NDUFS2 in
adult AT2 cells leads to the spontaneous development of lung fibrosis and death of the animal from respiratory
failure within several months, highlighting the potential importance of this pathway in lung fibrosis. Collectively,
we hypothesize that the loss of MCI function increases the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio through a pathway
that requires OMA1, DELE1, and HRI to activate the ISR and enhance ATF4-mediated transcription, precluding
normal alveolar epithelial differentiation. I will test this hypothesis in the following two aims: Aim 1: To determine
whether an increased mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio and DELE1 are necessary for ISR activation that
precludes AT2 to AT1 differentiation in the absence of mitochondrial complex I. Aim 2: To determine
whether epithelial ATF4 activation is necessary and/or sufficient for impaired AT2 to AT1 differentiation.
We propose causal experiments using sophisticated genetic murine models to link mitochondrial metabolism,
activation of the ISR, and failed epithelial differentiation to the development of fibrosis. We pair our experiments
with samples collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis at the time of lung transplant, with a goal of
credentialling mitochondrial metabolism and the ISR as targets for therapy to prevent and treat lung fibrosis."

We are requesting funds for a QPatch II-48 automated patch clamp system, designed for acquiring high-fidelity
patch clamp data. A major feature of this system is that it is being used with primary cells such as immune cells
and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes or neurons. There are currently no such automated patch clamp systems
available at NYU or within New York City readily available to the NYU investigators. A major advantage of the
QPatch II is that the use of seal enhancer solutions that contains high concentrations and fluoride and calcium
is not required. The instrument allows simultaneous patch clamp recordings with up to forty-eight individual cells,
in increments of eight, at relatively low individual cost. End users need minimal training. The floor standing
instrument is space saving with no special installation requirements, and the system is easily shared between
users. The instrument will be housed in a central location in a shared electrophysiology facility named IonLab,
managed by an experienced cellular electrophysiologist and shared by several NIH-funded major and other
users. Ample institutional help and commitment is available, including from the NYU Grossman
School of Medicine (NYUGSOM) Office of Collaborative Science (OCS) that assists with developing a
business plan, support for IonLab and access to a common reservation and billing system (iLab), and the
Department of Pathology who is committing to space and financial needs, including the maintenance of a
service contract. The major user group spans several academic departments and represents both basic and
translational research interests such as; pathology, cardiology, immunology and neurosciences. The major
NIH-funded users will have protected use of the majority of the instrument time whereas other users will be
able to use the remaining instrument time. The availability of this shared instrument will be unique in
Manhattan. The requested QPatch II automated patch clamp instrument will support the research of several
NIH funded researchers at NYUGSOM and NYU College of Dentistry."

The ease of access to quantitative imaging technologies such as laser-scanning confocal microscopy
has ushered in a revolution in our understanding of the inner workings of cells. However, despite the
subcellular resolution afforded by such microscopes, confocal microscopes cannot image with such
resolution over the large volumes of cells that reside in the context of multicellular organisms, large
organoids, and tissue explants without significant photobleaching or photodestruction. This grant seeks
to acquire a light-sheet microscope that is optimized for fast 3D multi-sample volumetric
imaging of delicate live specimens in their native environment, the Bruker Luxendo TruLive3D Imager.
The TruLive3D is especially suited for multi-position imaging of mouse preimplantation embryos, fly
embryos and zebrafish embryos, enabling rapid time-lapse, high-throughput imaging experiments using
live specimens. The TruLive 3D imager is particularly appealing to our User Group comprised of
developmental biologists, cell biologists, and molecular biologistsâall experts in imagingâ who aim to
overcome the current imaging limitation to define and characterize novel cellular processes. The optical
concept of the TruLive3D, the dual-sided illumination and single-lens detection from below, along with
the unique design of the sample holding vessels, and the ability to multiplex, enable easy-to-use,
extremely fast high-resolution imaging with minimal phototoxicity. Additionally, the combined
improvements in image quality, sensitivity, temporal resolution, and reduced bleaching greatly improve
the accuracy of image segmentation, tracking, and measurement of signaling dynamics, cell
movements, and cell divisions. TruLive3Dâs unique multi-well sample holder makes loading and
imaging of multiple live specimens easy and quick, allowing for prolonged imaging experiments of
otherwise challenging to image samples.
The Trulive3D is one of the most versatile systems that can advance our cellular and subcellular
understanding of various developmental, physiological and pathological processes. Labs working on fly,
zebrafish and mammalian embryogenesis and human/mouse organoids can benefit from this light
sheet microscope system to image readouts of signaling dynamics, subcellular dynamics, and cell
behaviors in the context of diverse developmental and physiological processes in live specimen. Our
User Group includes Drs. Lin He, Ian Swinburne, Hernan Garcia, Xavier Darzacq, Rebecca Heald,
Samantha Lewis, David Bilder, Ellen Robey, Sanjay Kumar, Richard Harland, Teresa Puthussery and
Mengmeng Fu, who all require this system in order to continue their important research. Most of these
investigators are in the Molecular and Cell Biology department, as well as from Physics,
Bioengineering, and the School of Optometry, signaling that this will be a useful instrument across the
campus."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to advance the research of investigators at The Jackson Laboratory
(JAX) and in the Maine research community by bringing a new Bruker timsTOF SCP mass spectrometer
package for high-resolution, single-cell proteomic analysis to JAXâs Mass Spectrometry and Protein Chemistry
Service (MSPC). JAXâs research mission focuses on discovering precise genomic solutions for disease to
improve human health in the global community. As part of this mission, there has been an increasing emphasis
on the analysis of single cells, as biomedical research has demonstrated that examination of biology at this
level is essential for understanding the biological processes underlying development and disease. Accordingly,
JAX has technologies for characterization and quantification of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and
individual cell-surface protein molecules present, all at the single-cell level. In addition, recently JAX
investigators have had access to increasingly advanced capabilities in the MSPC in mass spectrometry-based
proteomics and metabolomics for biological discoveries linking genomics with phenotype. However, despite
our numerous mass spectrometry capabilities, there is currently no instrumentation here with the capability to
perform unbiased, high-throughput label-free single-cell proteomics analysis. This gap limits our investigatorsâ
ability to understand biology at the single-cell level, including new insights that would be gained by integrating
single-cell proteome data with the array of other single-cell data generated here, and by addressing the issue
of a generally weak transcriptome-proteome correlation in organisms. The Bruker timsTOF SCP mass
spectrometer is the ideal system to address this gap. This instrument offers innovative technologies, including
a dramatically improved ion-source concept, an enhanced trapped ion mobility, and mass analyzer that provide
ultra-high sensitivity, enabling unbiased single-cell proteomics with high reproducibility. The timsTOF SCP can
achieve coverage of about 1,500 proteins per cell, sufficiently identify post-translational modifications in a very
small number of morphologically or functionally similar cells, and efficiently analyze low-abundant samples,
such as the rare cell populations that many of our investigators study. The timsTOF SCP and its accessories,
including the cellenONE for single-cell sorting and proteomic sample processing, will be transformative for
research at JAX and other Maine research institutions. Various studies at JAX focused on rare immune-cell
populations, stem-cell differentiation, sub-populations of cancer cells, the identification of new therapeutic
targets for cancer, and characterizing mechanisms underlying cognitive aging will all benefit from this
instrumentation. Progress in these research areas are particularly important given JAXâs broadening emphasis
on translating our basic research discoveries into clinical advances that will directly benefit human health. In
sum, the Bruker timsTOF SCP platform will substantially enhance JAXâs ability to fulfill its research mission and
will also bring this potential to the greater Maine community."

We propose to acquire an Orion HT multiplex fluorescent imaging system (Rarecyte inc.) to
support research at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital (BWH) and neighboring institutions.
Immunofluorescence (IF) is a standard tool for microscopy research and is used routinely to
identify cell types and study their organization and function in tissues. However, the overlapping
emission spectra of common fluorophores means that standard IF is limited to a few colors,
which is a major limitation for studying cell interactions in complex tissues and disease states.
Many cell types can only be identified using combinations of several markers, and to understand
their interactions it is often necessary to visualize multiple markers simultaneously. Thus,
multiplex immunolabeling methods are essential. One approach is to perform multiple labeling
cycles, and various methods have been developed to achieve this. However, these cyclical
methods are slow and labor-intensive, and specimens can become degraded after multiple
cycles. The Orion instrument was developed to solve these problems, and to achieve highly
multiplex imaging in a single scan. Antibodies are conjugated to a palette of up to 20
fluorophores, excitation is produced by seven high-power lasers, and fluorescence is measured
through a series of tunable narrow bandpass filters. Following staining, multiple fluorescence
images are captured automatically, and individual labels are computationally separated using
the companyâs SpectralEdge algorithm. The instrument can scan an entire slide at subcellular
resolution, which is especially important when studying large complex structures such as brain
or tumors, whose spatial heterogeneity is not adequately captured by smaller fields of view. The
Orion can also capture a H&E image on the same section, meaning that multiplex molecular
data can be correlated with existing H&E datasets from clinical pathology. The reliability of the
color separation has been extensively validated, and this novel technology holds great promise
for a wide range of applications. The PI, Sandro Santagata, has previously collaborated with
Rarecyte to develop the Orion technology, with support from a NIH SIBR grant. He also
collaborates closely with Peter Sorger at Harvard Medical school, a current advisor to Rarecyte.
Our users will benefit greatly from their expertise and connections to the company, and from a
growing list of validated antibodies and computational tools that have been developed to
support the Orion platform. The requested instrument will be installed in a shared core facility at
BWH, where it will support a large community of NIH-funded researchers studying cancer,
autoimmunity, inflammation, neurodegeneration and many other disorders."
10854024,"Following spinal cord injury, the colon is unable to evacuate stools via peristaltic propulsion. Losing bowel
function can cause constipation, gastro-intestinal complications, and faecal incontinence, severely impacting
health and quality of life. The standard of care for individuals with neurogenic bowel involves the design of a
bowel program for predictable and effective elimination of the bowels. A bowel program includes diet, fluid
intake, activity, and pharmaceutical (suppository) or mechanical rectal stimulation. However, the bowel routine
can require over an hour or more to evacuate the bowels and this process typically requires the assistance of a
caregiver, which adds to the cost of care and reduces independence. Restoring bowel function is considered a
high priority, but remains a critically unmet need requiring further development. The objective of this project is
to determine the feasibility and potential effectiveness of minimally invasive patterned electrical stimulation on
bowel emptying in Veterans with spinal cord injury and neurogenic bowel.
 We propose experiments with human study participants to develop and evaluate an approach to improve
bowel emptying. The majority of individuals with neurogenic bowel dysfunction use digital rectal stimulation to
distend the rectum and evoke an excitatory recto-colonic reflex, which increases colonic motility and loads
stool into the rectum for removal. The proposed approach would substitute digital rectal stimulation with
electrical rectal stimulation, using electrical stimulation of sensory (afferent) neurons of the rectum to modulate
the recto-colonic reflex. Preliminary data have shown that 1) the colon responds to electrical stimulation in
animals and 2) that rectal stimulation was correlated with bowel activity in two Veterans with spinal cord injury.
We hypothesize that the recto-colonic reflex can be evoked via electrical stimulation of rectal afferents and
promote clinically meaningful bowel emptying. This work will provide new insights for the development of a
sensory afferent stimulation-based neuroprosthetic device to restore bowel function following spinal cord injury."

Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is the most common muscle disease in adults over age
50, yet the cause of the disease is unknown, and there are no treatments. To better
understand the pathogenesis of this disease and to identify therapeutic targets, we have
developed two novel mouse models. First, by implanting human IBM biopsy tissue into
immunocompromised mice, we have developed a human xenograft model that recapitulates
key features of the disease including atrophy, endomysial inflammation, protein aggregates,
and TDP-43 pathology. Second, by deleting TDP-43 specifically in skeletal muscle of mice, we
replicated key IBM features including atrophy, rimmed vacuoles and protein aggregates. The
goal of this proposal is to better understand the pathogenesis of IBM using these two mouse
models and to validate therapeutic targets.
We believe we have created the first clinically relevant mouse models of sporadic IBM. Such
models have the potential to be useful for IBM studies including mechanistic studies and target
validation. This project will independently and rigorously test both the role of the inflammatory
response and the role of compromised TDP-43 splicing repression in IBM pathogenesis."
10834031,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Reconstruction of dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) tissues through tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine (RM) is a major goal in dentistry. Despite the continuing success and commercial viability of RM
approaches in selected areas of medicine, the application of RM concepts to DOC problems has not been well-
implemented in clinical practice. To meet this need, the Michigan-Pittsburgh-Wyss Regenerative Medicine
Resource Center (MPWRM RC) was established as an interdisciplinary partnership amongst the University of
Michigan, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Wyss Institute, along with technology, clinical, regulatory,
marketing, and commercial translation experts from private practice and industry. Through this collaborative
effort, we will accelerate clinical adoption of promising technologies by providing the interdisciplinary expertise
and resources to guide technologies towards FDA submissions.
The vision of this RC is to safely and effectively regenerate, reconstruct, and restore functional DOC tissues.
To achieve this vision and fulfill the goals of DOC Tissue Regeneration Consortium (DOCTRC), we will continue
this cooperative agreement with NIDCR for Stage 3 to: 1) implement the RC structure and processes developed
in Stage 2 to catalyze Interdisciplinary Translational Projects (ITPs) towards clinical adoption; 2) direct clinical
translation and commercialization of ITP technologies; and 3) broaden DOCTRC impact and build sustainability.
Each of these endeavors will be done in partnership with the Center for Dental Oral and Craniofacial Tissue and
Organ Regeneration (C-DOCTOR), our companion RC.
Under a cooperative agreement and partnership with NIDCR, we have forged strategic partnerships, built
infrastructure, and integrated assessment and advising processes, to support 19 ITPs in Stage 2 of the DOCTRC
initiative. All projects are beyond basic discovery with demonstrable preclinical proof-of-concept, rapidly
maturing product development and commercial translation roadmaps, and strong clinical impact potential. From
this set, 7 projects have been identified as candidates for the initial cohort of the Stage 3 ITP program with a
subset of other projects entering Stage 3 as they mature. These projects represent a balanced portfolio with
respect to clinical needs addressed and technology types, with corresponding product development pathways.
Upon completion of Stage 3 of the DOCTRC initiative, we will have advanced a portfolio of technologies with a
spectrum of associated risk to FDA submissions and commercialization, towards eventual clinical adoption. We
will work to secure leveraged and follow-on funding for ITPs so they may progress to human clinical trials. Finally,
the RC will share our approach with the RM communities beyond solely the projects in our portfolio. The impact
of these efforts will be a catalysis of translation in the DOC arena never previously achieved in an NIH
extramural program, resulting in the transformation of dental, oral, and craniofacial medicine."
10834032,"Project Summary
The somatosensory system permits us to perceive and react to the environment through modalities that
include touch, nociception, thermosensation and proprioception. Somatosensory information is received
peripherally and then relayed centrally by different populations of dorsal interneurons (dIs; dI1-dI6) in the spinal
cord. Our research objectives are to understand the mechanisms that establish dIs during development and
then apply these principles towards designing differentiation protocols to direct the formation of specific
populations of dIs from pluripotent stem cells. These cells have the potential to repair damaged sensory
circuits and act as substrates for drug screening platforms. We have focused on dissecting the role of the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) family in dI fate specification. BMPs were widely assumed to act as morphogens,
patterning the dorsal spinal cord in a concentration-dependent mechanism similar to the manner in which sonic
hedgehog (Shh) patterns the ventral spinal cord. However, our recent studies using mouse, chicken, and
mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) models have found that no evidence that BMPs act as morphogens.
Rather, BMPs have signal-specific activities, with differential abilities to direct dorsal progenitor (dP) patterning
and/or differentiation through specific type I BMP receptors. Our recent in vivo and in vitro studies have also
suggested that dI fates are established in a series of nested choice points. In our model, spinal progenitors are
dorsalized by retinoic acid (RA), subdivided into multipotential dP subgroups by BMP signaling, and then
resolve into specific dI fates. Since little is known about this patterning process, we will assess in Aim 1 how
multipotential dP fates are first established by RA and BMP signaling and identify the mechanisms directing
multipotential dPs into specific dI identities. In Aim 2, we will determine the nature of the intracellular response
that permits specific BMPs to drive dPs towards different dI identities, addressing two unresolved questions: [1]
are canonical receptor regulated (R)-Smads activated in a BMP-specific manner to result in distinct patterning
activities? And [2] what factors do the R-Smads in turn regulate to promote dI fates? Together, these studies
will investigate a long-standing problem in developmental biology, i.e., understanding how specific outcomes
arise from a common signal, and shed light on the specification of dIs, cell types needed to permit paralyzed
patients to again interpret their sensory environment. Our specific aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Identify the mechanism(s) that establish multipotential dPs and assign them into individual dI fates.
Hypothesis: RAÂ±BMP4 direct the formation of multipotential dP subgroups, which resolve into specific dI fates
by the asymmetric activation of additional endogenous signaling pathways, such as the Wnt pathway.
Aim 2: Assess the role of the Smad and Id families in BMP-induced dI fate specification.
Hypothesis: BMPs differentially activate Smad1 and/or Smad5, to regulate the activity of Id family members."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor for which improved therapies are badly needed. There are
roughly 10,000 cases diagnosed in the US each year, and median survival is ~14 months. Evidence has been
accumulating over recent years linking cytomegalovirus (CMV) to GBM and other cancers. However, the role
of CMV in GBM remains poorly defined. CMV is a prevalent virus in humans, where it resides lifelong in a
latent state but can be reactivated under certain conditions. Several clinical trials targeting CMV using diverse
approaches including immunotherapies and the anti-viral drug CMV have shown very promising responses in
GBM patients, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. To improve our understanding of this area we
have developed an immunocompetent murine model of intracranial GBM grown in the context of a systemic
latent CMV infection. This consistently leads to significantly shortened survival compared with mock infected
controls in multiple distinct murine GBM models. These effects can be reversed by treatment with anti-viral
drugs. Our new preliminary human data shows reduced progression free survival in CMV seropositive humans
and similarities in patterns of differentially expressed genes supporting the relevance of the mouse model. Our
model features increased blood vessel formation, with accumulation of perivascular pericytes, increased CD8+
T cell infiltrates and resistance to chemotherapy. We discovered that platelet-derived growth factor-Î´ (PDGFD)
is upregulated by CMV infection of tumor cells, and that CRISPR-mediated knockdown of PDGFD prevents
pericyte recruitment and severely impairs tumor growth. Therefore in Specific Aim 1 we will further
investigate PDGFD as a potential GBM therapeutic target. Also, we have preliminary data with a replication-
defective viral mutant suggesting that CMV replication is critical to this phenotype, and we will use this mutant
to explore the mechanisms by which CMV enhances tumor progression. We also have shown that the tumor
microenvironment is significantly impacted by CMV, therefore in Specific Aim 2 we will examine the
therapeutic implications of CMV on tumor/immune interactions, and the importance of viral replication in these
effects. In Specific Aim 3 we will use our model to investigate the interactions of CMV with standard of care
chemoradiation, in terms of viral reactivation and sensitization to therapies by anti-viral drugs. Results from the
proposed experiments will bring us to a deeper understanding of the impact that CMV has on GBM
progression, providing badly needed targets and rational therapeutic combinations for future clinical trials in
this devastating disease."

While many neurological defects and disorders are known to result from developmental perturbations in specific
cell types and/or are linked to well-studied signaling pathways, the system-level coordination of multiple cell
populations and the spatiotemporal specificity of their signaling outputs during neurogenesis remains poorly
understood. The long-term objective of this proposal is to take advantage of the accessible and rapidly
developing zebrafish olfactory epithelium to quantitatively characterize cell-cell signaling pathways and
multicellular behaviors that drive the assembly of complex neuronal populations in vertebrates. Proposed
experiments will test the hypothesis that the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways provide spatially- and temporally-
sensitive cues to guide stem cell migration into the olfactory epithelium and regulate sensory neurogenesis.
Small subsets of cells will be manipulated and analyzed completely in vivo, at subcellular spatial resolution and
with sub-minute temporal resolution, so as to determine the system-level coordination of stem cell migration,
specification, and differentiation during both normal and disrupted signaling. First, new tools and techniques will
be used to perturb Wnt signaling in vivo at specific times and locations during olfactory development and to
algorithmically model and explain progenitor cellsâ migratory behavior. Next, Notch signaling will be manipulated
in vivo to quantitate its effects on olfactory system-wide neurogenesis, and target genes will be identified that
are required for neuronal specification and/or differentiation. Finally, the transcription factor insm1a will be
similarly investigated to determine its role in Notch signaling-mediated olfactory neurogenesis. The approaches
in this proposal will directly analyze in vivo data to understand and predict multicellular behavior without reducing
biological complexity and help uncover phenotypes that may advance our broad understanding of system-wide
neuronal differentiation and assembly in vivo."

 The long term goal of the training program is to equip our predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows
with the knowledge base and the research skills to compete successfully in the world of substance use disorder
(SUD) research. For the past 29 years, the Drug Abuse Training Program at the Medical University of South
Carolina (MUSC) has trained predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars to be cognizant of multiple preclinical and
clinical dimensions of the SUD problem. The objectives of the training program are (1) to integrate a diverse
group of trainees into various funded addiction-related research programs with appropriate mentors, (2) to
provide a strong foundation in research design, analytic techniques, and data presentation appropriate for SUD
research, (3) to expose trainees to appropriate role models, (4) to expose students to issues related to scientific
ethics, rigor, and reproducibility, (5) to teach trainees communication skills, (6) to teach trainees how to prepare
a research grant application and transition to individual fellowships, (7) to help each fellow gain an appreciation
of both clinical and basic science research, and (8) to assist trainees in their professional development. There
has been tremendous growth and development of neuroscience faculty who conduct preclinical and clinical SUD
research in NIH-funded centers at MUSC within the past decade. Concomitant with this growth has been a
substantial increase in training program applicants who are eager to learn from this highly collaborative faculty.
Thus, support to continue this training program at the level of 8 postdoctoral and 4 predoctoral trainees per year
for 5 years is requested. There are now 5 major preclinical and clinical research opportunities: (1) neurobiology
and treatment of drug relapse; (2) sex and gender-related research in SUDs; (3) interaction of stress and SUDs;
(4) neurobiology and treatment of tobacco and cannabis use disorders; and (5) neuroimaging functional networks
in SUDs. Since the main sites of research training arein very close proximity to one another, there is coordination
of educational (courses, seminars, journal clubs) and research (preclinical and clinical) opportunities and
activities. Coupled to the environment is a comprehensive training package incorporating didactic material,
clinical experiences, and research experiences that provides an ideal training opportunity that is evaluated on
an annual basis. Recruitment and selection of trainees is accomplished by the Program Directors and Internal
Steering Committee members. Augmented recruitment and retention of under-represented individuals is
accomplished in partnership with the College of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office at MUSC.
Eligible preceptors (mentors) are those with actively funded substance abuse-related research projects and
matching of trainees with mentors is by mutual consent. An External Advisory Committee is consulted annually
for evaluation and recommendations. The NIDA training program at MUSC has been very successful in placing
our trainees in highly-productive postdoctoral and faculty-level positions through which they continue to
contribute to SUD research."

specific aims of this research include: 1) to utilize the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) model protocol to effectively collect, analyze and disseminate timely
and highly-scientific quality data on maternal risk factors, behaviors and attitudes
relating to pregnancy and early infancy that will result in translational efforts that reduce
adverse maternal and infant outcomes; and 2) to foster partnerships and culturally
competent data collection, analyses, and dissemination practices within ND
communities, including American Indian communities, in an effort to adequately monitor
modifiable risk factors and minimize disparities. Using the standardized protocol from
CDC, the ND PRAMS Program will implement the data collection, analyses and
dissemination aspects of PRAMS research. ND PRAMS will oversample the ND
American Indian maternal population. Analyses and dissemination of data will be
conducted on a regular basis through fact sheets, data reports, etc. The ND PRAMS
program will also work to modify the PRAMS protocol, as necessary, to ensure
adequate data collection of emerging needs such as population changes, epidemics,
environmental issues, etc. The ND PRAMS Program led by the Program
Director/Principal Investigator, along with its advisory group/Steering Committee, will
ensure adherence to the CDC standard protocol; develop culturally competent
educational materials and a stipend plan to encourage participation; and develop a data
dissemination and translation plan. The ND PRAMS Steering Committee will also
include a tribal subcommittee that will provide leadership for PRAMS data collection,
analysis and dissemination efforts for tribal communities. Data collected through
PRAMS will complement other local and national data sources and allow for comparison
with other states on maternal characteristics and subsequent early infancy outcomes."

2002.
RI PRAMS randomly selects approximately 170 women from the Rhode Island vital
records birth file each month. Sampled women receive a questionnaire by mail and non-
respondents receive follow-up mailings. Additional attempts to contact non-respondents
are conducted via telephone and in-person at Women, Infant and Children (WIC) sites
which was approved by CDC and implement in RI as an alternative method of data
collection. Data is stratified by low birthweight and normal birthweight. RI PRAMS
materials, including surveys, are available in English and Spanish.
RI PRAMS works in partnership with its Steering Committee, RIDOH programs, other

10853569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The progression from a pluripotent state into the myriad cell types that arise during mammalian development
involves a host of epigenetic properties that dictate gene expression patterns and enforce the commitment of a
cell to a specific lineage. The advent of single-cell genomics has enabled the study of cell lineage dynamics at
unprecedented resolution; however, such studies have been largely limited to RNA transcription. The dynamic
modulation of the epigenome that governs these processes involves multiple layers of regulation, including a
major role by DNA methylation â a canonically repressive property that can act as a gatekeeper of genomic
permissiveness. Aberrant DNA methylation is also associated with numerous developmental disorders and
diseases; however, it is also one of the least studied properties, particularly at the single-cell level, primarily due
to technological limitations. We have recently addressed this shortcoming with the development of a high-
throughput single-cell DNA methylation assay capable of producing 100âs of thousands of cell profiles in a single
experiment, paving the way for studies of this property with a power comparable to that of transcription. Here we
propose the production of at atlas of DNA methylation during mammalian embryonic development in the mouse
at 24-hour increments from embryonic day 8.5 to 17.5 in order to produce a granular map of DNA methylation
dynamics during key stages of lineage priming and commitment. We will further assess the intestinal epithelium
using novel multiomic technologies in order to gain mechanistic insight into how layers of epigenetic control drive
and enforce one another. These data will enable the assessment of standing hypotheses regarding the role of
DNA methylation in genomic permissiveness and cell fate decisions. Finally, the datasets, which will represent
a powerful resource for developmental biology and epigenomic studies, will be made openly available through
interactive portals to enable broad access by the greater research community."

physiology, and pathology. The formation and plasticity of neural networks are key examples of cell shape
change during development and physiology, whereas cell shape and motility goes awry in pathological
conditions, such as melanoma. We study two main themes during cellular shape change: The active control of
the cytoskeleton, which is acknowledged as critical to cellular shape change, and the concurrent remodeling of
the plasma membrane, which is perhaps less well appreciated. Although many cytoskeletal and membrane
remodeling components are known and their biochemical and structural characteristics described, we lack a
systematic understanding of how these disparate systems are regulated and coordinated to orchestrate cellular
shape change. Perhaps the most important problem in cell morphogenesis is understanding how cells perceive
cues in their environment and convert this extracellular information into shape changes through coordinated
cytoskeletal dynamics and plasma membrane remodeling; this is the focus of this proposal. Functions of small
GTPases and kinases have been extensively studied in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane
remodeling. Work from my lab identified an emerging role for E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulated cellular shape
change. We identified two E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM9 and TRIM67, which regulate cytoskeletal and exocytic
proteins and cellular shape changes in response to netrin. The extracellular morphogen netrin promotes neuronal
morphogenesis and cancer progression. Despite these important consequences, we know little about how cells
interpret netrin into shape changes. TRIM9 and TRIM67 provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the
function of ubiquitination in cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling, and how these functions are coordinated
during netrin triggered cell shape change and motility. TRIM9 and TRIM67 share similar sequences, localization,
and interaction partners, however our studies identified distinct functions of these related proteins and
antagonistic phenotypes associated with their deletion. The overarching goal of this program is to test the
hypothesis that TRIM9 and TRIM67 coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis during netrin-dependent
morphogenesis in multiple cell types. Since netrin plays roles in both neuronal development and cancer
pathogenesis, our work will exploit developing neurons and migrating melanoma cells as model systems. Our
preliminary and published data indicate both cell types respond to netrin and express TRIM9 and TRIM67. Our
work will illuminate fundamental generalities and cell type specific mechanisms of shape change, providing
mechanistic understanding of the coordination of the cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking during development
and metastasis. This supplement seeks to promote diversity in our health related research."

 Babies are a highly vulnerable population for which the ability to diagnose atypical vs. typical visual cortex
development and intervene early could not be of greater importance. However, how infant visual cortex develops
microstructurally and functionally is largely unknown outside primary visual cortex (V1). The goal of this research
is to fill glaring gaps in knowledge by: (i) Using innovative quantitative (qMRI), diffusion (dMRI), and functional
(fMRI) magnetic resonance imaging, to longitudinally measure and examine the relationship between
microstructural and functional development of the human visual system during the first two years of life (Aim 1).
(ii) Using advanced histological and quantitative methods in pediatric samples of visual cortex, determine the
biological underpinnings of microstructural development (Aim 2). Specifically, Aim 1a will use qMRI and dMRI
to longitudinally measure the microstructural development of infant visual cortex from 0-24 months. We will: (i)
test if development varies across visual areas, and (ii) examine if microstructural development is associated with
tissue pruning or proliferation. Aim 1b will use dMRI and qMRI to longitudinally measure the microstructural
development of the white matter tracts of the infant visual system from 0-24 months and examine the relation
between white and gray matter development. Aim 1c will use fMRI to: (i) examine the development of cortical
responses to visual contrast, which rely on processing in V1, and responses to visual categories, which rely on
processing in high-level visual regions in ventral temporal cortex (VTC), and (ii) determine if and how functional
development is related to microstructural development in the same infants. Aim 2 will augment and validate in
vivo metrics using ex vivo histology in tissue samples of 0-24 months-olds. Aim 2a will use quantitative histology
to (i) measure the development of cortical myelination in V1 and VTC, and (ii) relate histological data to in vivo
metrics to determine which neuroimaging metrics are coupled with myelination. Aim 2b will: (i) quantify the
densities of multiple cell types (all cells, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) in V1 and VTC, and (ii) test
if development varies across cortical expanses and if it is tied to myelination. Aim 2c will use transcriptomic
analyses to determine gene expression pathways and elucidate molecular signaling pathways associated with
microstructural development in V1 and VTC. The proposed research is highly innovative and groundbreaking as
it will provide the first combined in vivo and ex vivo measurements of the microstructural and functional
development of human visual cortex in infancy. This research is important as it will not only fill significant gaps
in knowledge but also will develop novel, cutting-edge, and open-source methodologies for quantitative
measurements of cortical microstructure that are linked to biological mechanisms. Thus, the proposed research
has broad societal and clinical impact as it will lead to development of non-invasive biomarkers to diagnosis
atypical visual cortex development in infants, leading to early inventions and better life-long outcomes."

 Candida albicans is a common fungal commensal and opportunistic pathogen occupying the skin, oral
cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract of its human host. Overgrowth of C. albicans within these
host niches can lead to mucosal and systemic disease and typically relies on pathogenic processes such as
the yeast-hyphal transition. Hyphae are capable of breaching host mucosal barriers through active penetration
and endocytic uptake that both lead to host cell destruction and transmigration of C. albicans to deeper tissues.
Thus, host epithelial cells serve a vital role in detecting C. albicans overgrowth and signaling to professional
phagocytes to remove invasive fungal cells. Interestingly, natural C. albicans isolates obtained from clinical
setting display a range of filamentation phenotypes, including strains unable to produce hyphae. Here, we will
investigate the genetic determinants underlying natural occurring phenotypic variation in C. albicans that
regulates the ability to filament and/or colonize the oral cavity through the first use of quantitative genetic
approaches in C. albicans. A genetically diverse set of sequenced clinical C. albicans isolates forms the basis
of this study as they display significant variation in filamentation processes in vitro and the ability to cause
disease in vivo. First, gene expression across the sequenced isolates will facilitate construction of co-
expression network modules that associate with in vitro filamentation phenotypes. Expression of key
transcriptional regulators within each predicted module will be tested in multiple strain backgrounds for altered
in vitro filamentation across a variety of solid and liquid substrates. Automated phenotyping of filamentation,
adhesion, and invasion of agar substrates will be built to facilitate scoring mutant phenotypes (Aim 1). In Aim 2,
quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping will be developed utilizing the parasexual program, an alternative mating
and ploidy reduction system in C. albicans, to identify the genes responsible for differences in filamentation
and epithelial damage between C. albicans strains incubated with OKF6/TERT-2 oral epithelial cells. Identified
genes that modulate filamentation and epithelial damage in tissue culture systems will be subsequently tested
for in vivo colonization and filamentation phenotypes of a murine model of oropharyngeal candidiasis.
Preliminary experiments suggest that filamentation and damage of oral epithelial cells are separable
phenotype, which will be explored further through dual-species RNA sequencing of strains separated by
filamentation (+/-) and cell damage (+/-) phenotypes incubated with OKF6/TERT-2 cells (Aim 3). This Aim will
also determine the role of recently identified host genes with differential expression between damaging and
colonizing strains in host cell signaling and transcriptional responses that lead to either filamentation or host
cell damage during interaction with oral epithelial cells. Together, these studies will determine the pathways
and processes modulated by genetic diversity in C. albicans that lead to divergent filamentation and epithelial
damage phenotypes that contribute to commensalism v. disease."
10833622,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The objectives of this project are to more thoroughly understand the relationship between neonatal
abstinence syndrome (NAS) and longitudinal academic performance. NAS is a withdrawal condition due to in
utero drug exposure, most commonly opioids. The syndrome affects more than 32,000 newborns annually in
the U.S., and its incidence continues to rise. Researchers report poorer development in toddler and preschool
years, higher rates of inattention and behavioral problems, and worse and deteriorating school performance in
children with a history of NAS, indicating the effects of NAS may last well beyond the newborn period.
However, these existing studies do not sufficiently account for the complex interaction of biologic, health, and
socioenvironmental influences on childhood development. Thus, the relationship between NAS and long-term
neurodevelopment and academic achievement remains largely unknown. As school achievement is directly
associated with adult productivity and negatively correlated with participation in crime, a better understanding
of NAS and academic performance is urgently needed to optimize outcomes across a lifetime.
 This proposal aims to assess the independent relationship between NAS, NAS severity, NAS treatment, in
utero drug exposure and longitudinal academic performance after controlling for relevant biologic, health, and
socioenvironmental variables; to explore the moderator effects of early community and school resource
support on NAS; and to learn how familiesâ school experiences may explain childhood academic performance.
The former aims will be accomplished using an inclusive, uniquely-integrated South Carolinian data
warehouse. With this data system, a child with a diagnosis of NAS can be linked with his/her mother, and the
dyad can be followed so that a broad range of childhood outcomes can be examined in the context of relevant,
influential factors. In addition, through qualitative interviews with parents and guardians of children with a
history of NAS followed at a Pennsylvania academic medical center, the project will 1) explore if and how
caregiversâ experiences regarding early community and school resource support are related to childhood
academic performance and 2) analyze themes that emerge around barriers and facilitators of academic
achievement in children with NAS.
 Under this career development award, the applicant receives training in methodology of data-driven, public
health studies and patient-oriented, clinical research design; epidemiology, mixed methodologies, community
health, and applying public health principles to clinical practice; and moving research to policy. Successful
completion of the project will not only provide data to serve as the foundation for future studies evaluating NAS
outcomes and treatment, but, in addition to her training and mentorship plan, will prepare the applicant to
become an independent physician-scientist able to conduct clinical trials aimed at improving outcomes of
children affected by NAS."

Powerful machine learning techniques, including recent advances in deep learning, promise to revolutionize
our ability to predict biomedical outcomes and could one day replace people in tasks such as image analysis,
medical diagnosis, and precision therapy. However, most machine learning methods result in âblack boxesâ
which do not provide the mechanistic understanding needed to control and repair biological systems in
industrial and medical applications. Furthermore, machine learning models trained for high accuracy in one
context, such as predicting drug responses of cell lines, often transfer poorly to other contexts such as
predicting drug responses of patients. How can we gain both the predictive power of machine learning and the
interpretability and transferability of mechanistic models of biology? Here we explore a series of
complementary and innovative approaches to this question based on integrating machine learning models with
biological networks. Specifically, we aim to use networks to: [Aim 1] Guide the transfer of predictive models of
drug response from model systems to patients; [Aim 2] Apply machine learning models to genotype-phenotype
prediction in genome-wide association studies; and [Aim 3] Use machine learning for patient diagnosis and
clinical trial selection in precision medicine applications. These aims are motivated by Driving Biomedical
Projects focused on drug response prediction in cell lines and patients (Aim 1; DBPs 13,19), genome-wide
association analysis of disease (Aim 2; DBPs 14-15,17), predicting patient outcomes in cancer and major
depression (Aim 3; DBPs 8,16), and clinical trial design (Aim 3; DBP 18). Our methods will be made available
as open source software and on prominent cloud-based biomedical data and computing environments (TPs
6,7) to support wide adoption.

10840296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The purpose of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) is to prepare
Heidi M. Herrick, MD MSCE, Clinical Instructor and Attending Physician at the Childrenâs Hospital of
Philadelphia and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for her long-term goal of becoming an
independent health services research scientist with expertise in Human Factors (HF) and its application to
neonatal resuscitation. Her long-term career objective is to apply HF methodology to neonatal resuscitation to
improve provider resuscitation performance and neonatal outcomes. Her immediate goal is to acquire the
mentorship, training, and research experience needed to successfully compete for R01 grants aimed at
optimizing neonatal resuscitation to decrease variation in DR practices and outcomes. To achieve these goals
and transition to independence, Dr. Herrick and her mentors have developed a comprehensive career
development plan based on the following: (1) intensive mentorship from a team with whom she has a proven
track record of collaboration and scholarship; (2) advanced training in HF in complex systems, quality metric
development, and qualitative methodology; (3) mentored leadership positions, and (4) an innovative research
plan to use a HF framework to define and validate DR quality metrics and to develop comprehensive DR
models to evaluate factors that impact quality.
 Prematurity is a major clinical problem with enormous societal burden and cost, affecting one in ten
deliveries in the US. DR resuscitation is paramount to the survival of extremely premature neonates.
Unfortunately, significant variation in DR practices and outcomes exist within the US. This variation
emphasizes the need for improved and consistent care. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive
approaches to assess DR care, and no validated DR quality metrics exist to help explain and rectify this
variation. Leveraging HF methodology in a multicenter study, Dr. Herrickâs research proposal will fill this
knowledge gap by (1) performing and in-depth works systems analysis of DR resuscitation to identify
systematic factors that impact process and outcome variation, (2) identifying and refining DR quality metrics
using a modified Delphi Process, and (3) testing reliability and validity of consensus quality metrics.
 Dr. Herrickâs K08 studies will address the critical gap of lack of DR quality metrics. The findings from these
studies will directly inform future R01 proposals aimed at decreasing variation to optimize neonatal
resuscitation. Her career development plan outlines a clear path to gain the knowledge, skills, and experience
needed to gain independence as a health services research scientist and to become a leader in the application
of human factors to neonatal resuscitation."
10840388,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA replication is accomplished by highly regulated macromolecular complexes called
replisomes. Numerous challenges such as damaged DNA templates, repetitive sequences, and
transcriptional complexes hinder DNA replication and stall replication forks. Stalled forks activate
the replication stress response to signal repair of damaged DNA, recruit proteins, and halt cell
cycle; thereby stabilizing replication forks and preventing collapse into toxic double strand breaks.
Failure to deal with replication stress can cause diseases characterized by abnormal
development, accelerated aging and cancer predisposition. For these reasons, it is critical to
understand genome maintenance pathways that promote accurate DNA replication in the context
of replication stress. To gain further mechanistic insight into replication stress response pathways,
I previously developed a quantitative proteomic screening approach to study the protein
composition of replisomes at unperturbed and stalled replication forks in human cells. This work
provides evidence for checkpoint-independent replisome stabilization, a model contrary to
prevailing models of replisome dissociation when checkpoint is inhibited, as well as mechanistic
insights into ATR inhibitors that are currently utilized in clinical trials as chemotherapeutics. I also
generated comprehensive proteomic datasets of active, stalled, and collapsed replication forks.
These datasets include potential regulators of replication stress response, and also identifies
mediators of replication fork protection, which is relevant to acquired chemoresistance in breast
cancers. My lab will utilize this vast resource in combination with detailed functional studies to
reveal previously unknown genome maintenance mechanisms. The proposed research program
is designed to address three key areas in my lab: 1) Characterization of new replication stress
response proteins, 2) Replication fork protection in breast cancers, and 3) Regulation of
replication stress response by phosphorylation.
 Completion of these goals will reveal new fundamental insights into the molecular
mechanisms of replication stress response that can lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries thereby
expanding our view on genome maintenance mechanisms that govern DNA replication and
providing avenues for designing effective treatments in cancer chemotherapy."
10840389,"Inflammatory liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can progress to liver fibrosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatic T cell immunity is closely linked to liver diseases since T cells are not
only essential for the clearance of hepatotropic viruses like HCV but may also cause liver injury and contribute
to disease progression. However, the specific role of functionally distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets or
innate-like T cells, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, in mediating an effective antiviral immune response or
regulating liver damage during inflammation are not well understood. Thus, gaining new insights into the
functional biology of hepatic T cell subsets is a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccine strategies and
immunotherapeutic options for the treatment of progressive liver diseases.
Limited access to human liver tissue and the lack of immune-competent small animal models has impeded
studies of hepatic antiviral immune mechanisms. However, we have recently developed an immune-competent
mouse model of an HCV-related virus, Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV), which shares significant virological and
immunological similarities with HCV infection in humans. This advance now allows for in-depth mechanistic
studies of anti-hepaciviral immunity in vivo.
Our initial analysis of hepatic lymphocyte subsets during acute, chronic and secondary NrHV infection revealed
a significant induction of a diverse antiviral type 1 T cell response and T cell dependent viral clearance. However,
we also made the unexpected observation that subsets of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NKT cells are polarized
towards type 2 immunity and may contribute to immune-regulation. In this proposal, we will build on these
preliminary data and elucidate the functional properties and potential crosstalk of distinct hepatic type 1 T cells
and type 2 cytokine secreting lymphocyte subsets during NrHV infection. Specifically, we will use high-
dimensional flow cytometry, in vivo functional approaches and/or transcriptome analysis to 1) define the
functional role of different virus-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cell subsets, 2) determine the kinetic and
impact of CD4+ T cells on the generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and protective immunity, 3) delineate the
function of type 2 CD8+ and NKT cell subsets and define their impact on liver damage, virus-specific T cells and
other hepatic immune cells during different stages of infection. Finally, we aim to translate our main findings from
the mouse model to human HCV patients.
Our data will provide novel biological insight into the role and interplay of distinct hepatic type 1 and type 2 T cell
and NKT cell subsets in mediating viral clearance, protective immunity, tissue pathology or repair during a

10838819,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Innate immune sensing of microbes leads to activation of signal transduction cascades that trigger
multiple transcription factors to rewire gene expression for host defense. However, the mechanisms that regulate
this sophisticated response are not completely understood. This proposal addresses a novel transcriptional
mechanism that regulates the innate response to HIV-1. Our preliminary data define a gene regulatory network
that maps the innate immune response in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and highlight new transcriptional
circuitry that controls interferon signaling, which is highly relevant for HIV infection. Type I and type III interferon
are known to block acute infection of HIV. However, dysregulated interferon signaling is a hallmark of
pathogenesis and can increase virus replication and spread. Based on our network predictions and experimental
validations, our data indicate that Core-Binding Factor Subunit Beta (CBFb, encoded by the gene CBFB) is a
cell-type specific regulator of interferon and inflammation. Loss-of-function mutations in CBFb have been
associated with breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, but a role in regulating antiviral responses through
interferon signaling has not been described. We have found that perturbation of CBFb by CRISPR-Cas9 or RNA
interference leads to spontaneous induction of specific interferon stimulated genes and inflammatory factors in
myeloid cells but not T cells. CBFb is known to be hijacked by HIV-1 Vif in T cells to reduce expression of
APOBEC3 family restriction factors, and our work suggests that CBFbâs impact on HIV is more complex than
previously appreciated. Interestingly, our data indicate that HIV-1 replicates more efficiently in CBFb-depleted
myeloid cells in single-cycle infections, but the virus fails to spread efficiently in replication-competent assays
(and in this case, effects are independent of Vif). The experiments outlined in this proposal will provide a greater
mechanistic understanding of how the transcription cofactor CBFb regulates innate immune responses and
influences HIV-1 replication. With this project we aim to: 1) Determine the direct and indirect targets of CBFb
and their impact on HIV infection, 2) Determine the mechanism by which CBFb limits IFN responses in myeloid
cells, and 3) Validate roles for CBFb during activation and maturation of primary immune cells in response to
HIV. We will systematically test how CBFb and CBFb-dependent genes impact HIV replication, test mutant CBFb
constructs in rescue experiments, and evaluate the roles of CBFb binding partners (such as RUNX family
members) in regulating HIV infection and the innate immune response. We expect to uncover the molecular
mechanism of how CBFb suppresses interferon signaling and gain a better understanding of how the
inflammatory state of a cell affects HIV replication. Ultimately, this project will teach us how cellular parameters
tune innate immunity, knowledge that could lead to new treatments to target the virus reservoir and engage anti-
HIV immune responses."

Globally, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV
and common mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. The mental health of GBMSM is directly
affected by chronic exposure to sexual minority stressors, those that uniquely impact sexual minority individuals
via prejudice events, such as enacted stigma and violence, as well as anticipated and internalized stigma and
concealment of oneâs sexual orientation. Behavioral interventions that address the multiple mental and sexual
health problems caused by chronic exposure to sexual minority stress among GBMSM are urgently needed. The
goal of this Career Development Award is to expand the candidateâs skillset and prepare him to conduct
independent research on scalable behavioral interventions that integrate mental health and HIV services for
sexual minority individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Through a combination of didactic and
applied training and mentorship from leading experts, the candidate will develop expertise in 1) the systematic
adaptation of evidence-based interventions (EBI); 2) implementation science tools for identifying and evaluating
implementation strategies; 3) theory and analysis of mechanisms of change for mental health interventions; and
4) leading culturally appropriate intervention research in LMIC. The candidate will apply the knowledge and skills
gained through this training to conduct a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) in collaboration with Colectivo
Amigos contra el SIDA (CAS), a GBMSM-serving community clinic in Guatemala City with whom he has
extensively collaborated. Specifically, the candidate will adapt the ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower
Effective Men) intervention to target pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake for the Guatemalan context and to
identify implementation strategies (Aim 1). ESTEEM is a skills-building Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
intervention that was designed to reduce GBMSMâs co-occurring health risks by addressing the underlying
cognitive, affective, and behavioral pathways through which minority stress impairs health; it is effective at
improving mental health and HIV-related behaviors among GBMSM in the US and China. He will then pilot the
adapted intervention with 80 GBMSM to assess preliminary effectiveness on depression, anxiety, and PrEP
uptake, and explore mechanisms of change (Aim 2). Finally, he will assess acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity
of the adapted intervention and implementation strategies for future scale-up in other community clinic settings.
Findings from this research will inform the development of an R01 proposal for a hybrid type 1 implementation-
effectiveness trial to examine effectiveness and implementation sustainability of the scaled-up, adapted
intervention. Together, the training, research, and collaborations outlined in the award will support the testing of
a scalable mental health intervention with the potential to improve multiple common mental illnesses and PrEP
uptake among GBMSM in LMIC, contributing to NIMHâs goal of scaling up EBIs for underserved populations."

 Vaccines and antibody interventions against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) have made
tremendous progress, but are not yet ready for broad clinical use. A vaccine that prevents new infections could
provide a major boost to ending the HIV-1 pandemic by blocking transmissions. The HIV-1 fusion peptide (FP)
has shown promise as a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb)-directed vaccine target site because vaccine
antigens can effectively prime and expand B cell responses targeting FP. However, HIV-1 genetic diversity at
FP and the limited potency & neutralization breadth of known antibodies at the FP site has slowed progress for
FP-directed interventions. A better understanding of how anti-FP antibodies can attain exquisite neutralization
potency and breadth against HIV-1 will enable improved vaccines and therapeutic development. This project will
explore critical mutational pathways for anti-FP antibodies, providing new molecular and functional insights for
better antibody & vaccine solutions against HIV-1 FP.
 Aim 1 of the project will apply precision mutational scanning and directed evolution to engineer exquisite
neutralization potency for antibodies targeting HIV-1 FP. We will implement a new single-cell droplet-based
screening platform established by our laboratory to directly identify antibody variants based on neutralization
function. Aim 1 will enhance anti-FP antibody breadth & potency beyond current best-in-class examples, and by
studying these antibodies we will learn more about the structural & molecular requirements for potent protection
at FP. For Aim 2, we will explore the affinity mutational landscapes that can increase cross-reactivity and breadth
against FP, and compare those data with neutralization profiles in Aim 1 to understand the connections between
affinity-enhancing and neutralization-enhancing mutations. Finally, in Aim 3 we will explore how antibody variable
region mutations can also influence Fc-effector function, and how HIV-1 Fc effector protein engagement co-
correlates with affinity and neutralization of a given mutation against diverse HIV-1 viral isolates. Data from Aim
3 will accelerate our understanding of bNAb Fc effector recruitment mechanisms, and synergize with parallel
improvements in Fab-mediated neutralization potency.
 This project elucidates the critical relationships between neutralization potency, antigen affinity, and effector
function in antibodies targeting the FP site. Our multi-platform approach enables the most comprehensive
functional study of anti-FP antibodies to date, with layered characterization of the genetic, biophysical, and
functional features that lead to exquisite anti-HIV-1 activity. The new bNAbs generated and knowledge gained
by this project will provide critical information and resources to develop globally relevant vaccines and
therapeutics against HIV-1 FP."

As individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) live into older age, patterns of care established during middle age

planning (ACP) is a critical tool for supporting older adults to participate with clinicians in making real-time,
complex medical decisions over the course of serious illness so that the medical care they receive is aligned
with their goals. Although often applied to end-of-life decisions (e.g. advanced directives regarding life-
sustaining treatments), the ACP paradigm has been expanded to also prepare patients to more effectively
participate in re-assessing current treatment goals for long-term chronic conditions such as T2D. The goal of
this study is to apply the expanded ACP paradigm (skill building and preparation for values elicitation, decision-
making, and communication) to the specific clinical problem of hypoglycemia-related adverse outcomes in
vulnerable older patients with T2D. We will adapt our existing, evidenced-based patient-facing, online
PREPARE tool (prepareforyourcare.org) to address treatment intensity in older adults with T2D at increased
risk for hypoglycemic events (i.e. prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas) (Aim 1). We will then conduct a
randomized clinical trial in the primary care setting comparing this new ACP-T2D tool to usual care among 600
adults â¥ 75 years of age and at increased risk for hypoglycemic events (Aim 2). The goal of this intervention is
to enable informed, prepared patients to engage with their primary care providers in re-assessing their
diabetes treatment intensity and treatment goals in the context of ACP. We hypothesize that for many of these
high-risk older adults, these informed conversations will lead to medication de-prescribing and corresponding
lower incidence of clinically-significant hypoglycemia (primary clinical outcome, defined by the American
Diabetes Association as hypoglycemia requiring resuscitative help from another person) relative to usual care.
We will also examine prescription changes, ED/hospital admissions, and a set of patient-reported outcomes
related to communication, diabetes management, and ACP. In Aim 3 we will analyze heterogeneity of
treatment effect by clinical and patient-level contextual factors to inform future iterations of this expanded ACP
paradigm. If successful, this relatively low-cost and generalizable framework could be scaled and applied in a
wide variety of healthcare settings and to a range of chronic conditions in which evolving risks, benefits, and
consequences of treatment require re-assessment with age."

wide variety of healthcare settings and to a range of chronic conditions in which evolving risks, benefits, and
consequences of treatment require re-assessment with age."
10840309,"The American Society for Virology (ASV) seeks renewal of a multi-year block grant to provide partial support
for predoctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and U.S. teachers of undergraduate virology to travel to and
participate in the annual ASV scientific meetings in 2021-2025. The ASV 2021 meeting will be held July 17-21

on participation by women and underrepresented minority virologists, with the goal of benefiting future virology
research. Pre- and postdoctoral awards will be $500 each, and teacher awards $1,000 each, for a total of
$14,000 per year. Members of the ASV Travel Award Committee will evaluate the applications. Pre- and
postdoctoral awardees are selected based on an abstract of their work for presentation in workshops or poster
sessions. Teachers are selected based on an essay explaining the benefit of ASV meeting attendance to their
teaching (and research, if applicable). In addition to announcing the travel award program to its members, ASV
promotes it to ~100 U.S. undergraduate institutions serving primarily underrepresented populations. Post-
meeting evaluations are required of awardees and obtained anonymously, focusing on how they benefited
from participation. The ASV meeting provides an opportunity for U.S. junior scientists to meet and interact
directly with senior virologists in symposia, workshops, poster sessions, and special satellite symposia
covering the most recent developments in virus research. These include studies of viruses of humans, animals,
plants, invertebrates and prokaryotes, and the scope spans topics such as virus genetics, replication, structure,
pathogenesis, ecology, evolution and emergence, disease control, virus-host interactions, and new
technologies. The ASV is the largest general virology meeting in North America, enhancing opportunities for
cross-fertilization of ideas and technologies across the entirety of the virus world. In addition to scientific
sessions, over the last 10 years the meeting has included opportunities for trainees and teachers of
undergraduate students to network with and receive mentoring from virologists with experience in academia in
both research and primarily undergraduate institutions, industry, government research, publishing, clinical
virology, and other scientific careers through career, education, and communication workshops and lunch

10840405,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Medicare Advantage (MA) program has experienced substantial growth over the last decade, particularly
among racial/ethnic minorities. MA offers an alternative to traditional Medicare (TM) coverage by allowing
Medicare beneficiaries to receive integrated medical and prescription drug coverage from private insurers.
Although MA serves a growing population of Black and Hispanic beneficiaries, it remains unclear whether MA
mitigates or exacerbates racial/ethnic disparities in care, as well as whether certain MA plans provide higher
quality and more equitable care for Black and Hispanic enrollees than other MA plans. Rigorous evidence is
needed to identify opportunities to reduce health care disparities in the Medicare program and design
incentives for MA plans to improve care for Black and Hispanic enrollees. Thus, the overarching objectives of
this study are to investigate whether enrollment in MA mitigates or exacerbates racial/ethnic disparities (i.e.,
between Black vs. white and Hispanic vs. white beneficiaries) in access, quality, and utilization of care relative
to TM; to identify high-quality and high-equity MA plans; and to develop and validate measures of patient
experiences with trust, discrimination, and equitable care that could be incorporated into future assessments of
MA plan performance. We draw on rich sources of national data, including the Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey and encounter claims submitted by Medicare Advantage plans, and will also conduct a national survey
of Medicare beneficiaries to assess experiences with trust, discrimination, and equity in care to evaluate
disparities along different dimensions of care (access, quality, and patient experiences). We will go beyond
existing surveys of the Medicare population by explicitly surveying beneficiaries about their experiences with
equity, trust, and discrimination in care, and will provide evidence to guide how these items could be
incorporated into future surveys of patient experiences and assessments of MA plan performance (e.g., plan
star ratings). Thus, this project will illuminate how key features of the MA program overall, and attributes of
particular MA plans, affect care for racial/ethnic minorities. It will also provide new evidence to inform how
policymakers could take equity into account when evaluating the quality of MA plans, including assessing
patient experiences with equitable vs. inequitable care. This work addresses NIAâs strategic priorities for 2020-
25 to identify health system factors underlying disparities and policy opportunities to reduce health care
disparities among older adults. To enhance the impact of our work, we will disseminate findings through
scientific publications and to a national network of policy stakeholders, including a Policy Advisory Committee
comprised of experts in Medicare policy, the MA program, and disparities."
10840466,"The clinical landscape of metastatic melanoma has advanced rapidly since 2009 with the breakthroughs
of targeted therapies and immunotherapy. These therapeutic agents are now moving into the adjuvant
setting. A current unmet need is to understand the biology of melanoma that fail to respond to either
targeted or immunotherapy in order to devise new treatment strategies. A paradigm for these non-
responsive subsets is uveal/ocular melanoma. A further complication is that nearly 50% of uveal
melanoma patients will ultimately develop advanced disease involving liver metastasis without
recurrence at the primary site; however, there is often a lag period ranging from years to decades
between primary tumor treatment and development of liver macro-metastasis. This observation
highlights the clinical importance of early tumor cell dissemination (DTC) and dormancy at distant sites.
We are studying the cellular mechanisms of tumor dormancy and tolerance to targeted inhibitors in uveal
melanoma. We aim to identify mechanisms controlling dormancy in uveal melanoma disseminated
tumor cells. Mechanistic insights will lead to novel targeting approaches; thus, we aim to provide pre-
clinical data for new treatment combinations for uveal melanoma patients. Aberrant cell cycle regulation
is a hallmark feature of cancer. In uveal melanoma, cell cycle progression is promoted through mutations
in the guanine-nucleotide binding proteins, GNAQ and GNA11. Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are FDA-
approved in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer but their use in uveal melanoma will require
optimization of drug combinations and schedules. We aim to understand how to utilize CDK4/6 inhibitors
in uveal melanoma and combine them with agents that target dormant cells and/or drug tolerant
persisters. We aim to define the molecular signatures of these therapy-induced drug tolerant persisterp
cells in metastatic uveal melanoma. In this multi-PI R01, synergy is provided by our established
published and ongoing collaborations on altered signaling pathways, cellular dormancy, metastasis
biology and response to targeted therapies. Our research expertise in dormancy and melanoma biology
complement each other and link to clinical strengths at our institutions. Our studies will determine how
dormancy and oncogenic signaling pathways dictate survival and quiescence of uveal melanoma DTCs
and how to target them to prevent metastatic re-growth. We anticipate that our mechanistic insights into
uveal melanoma DTCs and metastasis biology will form the basis for new treatment options that in the
near future could result in more potent and durable therapy responses."
10847435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic and inflammatory disorders such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing at
alarming rates. Many of these are not tissue-specific occurrences but complex and often overlapping
pathologies of unknown origin for which no cure exists. Examples are concurring pathologies of the gut-liver
axis, such as inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory pathologies of the liver.
The discovery of âunconventionalâ T lymphocytes and their ability to respond to non-peptide antigens, marks a
new area in the exploration of how migratory cells and immunometabolic networks shape the emergence of
autoimmune and metabolic diseases. These are comprised of a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes, such as
mucosa-associated invariant T cells, whose invariant TCR can recognize cellular and microbial metabolites via
presentation through the MHC-like receptor 1 (MR1). Emerging evidence suggest MR1-restricted T cells to be
implicated in a wide variety of disorders ranging from ulcerative colitis to type 1 diabetes, autoimmune hepatitis
and multiple sclerosis via TCR-specific and non-specific means.
However, lack of models relevant to human physiology represents a significant hurdle in our understanding of
how MR1-restricted T cells affect the host and diseases. We have developed an approach that utilizes multiorgan
human microphysiological models (MOMPS) of donor-matched tissues and unbiased systems biology tools to
gain granular insight into causal relationships between cellular crosstalk and immunometabolic illnesses. In order
to gain critical knowledge about the heterogeneity and functionality of MR1-restricted lymphocytes, we will
combine single-cell characterization of human MR1-restricted T cells across donor-matched tissues and
circulation, with mechanistic studies in a microphysiological model of the gut-liver axis. These MOMPS will be
used to systematically search for causal relationships between MR1-restricted lymphocytes, tissues, and
external factors by reconstructing donor tissue at various levels of complexity. Each level will be challenged via
predetermined inflammatory and metabolic perturbations. Multiomic observation of changes based on interaction
and perturbation at each degree of complexity will allow us to construct interaction networks that reveal causal
relationships among entities. With computational tools and resolution into molecular underpinnings of cellular
and tissue homeostasis, MOMPS represent a unique opportunity to systematically dissect how interactions at a
lower order inform new behavior at the macro scale within and between organ systems. While the gut-liver axis
will serve as a model in this proposal, the developed approach, together with fundamental biological insights into
MR1 expression by parenchymal tissue and function of MR1-restricted T cells, will be applicable to other organ
systems and a variety of pathologies. Our overarching goal is to identify tangible targets and new cell-based
approaches to modulate autoimmune pathologies but also contribute new tools that shed light on the
fundamental origins of complex diseases."
10847439,"Background: We seek to further our understanding of normal mammary gland biology and determine
how pregnancy associated changes in the mammary gland may contribute to development of breast
cancers. Though pregnancy is well-known to provide a protective effect against breast cancer risk, all women
who give birth experience a transient increase in breast cancer risk following each pregnancy. The magnitude
and length of this elevated risk is largely determined by the woman's age at first birth and for women over 30 at
the time of first pregnancy the protective effect likely never occurs. Postpartum breast cancers (PPBC), defined
as breast cancers diagnosed within 5-10 years of last childbirth, are more than twice as likely to become
metastatic and result in death. This devastating diagnosis affects ~12,000 women annually. In 2006, for the
first time, the number of women having children in their 30s was greater than the number under 25. Thus,
PPBC cases are rising. It is thought that modern childbearing practices contribute to the increased risk for
developing PPBC. We have shown that tumor cells and normal adjacent mammary epithelial cells (MECs) in
PPBC patients exhibit high levels of SEMA7A expression, and SEMA7A expressing tumors are more
metastatic. Thus, we believe that understanding the mechanisms underlying SEMA7A signaling in the
mammary gland will lead to novel insights into aggressive PPBC. Our recent preliminary data reveal
SEMA7A+ live MECs during postpartum involution suggesting that SEMA7A may promotes cell survival during
postpartum glandular regression. Consistent with our hypothesis, SEMA7A promotes cell survival in cultured
MECs and our preliminary data suggest a reduction in MECs, as well as lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and
immune cell populations, in SEMA7A-/- (KO) mice. Additional data from KO mice reveal a decrease in
programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1+), a molecule that we have shown to be important for immunosuppression
during involution, on mammary macrophages, LECs and MECs. As the epithelial cell apoptosis that occurs
during involution likely results in presentation of self-antigens, an immune-tolerant tissue microenvironment
may be necessary to prevent activation of the immune system by self-antigens and to simultaneously support
survival of remaining cells in the mammary and stromal compartments. Our overarching hypothesis is that
SEMA7A expression promotes cell survival and a transiently tolerant microenvironment in the
mammary gland; furthermore, aberrant sustained upregulation of SEMA7A may pre-dispose women to
breast malignancy. Aim1 will define the role of SEMA7A in epithelial cell survival during mammary gland
involution. Aim2 will decipher SEMA7A mediated mechanisms of immune tolerance in the mammary
microenvironment during postpartum involution. Relevance: To establish clinical relevance, we will also
perform multi-color immunostaining on normal mammary tissues from recently lactating women."
10847442,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a major hub in the brain that interacts with numerous other brain circuits to
control many behaviors related to learning, memory and decision-making. OFC has also emerged as a significant
node of dysfunction in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Nevertheless, how different OFC outputs contribute to AUD
remains largely unknown. One major challenge in such an investigation is that AUD develops over long time-
scales and is a chronic relapsing condition. Another challenge is that distinct projection outputs of OFC have
different functions. Thus, investigation into the neuronal mechanisms underlying AUD will benefit from a longitu-
dinal study of projection-specific neurons that spans the long timescale representative of AUD. Recent advances
in two-photon microendoscopic calcium imaging allows the longitudinal tracking of the same projection-specific
OFC neurons across months. In this proposal, we will use this cutting-edge technology to study the function of
two OFC circuitsâprojections to dorsal striatum (targeting the densest projection near the border between dorsal
and ventral striatum) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in alcohol related behaviors. These downstream
targets are themselves critical regulators of natural reward or alcohol related behaviors, and these projections
have been demonstrated to have at least some non-overlapping functions in natural reward learning. The central
question of interest in this proposal is whether the encoding adaptations during initial alcohol use in neuronal
ensembles within these OFC circuits predict their subsequent encoding and control of aversion-resistant operant
alcohol seeking or cue-induced reinstatement. In aim 1, we will image alcohol related neuronal activity weekly in
the above OFC outputs while C57/BL6 mice have intermittent access to 20% alcohol in a two-bottle choice
paradigm (IA20%2BC) for 7-8 weeks. We will test the hypothesis that OFCâdorsal striatum, but not OFCâVTA,
neurons strengthen their responses to alcohol, as animals begin preferring alcohol. In aim 2, we will longitudinally
track the same neurons from initial alcohol consumption to subsequent tests of aversion-resistant seeking. Spe-
cifically, we will investigate the role of the above circuits during operant self-administration of alcohol with or
without quinine adulteration, and test the hypothesis that the same OFCâdorsal striatum neurons that encode
initial escalation of alcohol preference also encode and mediate aversion-resistant seeking. In aim 3, we will
longitudinally track neurons from initial alcohol use to subsequent extinction and cue-induced reinstatement of
operant alcohol seeking. We will test the hypothesis that OFCâVTA neuronal activity predicts and mediates
cue-induced reinstatement of operant alcohol seeking. Overall, these studies will yield insights on the extent of
overlap of neuronal encoding of alcohol consumption/preference, aversion-resistant operant seeking, and cue-
induced reinstatement."

The Virtual and Augmented Reality Interaction (VARI) Core is designed to facilitate access and applications for
immersive visual stimulus environments. The core will continue to be directed and managed by Dr. Eelke
Folmer, Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, who specializes in augmented
and virtual reality research. Virtual reality and augmented reality are considered essential to the next
generation of visual and cognitive neuroscience research programs because of the novel and highly improved
opportunities to provide controlled immersive stimulus experiences that allow analysis of perception, cognition,
and behavior in naturalistic visual environments and tasks. The core was established in Phase II and
supported a wide array of projects within and beyond Center-supported faculty including a number of
extramurally funded projects. In Phase III we will continue to enhance and expand the equipment, training and
services required for neuroscience research using virtual reality and augmented reality resources. The core will
offer training and workshops in usage of this equipment, and software development services for developing
virtual reality and augmented reality applications. The technology and services through the core are essential
to efficiently support the growing cluster of visual and cognitive neuroscience faculty at UNR. In Phase III we
will further expand this user base including supporting the Pilot Project Program through the Center, and will
develop the policies and plans to progressively shift funding for the core from the COBRE to user-and grant-
based as well as institutional support."
10830383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human microbiome is a key regulator of host immune function, and growing consensus suggests this
relationship is likely mediated by host interactions with microbial derived small molecules (i.e., metabolites).
Accordingly, microbial derived metabolites have been associated with numerous autoimmune, allergic, and
infectious diseases. However, the host-microbiome circuits that form the molecular basis of these associations
have not been fully characterized, and many microbial derived metabolites have not even been formally
identified. In this proposal, we describe a strategy to identify and functionally characterize microbial derived
metabolites isolated from patients in health and autoimmunity. Our collaborative team will isolate and
characterize novel metabolites from the human microbiome, map these associations to human immune
pathways, and identify the specific host receptors that engage microbial derived metabolites. This proposal will
establish causal relationships between microbial metabolites and human immune system function."
10845716,"This is submission of a competitive renewal of a T32 Institutional Training grant, entitled The Stuart T. Hauser
Research Training Program in Biological and Social Psychiatry. It is ending its 42nd year of a very successful
post-doctoral program for MDs, PhDs, and MD/PhDs. Drs. Hauser and McCarley provided leadership from
its inception and Drs. Shenton, a former trainee, joined as Associate Director in 1994, and became PI in
2008. Dr. Marek Kubicki has now joined as multiple principal investigator. We plan to continue this
intentionally broad, interdisciplinary psychiatry program, which fits well with NIMHâs mission to âtransform our
understanding of mental illnessesâ and âto pave the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.â The rationale is
quite clear â to train the most diverse and outstanding young investigators, and to equip them with the tools
and knowledge needed to succeed in developing their own research careers in biological and/or social
psychiatry, and to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent and possibly cure mental illness. We also follow
NIMHâs mission to âfoster innovative thinkingâ and to ensure âan array of novel scientific perspectivesâ that
are used âto further discovery in the evolving science of brain, behavior, and experience.â The program is
interdisciplinary and has as its cornerstone a weekly 1.5-hour seminar that includes a 3-month grants module
to demystify the grant process. Issues relevant to the ethical and reproducible conduct of research are
discussed as are the development of skills needed for a successful clinical research career. Trainees also
present their work, and invited speakers discuss their research careers. Trainees work with outstanding
preceptors in their chosen field to further develop their expertise, and to ensure the best training possible to
support individual initiated investigator research. There are 38 preceptors, across multiple research areas
and sites, who help to evaluate candidates and serve as mentors. Trainees devote two years to the program
with the goal that they leave with the skills needed to conduct their own independent research or join
established clinical research teams as junior colleagues. In the current grant cycle (4 years), trainees have
received 26 awards during their time in the T32, some examples include: an NIMH K23 Mentored Patient-
Oriented Research Career Development Award, two NIH Clinical Research Loan Repayment awards, five
Society Travel awards, three Best Poster awards at conferences, two Harvard Medical School Livingston
Awards, a Postdoctoral Excellence in Mentoring Award, a Visionary Grant Award from the American
Psychological Foundation, a McLean Hospital Presidential Award, and an Alkemes Pathways Research
Award, among others. Trainees fill out a needs assessment form when they begin and then fill in gaps in
knowledge with relevant courses. We recruit underrepresented minorities and include underrepresented
minorities among our preceptors. Program Advisory Committee, Diversity and Inclusion Committee, and
Fellows evaluate the program each year to help us improve it."

This application is for continuation of the University of Michigan (U-M) Cancer Biostatistics Training
Program (CBTP) that first began in 2002, for training in cancer biostatistics and epidemiology. During its
20 years so far, the program has supported 39 pre-doctoral trainees. 4 trainees who were active but
supported by other funds, for a total of 43 trainees. The need for rigorously trained statistical scientists
and data scientists in biomedical research is massive. This need is continuing to increase with the
increase in the large and complex data sources, including high-throughput molecular technologies,
mobile health, and electronic health record data, as well as the increase in personalized treatment and
prevention approaches in cancer. The overarching goal of CBTP is to increase the work force in cancer
research of a new generation of biostatisticians who are educated not only in the powerful quantitative
methods of modern statistics and data science, but also in the biology and epidemiology of cancer, the
current body of knowledge about the etiology of cancer, its detection, prevention, natural history, and
treatment. CBTP will provide biostatisticians with the requisite scientific knowledge to understand current
issues in cancer research, and training in statistical, data science and epidemiological techniques and
research methodology related to cancer, and thus catalyzing their growth as future cancer researchers.
The specific goals of CBTP are to give students who are obtaining a Ph.D. in Biostatistics or Epidemiology
(i) a solid understanding of cancer biology, (ii) experience and ability to communicate and collaborate
with cancer scientists, (iii) understanding of recent developments in cancer requiring innovative statistical
research and (iv) independent research skills. We request support for five pre-doctoral trainees. The
interdisciplinary program will enable the trainees to obtain knowledge and experience in an area of cancer
research and to participate as a biostatistician in an active research program under the direction of a
mentor in biostatistics and a cancer scientist. The cancer research experience will be facilitated by the
Cancer Data Science Shared Resource at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center. In addition to the biostatistics
courses, the trainees will be required to take courses in cancer epidemiology and biology. The strong
programmatic activities include a specifically designed seminar course on biostatistical issues in cancer,
a weekly lab meeting, a journal club, an annual retreat and orientation, visits to cancer research
laboratories and meetings with invited visitors. The training program will draw students primarily from
the Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. Trainees will typically be supported by this grant for
two years. CBTP is supported by 26 Primary Faculty from the Biostatistics and Epidemiology departments
and 22 Affiliate Faculty from the U-M Rogel Cancer Center."
10846243,"Project Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is used in the treatment of over 50% of cancer patients. Despite major
technological developments, RT is still critically limited by normal tissue toxicity, and curative
treatment is restricted to localized tumors. Pervasive disparities also exist in access to RT in the
USA and in global health due to treatment costs, distance-time barriers, cultural and
infrastructure/technology barriers. These disparities are also fundamentally reflected in the
radiotherapy workforce. There are now emerging transformative RT research areas and initiatives
that can address the toxicity limitations in substantial ways, extend RT to curative treatment of
both local and metastatic disease, and reduce disparities with innovations to reduce treatment
time and cost, enhance patient convenience, and significantly increase survival and quality of life
for patients. Some of the exciting emerging transformative areas of RT research include: Radio-
Immunotherapy, FLASH RT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in RT, smart RT biomaterials, MRI-guided
RT, and new technology and approaches for global health, all with tremendous potential to
engage students/trainees and faculty to advance innovation and reduce disparities. These
emerging areas are exciting and there is great need for concerted and accelerated efforts in
training a diverse next generation of research leaders in these areas. To address this unmet
need, the overall goal and innovation of this project is to establish a premier CaREER (Cancer
Research Education Excellence in Radiotherapy) program to train the next generation of
scientists, technologists and physicians skilled in research in emerging transformative areas of
RT and with innovation focus on addressing RT disparities. The proposed CaREER program will
leverage a strong institutional environment at Johns Hopkins in collaboration with faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Howard University and global health partners to
attract and retain significant number of underrepresented minorities, who will be empowered to
pursue careers and higher education programs involving cancer research. The highest
significance of the CaREER program is expected in the concerted training of diverse next
generation leaders in the newly emerging and transformative research areas of radiotherapy, to
drive innovation in overcoming current RT limitations and reducing disparities."
10846250,"Background: Black women are disproportionately affected by HIV, both nationally, and locally in Miami (a U.S. HIV
epicenter) and 40% are not virally suppressed.1 There is no existing adherence intervention explicitly addressing the
impact of the unique and intersectional adversities (e.g., trauma, discrimination, stigma, gender roles) faced by
BWLWH that are associated with mental health symptoms, medication nonadherence, and viral non-suppression.5-
14,16-21 Evidence-based trauma treatment techniques (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) can be adapted to reduce
trauma symptoms among BWLWH.44-48 However, existing trauma interventions for women with HIV show no effects
on adherence and exclude critical adverse experiences of BWLWH46-48 and interventions promoting gender empower-
ment (e.g., SISTA, WILLOW)53,54 do not address adherence. Our single session adherence intervention (LifeSteps)
has proved fruitful but does not address intersectional adversities and promote resilience.57,58 To address these
issues, the PI successfully completed a NIMH funded K23 that involved developing and pilot testing STEP-AD and the
next logical step is a large scale RCT to assess efficacy. Preliminary work. Striving Towards EmPowerment and
Medication Adherence (STEP-AD) is an individual ten session intervention that integrates CBT for PTSD symptoms,
one LifeSteps session, and strategies for coping (informed by BWLWH & community via qualitative work) with
discrimination/microaggressions, promoting gender empowerment, positive body image, and healthy relationships,
and enhancing resilience in order to decrease trauma symptoms, increase adherence, and ultimately improve viral
suppression. The current R01 proposal will assess the efficacy of STEP-AD in increasing viral suppression and is built
on strong preliminary evidence of acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy via (i) formative qualitative work with BWLWH17
and community stakeholders26 (ii) an open pilot /case series of STEP-AD64 and (iii) a pilot RCT indicating that BWLWH
who completed STEP-AD compared to enhanced treatment as usual had significantly higher adherence at
intervention completion, higher CD4 count, and lower likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis.65 Conceptual Model: This is
informed by Intersectional Theory,61,62,110 Minority Stress27, and the Biopsychosocial Model30,44 and aligned with NIHâs
cross-institutional support for research projects promoting viral suppression among individuals from health disparity
populations.107â109 Research Plan: 250 BWLWH in Miami, FL will be randomized to either the 10-session STEP-AD
intervention or a time and intensity matched control condition. We will (1) determine the impact of STEP-AD compared
to the control condition on viral suppression at 3- and 6- month post intervention (2) determine the impact of STEP-AD
on secondary outcomes of sustained viral suppression at -9 and -12 months, and ART adherence, PTSD symptoms,
and engagement in care compared to the control group at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12- months and (3) assess potential
mediators (e.g., adherence, mental health, engagement in care) and moderators (i.e., who this intervention works best
for). Potential Impact: Assessing the efficacy of STEP-AD may equip us with an evidence-based adherence
intervention to improve viral suppression among BWLWH (a priority population) and reach the UNâs 95-95-95 goal.109"
10848379,"Gammaherpesviruses establish life-long infections in >95% of adults worldwide and are associated with B
cell lymphomas. Prevention of gammaherpesvirus-driven lymphomas is currently impossible due to
absence of vaccines, curative antivirals, and defined risk factors for lymphomagenesis. All
gammaherpesviruses encode a protein kinase, a key determinant of chronic infection and pathogenesis.
This grant application aims to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying physiologically
relevant functions of gammaherpesvirus protein kinases during chronic infection of an intact host. Based on
our published and preliminary findings, the proposed studies test the working model that macrophage-
intrinsic IFN signaling is antagonized by an enzymatically active viral protein kinase to promote the passage
of the virus from myeloid to B cell compartment. Once viral access to B cells is gained, viral kinase
supports latent viral gene expression and engages host mechanisms to drive B cell differentiation and
establishment of chronic infection. Successful completion of the proposed studies will define molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying functions of the conserved gammaherpesvirus protein kinase during chronic
infection of an intact natural host. Such mechanisms are likely to operate during viral lymphomagenesis
and may present novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of gammaherpesvirus-driven lymphomas."
10848381,"The long-term goal of our research is to understand how the properties of Cav channels shape their
neural functions. The objective of this competing renewal application is to define the Cav1-dependent
signaling pathways that shape the development and plasticity of the photoreceptor (PR) synapse. Among
the major Cav1 subtypes expressed in the retina, Cav1.4 is uniquely critical for PR synaptogenesis. How
Cav1.4 contributes to this process remains a mysteryâa major challenge being that available animal
models do not distinguish between the roles of Cav1.4 as a source of Ca2+ ions and as a scaffold for
synaptogenic proteins. To overcome this hurdle, we generated a knock-in mouse strain expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Cav1.4. While the molecular organization of PR synapses is largely spared in
these mice, the maturation of synaptic ribbons and invagination of postsynaptic neurites into PR terminals
is disrupted. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that the clinical variability associated with CSNB2
could arise from heterogeneous impacts of the mutations on the organization, development, and mature
function of the PR synapse. Our central hypothesis is that Cav1.4 mediates Ca2+ signaling pathways that
promote the maturation of synaptic ribbons and the postsynaptic architecture of PR synapses via
mechanisms that are disrupted in CSNB2. We will test this hypothesis with the following Aims: (1) Elucidate
the mechanism whereby Cav1.4 Ca2+ signals regulate the maturation and plasticity of synaptic ribbons (2) Define
the role of Cav1 Ca2+ signals in enabling the postsynaptic wiring of PR synapses (3) Determine the impact of
pathological variants of human Cav1.4 channels on PR synapse structure and function. The overall impact of our
research will be knowledge of: (a) the multi-faceted roles of Cav channels at a synapse that is crucial for vision,
and (b) how dysregulation specifically of Cav1.4 could lead to heterogeneous forms of vision impairment. More
broadly, our research is expected to provide insights into mechanisms that enable the proper synaptic
connectivity in the retinaâa requirement for the successful restoration of vision through cell transplantation
therapies."
10851728,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at exceptionally high risk of frequent emergency department
(ED) and hospital use, poor functional outcomes, and increased morbidity and mortality from poorly managed
chronic health conditions and complex social needs. Significant deficiencies in continuity of care and poor
communication between PEH and health and social services providers contribute to these bleak long-term
outcomes. Evidence-based interventions of particular promise for reducing ED and hospital utilization and
improving health outcomes and meeting social needs involve: 1) providing care in the community to overcome
barriers including transportation and fear of stigmatization; 2) coordination of care transitions following ED or
hospital discharge to improve access to needed community supports and reduce the risk of readmission; and
3) using mHealth technology to link PEH with appropriate community-based health and social services. This
project will build on evidence from two feasibility studies in order to integrate and test a mHealth intervention,
comprised of global positioning system technology and text messaging components, into a community setting
to connect PEH with a community-based case manager and healthcare and social services. Our hypothesis is
that integrating the mHealth intervention into an established, trusted navigation center for PEH will mitigate
barriers to care and gaps in the care continuum resulting in decreased ED and hospital use and improved
health outcomes and attainment of social needs. Our specific aims are to: 1) refine the existing mHealth
intervention and implementation strategy using a community-based participatory research approach; 2)
conduct a stratified RCT to compare a mHealth intervention with usual care community-based case
management to examine the impact on healthcare utilization (primary outcome), medication adherence, social
support, psychological distress and social needs attainment (secondary outcomes) in PEH; and 3) identify and
understand factors from PEH and stakeholder perspectives that impact sustainability of the mHealth
intervention. The project will be conducted in four phases. During phase one, we will refine the intervention
(Aim 1) by eliciting feedback from PEH, key informants, and our community advisory board before conducting
a usability test of the refined mHealth intervention. Phase two will consist of the RCT (Aim 2) to compare the
efficacy of the mHealth intervention to a usual care control group. Phase three will identify factors to facilitate
sustainability of the mHealth intervention (Aim 3) using stakeholder interviews. Phase four will consist of data
analysis, triangulation of findings, and dissemination. This study is significant and innovative for several
reasons: targets an AHRQ understudied group with complex needs and use of high cost services at a critical
transition point; is based in a community-based navigation center instead of a traditional health or social
services setting; and recognizes the need for end-user engagement in design."

Memory-based cognition depends on both the ability to remember specific details of individual experiences
(specificity) and the ability to combine information across experiences to derive new knowledge
(generalization). It is well established that the hippocampus rapidly encodes specific events, but the
mechanisms of memory generalization are less clear. Traditionally, a division of labor has been postulated
between the hippocampus, learning rapidly to support specificity, and other memory systems, learning slowly
and incrementally to support generalization. More recent research has also shown a role of the hippocampus
in rapid generalization, where new knowledge is derived by combining information across a small number of
events. It is currently debated whether the hippocampal contribution to generalization is fully explainable by its
role in storing specific experiences or whether the hippocampus integrates information across experiences to
form generalized knowledge. Furthermore, it is unclear whether generalization learning proceeds at the
expense of memory for specific details or whether multiple types of memory representations form and co-exist
to serve multiple forms of cognition. The current project tests the hypotheses that representations at distinct
levels of specificity form in parallel along the long axis of the hippocampus through interactions with distinct
cortical regions. More anterior generalized representations inform generalization. More posterior specific
representations support memory specificity but can also inform generalization decisions under circumstances
when generalized representations have not been formed. To test these hypotheses, the proposed studies use
functional MRI in humans during concept-learning tasks in which both specificity and generalization learning is
indexed using (1) behavioral methods, (2) cognitive modeling and model-based fMRI, and (3) neural pattern
similarity analyses. The studies will determine the mechanism(s) of memory generalization and how it relates
to memory for specific events, the degree to which the formation of distinct representation is under strategic
control, and the hippocampal-cortical interactions that contribute to specificity and generalization learning. The
results will reveal whether specificity and generalization are two behavioral expressions supported by a single
neural representation, a single neural system that can form different types of memory representations under
different task demands, or distinct neural systems that form distinct representations. The results will inform
current theories of memory function and help reconcile a decades-long debate regarding the nature of concept
representations. The basic science knowledge obtained here will help shed light on the memory and
generalization mechanisms that may go awry in many neuropsychiatric disorders."

10851734,"I'm a clinical psychologist and researcher, Penn Memory Center Scholar, and instructor in the Division of
Geriatric Medicine at University of Pennsylvania. I joined the Penn Project on Precision Medicine for the Brain
(P3MB) in late 2015 to study the promising advances being made in the diagnosis and treatment Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Researchers posit a stage of AD called âpreclinical AD,â defined as a condition in which
individuals are cognitively unimpaired but have biomarker evidence of AD. In the future, persons with
preclinical AD will be prescribed therapies and other interventions to delay or slow the disease progression. I
study the experiences of AD research participants across the continuum of cognitive decline from unimpaired
to moderately cognitively impaired in order to understand what types of psychological care may be needed to
support the translation of this model of AD dementia prevention into routine practice. I propose to study two
features central to the experience of living with preclinical AD: Subjective Cognitive Complaints (SCCs) and
Future Time Perspective (FTP).
 To do this, I will examine how a person's knowledge of their AD biomarker result, specifically an
amyloid PET scan result, affects their SCCs and FTP, b) interacts with reports of SCCs and measures of AD
pathology, and c) how longitudinal changes in FTP affect decision-making. Findings from this study will show
how SCCs and FTP behave in the preclinical AD experience. This is important to know, as clinicians and
researchers can measure them, and they can affect how people assess their wellbeing and make decisions
such as whether or not to take medication or participate in other health-related interventions. SCCs
currently
(stage

are
used to classify stage 2 of preclinical AD, which is a distinct transitional stage between asymptomatic
1) and mildly impaired (stage 3). FTP predicts n
decision-making, such as health and financial planning behaviors, but these associations have not
studied in individuals with preclinical AD. The studies that propose will
FTP is a measure of one's sense of time remaining. a
I inform how FTP is affected by
learning an AD biomarker result and how this impacts decision-making. Discovering how SCCs and FTP
behave in the preclinical AD experience will assure successful translation of Preclinical AD and the model of
prevention in AD that it will accompany from research into practice, which is my long-term goal.
 To accomplish my overall objective, I propose a 5-year K award to support (i) training to develop as a
PI and to develop knowledge of AD biomarkers, research methods, and clinical care, and (ii) building a
research program that will develop an evidenced-based model to guide psychological care in Preclinical AD. I
have a multidisciplinary team of mentors selected for their mentoring track record and expertise in AD imaging
biomarkers, disclosure of AD biomarker results, and decision-making. This plan will give me the skills and
preliminary data I need to compete for R01 funding and to succeed as an independent clinician-scientist."

 It is increasingly recognized that a diverse workforce is important to academic productivity. However,
members of ethnic minority groups are currently underrepresented in academia. This underrepresentation in
academia has a direct effect on health disparities research, including studies related to nutrition, obesity,
and/or diabetes. Underrepresented minority (URM) scientists tend to engage in research that addresses issues
relevant to ethnic minority groups. In order for URM scientists to make a sustained impact on issues relevant to
the National Institute for Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), they must be able to obtain
federal grant funding. The Louisiana Center for Advancing Underrepresented Scientists Careers in Health,
Nutrition, Obesity, and Disparities Research (LAUNCHED) will

competing
develop a comprehensive program of
mentoring, training, and career development to increase the success rate of URM scientists
for federal research funding.The LAUNCHED proposal is a collaboration among several institutions
with existing working relationships. The project will be led by investigators from Pennington Biomedical
Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA, along with Tulane University, Louisiana State University (LSU) A&M,
LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). The program will also involve two Historically Black
Colleges and Universities including Xavier University of Louisiana, and Southern University. Two cohorts of
URM scientists (cohort members) will be recruited, and will include 10-20 mentees who will each spend 2
years in the program. Pennington Biomedical is home to several obesity and diabetes related center grants,
which will work synergistically with the LAUNCHED program to provide a comprehensive training program for
the cohort members. The center grant infrastructure will allow the LAUNCHED program to provide cohort
members with mentorship, grant writing opportunities, didactic instruction in nutrition and diabetes, and a Pilot
and Feasibility program. There will also be several components that are tailored to the specific needs of URM
scientists. The LAUNCHED program will provide didactics on diabetes, obesity, and nutrition as it relates to
health disparities. Mentors will be educated on barriers facing URM scientists and will be provided with specific
skills for working effectively with URM scientists. Senior URM scientists will interact with cohort members in
order to serve as role models and share strategies for academic success. Career coaching will be delivered by
professional coaches with experience working with URM scientists. In addition, the LAUNCHED program has
expertise in mentoring and career coaching organization to work successfully with ethnic minority women.
Ultimately, the LAUNCHED program will provide a comprehensive and data-driven training program that will
prepare URM scientists to successfully compete for NIH grant funding."

As part of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, the NIMH seeks to improve measures of neuronal
and psychological targets for use in intervention research. RDoC tools must precisely measure cognitive and
neuronal systems to produce reliable findings. Unfortunately, many RDoC tasks have not been
psychometrically evaluated, nor refined, and are liable to confounds that can lead to inaccurate claims of
differential deficit, weakened effect size, and contradictory brain imaging findings. As highlighted by FOA PAR-
18-930, there is a critical need for modern psychometric methods and tools designed to support cognitive and
clinical neuroscience research. This project responds to this FOA by evaluating and refining a methodology
designed to administer statistically robust variants of RDoC tasks, especially in the context of brain imaging.
We have created a quantitative methodology designed to administer computerized adaptive tests (CATs) in the
context of cognitive and clinical neuroscience research. CATs manipulate stimulus properties in real time in
order to improve measurement precision, avoid ceiling and floor effects, and maximize effect size, even for
individuals and groups with highly discrepant levels of cognitive functioning. CATs also perform psychometric
adjustments to cognitive tasks so that brain functioning abnormalities can be interpreted independent of
performance deficits. In pilot work, we have used this approach with an RDoC working memory task, the N-
back, to show that the methodology improves the reliability of both cognitive and brain imaging data. We will
evaluate the generalizability and impact of adaptive testing, beyond the N-back task, for use in translational
and experimental testing. Patients with schizophrenia and controls will be administered both adaptive and non-
adaptive versions of four RDoC paradigms used to assess working memory: delayed match-to-sample,
Sternberg, self-ordered pointing, and N-back. Additionally, participants will be administered the 5-Choice
Continuous Performance Task and Probabilistic Learning Task, translational measures of control and learning
respectively. Both groups will undergo functional neuroimaging and respond to adaptive versions of these
tasks. The specific aims are to: (1) Determine whether adaptive testing improves the precision and effect size
estimates of performance differences produced by RDoC tasks; and (2) Determine whether adaptive testing
improves the reliability and effect size estimates of brain activation differences produced by RDoC tasks. While
these aims are designed to evaluate a methodology, and to address critical concerns related to the use of
RDoC working memory tasks as neural probes, mediators, and outcomes in psychosis research, results also
have broad implications across populations, brain regions and networks, and cognitive domains. By addressing
concerns of poor reliability, weak effect size, and brain activation confounds, this project will show that adaptive
testing broadly improves cognitive neuroscience tasks. To facilitate rapid deployment of adaptive RDoC tasks,
we will develop freely available versions of the paradigms used and a companion R package âcatCogâ."

Background The non-invasive diagnosing of bladder cancer in patients with hematuria, the most common
clinical presentation of bladder cancer, or in subjects with a history of bladder cancer on tumor surveillance
remains a challenge, and as such, these patients require invasive testing. Current urine-based assays are not
robust and therefore cannot be used to ârule outâ patients who do not require these invasive testing.
Previously, we a) identified a bladder cancer-associated diagnostic protein âfingerprintâ comprised of 10
biomarkers, b) developed a multiplex immunoassay to query these 10 biomarkers in voided urine samples and
c) performed analytical validation of the multiplex immunoassay. Using the multiplex immunoassay, we have
generated encouraging preliminary data in 326 subjects (46 cancer) noting a sensitivity and specificity of 93%.
Thus, for the first time, we possess an accurate assay that can be used to ârule outâ patients who do not require
invasive testing. Furthermore, early detection (i.e., detection prior to clinical manifestation) is an important goal
for patients at risk for bladder cancer. At presentation, more than 70% of bladder cancer cases are non-
muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), whilst the remaining 30% are muscle invasive bladder cancer
(MIBC) or metastatic. When detected early (i.e., NMIBC), the 5-year survival rate is approximately 94%,
compared to a 5-year survival rate of ~50% when the disease is detected as muscle invasive bladder cancer
(MIBC), and <20% when the disease is metastatic. However, to date, no early detection assay is available. In a
small cohort of 20 bladder cancer patients and 20 matched controls from our ongoing R01 studies, we have
noted an elevation in our bladder cancer-associated diagnostic protein âfingerprintâ as early as 18 months prior
to the clinical diagnosis of bladder cancer and an actual positive multiplex immunoassay in all bladder cancer
patients 12 months prior to the clinical diagnosis of bladder cancer. Hypothesis: A bladder cancer-associated
diagnostic protein âfingerprintâ exists that can be leveraged to indicate the presence of bladder cancer in non-
invasively obtained urine samples not only at the time of diagnosis, but prior to the clinical presentation and
diagnosis of bladder cancer. Specific Aims: 1) To validate the multiplex immunoassay for bladder cancer
detection in a large, nested case-control study (n=800) and 2) To evaluate the multiplex immunoassay for early
detection in a large, nested case-control study (n=600). Significance This research will open the door for
improving on the non-invasive methods for detecting bladder cancer and as such it will have a marked
impact on patient care. Methodology Previously, our group has discovered and performed early validation of
bladder cancer-associated diagnostic proteinâ fingerprintâ with extremely encouraging results. In the current
proposal, we now seek to test the multiplex immunoassay in two large, nested case control studies, which
would allow us to develop and lockdown In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay (IVDMIA) algorithms for
two distinct indications listed in the aims. Such algorithms can be deployed in future prospective studies.
Expected Results There exists an unmet clinical need for reliable biomarkers a) to ârule outâ which patients
with hematuria or on bladder cancer surveillance do not require further evaluation and b) to early detect
bladder cancer when its more treatable with improved survival rates. Implementation of such a robust assay
could have a profound impact leading to improved care and reduced healthcare costs."

 Polycyclic terpenoid natural products are endowed with a broad range of medicinally relevant biological
activities. Taxol and artemisinin are two premier examples of life-saving terpenoids; the former is used clinically
to treat several different cancers, while the latter is a critical antimalarial agent used worldwide. Chemical
synthesis approaches to natural products provide opportunities to make compounds that might be scarcely
available from nature, to generate analogues that are only available by total synthesis, and to make probe
molecules for increased understanding of the underlying biology. A balance of innovative strategy and new
chemical methodology promises efficient syntheses that can serve to answer important biological questions
that often can only be probed with small molecules.
 As part of our laboratoryâs long-term goal to enhance efficiency in the synthesis of complex natural
products to facilitate important studies in biology, the objective of the proposed research program is to develop
concise and creative synthesis designs and empowering methodological advances to permit access to many
bioactive diterpenoid natural products. The rationale for this work is that synthetic chemistry is critical to the
development of natural product âhit moleculesâ into legitimate preclinical lead compounds by analogue
production, by identification of structure-activity relationships, by the synthesis of chemical probe molecules for
mechanism of action studies, and more. An efficient total synthesis of targeted natural products provides a
platform from which to address each of these key areas of research.
 The proposed research is significant because chemical synthesis will provide access to a broad range of
biologically important secondary metabolites and analogues with which to interrogate key processes; at the
same time, the underlying synthesis designs and methodologies will lead to vertical advancement of the field of
organic chemistry. These contributions are innovative by virtue of the chemistry-driven, multi-faceted
investigations into the biological activity of diterpenoids with immunosuppressive, antiviral, antibiotic, and
neurological activity; the development of new stereocontrolled polyene cyclization strategies to access
polycyclic diterpenoid natural products; and the elaboration of new radical bicyclization strategies to make
complex architectures relevant to bioactive natural products."

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) are major
challenges in prostate cancer (PCa) therapy. Activation of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway is the main
mechanism underlying CRPC progression. Development of NEPC is also associated with castration
resistance, and one of known drivers of NEPC is N-Myc oncoprotein. We have found that the histone
demethylase JMJD1A is upregulated in CRPC and NEPC tissues; JMJD1A supports growth of CRPC cells by
promoting AR activity and c-Myc levels, while it supports NEPC cell growth by increasing N-Myc levels.
However, selective inhibitors of JMJD1A are not yet available.
 We have identified a new pathway that regulates JMJD1A stability and chromatin recruitment. Our
preliminary data shows that JMJD1A is targeted for ubiquitination and consequent degradation by the ubiquitin
ligase STUB1, whereas JMJD1A acetylated by acetyltransferase p300 escapes STUB-induced degradation.
We observed elevation of JMJD1A acetylation levels in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cells or in a VCaP CRPC
model; higher levels of JMJD1A acetylation were associated with more rapid recurrence of prostate cancer
after neoadjuvant hormone therapy, indicating a key role for JMJD1A acetylation in JMJD1A stability and
CRPC progression. We have evidence that stability of acetylated JMJD1A requires BET family protein BRD4,
which binds acetylated lysine and serves as promising targets for CRPC therapy. Interestingly, targeting
JMJD1A acetylation using a p300 inhibitor or a BET inhibitor induces JMJD1A degradation and inhibits CRPC
or NEPC cell growth in vitro.
 We will test the hypothesis that JMJD1A modifications by ubiquitination and acetylation regulate
JMJD1A activity and may be targeted as potential CRPC and NEPC therapy. Aim 1 characterizes biochemical
mechanisms of JMJD1A acetylation in regulating JMJD1A recruitment to AR targets via BRD4. Aim 2 will
determine global regulation of AR target genes in CRPC cells upon manipulation of the STUB1-JMJD1A axis
or JMJD1A acetylation using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq studies. Aim 3 will evaluate growth of CRPC or NEPC
xenografts following manipulation of the STUB1-JMJD1A axis or JMJD1A acetylation, or following treatment
with a p300 inhibitor or a BET inhibitor. Finally, in Aim 4, we will evaluate effect of JMJD1A knockout in the
progression and castration sensitivity of PTEN or Hi-Myc PCa models. We will also perform staining for
acetylated JMJD1A and STUB1 in a large set of PCa tissue microarrays (TMAs) to evaluate how their
expression correlates with JMJD1A levels, various types of prostate cancer and their clinical relevance. In
summary, our proposed studies could identify novel mechanisms, targets and strategies useful as potential
therapy for CRPC and NEPC."

The widespread adoption of genome-scale methods in biomedical research has resulted in biology now being
a big data discipline that requires training in modern machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Formal
instruction in both biology and AI is critical for PhD trainees pursuing careers in a broad range of academic and
non-academic fields. The mission of the Quantitative Biological Systems Training (QBIST) program is to
empower biomedical researchers to choose confidently amongst a diversity of careers through active training
and experiential learning in robust and transferable quantitative and leadership skills. The second award period
of the QBIST program will focus on 3 primary objectives. Objective 1: Consolidate training opportunities to
develop and apply advanced computational and data science skills to complex biomedical research
questions. We will modify the QBIST curriculum to respond to the evolving demands of quantitative training to
ensure training in cutting edge methods. Objective 2: Enhance the value of mechanisms for exploring
biomedical career paths outside the traditional academic trajectory. QBIST trainees will continue to
explore post-graduate career options through participation in an internship program with non-academic
organizations. In addition, we will provide opportunities to participate in established entrepreneurial and
multi-dimensional team-building programs at NYU to expand training options. We will also increase the value
of these experiences by providing opportunities for self-reflection. Objective 3. Provide trainees with
opportunities to develop leadership skills through mentoring experience. To enable trainees to gain
critical leadership and mentoring skills in the context of supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion, trainees will
assume mentorship roles in the NYU Biology Summer Undergraduate Research Program. Importantly, we will
modify the existing QBIST curriculum so as to not increase trainee workload to ensure we meet our overall
objective of decreasing time to graduation while maintaining a high PhD graduation rate. The second
award period of the QBIST program will include 17 faculty members at all career stages with a demonstrated
track record of mentoring and commitment to the goals of the QBIST program. To accommodate the expanded
aims of the QBIST program we will select 4 students per year who will be appointed for two years during the
second and third years of their PhD training. Students will be selected by the QBIST program executive
committee on the basis of a written application detailing training goals and long-term career objectives that
demonstrate alignment with the QBIST program. To assess the continued effectiveness of the QBIST program,
we will use annual surveys completed each year by all trainees and quantify trainee research and career
outcomes. All data and analyses will be made publically available on the QBIST web portal. Achieving the
QBIST program objectives will serve to enhance the entire NYU Department of Biology PhD program and
provide insights and resources that will inform PhD training in biomedical institutions throughout the USA."

Kean University is a minority-serving institution with over 16,000 students. The Kean School of Integrative
Science and Technology (IST) serves roughly 2,100 students, 55% from groups underrepresented in the
sciences. The IST offers undergraduate honors programs in science and provides an interdisciplinary lens
recognizing the convergence of scientific traditions across key fields of study. It is an ideal home for the proposed
U-RISE program, the Kean University U-RISE Trainee Pathway (KUTP).
The KUTP will have a significant impact on Keanâs ability to train undergraduates in research excellence, unite
them in a diverse cohort to build the social capital underlying STEM identity, and prepare them for the next phase
of the biomedical research career pathway. KUTP recruitment will draw upon the ISTâs extraordinary Group
Summer Scholars Research Program for high-school students, a STEM Push Program, as well as Keanâs Office
of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. KUTP will ultimately serve a steady-state total of 20 fellows across the fields
of biology, biomedicine, biotechnology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and integrated science, for
a total of 54 fellows over the five-year program. Fellows will receive financial support, intensive triad mentoring,
and rigorous academic and research-skills training. The KUTP will expand on the ISTâs existing strengths by
adding advanced training in the responsible conduct of research and new cohort activities to increase the sense
of belonging, self-efficacy, and STEM identity of undergraduates. KUTP fellows will participate in more advanced,
independent research projects and professional development activities fostered by Kean faculty, collaborators
at the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (with members from Amherst, Boston
University, MIT, Penn State, Rutgers, MIT, UNH, UMass, and other regional schools), and industry professionals
at the Institute for Life Science Entrepreneurship (ILSE), a regional NYC/NJ metro area incubator, accelerator,
and research institute located on the Kean campus. Drawing on Keanâs extensive expertise in the training of
underrepresented minorities, the KUTP incorporates data-driven mechanisms to create sustainable
programmatic experiences and establish a model that can be applied more broadly at Kean and other institutions.
Program objectives are to increase recruitment, diversity, retention, and persistence for biomedical and related
majors at Kean, with 100% of KUTP fellows graduating and 30% and 15% of graduating KUTP fellows entering
MS-level and PhD-level programs, respectively, in biomedical and related fields within three years of graduation.
Kean will sustain the KUTP beyond the grant period and disseminate its results to other institutions."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder featuring progressive cognitive,
functional, and behavioral defects. Currently, more than 5.6 million Americans suffer from AD, and this number
is projected to increase to 15.0 million by 2060. Despite several clinical interventions have been approved for
treatment of AD, unfortunately they have demonstrated only modest effects in modifying the clinical symptoms
for relatively short periods with none showing a clear therapeutic effect on disease progression. The lack of a
clear understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and progression of AD is a significant barrier
to the development of innovative and effective therapies. The goal of this proposal is to address this gap by
defining the role of senescence in brain aging and AD pathogenesis. My lab and those of others have shown
that the number of senescent cells was markedly increased in the brain of AD patients and that the removal of
senescent cells can prevent cognitive declines and attenuate AD pathology in preclinical animal models. These
results suggest a critical role for senescent cells in AD pathogenesis and treatment. Based on evidence
provided by us and others that 1) oxidative stress is a pathological feature of AD, and 2) increased numbers of
senescent astrocytes have been identified in the brain of AD patients, we hypothesize that aging-associated
oxidative stress leads to the accumulation of senescent cells in the brain, which in turn promote the
pathogenesis and progression of AD via exacerbating amyloid beta (AÎ²)-induced neurotoxicity and tau
pathology. Therefore, pharmacological elimination of senescent cells can be exploited as a new strategy for
AD prevention and treatment. There Specific Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: in Aim 1 we will
determine if there is greater cell type-specific senescence burden in AD as compared to healthy aging brains,
in Aim 2 we will elucidate the mechanisms by which senescent cells influence AD pathogenesis and
progression, and in Aim 3 we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of selective senolytic agents to prevent and
mitigate AD progression and cognitive declines. Successful completion of this project will provide novel insights
into the mechanisms by which senescent cells affect brain aging and drive the pathogenesis of AD. More
importantly, we anticipate that outcomes of this study will substantially facilitate the development of new and
more efficacious strategies for AD prevention and treatment."

in aging and ADRD research and related healthcare fields, including effective communication and support
throughout graduate/professional school applications.
The GATORAADE program aims to bridge representation gaps and empower a diverse workforce in brain aging
and ADRD fields. By combining research experiences, academic instruction, and career development support
and coaching, GATORAADE trainees will be equipped with foundational knowledge and meaningful skills to
pursue graduate or clinical training programs. Retaining these diverse individuals will contribute to reduce health
disparities and to improve our chances of combatting aging related neurological conditions."

We propose renewal of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Cancer Prevention and Control Training
Program T32 training grant. Our training program is the only one in the Deep South (Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina). The Deep South has high cancer mortality rates and an increased
prevalence of multiple chronic diseases, including obesity and diabetes, which are risk factors for cancer that
disproportionately affect African Americans. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) recruit well-qualified pre- and
postdoctoral Fellows, especially those from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds, who aspire to
become independent cancer prevention and control researchers and who will address the complex health care
challenges in the Deep South; (2) train pre- and postdoctoral Fellows in cancer prevention and control research,
transdisciplinary research methods, and research ethics while developing their professional, relational, and
leadership skills; (3) leverage UABâs rich training environment to provide collaboration opportunities within the
OâNeal Comprehensive Cancer Center Cancer Control and Population Science Program; and (4) evaluate and
enhance how well the training program meets the needs of our Fellows and expands the pipeline of future cancer
prevention and control scientists. Our training program has three components: mentoring, experiential
learning, and coursework. Fellows will receive individualized support from a dual-mentor team selected from
our pool of 49 faculty mentors, selected for their prior successful mentoring experience and strong research track
records. Experiential learning activities will center primarily on immersion in the laboratories of Fellowsâ
primary mentors. All Fellows will write a grant application and design and conduct their own research
study, leveraging the numerous collaborative opportunities within the OâNeal Comprehensive Cancer Center
and UABâs Cancer Control and Population Sciences program. Fellows will disseminate their work via peer-
reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences. Five required courses cover cancer
prevention and control topics, transdisciplinary research, research ethics, grant writing, diversity/equity/inclusion,
and one elective topic. New curricular innovations introduce transdisciplinary research, an approach to
creating new knowledge that builds upon standard team science methodologies via integrating new perspectives
provided by partners from not only academia, but also industry, government or community groups. To foster
transdisciplinary work, our training curriculum includes a new annual transdisciplinary science workshop and a
mini-sabbatical. Over the last 35 years, we have trained 171 cancer prevention and control scientists, 82.5%

The Martinos Center at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) boasts a dynamic simultaneous magnetic
resonance and positron emission tomography (MR-PET) imaging program. This program supports a substantial
community of NIH-funded investigators, facilitates clinical trials, and offers crucial shared resources to the
Institute for Innovation in Imaging (i3) and Interdepartmental Brain Center (IBC) at MGH. In 2010, an 11 MeV
medical cyclotron was installed at MGH's Charlestown campus to bolster radiochemistry and translational
radiotracer development and manufacturing. This cyclotron primarily produces short-lived imaging isotopes using
carbon-11 and fluorine-18. The Siemens Eclipse HP cyclotron infrastructure lies at the heart of the research
imaging enterprise. After 13 years of service, a reinvestment is necessary to ensure continued access to PET
radioisotopes for the MGH Charlestown campus. Instead of replacing the Siemens Eclipse HP, which would
result in significant operational disruption and research downtime, we propose a series of upgrades extending
the cyclotron's lifespan by 10-15 years. These upgrades will stabilize maintenance-related operational elements,
modernize the control software, and expand radiotracer production capacity. Furthermore, the upgrades will
introduce new solid target capabilities to support the user community currently sourcing and shipping copper-64
from over a thousand miles away, thus establishing a Boston-wide source for the radioisotope. A current snapshot
reveals 9 major and 19 minor users that will be positively impacted through funding this shared instrument grant
application and the subsequent upgrades, but we also note that more than 60 human study protocols (3860
human imaging experiments) and more than 30 preclinical studies (675 non-human primate and >5000 rodent
experiments) have relied on the cyclotron to date. With the volume of scanning growing, this SIG funding will
support an extraordinarily strong scientific community. Specifically, we propose upgrading the RF system,
software and control computers, vacuum system, and adding a solid target to one of the beam lines. This cost-
effective, practical plan will ensure that NIH-funded investigators maintain a reliable supply of PET radioisotopes
and radiotracers essential for their research."

The Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology (qCMB) Training Program provides comprehensive and flexible training in
quantitative approaches in order to facilitate transdisciplinary and collaborative research in the broad field of Cell &
Molecular Biology. The Program produces outstanding graduates with the skills to meet the computational and
professional demands of modern life science research. The objectives include to produce more graduates able to apply
computational approaches to solve biological problems, provide an accessible curriculum for training in this area,
encourage and support transdisciplinary collaborations, offer training and professional development opportunities to
better prepare students for the workforce, and facilitate completion by fostering a supportive and inclusive
environment. The qCMB program is designed to support students engaging in collaborative research projects requiring
the generation and analysis of large biological datasets, particularly those generated through sequencing, imaging and
flow cytometry. We introduce our earlyâstage trainees to coding and its applications through a gateway course led by a
supportive community of preceptors and more experienced trainees. As students build confidence, a plethora of
elective computational courses support their individual research interests by expanding their quantitative skillsets.
Symposia, workshops and group meetings will enhance and support collaboration between program members and
between the qCMB program and other campus communities. Preceptors will hone their mentoring skills and learn
strategies to ensure mentees engage in reproducible research through qCMB resources and trainings. qCMB graduates
are prepared to enter the workforce by engaging in career management and leadership training and through
opportunities such as internships and guided mentor training. Throughout their PhD studies, qCMB trainees experience
an inclusive, welcoming and safe environment within a community that values their contributions, celebrates their
successes and guides them through the challenges of graduate school. The effectiveness of training will be
demonstrated through evaluations and by following the career trajectories of our graduates. Diverse trainees (6 per
year) are selected through a holistic process from among the pool of applicants to the CMB program and supported as
teaching assistants for the first semester while rotating through preceptor labs. Each will transition to fellowship after
one semester and will continue with rotations until joining a preceptor lab in Apr/May of the first year. After two years
on the award, trainees will transition to the preceptor's research grant or other fellowship for stipend support. The
award will support a total of 40 trainees who will transition to positions in academia, or industry that require data
analysis, collaboration and research experience."

Wildfire smoke increasingly contributes to ambient air pollution and more specifically PM2.5 and has been
associated with increased respiratory virus morbidity and mortality. We have previously shown that exposure of
human volunteers to woodsmoke (WS) significantly modifies acute antiviral host defense responses to influenza.
Similarly, we have preliminary evidence indicating that simulation of wildfire smoke affects viral infections in
human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) in vitro. Since concurrent exposures to wildfires and respiratory viruses
will likely increase worldwide due to climate change, understanding the clinical manifestation, cellular
mechanisms, and chemical components causing modified antiviral defense presents an important research gap
critical to public health. We have already demonstrated that computational modeling approaches can establish
the presence of harmful chemicals in different wildfire smoke conditions as drivers of toxicity. Integrating these
translational research and computational analysis models, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that wildfire
smoke affects multiple steps of antiviral defense pathways in the respiratory mucosa and that chemical
signatures within the complex pollutant mixtures can be associated as drivers of biological responses. Specific
Aim 1 will use in vitro exposure and infection of HNECs to determine the mechanisms of wildfire smoke-induced
changes in antiviral defense function and identify the chemical signatures mediating these responses. HNECs
will be exposed to a variety of different emission mixtures simulating different wildfire scenarios. Changes in viral
infection and multi-omic assessment of immune and inflammatory responses will be assessed. Using
computational modeling, chemical and molecular signatures driving the responses in HNECs in vitro will be
determined. Specific Aim 2 will determine the effects of WS exposures and influenza infection on nasal immunity
in humans in vivo, using inoculation with the live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine as a model to elicit
antiviral defense responses in the respiratory mucosa. Volunteers will be randomized for exposures to
WS/Filtered Air followed by inoculation with LAIV/Placebo. Using multi-omic platforms, samples will be analyzed
for immune biomarkers, as well as markers of viral replication and sinonasal symptoms, followed by
computational analysis associating biomarkers with infection outcomes. This application aims to
comprehensively assess the impact of wildfires on respiratory mucosal antiviral defenses by examining viral
entry and replication, antibody production, as well as mucosal metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics
mediating cellular defenses. The parallel investigations of in vitro (SA1) and clinical (SA2) outcomes will yield
both immediate translational impact and in-depth mechanistic insights into the effects of wildfires on respiratory
antiviral defenses. Ultimately, this application will elucidate the mechanisms and chemical signatures through
which wildfire exposures disrupt respiratory innate immune defenses and correlate these changes with
alterations of nasal mucosal host defense functions in humans in vivo."

Humans rely on sweating to remove excess heat from the body, making the eccrine sweat gland an
indispensable component of the human thermoregulatory system and an organ essential for human survival.
During development, epidermal progenitors within the eccrine placode differentiate into multiple specialized cell
types that are ultimately partitioned into specialized, functional compartments. A lack of understanding of how
the progressive differentiation of the eccrine anlage occurs has stalled efforts to regenerate these critical skin
appendages for the repair of traumatic skin injuries, leaving affected patients with potentially life-threatening
deficits in thermoregulation. We have recently identified a novel eccrine dermal population, the Engrailed 1-
dependent eccrine niche (EDEN), that is required for eccrine gland formation in mice, and gives rise to a distinct
dermal lineage that is persistently associated with each developing human and mouse eccrine gland. A first-of-
its kind dermal niche to be described for eccrine glands, understanding how EDEN arises and is maintained, and
what factors EDEN produces to instruct eccrine development are entirely unknown. Accordingly, the goals of
this proposal are to define the cellular mediators required for EDEN induction, differentiation, and maintenance
(Aim 1) and to identify EDEN-produced effectors required for eccrine differentiation (Aim 2). Our research
strategy employs: a) functional experiments in mice using existing alleles to carry out targeted genetic
perturbations of EDEN and the associated eccrine epidermal anlage and also b) candidate-based and systematic
discovery of EDEN molecular effectors required for eccrine differentiation using genetically-targeted, single cell
transcriptomics followed by high-throughput seqFISH+ based validation in both human and mouse eccrine-
forming skin, and functional testing in vivo using genetic disruption in mice. Our findings will define the regulators,
functional properties, and effectors of the eccrine niche to reveal the extrinsic drivers of eccrine developmental
progression. Made possible by the unique biological and technical expertise of our team, this first-of-its kind,
instructive recipe for eccrine formation will seed translational efforts to regenerate these essential appendages
and identify novel genetic targets for alleviating eccrine disorders."
10834466,"Brain metabolism is a fundamental aspect of biology and human disease. The brain critically depends on
glucose, consuming large quantities as the biochemical fuel for cognition, memory, and behavior. Fundamental
aspects of brain metabolism have been extensively studied, but recent evidence regarding the key role of
glucose and glycogen metabolism in neurological diseases has recently opened up new avenues of research.
The neurological disease where aberrant glucose metabolism has been investigated in-depth is Lafora disease
(LD). LD is an autosomal recessive, fatal, glycogen storage disease (GSD) that equally affects both sexes.
Symptoms emerge in adolescence with drug-resistant epilepsy, ataxia, neurodegeneration, and a rapid decline
into a vegetative state before death. Results from several labs using multiple models have demonstrated that
aberrant intracellular glycogen-like aggregates, known as polyglucosan bodies (PGBs), are the cause of LD.
Strikingly, we and others have identified PGBs in multiple neurological diseases and we hypothesize that
PGBs are a driving force in disease progression for brain-impacted GSDs, and that PGBs also play a
critical role in Alzheimerâs disease (AD).
 We have made foundational discoveries regarding glucose hypometabolism in LD, defined how PGBs
impact cellular processes, developed cutting-edge tools to determine the underlying cellular mechanisms, and
established therapeutic platforms to inhibit and/or eliminate PGBs. Defining the mechanisms of glycogen
metabolism in LD provides insights into how PGBs form and impact brain homeostasis. Thus, LD offers a
unique window into both normal brain glucose metabolism and broader disease implications when this
metabolism is perturbed.
 This R35 will combine our NINDS-funded, LD-centric R01 and P01, and extend our expertise to brain-
impacted GSDs and determining the role of PGBs in AD. Moving forward, we will further define LD-driven
perturbations in signaling at the molecular level, elucidate changes in cellular physiology, and establish novel
therapeutic modalities at the organismal level. Excitingly, the work on LD serves as a model for how to
interrogate brain metabolic perturbations in other neurological diseases involving PGBs. We will apply these
powerful LD-developed tools and insights to define how PGBs impact multiple neurological diseases,
determine the glycogen-centric molecular mechanisms impacting disease progression, and define how PGB
removal affects brain metabolism as a pre-clinical therapeutic. Importantly, we have key pieces of preliminary
data for LD, brain-impacted GSDs, and AD from both mouse models and patient tissue. The increased
stability, freedom, and flexibility provided by the R35 would allow us to make seminal discoveries in brain
metabolism and define the role of PGBs in multiple diseases while carrying out key steps in the development of
therapies and biomarker development.

10834258,"Project Summary:
The effort to identify functional non-coding sequences has largely focused on the regulatory elements such as
enhancers and non-coding RNAs. However, while ~70% of the human genome is epigenetically quiescent, i.e.
not marked by any epigenetic modification indicating functional inactivity, the majority of somatic mutations
associated with diseases occur in the non-coding regions. An emerging question is why and how somatic
mutations in epigenetically quiescent loci would affect cellular functions and cause disease formation. A
possible mechanism is that the mutations in these loci may alter the neighbor chromatin organization and such
a change is propagated through the 3D genome to generate a profound impact on phenotype. Although this
hypothesis is tempting, such non-coding loci have not been widely identified, characterized and analyzed in the
human genome. In the proposed work, we aim to integrate computational prediction and CRISPR library
screen to systematically uncover non-coding loci that do not host any functional element and are not even
marked by histone modification, protein binding or open chromatin but are important for cell survival (Specific
Aim 1 and 2). We will investigate the mechanisms of how the deletion of these loci lead to cell dysfunction
using Hi-C, single cell RNA-seq and single ATAC-seq analyses (Specific Aim 3). Once completed, the
proposed work will provide a new aspect of understanding the functions of epigenetically quiescent non-coding
loci and facilitate developing genome-editing based therapeutics targeting these loci."
10854269,"Abstract
The hippocampus is associated with adaptive learning and memory, processing multimodal signals within its
intrinsic circuits, where inhibitory neurons have a fundamental role. Studies of inhibitory hippocampal neurons in
rodents have produced massive data on their types, physiology, and connectivity, organized into large
databases, but not yet achieved for primates. Given the primate expansion of the hippocampus in parallel with
the cortex, a primate animal model is crucial. Concomitant elaboration of the hippocampal inhibitory system
across primates, facilitates primate-specific circuit interactions, as seen in the cortex, thalamus, and amygdala.
In concert with the hippocampal expansion in primates, extensive evidence implicates disruption of
distinct inhibitory hippocampal neurons in psychiatric diseases in humans, including schizophrenia and post-
traumatic stress disorder. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate in a primate animal model inhibitory
neurons in the intrinsic circuits of CA3-CA1 fields of anterior hippocampus through: 1- Estimation of the
neurochemical inhibitory neuron makeup using unbiased stereology and analyses; 2- Study of biophysical
properties of single-neurons using in-vitro electrophysiology, their detailed morphology through staining, confocal
imaging, and quantitative measures and analyses; 3- Study of innervation targets and interconnectivity of
hippocampal inhibitory neuron types at high resolution through confocal imaging and electron microscopy; and
4- Computational modeling to simulate the role of inhibitory neuron types in the intrinsic hippocampal network
and dysfunction in psychiatric diseases, based on data from Studies 1-3 and the published literature. The focus
of study is on the anterior hippocampus, based on its strong connections with the amygdala, and projection to
prefrontal cortex. These pathways are associated with emotion and cognition, in processes that are disrupted in
psychiatric diseases. The proposed studies will probe quantitatively the hippocampal inhibitory system in a
primate model system, with novel studies that estimate the extent of expansion, neuronal specialization, and
connectivity on intrinsic function. Data will be collected quantitatively and organized in databases for efficient
dissemination to the research community to allow comparison with existing data from rats and mice. The
combined studies will help identify specialized primate loci prone to disruption in the hippocampal inhibitory
system, rendering humans uniquely susceptible to complex cognitive-affective disorders, and thus are of high
clinical relevance for developing effective therapies."

complete the detailed clinical trial planning necessary to meet NIAMS and NIH standards and regulatory
requirements prior to submitting a U01 application for funding. Activities included in this proposal include
initiating clinical, operational and regulatory activities; developing a data safety monitoring plan; identifying
and vetting clinical sites; developing and testing training materials, obtaining investigational drug; establishing
data collection, management and data analysis plans; and developing a final budget; and submission of a U01
application for funding. The study being proposed will evaluate the use of denosumab and sequential
zoledronic acid therapy to prevent bone loss after acute SCI. Bone loss after acute spinal cord injury (SCI)
occurs rapidly and is profound in magnitude, with 50% of bone mass or more being lost in the lower extremities
of non-weightbearing individuals, resulting in an elevated risk of fracture and limiting access to weight-bearing
rehabilitation. Bone loss is driven primarily by increased bone resorption, and the use of bisphosphonates to
prevent bone loss has slowed but not prevented significant bone loss. In contrast, an initial small clinical trial of
denosumab, a more potent anti-resorptive agent, has reported efficacy in preventing DXA-determined bone loss
after SCI, particularly at skeletal sites around the knee, the most common site of fracture. These data need to be
replicated in a larger and more diverse SCI population with bone loss evaluated by accurate CT imaging
technology and serum bone markers. And importantly, as the skeletal benefits of denosumab have been shown
to be rapidly lost after its discontinuation, an additional intervention to prevent this loss of efficacy after
denosumab discontinuation needs to be considered. Intravenously administered zoledronic acid has been shown
to be effective in this setting, and we have recently shown in a larger clinical trial that zoledronic acid is
effective in reducing bone loss at knee skeletal sites after SCI, providing further support for its use in this
setting. Additionally, our data have also demonstrated a significant interaction between zoledronic acid
treatment and a measure of ambulatory ability, WISCI, strongly suggesting that weight-bearing can impact
skeletal outcomes after zoledronic acid treatment and be an important factor for clinical decision making
regarding who should be treated. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and
durability of sequential treatment with denosumab and zoledronic acid to prevent and maintain bone loss after
acute SCI. We will utilize the setting of a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, with initial denosumab and
placebo treatment for 12 months (dosing at baseline and at 6 months) after acute SCI, followed by
randomization at that point of the group receiving denosumab, stratified by WISCI score, to a one-time
intravenous infusion of either zoledronic acid, a potent bisphosphonate, or matching placebo and participants
followed for another 12 months."
10858691,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Efforts to effectively treat and control Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa now face the critical issue that
parasites in East African countries have acquired resistance to artemisinin (ART), the core component of the
primary first-line therapy combination therapy of artemether plus lumefantrine (LUM) known as Coartem. Recent
studies have observed the rapidly increasing prevalence of K13 mutations (C469Y, R561H, R622I and A675V)
in isolates from Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia, which associate with in vitro and in vivo ART resistance. Gene
editing studies have shown that K13 mutations alone are generally insufficient to mediate ART resistance in
African parasites, and alternative pathways to resistance are likely. Recent reports have also observed reduced
susceptibility to LUM in Northern Uganda, which may signal the impending loss of Coartem treatment efficacy in
this region that may well spread across Africa. Our study is designed to elucidate the genetic basis of emerging
multidrug resistance in Uganda and evaluate how resistance mediators can affect parasite proliferation and
transmission potential, as these factors govern the spread of ART resistance in high-transmission settings
frequently found in Africa. Our first aim is to study k13-mediated and k13-independent ART resistance in
Ugandan parasites, which will provide insight into the complex genetic architecture and elucidate alternate
mediators of resistance. We will achieve this by implementing two genetic crosses using the humanized FRG-
NOD mouse model. Our first cross will be between an ART-resistant K13 mutant Ugandan isolate and the drug-
sensitive NF54 African line to elucidate secondary genetic modulators that interact with k13 to generate
resistance. Our second cross will employ an ART-resistant K13 wild-type Ugandan isolate crossed with NF54 to
identify markers for ART resistance that evolved independently of k13. We will establish phenotypic and genomic
profiles of recombinant progeny and apply quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to locate primary and secondary
determinants of ART resistance, confirm causal and secondary determinants using gene editing, and examine
their epistatic interactions. Our second aim is to understand the genetic basis of decreased LUM sensitivity in
Northern Uganda by exploiting the second cross, whose Ugandan parent displays high LUM IC50 values. Our
complementary genetic mapping approaches of applying bulk segregant analyses of recombinant pools coupled
with clone-based QTL mapping will identify candidate markers that we will validate using reverse genetics. Our
third aim is to study the impact of Ugandan K13 mutations and other resistance markers on parasite growth and
transmission to Anopheles vectors, and identify mutations that compensate for fitness defects in drug-resistant
lines. This will be achieved by measuring fitness using competitive growth mixed-culture assays and bulk
segregant analyses, and quantifying mosquito infectivity of edited mutant and wild-type isogenic lines. Our
findings will provide robust molecular markers to track and inform efforts to mitigate emerging multidrug
resistance in Africa and delineate the relationship between drug resistance, parasite fitness and transmission."

patient's lifetime, bladder cancer remains underfunded. High-grade (HG), muscle invasive bladder tumors
account for the majority of these deaths as patients with metastatic disease have a 5-year survival rate of only
15%. The current standard first line therapy for metastatic disease is cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
or immune checkpoint inhibition in patients who are platinum ineligible. Novel immune checkpoint (IC) inhibitors,
including anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1, represent a paradigm shift in cancer therapy in patients with advanced UC
however, only 15-25% of patients treated in published trials had objective responses to single agent IC inhibition.
 In patients with clinically localized, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), there is a high level of
evidence to support the use of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two widely accepted regimens with
therapeutic equipoise are MVAC (methotrexate, vincristine, adriamycin, and cisplatin) and GC
(gemcitabine/cisplatin). While trials in advanced bladder cancer therapy are evaluating the combination of
chemo and immunotherapy, to rationally combine these two therapeutic modalities it is imperative to precisely
understand how MVAC and GC impact the immune microenvironment and how to best sequence chemo and
immunotherapy.
Preliminary studies from the Kim and Vincent laboratories show that MVAC and GC have differing effects
on the immune microenvironment in bladder cancers of the luminal molecular subtype. Tumors of the luminal
subtype, which have low baseline immune infiltration have a significant increase in immune gene signature
expression and restriction of tumor-specific T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes in the peripheral blood after MVAC
but not GC treatment. In contrast, GC significantly increases gene signatures known to promote resistance to
IC therapy in bladder cancer (Fibroblast TGFB Response Signature [FTBRS] and EMT_Stroma). These results
in aggregate suggest that in luminal bladder cancers, MVAC promotes an inflamed tumor immune
microenvironment permissive to IC inhibition, while GC increases stromal expansion, known to correlate with
immunotherapy resistance. In aggregate our preliminary data suggest that MVAC should combine better with
IC therapy than GC. Successful completion of this proposal will validate these findings in a prospective cohort
of paired pre and post MVAC or GC samples collected in the context of a randomized clinical trial (SWOG1314),

program. As a bioinformatics resource center, we are dedicated to sharing as broadly as possible the new
computational approaches and methods being developed in the Technology Research and Development
Projects (TR&Ds). As they mature, methods are disseminated to the research community as easy-to-use
software tools, leveraging support from our NRNB ecosystem of software and websites, which also includes a
suite of popular network biology resources such as Cytoscape and NDEx. Beyond dissemination of
bioinformatics technology, our community engagement program includes a portfolio of training opportunities
and activities to cultivate collaboration, service, and close relationships with Driving Biomedical Projects

corresponding websites, databases, manuals, forums, tutorials, and protocols to promote and provide access
to them. In Aim 2, we seek to develop an online training platform that is extensible and maintainable in coming
years. Training material is made using free, online systems that are easily accessible to both students and
trainers and are used as part of our in-person events, such as hands-on workshops. In Aim 3, we seek to
foster communities of technology users and developers. This task is done by sustaining a portfolio of

Although there is an 8% decrease in HIV infection in the U.S., the prevalence of people with HIV (PWH) has
increased due to effective combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART). PWH are prone to substance abuse
such as methamphetamine (METH), opioids, cannabis, and alcohol. Moreover, HIV and substance abuse
constitutes a health syndemic and contribute to a significant economic burden to the U.S. PWH and, with
METH abuse, have activated and inflamed immune systems, increasing the risk of neurocognitive disorders
(NCD). HIV and METH increase neuroinflammation, whereas cannabidiol (CBD), a component of cannabis, is
known to attenuate inflammation; however, their collective impact is yet to be elucidated. Thus, there is a
critical need to delineate the mitigating effect of CBD on neuroinflammation in HIV infection and METH abuse.
Our long-term goal is to establish effective intervention strategies to enhance PWH's span and quality of life.
Our overall objective for this proposal is to understand the impact of CBD on HIV infection and METH abuse-
associated neuroinflammation. In recent times, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained considerable attention
as novel actors in intercellular communication, inflammation, and disease progression. On the other hand,
depending on the cell of origin, EVs can have precisely the opposite effect, i.e., alleviate inflammation. Several
preclinical studies have indicated CBD alleviates inflammation by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation
and cytokine production. However, the underpinning mechanism of CBD's effects on neuroinflammation in the
context of HIV infection and METH abuse has not been explored. Based on the previous findings, we
hypothesize that CBD attenuates HIV and METH abuse-associated neuroinflammation by modulating NLRP3
inflammasome activation and altering the EV cargo. We will test this hypothesis under the following two aims;
In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of CBD in modulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and EV cargo in
vitro. We will use human monocyte-derived microglia (MDMi) in our study. RNA and protein isolated from
different experimental groups will be used to analyze gene expression, whereas EVs isolated from conditioned
media will be subjected to cytokines analysis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effect of CBD on
neuroinflammation and EV cargo in HIV infection and METH abuse using a Hu-mice model. Preclinical hu-mice
models with METH administration and HIV infection that exhibit pathophysiological complexities of the human
brain will accurately mimic neuroinflammation in clinical settings. Thus, delineating the impact of CBD on the
modulation of neuroinflammation in the context of HIV infection and METH abuse will identify genes involved in
neuroinflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during HIV infection and METH abuse and the impact
of CBD administration."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Beta-amyloid plaques in the brain
on autopsy are one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD, but numerous clinical trials targeting beta-amyloid
have failed. Many studies in brain specimens and animal models of AD have shown that iron is found in and
adjacent to beta-amyloid plaques and may contribute to neuronal injury. People with evidence of beta-amyloid
plaques on positron emission tomography (PET) and high levels of brain iron have accelerated cognitive
decline. However, the mechanisms linking iron to cognitive decline in humans remain unclear. Elucidating
these mechanisms is critical for the development of potential iron-targeted therapies. The objective of this
proposal is to use state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of
iron, oxidative stress, and neuronal injury to understand the link between iron and AD. If successful, this
proposal will clarify iron's role as a potential key upstream target in therapeutic trials to slow or stop the
development of AD. This application is for a prospective study of 80 elderly normal individuals, half of whom
will have PET evidence of cerebral amyloid deposition. The first aim is to test the hypothesis that subjects with
cerebral amyloid deposition will have higher baseline levels of brain iron and higher rates of iron accumulation,
using quantitative susceptibility mapping, a noninvasive MRI measure of brain iron. The second aim is to test
the hypothesis that subjects with cerebral amyloid deposition will have higher baseline levels of oxidative
stress and higher rates of increase in oxidative stress, as reflected by lower glutathione levels on proton MR
spectroscopy and higher isoprostane levels in the CSF. The third aim is to test the hypothesis that subjects
with cerebral amyloid deposition will have greater baseline evidence of AD biomarkers and longitudinal change
in AD biomarkers, including CSF markers of beta-amyloid, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau, brain atrophy
and cortical thinning, and memory decline. The results of this proposal will advance our understanding of the
role of iron in AD pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target for clinical trials."

This application is being submitted for a new Training Program in Comparative Effectiveness Research for
Suicide Prevention that will be offered by the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health with predocs also coming from the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) at Harvard University and postdocs from the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School
(HMS). The principal objectives of the Training Program will be to educate a new generation of promising
interdisciplinary pre- and post-doctoral trainees in the use of cutting-edge methodology for comparative
effectiveness research (CER) focused on clinical and policy interventions aimed at reducing suicides and
suicide-related behaviors (SRBs; ideation, plans, attempts, other self-injurious behaviors). The application
builds on the combined strengths of the epidemiologic methods program in the Epidemiology Department and
the strong collaborative research program on suicide prevention across several Departments at Harvard. We
aim to train subject matter specialists (clinical psychologists, psychiatric epidemiologists, psychiatrists) in
cutting-edge CER methods and to provide trainees who are going to become CER methodologists with the
intensive subject matter exposure in suicide prevention research needed to encourage their continued focus on
suicides and SRBs in their future studies. All trainees will complete a rigorous core set of courses in modern
CER methods as well as receive in-depth training in current theories and empirical CER studies aimed at
preventing suicides and SRBs. An extensive network of collaboration exists among training faculty members
with each other and with external collaborating in numerous high-profile CER studies focused on interventions
to reduce suicides and SRBs. These projects will provide trainees with a rich array of mentored research
training opportunities. We are requesting support for a total of six trainees: three predoctoral and three
postdoctoral. Training will be a combination of coursework, training seminars led by core faculty, practica, and
mentored research training in which CER methods are applied to important projects involving the prevention of
suicides and SRBs. Diversity and health disparities will be major foci."

dysfunction by affecting synaptic integration, spike train transmission, and circuit connectivity. Incorporating
published experimental data into accurate, full-scale, and biologically plausible neural network simulations is
important for quantitatively bridging the sub-cellular and systems-levels. We successfully designed,
implemented, and freely distributed to the community computer software and databases to reconstruct,
analyze, visualize, simulate, and share the 3D tree-like shape of neurons collected from any labeling and
visualization techniques, animal species, brain regions, developmental stages, and experimental conditions.
We imaged by light microscopy, digitally traced, and shared new data, and we provided our peers with the
electronic means of freely doing the same. Moreover, we combined those data with computational models of
membrane biophysics to investigate the neuronal structure-activity relationship with a special focus on the
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex due to their central role in spatial representation and episodic memory. We
additionally annotated a massive amount of cellular properties in an open-source web-based portal of neuron
types in the rodent hippocampal formation. We now propose to expand this research approach with three
specific aims. The first is to augment the power, scope, and usability of the NeuroMorpho.Org repository of
digital tracings. We plan to more than double the number of shared reconstructions while enhancing the
human- and machine-accessible utility by adding âsearch similarâ and summary reporting functionalities. Most
importantly for long-term sustainability, we will dramatically modernize the information technology infrastructure
of this resource to enable unsolicited submissions directly from authors, continuous agile releases, and
community crowdsourcing. The second aim is to complete the Hippocampome.org knowledge base by adding
synaptic information, including connection probabilities, physiology, and plasticity, and linking them to the
existing morphological, physiological, and molecular properties of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. This will
enable the implementation of a real-scale spiking neural network model to run predictive simulations of activity
dynamics and computational functions. The third aim is to develop an innovative approach to classify neurons
directly from network connectivity, validating it with the hippocampal circuit and deploying it on open-access
high-throughput data from a popular model organism. Together, these three aims will allow us (and others) to
test hypotheses relating neuronal morphology to molecular and developmental determinants on the one hand,
and to functional circuits on the other. The focus of this application on structural plasticity is especially relevant
to disabling neurological diseases prominently involving the hippocampal formation, including epilepsy and
Alzheimerâs. Our proposed data-driven, biologically realistic network simulations may shed light on the role of
specific neuron types and of their interactions in impairments of memory formation and retrieval."
10840452,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Whether through active or passive immunization, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) will likely form
a cornerstone of HIV prevention. This application proposes an ancillary study of the African component of the
antibody-mediated prevention trial (AMP) (HVTN 703/HPTN 081). The AMP study is the first proof-of-concept
trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a bNAb (VRC01) to block HIV acquisition. Our team is involved in the
laboratory investigations to measure serum levels associated with protection, and through sieve analysis, to
determine how predicted genotypic features correlate with prevention efficacy. The goal of this application is
to provide a deeper understanding on how HIV-1 diversity affects the amount of antibody needed to
prevent infection; and the clinical consequences of infection with VRC01-resistant viruses.
 The extreme diversity of circulating HIV strains, together with the flexibility of the Envelope protein (Env)
in evading immune pressure, could threaten the effectiveness of immunization studies. Utilizing sequence data
and functional env clones from AMP breakthrough infections, the first aim will provide an up-to-date bNAb
sensitivity profile of circulating strains, providing data useful for future clinical trials. This analysis will be done
using the standardized Env-pseudotyped assay, and a subset will also be evaluated using infectious env clones
generated in PBMCs to verify these data. The parent protocol sieve analysis will predict genetic features that
affect VRC01 neutralization susceptibility and resistance, and the second aim of this application will
experimentally validate these predictions, as well as evaluate how the cognate Env of breakthrough infections
influences the impact of these mutations. This will provide experimental data on how changes in envelope affect
the amount of antibody needed for prevention of infection. Lastly, VRC01 escape mutations have been
associated with reduced viral fitness and we will compare fitness of VRC01-resistant and sensitive viruses and
determine how this affects key clinical markers such as HIV viral load and CD4 counts.
 The HVTN 703/HPTN 081 trial provides a unique opportunity to define the impact of diversity on bNAb
efficacy in a sub-Saharan Africa setting where new prevention approaches are still urgently needed. This study
will be led by investigators at the University of Cape Town and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
in collaboration with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, and includes a training partnership with
North-West University in Mahikeng, South Africa. Information generated in this proposal will support the next
phase of combination passive immunization trials and will provide seminal data to understand the prevention
efficacy of VRC01."

The inability of wounds to heal in diabetic patients is the leading cause of lower extremity amputation in the
United States. Chronic, localized inflammation is believed to be a causative factor in the slow healing of diabetic
wounds, and macrophage cells are implicated as primary mediators of this inflammation. In non-diabetic patients,
macrophages are initially in a pro-inflammatory state in wounds and shift over time to an anti-inflammatory
phenotype that promotes tissue repair. In diabetic patients, the inflammatory macrophage phenotype persists,
resulting in impairment of angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, and wound contraction required for healing.
Systemically administered pharmacological agents that are anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory do not
improve healing in the clinic or in preclinical animal models and, in fact, further impair healing, likely due to off-
target effects in other immune or structural cells that facilitate tissue repair. This proposal focuses on the
development of drug carriers based on targeted nanomaterials to reroute the delivery of pharmacological agents
selectively to inflammatory macrophages in wounds after local administration to eliminate off-target effects. We
are particularly focused on inhibiting overactive pathways that generate inflammatory prostaglandins. In our
preliminary data, we show that polysaccharide-based nanocarriers can deliver cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors to
wound macrophages to potently diminish inflammatory cytokine expression and expedite wound healing in
diabetic mouse models. Aim 1 of this proposal is to optimize formulations that maximize the efficiency of targeted
delivery to inflammatory macrophages in wounds using fluorescent and radioisotopically labeled nanocarriers,
evaluated in vivo by nuclear imaging and ex vivo by flow cytometry, gamma well counting, and fluorescence
microscopy. Aim 2 is to optimize the efficacy and drug release rate of a therapeutic formulation that targets
different regulatory pathways of prostaglandin synthesis toward diabetic wound healing. Aim 3 is to evaluate
efficacy and off-target effects in multiple murine acute and chronic wound healing models of type 2 diabetes, as
well as monocyte-derived macrophages from diabetic patients. Fundamental outcomes of this work will be an
understanding of nanomaterial transport in wounds and receptor-mediated mechanisms to target macrophage
subpopulations, as well as an understanding of the role of prostaglandin-driven inflammatory processes in
macrophages within diabetic wounds. The nanocarrier delivery agents are based on materials already in broad
clinical use, which may expedite clinical testing of the resulting therapeutic agents if preclinical results are
promising. This work will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team comprising bioengineers (Andrew Smith
Lab) who focus on nanomaterial-based drug delivery and imaging agents, experts in molecular and cellular
immunology and mechanisms of diabetic wound healing (Katherine Gallagher Lab), and experts in nuclear
imaging and radiopharmacology (Wawrzyniec Dobrucki Lab)."

Despite combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV proteins like Transactivator of Transcription (Tat) persist at low
levels in the brains of HIV-infected individuals, resulting in cognitive decline collectively referred to as HIV-1-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Alcohol use disorder is a common comorbidity in people living with
HIV (PLWH) and is also known to potentiate the pathogenesis of HAND. Although the mechanisms underlying
HAND are complex and remain poorly understood, low-level, persistent neuroinflammation has been shown to
be a correlate of HAND. In the brain, glial cells such as the astrocytes, are major contributors of inflammation,
involving the inflammasome NLRP6 (a member of the NLR [nucleotide-oligomerization domain-like receptor)
family of proteins that acts as a sensor protein and plays multiple roles in regulating inflammation and host
defenses.
Based on the premise that alcohol use exacerbates HIV-associated neuroinflammation, we
hypothesize that exposure of HIV Tat stimulated astrocytes to alcohol will lead to exacerbated expression of a
pro-inflammatory milieu compared to cells exposed to either agent alone or to control cells (HIV protein/drug
naÃ¯ve) and, further that mechanistically this involves increased activation of NLRP6 and its downstream signaling
pathways. In fact, our exciting preliminary studies have demonstrated that human A172 astrocyte cells exposed
to both HIV Tat (surrogate of HIV infection) and alcohol significantly increased the activation of NLRP6 involving
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The proposed hypothesis will be tested in two aims: SA1 To investigate the
molecular mechanism(s) underlying HIV Tat and ethanol-induced astrocytic activation in mouse primary
astrocytes (MPAs) and SA2. To validate the findings from SA1 in an in vivo doxycycline-inducible transgenic Tat
(iTat) mice model exposed to ethanol These findings could have important implications for the future
development of therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating neuroinflammation in PLWH with HAND and alcohol
use disorder."

 The impressive amount of data generated by experimental but mostly unsuccessful HIV/SIV vaccines
has led to the realization that protection will most likely requires 2 levels of barriers, the initial one at the
mucosal port of entry and if breached, a second set of systemic defenses. The capacity of humoral and cellular
immune responses in mucosal tissues to block or contain replication at the initial stage of virus transmission
may have a profound impact on the ability of a vaccinated host to resist infection, even when virus progresses
beyond the port of entry, allowing the systemic response more time to control or eradicate the incoming
pathogen.
 We hypothesized that there are two features necessary for a successful vaccine: 1) A prolonged if not
life-long stimulation of the immune system with viral antigens to maintain âalertâ immune responses; and 2) a
targeted immune response at the site of primary HIV replication. A vaccine approach that simultaneously
addresses these two issues would have the potential to achieve solid, long-term active protection.
 To fulfill these requirements, we have developed an original strategy that successfully delivers a
vaccine to mucosal sites, providing antigen stimuli at recurrent intervals and elicit protective mucosal and
systemic immune responses. Our strategy leverages epithelial stem cells as permanent but non-expressing
source of viral antigen while their short-lived differentiated offspring express and present antigen to the local
immune system, along the mucosal surfaces of viral entry. Using a single cycle replicative-deficient SIV
(SIVsc) approach, which has been shown to be safe compared to traditional attenuated vaccines, we have
cloned the SIVsc genome under the control of the involucrin promoter (pINV-SIVsc), a terminally differentiated
keratinocyte specific promoter. When administered, the vaccine targets and transduces basal epithelial stem
cells from colorectal tissues. These cells then proliferate and differentiate into mature epithelial cells, triggering
SIV antigen expression via the promoter and leading to both direct and cross priming.
 For this project, we propose: 1) To confirm and further improve the efficacy and safety profile of the
pINV-SIVsc vaccine via the colorectal route; 2) To visualize and optimize vaccine delivery, and investigate the
mechanisms of action underlying protection; and 3) Using our best optimized vaccine strategy, demonstrate
protection from virus acquisition and/or viral replication in vivo and determine the correlates of protection or
control against repeated low-dose intrarectal challenges with heterologous SIV."

HIV-1 integrase (IN) is one of the major antiviral targets, and multiple IN inhibitors have been developed as a
key component of current antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, considering viral resistance and toxicity
potentials of current INSTIs, compounds with new modes of action (MOA), improved safety profiles, high
genetic barrier, and long-acting formulation potentials still remain highly in demand. Allosteric IN inhibitors
(ALLINIs) are a new class of IN inhibitors that target the non-catalytic sites of HIV-1 IN. Initially, ALLINIs were
originally developed to block the binding of a host factor, LEDGF/p75, to the cleft formed between two IN
monomers. The binding of IN to LEDGF/p75, which is a transcription factor, facilitates the selection of viral
integration sites toward actively transcribed genes, which can facilitate LTR-mediated viral transcription post
integration. Also, it was later discovered that the binding of these ALLINI compounds targeting the LEDGF/p75
binding site of IN also inhibit HV-1 maturation by inducing aberrant IN multimerization that blocks the IN-viral
RNA interaction essential for the proper localization of viral genomes within viral capsid during viral maturation.
This new activity of IN during HIV-1 maturation further re-enforced the discovery efforts of ALLINI compounds
as a potential new class of antivirals (maturation inhibitors). However, after more than a decade of efforts, no
ALLINI compounds have progressed to clinical developments, due to their apparent toxicity or limited efficacy.
STP0404 is a highly potent pyrrolopyridine-based ALLINI with a sub-nanomolar IC50 efficacy, outstanding PK,
and safety profiles observed in both preclinical in vitro and animal investigations. This grant has been
supporting various intense MOA investigations of STP0404, which, together with extensive cellular and animal
PK and toxicology evaluations conducted by ST Pharm, STP0404 was recently moved to human trials. Indeed,
STP0404 became the first-in-human (FIH) ALLINI compound: the phase I trial of STP0404, which was
completed in 2022, demonstrated its outstanding safety and human PK profile for once-a-day oral formulations,
which further supports advanced clinical evaluations for its anti-viral efficacy in HIV-1 patients. In this renewal
application, we will characterize a new STP0404 derivative, EKC110, designed to have improved genetic
barrier and altered resistant mutation profile, and also investigate its cellular pharmacology/safety, and synergy
with other ART agents. We will also investigate novel antiviral activity and resistance MOAs of our
pyrrolopyridine ALLINIs by employing a series of biochemical, structural biology, virological, and computational
biology approaches. Finally, we will investigate the effect of STP0404 and EKC110 on HIV-1 integration site
selection and their HIV-1 reactivation suppression activity from latently infected CD4+ T cells. Overall, we aim
to deliver a new class of safe and effective anti-HIV agents that can be used potentially for treatments for both
viral infection and persistence through mechanistic and chemical innovations."
10839008,"QALYs, Comorbidities, and Cost-effectiveness of HIV Care in the Department of Defense vs the
 Veterans Health Administration
I. ABSTRACT
The challenges faced by people with HIV (PWH) are changing. Modern HIV treatment and care have reduced
AIDS and extended lifespans. Throughout these longer lifespans, however, PWH are more likely to be diagnosed
with non-AIDS comorbidities than people without HIV. The focus of HIV research and treatment must therefore
shift away from AIDS and mortality towards non-AIDS comorbidities and the quality of this extended lifespan.
Treatment of these non-AIDS comorbidities constitutes a substantial share of long-term HIV care cost. We will
assess the cost-effectiveness of HIV care in two large single-payer systems using a novel approach focusing on
the challenges of non-AIDS comorbidities and quality of life faced by PWH today.
Health records for over 4,268 patients from the US Military HIV Natural History Study (NHS) and over 55,880
patients from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) will be derived for the year range 2002-2022. Quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs) will be employed to take into account patient preferences for their current health
state relative to perfect health. Health states will be identified as combinations of stages of HIV and permutations
of comorbidities. The QALY for surviving an additional year in each health state will be estimated. QALYs will be
estimated using traditionally employed and novel methods. As we demonstrate, our machine learning application
allows us to accurately measure QALYs in the absence of quality of life questionnaire data. The time of
progressing from one health state to another will be estimated. A model of HIV progression capable of
determining the patient's risk of future non-AIDS comorbidities will be developed. The cost-effectiveness of
modern era HIV care in the DoD vs the VA will be assessed using this new model.
This work will produce several solutions for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. The study will produce
formulas enabling researchers to accurately measure QALYs in the absence of health-related quality of life
data. The study will produce a new model of HIV progression enabling clinicians to predict and prevent the
non-AIDS comorbidities the patient is at highest risk of developing. Employing access to Kaiser Permanente,
Ryan White Care, and other data with propensity score methods will allow us to estimate custom models for
those populations and generalize our findings to those populations. The study will inform DoD and VA
policymakers whether it is more cost-effective to retain PWH in the DoD or transfer them to the VA.
The proposal addresses the Office of AIDS Research priority area of âAddressing HIV-Associated
Comorbidities, Coinfections, & Complicationsâ, the National Institute of Aging research priority area of
âUnderstanding the Dynamics of the Aging Processâ Goal A, Goal E, and Goal F by studying comorbidity
progression paths among PWH as they age, informing of future complications and possible preventive efforts,

 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells have emerged as a promising immunotherapy in controlling
HIV-1 infection. However, CAR-T cells are also subject to immune dysfunction/exhaustion mediated by
persistent inflammation during chronic HIV infection. Strategies to prevent exhaustion/restore functions of anti-
HIV CAR-T cell are critical for ultimately achieving HIV functional cure. Our preliminary studies have showed
that autophagy induction can improve mitochondria function and promote CAR-T cell cytotoxic T lymphocyte
activity in vitro. Importantly, we found that induction of autophagy can prevent excessive IFN-I signaling and in
vivo treatment with autophagy inducer rapamycin in chronically HIV infected humanized mice can decrease
inflammation, restore exhausted anti-viral T cell function, and reduce viral loads. In addition, we found that
autophagy inducers such as rapamycin allow efficient HIV-1 latency reversal by PKC activator bryostatin-1
while reducing T cell activation associated immune toxicity. Therefore, we hypothesize that autophagy
induction can enhance âkick and killâ HIV cure approaches by improving the survival, persistence and function
of anti-HIV CAR-T cells and facilitating effective and safe latency reversal by PKC modulators. We will utilize
our well-established humanized mouse model engineered with anti-HIV CD4CAR T cells to investigate the
therapeutic potentials of autophagy induction for HIV âkick and killâ cure approaches. Our study will also provide
mechanistic insights into the development of immune exhaustion and autophagyâs regulation of CAR-T cell
function and will thus have a wide impact beyond HIV cure research."

 HIV remains a significant problem worldwide. The CA protein of HIV is involved in several critical replication
events, including Gag oligomerization and viral assembly, maturation, reverse transcription (RT), trafficking to
the nucleus via interaction with host factors, nuclear import, integration, and evasion of host immune
responses. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the role of CA in replication, there are many
unresolved questions regarding CA structural dynamics during viral assembly and post-entry replication steps,
CA-host factor interactions, and the impact of these interactions on virus biology. The genetic fragility of CA and
difficulty of examining CA-host interactions in cells represent significant barriers to the resolution of these
questions. To address these challenges and knowledge gaps, we are working to identify and develop novel tools
capable of discriminating among different CA assembly forms. To date, we have identified RNA aptamers that
bind specifically to the CA lattice, but not other assembly forms, and those that bind both the CA lattice and CA
hexamer assembly forms. Aptamers represent unique tools particularly well-suited to the study of CA assembly
forms and interaction sites, as they bind targets with high specificity, discriminate among different conformations
of the same protein, can be expressed in or delivered to cells, can be used to outcompete other interacting
partners, and are amenable to a variety of different modifications. Interestingly, our aptamers identified to date
display different biological phenotypes, suggesting that they may target unique sites on CA or influence CA
function in distinct ways. Here, we propose two aims in support of our goal to develop aptamers as useful tools
for the field. The focus of Aim 1 is to identify new aptamers that target additional CA assembly forms, building
upon our prior work supporting feasibility of our approach. Our ultimate goal is to develop a panel of aptamers
with specificities to all relevant CA assembly states. The focus of Aim 2 is to develop an aptamer-mediated, CA
assembly state-specific affinity purification method paired with crosslinking mass spectrometry to identify novel
CA assembly state-associated host factors. Collectively, these tools will tremendously benefit the field, as there
are currently no tools available for the differentiation of CA assembly states. Importantly, aptamers are amenable
to a variety of modifications that will facilitate applications including affinity purification, microscopy-based
tracking of CA during replication, expression in cells for evaluation of replication effects and mechanistic studies,
and delivery to cells to compete for binding to specific CA sites. Furthermore, future determination of sites of
aptamer-CA interaction will help identify novel accessible sites on CA for potential therapeutic targeting."

A significant proportion of individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection develop cognitive
deficits. This may be due solely to the HIV-1 infection; however, this may also indicate that prolonged ART itself
may contribute to the impairments, particularly in the context of HIV-1 infection. The latter possibility is of
particular concern given that a growing number of uninfected individuals use antiretrovirals (ARVs) as pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The brain circuitry that may be affected by prolonged treatment with ARVs or by
ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection is unknown.
We propose to apply our recently developed array of new tools for constructing, comparing, and analyzing 3D
whole-brain maps of neuronal activation in the mouse brain to reveal the critical neural circuitry affected by ARVs,
HIV-1 infection, and their combination. Our hypothesis is that 3D patterns of neuronal activation in animals
exposed to ARVs, HIV-1, and ARV/HIV-1 and involved in challenging behavioral tasks can both reveal the
crucial circuitry defining these effects and serve as unique signatures of the treatments' effects.
In specific aim 1, we will determine the critical shared components of neural circuitry affected by prolonged
exposure to select ARVs. We will generate mesoscopic global maps of neuronal activation in mice presented
with relevant cognitive challenges after exposure to ARVs. We will then subject the mapping datasets to our
stepwise selection pipeline to identify the critical brain regions and neural circuits altered by the treatments. In
specific aim 2, we will determine the components of neural circuitry in NOD-hIL-34 mice, a humanized animal
model of HIV-1 infection, that are affected by exposure to select ARVs in the context of infection. Finally, in
specific aim 3, we will validate and extend the conclusions of our in silico investigations: we will monitor neuronal
activity in the candidate regions in vivo on the single-cell and population levels; apply monosynaptic tracing to
determine whether ARV treatment induces long-term changes in neuronal connections; and use chemogenetics
to manipulate neuronal activity in the key components of the inferred circuitry. Our experiments will create a
circuitry map space for the action of ARVs in the context of HIV-1 infection, upon which other circuitry maps that
describe various behavioral states and responses to treatments can be projected and compared. Our results will
help to characterize cognitive impairments in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving ART and in those using ARVs
as PrEP, and will inform future therapeutic efforts to treat HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment."

Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) are expressed in brain areas that control reward, motivation, and anxiety.
Dynorphin (DYN), an endogenous KOR agonist controls KOR activity to promote physiological acute aversive
states such as fear and anxiety to promote escape. Furthermore, upon opioid drug withdrawal and abstinence,
dysregulated DYN/KOR signaling can result in aversive physical and affective states that are a major driver of
relapse. Preclinically, KOR antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the physical signs of acute opioid
withdrawal. The current standard of care administered to reduce the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal is
the alpha 2a adrenergic receptor agonist, lofexidine. Although approved, lofexidine is only modestly effective at
withdrawal symptom severity reduction and can have significant unwanted side effects such as hypotension,
acute orthostasis and syncope, QT prolongation, and the potentiation of CNS depressant effects when taken
with sedating drugs. Cerevel Therapeutics is addressing this unmet need with the development of a short-acting,
selective KOR antagonist. This compound, CVL-354, attenuated the physical signs of withdrawal in an acute
opioid withdrawal model in rodents and we have completed a comprehensive nonclinical safety package that will
support dosing up to 90 days in humans. If awarded these funds, we are poised to run single and multiple
ascending dose studies to assess safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers (UG3 portion). In the UH3 portion
we will execute PET studies to further explore receptor occupancy in human, in combination with additional
nonclinical safety and manufacturing work that will support a Phase 2 clinical trial aimed at providing a more
effective treatment option to mitigate the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal."

Periodontitis and oral disease are widespread with major and negative impacts on quality of life. Radiography
is the standard of care in imaging but is limited to assessment of hard tissue. In the last three years, we have
shown that ultrasound imaging offers significant advantages to oral health including non-invasive and real-
time assessment of the periodontal probing depths, cementoenamel junction, gingival thickness, gingival
perfusion/hypoxia, and clinical attachment loss. However, further clinical work in this field is limited by the
large size of the ultrasound transducersâthey are simply too large to access the posterior teeth. While smaller
transducers exist, they cannot operate at the high frequency (>40 MHz) needed to image the small feature
sizes involved in oral health. Therefore, we have established a three-way academic-industrial partnership to
refine and finalize these devices for oral health. Dr. Jokerst at UCSD serves as PI and pioneered the use of
photoacoustic imaging in oral health. VisualSonics Corp. is our industrial partnerâDr. Jokerstâs preliminary
data was collected on VisualSonics equipment, and this company has a 20-year track record in developing
high-frequency transducers including recent 510k-approved systems for human use. The clinical partner is
Dr. Casey Chen who is Chair of Periodontology at USC and who will validate the system with human subjects.
Aim 1 of the work will build and validate a small hockey stick-style transducer. While this design is already
common, hockey stick transducers above 20 MHz are not available. Aim 2 will integrate diode lasers into the
system for photoacoustic imaging to complement ultrasound. Aim 3 will develop image-processing algorithms
to automatically export metrics of oral health such as clinical attachment loss and probing depth. Such
automated image-processing is critical to broad clinical acceptance. Aim 4 will validate this device in healthy
and diseased human subjects with comparisons to clinical gold standards. The significance of this work is
based on the widespread prevalence of periodontal disease and the remarkable new insight that acoustic
imaging offers in diagnosis and treatment planning. The innovative outcomes include non-invasive charting,
direct measurements of the cementoenamel junction, noninvasive biotyping, and 3D maps of inflammation
near implants. The work is feasible because of the track record of all three partners as well as their history of
collaboration. This is a good investment for NIH because there is no miniaturized and high-frequency (>40
MHz) ultrasound transducer available despite the dramatic improvement in spatial resolution that high
frequency offers. The proposal offers deliverables at all ranges of risk and the ultrasound transducer is highly
likely to succeed with implications well beyond oral health: Applications in endoscopy, head and neck
diseases, as well as transrectal/transvaginal imaging are obvious."
10858231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The 1.2 million people in the United States affected by hematologic malignancy (HM) each year are at high
risk of infection-related complications and mortality. As a result, HM patients are exposed to prolonged
antibiotic therapy, and are at increased risk of harm from multidrug resistant organisms and antibiotic-
associated adverse events. Optimizing selection of antibiotics in this population is a critical antibiotic
stewardship (AS) goal. A major barrier to achieving this goal is inaccurate antibiotic allergy labels.
 Although self-reported beta-lactam (BL) allergy is found in up to 20% of all inpatients, 90% of patients with
a reported penicillin (PCN) allergy are able to tolerate PCN. Inaccurate allergy labels may result in patients
receiving sub-optimal antibiotic therapy with less effective, overly broad, and/or more toxic agents. In HM
patients, BLs are preferred for many infectious complications. BL allergy is common in HM patients (>25%)
and those with BL allergy have significantly greater hospital LOS, 30-day mortality, and antibiotic exposure.
 Studies of antibiotic allergy delabeling interventions combining history, skin testing and oral challenge in
general hospitalized patients have shown that up to 85-95% of patients with reported BL allergy can be safely
delabeled. Patients who are successfully delabeled have increased appropriate antibiotic use and improved
clinical outcomes. Despite their increased risk of antibiotic-associated harm, cancer patients with BL allergy
have not been prioritized in research on delabeling interventions. Although recent studies (including our own)
provide promising early evidence for the feasibility of BL delabeling in cancer populations, the impact of a BL
allergy delabeling intervention on clinical outcomes in the HM population is unstudied.
 Our long-term goal is to optimize antibiotic use and improve clinical outcomes in high-risk
immunocompromised patients. The overall objective in this application is to test the impact of a pharmacist-led
BL allergy delabeling intervention (Allergy Delabeling in Antibiotic Stewardship â âRENEWâ) on clinical
outcomes and antibiotic use in hospitalized patients with HM while concurrently assessing social and
behavioral factors that shape implementation. The Specific Aims of this study are:
 Aim 1: Assess the Impact of the RENEW Intervention: To assess the impact of a BL allergy delabeling
intervention on antibiotic use and clinical outcomes in HM patients using a cohort study design.
 Aim 2: Identify Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of the RENEW Intervention: To identify
barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the RENEW intervention via a concurrent mixed-methods
process evaluation that will elicit the perceptions of patients and clinicians toward the intervention.

There is a growing understanding that the properties of microtubules polymers, such as their dynamics or post-translational modifications, can influence motor motility. There is also ample evidence that in neurons, MT
properties are not uniform across axons and dendrites. However, it is still unclear what are the mechanisms that
locally regulate neuronal microtubules, and how the resulting changes influence cargo transport. This proposal
aims to understand how microtubule polymer length, abundance and distribution are locally regulated, and how
this affects cargo delivery to synapses. It will do so by studying the role of an atypical kinesin, VAB-8/KIF26,
which we recently identified as a local regulator of microtubule organization and synapses in C. elegans. The
work proposed here will determine (1) how Wnt signaling directs the activity of VAB-8/KIF26 to a specific axonal
sub-domain, (2) how VAB-8/KIF26 regulates microtubule length and abundance, and (3) how this regulation
influences the delivery of cargo to presynaptic sites.
Answering these questions will increase our basic understanding of local regulation of neuronal microtubules
and its influence on axonal transport. The evolutionary conservation of VAB-8/KIF26 and Wnt signaling and the
cardinal role of MTs in neuronal development, maintenance and dysfunction underscore the importance of this
fundamental knowledge."
10830431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The 1972 Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program has led to near-universal access to dialysis
in order to extend the survival of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients progressing to ESRD. Each
year ~120,000 patients in the US transition to dialysis as the dominant yet costly treatment paradigm for
uremic, biochemical, and volume derangements. However, in the past 4Â½ decades, there has been little
progress or innovation in developing patient-centered treatment options for advanced CKD beyond dialysis.
Pioneering research led by our team under the NIH U01 âTransitions of Care in CKDâ (TCCKD) United States
Renal Data System (USRDS) Special Study Center have shown that transition to dialysis is associated with 1)
high mortality particularly in the 1st year of treatment, 2) frequent hospitalizations, 3) poor health-related quality
of life (HRQOL), 4) loss of independence, 5) functional decline, and 6) high withdrawal dates, particularly in
elderly and comorbid patients. This has prompted rising interest and pressing urgency for conservative
dialysis-free management as an alternative treatment option. Yet this strategy remains under-utilized due to
major uncertainties regarding 1) the comparative effectiveness of conservative management vs. dialysis on
hard outcomes and patient-centered endpoints, and 2) which patients will benefit from dialysis-free treatment.
 Our Multiple-PI R01 proposal will address these knowledge gaps by using innovative longitudinal data
sources from two of the largest US integrated healthcare systems, namely OptumLabs (United Healthcare) and
national Veterans Affairs (VA) data linked to Medicare and USRDS resources (2007-18), paired with a well-
defined prospective CKD cohort in the largest study of conservative management vs. dialysis transition to date.
Using propensity score matching, Aim 1 will examine associations of conservative management vs. dialysis
transition with mortality and hospitalization (co-primary outcomes), and skilled nursing facility placement,
intensive care admissions, and healthcare costs (secondary outcomes) in two large OptumLabs and VA
cohorts each with >0.5 million advanced CKD (eGFR <25ml/min/1.73m2) patients. In these two cohorts, Aim 2
will develop clinical prognostic models that predict an individualâs likelihood of survival and hospitalization with
conservative management vs. dialysis. In a prospective cohort of 116 stage 4-5 CKD patients, Aim 3 will
compare the impact of conservative management vs. dialysis preparation on the longitudinal trajectory of
HRQOL (primary outcome) and physical performance/activity, symptoms, and nutrition (secondary outcomes)
using rigorous protocolized data collection with validated instruments. Our findings will have substantial impact
on patient care and policy by 1) expanding patient-centered treatment options for the vast CKD population, 2)
generating rigorous evidence for clinical guidelines by identifying which patients are optimal candidates for
conservative management, and 3) informing clinical practice models aspiring to provide dialysis-free treatment
as an approach aligned with patient choice based on the US Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative."

The long term goals of my laboratory are to generate new insights into the role of the
inflammatory response in tissue repair and to develop novel therapies that shape the
inflammatory response to improve tissue repair. For the past 15 years, the major focus of my
research has been the role of macrophages in tissue damage, repair and regeneration. My
laboratory has published findings that macrophages play important roles in repair of both skin
and skeletal muscle and that these cells display tremendous phenotypic plasticity while helping
to guide a wound through each phase of healing. Our data also demonstrate that macrophage
dysregulation contributes to chronic inflammation and impaired skin wound healing in diabetes
as well as impaired healing of traumatic muscle injuries. Importantly, we have demonstrated and
that targeting macrophages can induce resolution of inflammation and improve healing. For
example, we have found that repurposing the anti-diabetic drug glyburide into a topical
treatment for skin wound healing can be used to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in wounds,
which results in a switch from a destructive pro-inflammatory to a pro-healing macrophage
phenotype and improved healing in diabetic mice. We are now in the process of obtaining an
Investigational New Drug designation for our new formulation that is needed to move forward
into a Phase I human trial on topical glyburide for diabetic leg ulcers. Following this model
pipeline from discovery to clinical trial will be a primary goal of all our future studies.
Despite these advances, much remains to be learned about the plasticity of macrophages
during tissue repair and the factors that regulate macrophage function, including cell-intrinsic
and cell-extrinsic pathways. To this end, my laboratory is studying the contributions of each
developmental stage of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to the regulation of wound
macrophage function during repair of skin and skeletal muscle, in both normal healing and
impaired healing models, in mice and humans. A goal of my laboratory over the next 5 years is
to take advantage of newly developed single cell analysis techniques to determine, using
unbiased methods, the actual phenotypes that macrophages adopt during normal and impaired
wound healing. This approach will help overcome a significant barrier to progress in the field,
which is the widespread use of biased and oversimplistic methods to categorize macrophage
populations in vivo, and has potential to identify novel macrophage populations involved in
healing. We will also use the single cell analysis techniques to guide mechanistic experiments
to elucidate the transcription factors and pathways involved in the regulation of different
macrophage populations. As our research progresses, we plan to address additional significant
gaps in understanding in the wound healing field, including the role of wound pathogens in the
(dys)regulation of macrophage function and tissue repair. The overall vision guiding our
approach is that by identifying novel regulators of macrophage function during wound healing,
we can develop new approaches to manipulate inflammation and improve healing of poorly
healing wounds, and in the process, generate a pipeline of candidate therapies to translate into
clinical studies."

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are much more common among the
elderly, and the aging population in the United States is rising rapidly. According to data from US Census
Bureau, there will be about 72 million people 65 and older by 2030, about one in every five Americans, this is
more than twice their number in 2000. The medical community is already seeing a high incidence of acute
kidney injury in the elderly population and it is expected that this will continue to rise with an increase in this
age group. This concerning trend; however, has received little attention despite the detrimental and potential
fatal outcomes associated with an episode of AKI, especially in this age group. The purpose of this study is to
explore the mechanisms that underlie the decrease reparative response in the aging kidney after injury with a
special focus on tubular senescence and epithelial cell proliferation. The specific aims of this proposal include:
1) Define the proliferative capacity of young vs. old proximal tubule cells by clonal analysis of dedifferentiated
cells, 2) Assess and characterize proximal tubule senescence in young vs. old kidneys after injury, and 3) To
determine if augmenting the proliferative response via transient overexpression of the transcription factor
Foxm1 leads to enhance renal recovery. Through these aims, our goal is to get an understanding of the
biology of the aging kidney in order to guide the quest for therapies to prevent, ameliorate or cure acute kidney
injury in the elderly or its progression to chronic kidney disease.
 This proposal outlines a 5-year training program to provide support and guidance towards the applicant
long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist studying the molecular mechanisms that
impair the regenerative response after acute kidney injury in aging. The plan consists of coursework, training in
new laboratory techniques and guidance from Dr. Benjamin Humphreys, Chief of Division of Nephrology at
Washington University, and members of the advisory committee who have a diverse wealth of expertise and
mentorship experience. The proposed studies try to address a highly relevant clinical problem such as AKI in
the elderly while providing resources for the applicant's career development."
10830370,"Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)
are the primary treatment for malaria and combine a potent short-acting artemisinin with a longer-acting partner
drug. ACTs rapidly clear the initial infection while providing a post-treatment prophylactic period that reduces the
risk of reinfection. In Southeast Asia, artemisinin and partner drug resistance has dramatically decreased ACT
efficacy. In sub-Saharan Africa, where artemisinin resistance has not been widely established, artemether-
lumefantrine (AL) is the most widely prescribed ACT. A challenge to treatment in sub-Saharan Africa is the
substantial overlap of malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Child development and
antiretroviral therapy significantly alter AL exposure, which can significantly impact treatment outcomes and
contribute to drug resistance selection. Therefore, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of 5-day (10-dose) versus standard 3-day (6-dose) AL to improve drug exposure and therapeutic
efficacy in children with and without HIV living in a high endemic region of Uganda. A potential disadvantage of
ACT regimens is the inherent mismatch in ACT component half-lives, resulting in an extended period of
subtherapeutic lumefantrine âmonotherapyâ following treatment. In the parent trial, over 70% of children
developed recurrent microscopically detectable parasitemia within 6 weeks of initial treatment with AL. Recent
studies using newer more sensitive molecular approaches have detected persistent submicroscopic parasitemia
up to 14 days after AL treatment. Thus, although increasing AL exposure may improve efficacy, our
understanding of the interplay of partner drug exposure, parasite dynamics, and drug resistance selection in high
transmission settings with multiclonal infections is lacking. Malaria pathogenesis and ACT drug exposure are
further influenced by HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy. The high rate of new infections following treatment
in our study provides the opportunity to comprehensively study parasite dynamics in children, and the impact
that HIV infection has on those dynamics. Using state of the art molecular and genetic studies conducted in a
randomized clinical trial, I propose to assess the relationship of persistent parasite detection to treatment
outcomes, transmission dynamics, and drug resistance after AL treatment. I will further characterize the influence
of sub-therapeutic partner drug levels on the selection of drug resistance. The combination of detailed parasite
strain dynamics, drug pharmacokinetics, and drug resistance analysis has not been conducted to date. My
overarching hypothesis is that a more detailed understanding of the influence of drug exposure and parasite
dynamics on drug resistance selection will enable the optimization of current and future antimalarial regimens.
This fellowship will provide me with an advanced experimental and statistical background in molecular biology
and pharmacology, and will further my development as a physician-scientist with a career at the forefront of
infectious disease treatment and prevention in a global health context."

The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate a high-volume, low-threshold, naloxone-on-release program
serving individuals being released from the Los Angeles County Jail system.
 Opioid-related overdose death is the single largest cause of accidental death in the United States.
Individuals being released from incarceration are at particular risk, with some studies showing their risk of
death in the weeks immediately after release is as much as 129 times that of the general population.
 One intervention demonstrated to reduce opioid-related deaths is training opioid users and those in their
immediate social circles to recognize overdose and to respond by using naloxone, an opioid antagonist which
effectively âreversesâ overdose. Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) programs are now
present in almost every state. However, access to OEND programs has not been equitable, with African
American and Latinx people who use opioids being less likely to access OEND, a particular concern given
opioid-related overdose mortality has increased 114% among Black and 97% among Latinx populations over
the last 5 years compared to 32% among Whites. One recent innovation, ânaloxone-on-releaseâ, aims to
address the particularly high rate of overdoses experienced by individuals being released from incarceration. In
addition, naloxone-on-release has the potential to reach populations underserved by traditional OEND
programs given the over-representation of African American and Latinx people in incarcerated populations
nationwide. At least 28 pilot or early stage naloxone-on-release programs currently exist in the US, however to
date the literature on these programs is largely limited to descriptions of feasibility and logistical issues. A
single paper describes the efficacy of a national-level program in Scotland, which, encouragingly, saw a 36%
drop in the proportion of overdose deaths among releasees in the four weeks following release.
 In January 2020 the Los Angeles Sheriffâs Department implemented a naloxone-on-release program, in
which all inmates being released from the LA County Jail system are exposed to a video training on overdose
recognition and response and are able to take as many doses of naloxone as they wish from a no-cost vending
machine at the point of release. 31,352 doses of naloxone were distributed by the program in 2020, almost
twice as much as every other OEND program in Los Angeles combined, and making it by far the largest such
program in the world (the Scottish program described above distributed 2,273 doses over 3 years).
 We will use an innovative mixed-methods design to capitalize on this timely opportunity, and examine
whether the naloxone-on-release program is serving those most at risk, whether the program reaches
previously underserved populations, how the program impacts the communities to which releasees return, and
whether the program reduces deaths among releasees and in the communities to which they return."

Defining how we form, store, and retrieve memories is one of neuroscienceâs most researched areas. The
hippocampus is a well-characterized forebrain structure with a crucial role in the formation and retrieval of
episodic memory, and is known to be vulnerable to age-related memory dysfunction. Cognitive decline in age
and neurodegenerative disease is an increasing burden on healthcare systems and society at large. To treat the
causes of memory decline in age and age-related disease, the mechanisms by which hippocampal cell
populations form and maintain individual memories over time must be characterized. Decades of research have
shown that new learning results in strengthened synaptic connections between networks of hippocampal
neurons. These distributed connections between cells are believed to make up the physical basis for memories,
often defined as an engram. Significant progress has been made in finding the engram in the brain with the
application of activity-dependent genetic strategies, which isolate populations of cells expressing immediate-
early genes (IEGs), to identify the neurons activated by learning. Subpopulations of neurons expressing the IEG
c-Fos are activated during learning and reactivated during memory recall, so they are often referred to as engram
neurons. Previous studies demonstrated the crucial role of hippocampal engram neurons in memory recall
behavior, and artificial reactivation of these cells in mouse models of aging and Alzheimerâs disease rescued
memory retrieval deficits, pointing to engram cells as a promising target for future interventions to treat memory
deficits. However, the in vivo mechanisms by which these cells store associations, and how their reactivation
drives memory retrieval, have yet to be explored. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will utilize novel
two-photon imaging to combine an inducible c-Fos tagging strategy with large-scale calcium imaging, to
investigate how these cell populations contribute to memory formation. Aim 1 of this project is to characterize
the dynamics of engram cell populations across learning in order to inform our understanding of circuit
mechanisms underlying memory formation in healthy states. This mechanistic understanding will then be utilized
in Aim 2 to define how these processes are negatively impacted by aging. Overall, the aims of this proposal will
contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the circuit mechanisms of hippocampal memory formation
in health and disease, with the potential to inform current treatment strategies for cognitive decline."

Big Data has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and care, but extracting the information it holds on
the optimal strategies for cancer control will require cutting-edge tools in data science. The optimal strategies
for cancer control will be dynamic strategies that adapt clinical decisions over time to a patientâs evolving
clinical history. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods cannot appropriately compare dynamic
strategies, so we need methods specifically designed for this task: g-methods. G-methods have helped to
shape clinical care in many areas, but they have not been systematically applied to cancer research. Further,
while g-methods let us validly estimate the effect of pre-specified strategies, these may not be the optimal
strategies. My overarching goal is to apply and further develop analytic methods to learn the optimal strategies
for cancer control from complex longitudinal data and generate user-friendly, publicly-available software to
make these methods available to the cancer research community.
I will apply these methods to answer key clinical questions across the prostate cancer control continuum: 1) the
optimal dietary and lifestyle strategies to prevent aggressive prostate cancer, 2) the optimal screening strategy
following a baseline PSA test to maximize detection of aggressive disease while minimizing detection of
indolent tumors, and 3) the optimal statin therapy strategy to maximize survival among men with nonmetastatic
prostate cancer. This project will leverage data from a large prospective cohort study and a novel platform of
electronic health records linked with genetic data. I will first apply g-methods to estimate the effects of
recommended strategies for cancer control that a randomized trial would have limited feasibility to evaluate. I
will then investigate whether novel methods that learn the optimal strategies from the data may lead to
improved, targeted recommendations that get the right interventions to the right people at the right time.
This innovative project will advance comparative effectiveness research for cancer care at the cutting edge of
data science. I am optimally positioned to undertake this research based on my 1) expertise in cancer,
epidemiology, and causal inference; 2) exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of global
leaders in their respective fields; and 3) unparalleled research environment to support my career development.
Through this work, I will expand my expertise in new areas, including machine learning. The proposed
research and training will help me achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator
and lead a transdisciplinary research program that integrates causal inference and machine learning to identify
optimal strategies for cancer control. Leveraging rich, existing data, this proposal represents a significant
opportunity to develop, apply, and disseminate powerful methods for big clinical data to accelerate progress in
cancer research and care."

Neural processes that influence school readiness in early childhood, a key time for intervention, and the
cognitive processes that explain how parenting and neural processes influence school readiness remain poorly
understood. There is a critical need to determine how cognitive control and its neural underpinnings develop
and how these are influenced by parenting practices. The long-term goal is to develop more effective science-
based interventions for behavioral and academic problems in children. The overall objective for the proposed
longitudinal project is to determine how specific parenting processes, neural processes, and cognitive control
processes promote school readiness in the transition from preschool to school entry. Our central hypothesis is
that delayed development of cognitive controlâat neural and psychological levelsâresults in cognitive control
deficits in early childhood that prevent automatization and lead to the downstream development of
externalizing and academic problems. Ineffective parenting practices are likely a key cause of delayed
development of cognitive control. The rationale for the proposed research is that a detailed understanding of
mechanistic pathways that explain how parenting and neural processes influence school readiness will enable
the identification of novel strategies to prevent behavioral and academic problems. Guided by strong
preliminary data, we will test the central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify neural indicators
of cognitive control in early childhood that predict development of school readiness, 2) Identify cognitive control
processes that explain how neural processes predict school readiness, and 3) Identify parenting practices that
predict development of neural processes and cognitive control. Aim 1 will determine the extent to which
response inhibition (N2 event-related potential, ERP) and novelty detection (P3 ERP) predict development of
school readiness based on tests of academic skills and reports of externalizing behavior problems by parents
and teachers. Aim 2 will identify the extent to which the neural indicators of cognitive control predict cognitive
control on laboratory tasks, which, in turn, lead to school readiness. Aim 3 will determine the degree to which
parenting sensitivity, autonomy support, and consistency that have been robustly associated with school
readiness predict neural and cognitive control processes that, in turn, predict school readiness. The proposed
research is innovative because it employs a new and transformative method of assessing cognitive control at
multiple levels of analysis (neural and psychological) longitudinally and in relation to parenting and school
readiness in early childhood. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to enable the design
of early intervention and prevention strategies targeted to enhance children's response inhibition and novelty
detection, translating to better cognitive control and school readiness. Ultimately, the results of the proposed
research are expected to help develop strategies that identify and target young children at risk for a lack of
cognitive control skills needed for school readiness and later success."

Articular cartilage lines the surfaces of joints and transmits the forces generated with loading; however, cartilage
can be damaged due to traumatic injury and disease and has a limited natural healing capacity. Although there
have been many advances in the development of cartilage therapies with autologous mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSCs), there is still much work to be done in order to identify the appropriate cell carriers and culture
environments that best promote the formation of functional cartilage. Our general approach for MSC-based
cartilage repair has been to engineer environments that recapitulate key developmental signals. Towards this,
in early funding cycles, we engineered hydrogel environments based on the biomolecule hyaluronic acid (HA),
including controlled degradation, growth factor presentation, and mechanical loading. During the most recent
funding cycle, we tethered and controlled the temporal presentation of a bioactive peptide (HAV) found in N-
cadherin, which is abundant in the developing microenvironment and mediates direct cell-cell communication. In
this renewal, we continue to address developmentally relevant cell-cell signaling, focusing now on indirect
communication mechanisms. Specifically, we recently found that a small fraction of differentiated chondrocytes
improves the amount and quality of matrix formation by MSCs and promotes their phenotypic stability. We further
showed that this phenomenon was the consequence of paracrine vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell signaling from
âbroadcastingâ chondrocytes to âreceiverâ MSCs. Here, we hypothesize that both the production and reception of
these signals is regulated by the microenvironment (matrix stiffness, interaction with developmental ligands, and
molecular diffusivity of the embedding material). To address this novel hypothesis, the first Aim will utilize our
recently developed microenvironmental screening platform to determine the hydrogel formulation that optimally
supports MSC chondrogenesis in co-cultures of MSCs and chondrocytes. This will be achieved by spatially
varying peptide and encapsulating material properties and imaging early markers of chondrogenesis and
cartilage matrix formation to identify optimal environments. In the second Aim, hydrogel formulations that
optimize MSC chondrogenesis in co-cultures will be scaled up and evaluated over longer time courses and when
implemented in an injectable format that is compatible with current clinical workflows. In the third Aim, these
optimized formulations will be arthroscopically administered in clinically-relevant load-bearing porcine focal
cartilage defects to assess the efficacy of this cell delivery system to promote functional repair. Successful
completion of these Aims will identify new translational options for patients suffering from cartilage injuries."

Some of the largest disparities in human papillomavirus vaccination (HPVV) rates exist in rural communities,
which represent missed opportunities for cancer prevention since incidence of HPV associated cancers have
been increasing disproportionately in rural compared to urban areas in the U.S. While there are effective
evidence-based strategies to improve adolescent HPVV rates in clinical practices, current gaps include a lack of
interventions targeting community-based practices and rural populations. Targeted interventions are desperately
needed to expand reach to rural community-based primary care practices to increase HPVV rates and meet the
needs of underserved rural communities where HPVV rates have remained low. To address this gap, we
developed an implementation science focused intervention for rural primary care practices (PC TEACH) that
considers community, culture, and health systems as upstream factors to increase adolescent HPVV rates by
engaging the entire medical team using a practice facilitation approach. In the current proposal, we will test the
effectiveness of our innovative practice-level intervention approach (PC TEACH) to: (i) increase HPV vaccine
uptake and completion rates in adolescent boys and girls, and (ii) lower the average age at vaccination in
community-based primary care practices. We hypothesize that HPVV initiation and completion rates will be
superior after practice facilitation of evidence-based PC TEACH vaccination strategies compared to rates prior
to intervention. We will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design, which conserves sample size while
maintaining power, with an integrated implementation framework, and process and outcome evaluation, to
address the following aims: Aim 1 - Implement and test the effectiveness of practice facilitation of PC TEACH,
using an implementation science approach, on HPVV initiation and completion in rural community-based primary
care practices. Aim 2 - Measure and monitor practice-level characteristics (e.g., size, scope, socioeconomic
environment, and vaccination experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic), and patient-level characteristics
(e.g., gender, age, insurance type, HPV knowledge, child vaccination history, and vaccine hesitancy), to identify
factors that influence HPV vaccine delivery and uptake rates, and may moderate intervention effects. Aim 3 -
Evaluate the extent to which practice facilitation activities most readily lead to adoption and implementation of
the evidence-based PC TEACH vaccination strategies as delivered by the primary care practice site staff. The
proposed study is innovative in that our use of community-engaged methods enhance scalability of the
implementation science intervention in underserved rural primary care settings to enable system changes to
improve HPVV rates. Findings from this study will be essential in understanding how to implement systematic
practice-level changes in rural community-based primary care practices, and how to cultivate a practice culture
supportive of HPVV in rural communities, a population underrepresented despite the observed incongruence of
increasing incidence of HPV-associated disease and low HPVV rates in rural areas in the U.S."
10831084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African American and Latino populations have worse adult health than their White peers (hereafter âhealth
disparitiesâ). These health gaps often begin in childhood, and have persisted, in part, because of continuing
inequalities in the social determinants of health. Far less research has identified population-level interventions
that level the playing field on the social determinants of health across population subgroups. The scant
evidence on effective population-level interventions is a significant barrier to reducing health gaps. Rigorous
prior studies have revealed the plausibility for large-scale nutrition policies to reduce racial/ethnic gaps in
childrenâs academic performanceâa strong predictor of adult educational attainment, which is one of the most
fundamental determinants of health. These studies have illuminated the intermediary mechanisms in the
pathway between school nutrition policies, (junk) food availability in communities near schools and childrenâs
academic performance. No longitudinal studies have thoroughly investigated the population-level influences
on academic performance of nutrition policies together with modifiable characteristics of nearby-school
neighborhoods. This longitudinal study capitalizes on a series of natural experiments generated by Californiaâs
policies to improve nutrition standards for foods and drinks sold to children in schools, and the changes in
nutrition standards for school meals put in place by the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. The study will
determine (a) the effectiveness of population-level school nutrition policy interventions in improving childrenâs
academic performance and reducing related gaps among African American and Latino vs. White peers; (b) the
extent to which modifiable, food-related factors in communities near schools influence longitudinal changes in
academic performance disparities; and (c) if school nutrition policy effectiveness varies by those community
factors. To generate valid inferences about the population-level effectiveness of these policies on academic
performance, this study uses the strongest possible approach to evaluate non-randomized exposures: a
difference-in-differences analysis that includes within-child change in exposures. Difference in difference
analyses will also examine the effects of child-level changes in modifiable characteristics of communities near

use powerful longitudinal data on academic performance among a diverse population of 11.8 million children.

10831085,"Project Summary/Abstract
mTORC1 is a master controller of cell growth/proliferation by regulating essential cellular anabolic
processes, including protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. For mTORC1 activation, while amino acids
recruit mTORC1 to the lysosomal membrane through Rag small GTPases (Rags) activation, growth
factors execute mTORC1 activation on the lysosome by activating Rheb small GTPase, a direct
activator of mTORC1. However, the molecular mechanisms by which lysosomal mTORC1 recruited by
the active Rags finds and interacts with Rheb on the lysosome have not been well understood. We
recently reported that amino acid stimulation increased polyubiquitinated Rheb (Ub-Rheb) levels, which
forms heteromultimers with ubiquitin-free Rheb and displays a strong binding preference for mTORC1,
thereby supporting mTORC1 activation on the lysosome (Yao et al., Mol Cell, 2020). We identified that
Ataxin3 acts as a key lysosomal Ub-Rheb deubiquitinase whose lysosomal localization is mitigated by
amino acid-induced active Rags. We hypothesized that ubiquitin-dependent higher-order of assembly
of Rheb might increase its density on the lysosome membrane and help sequester mTORC1 and its
effectors for activation. However, ubiquitin ligases for Rheb, which generate Rheb polyubiquitination
and support mTORC1 activation, have not been identified. Using Ub-Rheb-interacting proteomics and
lysosome proteomics databases, we identified that both HUWE1 and the Cullin3 ubiquitin ligase
complex interact with Rheb and positively regulate cellular mTORC1 activity without affecting Akt
activity. Our preliminary data indicate that HUWE1 is required for Rheb to interact with both mTORC1
and CAD, a key enzyme for de novo pyrimidine synthesis, of which activity is stimulated by Rheb and
the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway. In this proposal, we will study the molecular mechanisms by which
HUWE1 and the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex coordinately ubiquitinate Rheb and the role of these
ubiquitin ligases in the regulation of mTORC1 activity, de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and cell growth
control. The specific aims of our proposed studies are to: investigate whether and how these ubiquitin
ligases coordinately ubiquitinate Rheb to form catalytically competent Rheb multimers to stimulate
mTORC1 activity (Aim1); to determine the roles and mechanisms of this Ub-Rheb-mTORC1-dependent
signal amplification for specific downstream pathways such as de novo pyrimidine synthesis (Aim2);
study the physiological relevance of this HUWE1/CUL3-Ub Rhab-mTORC1-CAD pathway in the
regulation of cancer cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis such as liver and glomerular epithelial
cells (Aim3). The proposed studies will provide previously unappreciated molecular mechanisms for
mTORC1 activation and insight into the understanding Ub-Rheb-centered membraneless compartment
for amplifying mTORC1-dependent signals for cell growth/proliferation control."

 Obesity rates continue to rise in adolescents, adults, and aging populations leading to greater rates of
chronic disease and comorbid disease conditions across the lifespan. Obesity and associated chronic disease
conditions plague our healthcare system, negatively influence quality of life, and exact a terrible financial toll on
society. Obesity induces pathologies that dramatically increase risk of metabolic disease states, cardiovascular
dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, significant orthopedic limitations, and various forms of cancer. Obesity also
increases risk for chronic debilitating pain conditions and mental health disorders (stress, depression, anxiety).
Evidence over the last 3 decades shows that our current healthcare system is not effective in preventing or
treating obesity and associated complications. Traditional methodologies have largely been ineffective because
they have focused on single mode interventions (exercise, diet, pharmacology) or have not been effectively
translated from the bench to the clinic or the clinic to population level. New research-driven solutions and
therapies that bridge basic biomedical science, clinical, and population health research that are synergistically
aligned and address the multi-modal constructs underlying obesity and co-morbid disease conditions are
needed. Because obesity is central to so many diseases and comorbid conditions, and is increasingly prevalent,
we argue that obesity should be a centerpiece in the training for the next generation of scientists. Our T32
proposal entitled âTranslating Obesity, Metabolic Dysfunction and Comorbid Disease Statesâ will provide
foundational research training to predoctoral graduate students. The T32 training program will have 4 Pre-
Doctoral trainees provided support for ~2 years and will strive to prepare trainees to work with divergent
disciplines and foster synergistic and translational research teams. Trainees will be co-mentored by both basic
science and clinical faculty and will interact with an internal advisory committee with basic, clinical, and
translational scientific expertise. Trainees will take part in a unique training program involving both a diverse set
of activities (seminars, meetings, didactic course work) and customized plans that meet the needs and goals of
each trainee. The University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) has the necessary resources and scientific
environment for this program including an established culture of translational researchers, a well-established
community of federally funded investigators studying obesity and obesity associated comorbid disease
conditions across the lifespan, synergy with the leading healthcare provider in the area (University of Kansas
Health System), and access to a diverse population of research participants significantly impacted by obesity
(urban, rural, various socioeconomic and ethnic groups). We expect that our T32 will provide unique training for
predoctoral candidates, foster new collaborative research networks, and lead to new scientific discoveries for
the treatment and prevention of obesity."

 Twenty million Americans suffer from peripheral nerve injury, which results in approximately
$150 billion health-care expenses annually in the United States. Approximately half of patients treated
with nerve grafts have an inadequate level of function. Twenty million Americans suffer from peripheral
nerve injury, which results in approximately $150 billion health-care expenses annually in the United
States. Among various factors, axon growth rate and the lack of reinnervation and neuromuscular
regeneration are two major road barriers. In many cases, during peripheral regeneration, the muscle
undergoes atrophy and becomes un-receptive to reinnervation, and even the sprouting axons that
regenerate across the gap cannot form functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). While most of the
previous studies focus on accelerating peripheral nerve growth, novel approaches to maintain the
neuromuscular receptivity and delay the degeneration of muscle need to be developed and integrated.
Therefore, an integrative approach that combines the acceleration of axon growth and the prevention
of muscle degeneration is required to address this unmet medical need, and we propose to use
multimodal electrical stimulation (ES) to achieve this goal. Our recent studies have shown that repetitive
ES either at the proximal or distal stumps of transected nerve can be more effective than one-time ES
to further improve the therapeutic outcome, but their relative contributions to and their combined effects
on axon growth, the slow-down of muscle atrophy and reinnervation remain to be investigated.
Therefore, to investigate the potential synergistic effects of proximal and distal ES, we hypothesize
that programmable ES at the proximal and distal stumps of sciatic nerve following a transection injury
can promote axon growth and maintain muscle receptivity respectively and synergize neuromuscular
regeneration. We will test this hypothesis by developing a wireless, stretchable, bioresorbable and
miniaturized system that allows repetitive ES with versatile protocols. To address the aforementioned
challenges and test our hypothesis, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team, and performed pilot
studies to demonstrate the feasibility. We propose three Specific Aims: (1) To develop and
characterize a bioresorbable, stretchable and wireless bioelectronic device for repetitive electrical
stimulation. (2) To determine how the time periods of repetitive proximal and distal ES regulate muscle
functional recovery. (3) To investigate the combined effects of proximal and distal ES on neuromuscular
regeneration. This proposed project is timely with the recent advancement in regenerative engineering,
micro/nanotechnologies, miniaturized wireless point-of-care devices, and bioresorbable and stretchable
electrodes. This innovative bioelectronic device provides a novel and minimally invasive approach for
neuromuscular regeneration, and will have wide applications in regenerative medicine and therapy."

10848843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for about 15% of all cases of lung cancer worldwide, is the most lethal
form of lung cancer. Despite an initially high response rate to chemotherapy and chemoimunotherapy, the
majority of SCLC patients with extensive stage disease invariably relapse within one year. Although SCLC is
currently managed as a single disease with platinum-based chemotherapy remaining the cornerstone of
treatment, studies have identified that SCLC display both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity with distinct
transcriptome changes. However, the specific molecular determinants of response remains unclear, especially
as the tumor evolves from a naÃ¯ve chemo-responsive state to an acquired chemo-resistant state following
chemotherapy. Effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve clinical outcomes.
We will address this knowledge gap in overall Aim 1 by understanding how a critical determinant of
chemosensitivity, Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11), informs the degree of chemo-responsiveness in SCLC
subtypes. In overall Aim 2, we will study how different replication stress response pathways and replication fork
modulators work in concert to regulate chemo-sensitivity. Finally, in overall Aim 3 we will integrate insights
gained from work performed in support of overall Aims 1 and 2 to develop strategies to target replication stress
response pathways in combating acquired chemo-resistance in SCLC to yield deeper and more durable
responses with improved tolerability.
The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project framework with three Core facilities.
The experiments, progress and direction of the science within each Project will be monitored with feedback via
the Administrative Core A. Establishment of different SCLC cell lines, PDX, and GEM models will be supported
by Core B. Advanced microscopy and computational approaches for each project will be supported by Core C.
The Project/Core leaders have complementary expertise: John Poirier (functional genomics, Project 1, Core B),
Tony Huang (molecular biology, Project 2, Core A), Eli Rothenberg (biophysics, Project 3, Core C), David
Fenyo (computational biology, Core C), and Kwok-Kin Wong (cancer biology, Project 4, Core B). This ensemble
of complementary expertise fosters cross-fertilization of ideas beneficial to the whole team, and makes work
possible that can only be accomplished by a Program Project grant. This team also already has a long track
record of productive collaboration. The results obtained by this Program Project will provide a fundamental
advancement in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning DNA replication stress and SCLC
therapeutics, and will pave the way for the design of novel cancer therapy targeting relapsed SCLC patients."

Despite significant advances in neonatal care and implementation of therapeutic hypothermia, term and
preterm survivors of neonatal encephalopathy are at high risk for developing cognitive and learning deficits
even in the absence of functional motor deficits. Recent studies have implicated cerebellar dysfunction with the
long-term learning disorders seen in these children. Impaired Purkinje cell development has been linked to
impairment in cerebellar associative learning. Microglia have been shown to play a major role in the
development of Purkinje cells, the primary output neurons of the cerebellar cortex. Intrauterine inflammation
leads to microglial activation that results in maldevelopment of the Purkinje cells and cerebellar learning
deficits. Activated microglia in the cerebellum overexpress the enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII),
which hydrolyzes the abundant neuropeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG, a specific agonist of the
metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR3) to N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamate. Reduced NAAG levels have
been linked to impaired cognition. This study proposes to specifically target microglial GCPII enzyme using
dendrimer conjugated to the nanomolar potent but poorly brain penetrating GCPII inhibitor 2PMPA (2-
(phosphonomethyl) pentane-1,5-dioic acid) (D-2PMPA). The central hypothesis is that normal microglial
function and dynamics play a critical role in cerebellar development, and inhibiting upregulated GCPII in
activated microglia with D-2PMPA will lead to increased NAAG in the cerebellum enabling normal Purkinje cell
development and improving cerebellar learning and memory in juvenile rabbits exposed to low dose endotoxin
in utero. This will be tested by (1) Evaluating the effects of low dose intrauterine endotoxin exposure on
Purkinje cell development, cerebellar microglial response and cerebellar learning (tested by classical eyeblink
conditioning reflex) in a rabbit model of maternal inflammation induced brain injury. (2) Evaluate efficacy of D-
2PMPA mediated microglial GCPII inhibition on Purkinje cell development and cerebellar learning at 6-8 weeks
of age in rabbits exposed to intrauterine inflammation and (3) Determine mechanisms of cerebellar
neuroprotection by D-2PMPA mediated by NAAG induced activation of mGluR3. This study will provide a
better understanding of how low-grade maternal-fetal inflammation in the perinatal period can lead to
cerebellar learning deficits long term. The proposed work is innovative because it uses a novel and potent D-
2PMPA conjugate to target microglial GCPII for addressing cognitive and learning deficits and enable normal
development of the cerebellum in a rabbit model of perinatal brain injury. This Multi-PI proposal will bring
synergistic expertise in perinatal/neonatal brain injury, neuropharmacology/GCP2 and nanomedicine, and
clinical translation to accomplish these aims. This work can lead to the development of novel therapies to
address learning deficits commonly seen with neonatal brain injury."

The goal of this project is to extend our understanding of the cerebellum, and in particular, how this subcortical
structure contributes to human cognition. Diverse lines of research provide compelling evidence that the
cerebellum is not only involved in sensorimotor control, but also contributes to a range of cognitive functions.
For example, the neuroimaging literature has produced maps of the cerebellum that exhibit a stable functional
organization, with much of the cerebellar cortex showing hemodynamic changes that cannot be attributed to
movement. Moreover, patients with cerebellar disorders exhibit behavioral impairments on tasks assessing
cognitive and affective processing. However, our understanding of the functional role of the cerebellum in
cognitive domains remains rudimentary: Functional hypotheses have either been largely descriptive or targeted
to account for cerebellar function in a relatively narrow, task-specific manner. The research program outlined in
this proposal is designed to address this issue, seeking to develop a mechanistic account of cerebellar
function. Theoretically, the work will be guided by a novel hypothesis, namely that the cerebellum is essential
for processing that requires the continuous transformation of an internal representation, or CoRT(continuous
representational transformation). This hypothesis offers a parsimonious account of how the cerebellum
supports performance in diverse task domains. In the context of sensorimotor control, CoRT would entail
computations required to move a limb from one position to another and to anticipate the sensory
consequences of that movement. In other task domains, the continuous transformation of an internal
representation may optimize anticipatory behavior; for example, perception frequently involves the internal
transformation of the sensory input to account for atypical viewpoints, and social judgments may benefit
continuously simulating the intended actions of another individual. The research program will involve the
integrated use of behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging studies. One major component of the
behavioral work will focus on the performance of individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). This work will
involve traditional on-site experiments spanning a broad range of task domains to test the CoRT hypothesis, as
well as an ambitious on-line testing program. Through an outreach program facilitated by SCA support
networks and collaborations with an international team of researchers, the on-line program should produce a
unique database to provide well-powered tests of functional hypotheses, and examine relationships between
behavioral performance, etiology, and clinical ratings, and relate these measures with region-specific pathology
in the cerebellum. A second major component will build on recent neuroimaging work with healthy young adults
that has provided a comprehensive functional map of the human cerebellum though the use of a large battery
of tasks. This approach will be used to explore constraints on the organization of the functional map by
developing models of cortico-cerebellar connectivity and examining changes over the course of learning. As
with the neuropsychological studies, the neuroimaging studies will yield a rich database to evaluate different
functional hypotheses, as well as establish norms for comparison with atypical populations.

Background: A persistent ~10% of new U.S. HIV infections occur among people who inject drugs (PWID).
Provision of sterile syringes (via syringe service programs [SSPs] and pharmacies) helps prevent injection-
related HIV transmission; however, syringe access is insufficient in many locations, and the majority of PWID
experience substantial overlapping sexual and injection-related HIV risks. As in several geographic regions of
the United States, in the Northeast, increasing injection of opioids, stimulants, and other drugs is causing
renewed concerns about HIV transmission, with CDC declaring HIV outbreaks connected to injection drug use.
Despite the proven efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommendation that PrEP be offered to PWID at risk for HIV acquisition, uptake in this socially marginalized
population remains severely limited. Overview of Proposal: The current proposal is a culmination of extensive
preliminary research, including (a) in-depth qualitative research with PWID across Northeastern communities
affected by opioid use and HIV that documented high HIV risk and low PrEP knowledge but high interest, (b)
key informant interviews with PrEP providers, SSP staff, and other key stakeholders who provided specific
suggestions for PrEP intervention content and delivery strategies, and (c) two pilot randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of PrEP Navigator-delivered behavioral interventions with high risk populations including people who
use drugs and PWID that demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of our proposed
approach. This extensive research has led to the development of the âPrEP for Healthâ intervention.
Conceptual Model: âPrEP for Healthâ is a brief, multi-component behavioral intervention delivered to PWID by
highly trained PrEP Navigators embedded within SSPs that seeks to improve PrEP uptake (primary outcome)
and PrEP adherence and persistence (secondary outcomes) among PWID by increasing HIV and PrEP
knowledge, improving HIV risk perceptions and PrEP interest and motivation, cultivating PrEP use self-efficacy
and behavioral skills, and reducing structural barriers to PrEP use. Overview of Study Design: We propose
testing efficacy of âPrEP for Healthâ in two SSPs in Lawrence and Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, areas
heavily affected by injection-related HIV transmission. We will equally randomize 200 PWID to receive either
(a) the âPrEP for Healthâ intervention, which includes Navigator-delivered, theory-informed HIV and PrEP
education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving and planning, and ongoing PrEP navigation (n=100), or
(b) standard of care (information and referrals; n=100). We will evaluate successful PrEP uptake (via
medical/pharmacy records), adherence (via drug levels in hair), and persistence (via medical/ pharmacy
records) over 12 months. We will also examine the degree to which intervention efficacy occurs through
specific conceptual mediators (e.g., PrEP knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy) and differs according to
hypothesized moderators (e.g., age, gender, sexual risk)."
10848358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood immune-mediated kidney disease. In children, 80% of all cases
are steroid responsive and are referred to as steroid sensitive NS (SSNS), while the other 20% are steroid
resistant (SRNS). SRNS is a major cause of end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis and kidney
transplantation; unfortunately, 60% of patients with SRNS will develop disease recurrence following transplant
and ultimately kidney allograft failure. We and others have demonstrated that variants in Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) genes are associated with NS, signifying that defects in adaptive immunity, involving dysregulation
of both T and B lymphocytes, may be central to NS pathogenesis. While the association between HLA and NS
is strong, previous studies were carried out in small mono-ethnic cohorts using genome wide association chips
with limited coverage of the HLA genes, and variants uncovered account for a small fraction of NS risk. Therefore,
the precise HLA alleles/haplotypes associated with NS remain unknown. To enhance our understanding of NS,
we and others have enrolled over 3,700 multi-ethnic patients with primary, secondary, and post-transplant NS
from major multicenter kidney disease studies. We propose to perform state of the art next generation
sequencing (NGS) of the coding and non-coding regions of major HLA class I and II genes to determine the
relationship between variants in these genes and risk of NS, response to therapy, and disease recurrence
following kidney transplantation. Our overarching hypothesis is that certain HLA alleles/haplotypes
associated with NS can predict pattern of corticosteroid response in primary NS and the risk of disease
recurrence following kidney transplantation. We will test our hypothesis and evaluate potential molecular
mechanisms through the following aims: 1) Identify NS HLA risk alleles/haplotypes using high resolution HLA
NGS in a cohort of multi-ethnic patients and determine the relationship between genotypes and therapy
response, 2) Investigate the association between primary NS HLA risk alleles/haplotypes and secondary causes
of immune-mediated NS (IgA and membranous nephropathy), 3) Determine common structural and functional
motifs within NS HLA risk alleles/haplotypes and non-risk alleles by in-silico modeling and compare gene and
protein expression of these alleles in B lymphocytes and kidneys of patients with NS, and 4) Determine the ability
of known and novel NS HLA risk haplotypes to predict disease recurrence following kidney transplantation.
Significance: The studies proposed in this application will use cutting-edge NGS of major HLA genes to
identify the precise HLA alleles/haplotypes that are associated with NS, therapy response, and disease
recurrence following kidney transplantation. Understanding the intrinsic role of HLA variants and adaptive
immunity dysfunction in NS will lead to identification of novel pathways that are important in disease
pathogenesis and therapy not just for NS, but also for other common glomerular diseases."

 nHSV transmission and risk patterns are counterintuitive. HSV vertical transmission risk is lowest (<1%
of cases) from mothers with long-standing pre-existing genital infections, even with proven recurrence during
birth. >85% of cases arise from a primary maternal infection during birth, and ~15% of cases follow postnatal
infection from the community following birth to a seronegative mother. This risk pattern is consistent with the
hypothesis that protection is conferred through transfer of maternal antibodies. These antibodies cross
the placenta and supplement the underdeveloped fetal and neonatal immune system to protect against
congenital infections. These antibodies also pass in the breast milk. We have shown that maternal antibodies
access fetal and neonatal neural tissues with surprising efficiency and prevent nHSV in mice. We have developed
a novel mouse model wherein we study not only morbidity, mortality and viral burden, but also behavioral
pathologies (testing vision, anxiety, learning and memory) observed in humans following nHSV.
 Our overarching goal, is to explore use of an experimental vaccine (dl5-29), and a therapeutic monoclonal

predoctoral and postdoctoral training for promising clinical psychological scientists. By recruiting
graduate students in clinical psychology who have demonstrated scholarly accomplishments,
we are uniquely positioned to identify and prepare talented psychologists for academic careers.
The specific aims are to provide trainees with: (1) intensive clinical experience with a broad
range of presentation seen in an academic medical center (during a year-long psychology
internship supported by our department); (2) a curriculum that enhances conceptual and
practical skills in clinical research, including instruction in the responsible conduct of research
and a focus on cultural humility in clinical science; and (3) an intensive postdoctoral research
apprenticeship supported by a mentorship team that includes established investigators. To
accomplish these training aims and in response to prior trainee feedback, we have established
a Diversity, Inclusion, Cultural Humility, and Equity (DICE) Initiative that permeates all aspects
of the training program. The program has a demonstrated record of recruiting strong clinical
psychology candidates and a sustained record of successful outcomes. Indeed, among the 16
fellows who have graduated from the program in the last 10 years,13 (81%) transitioned to
primary academic positions, 2 (13%) to individual postdoctoral training awards and 1 is in a
primary clinical position. Most (75%; n = 12) of these recent graduates have had external
research funding, with 8 (50%) competing successfully for NIH career development awards and
3 (23%) receiving support from NIH as principal investigators or co-investigators. Thus, our
program continues to achieve outcomes consistent with the mandate of institutional research
training grants: placement of graduates in academic positions, successful pursuit of
independent research projects, and sustained academic productivity. We are confident this
record of success will continue with additional funding."
10846260,"Project Summary: Experimental pain testing in humans, including both quantitative sensory testing (QST) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is widely used to make inferences about pain processing
mechanisms, including how processing is disrupted in chronic pain. One age-old problem in delivering pain
experimentally is that nociceptors are generally much less sensitive to various physical stimuli (e.g. heating,
pressure, etc.) than innocuous somatosensory receptors. Therefore, experimental pain is almost always evoked
under non-specific conditions in humans. For QST, this means that true, unbiased nociceptive sensitivity cannot
be measured using psychophysical techniques that have provided insight into other sensory modalities. For
fMRI, this means that the brain activity being measured is not specific to nociception, but is instead blended with
innocuous stimulus-evoked activity. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method to selectively
stimulate nociceptors by locating fairly large (>2.56 cm2) naturally occurring areas of skin that are completely
devoid of innocuous warm fibers. By applying noxious heat to these warmth-insensitive regions, we are able to
obtain 1) unbiased measures of nociceptive sensitivity and 2) pure, nociceptive-evoked brain activations. In
addition, we have developed computerized visual analogue scales (VAS) that allow us to assess moment-to-
moment changes in perceived pain, including painful aftersensations, which can then be used to improve
registration of fMRI volumes to patientsâ actual experience of pain in the scanner. To further develop and test
the utility of these methods as novel pain biomarkers, this project will enroll both pain-free individuals and those
with fibromyalgia, a nociplastic pain condition. We hypothesize that at least a subset of patients will display
increased unbiased sensitivity to some aspect of nociception, indicating a measurable bottom-up sensitization.
We will then measure the brainâs response to this nociceptive-specific stimulus using fMRI, and compare with
brain activity from stimulation of nearby areas with normal warmth sensitivity. Continuous visual analogue scale
(VAS) ratings of pain of these noxious heat stimuli will help us model each individualâs pain experience and
properly account for the painful aftersensations experienced by many fibromyalgia patients. Instruments and
software programs used in this study will be made readily available to the pain community for use in future
research. Success in this project could also lead to development of a new clinical device for assessing
nociception and pain in isolation."

10851740,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a highly potent, neuroparalytic poison that cleaves presynaptic SNARE
proteins required for neurotransmitter release. The primary toxic effect of BoNT poisoning is blockade of
neuromuscular transmission, leading to flaccid paralysis and death by respiratory arrest. There are no specific
countermeasures capable of reversing symptomatic botulism. Current treatment strategies for lethal exposures
are limited to post-exposure prophylaxis via passive immunoglobulin therapy, which cannot prevent respiratory
collapse once botulism symptoms emerge, and supportive care. In the event of a large-scale botulism outbreak
or deliberate attack, there is limited ability to maintain large numbers of symptomatic victims on artificial
ventilation for weeks or longer. Consequently, development of effective therapeutics for respiratory paralysis is
a high priority for public health and national defense. A major limitation in creating an effective therapeutic for
botulinum poisoning has been the inability to identify post-exposure treatments that block or terminate the
molecular toxicity of the BoNT light chain (LC) within the nerve terminal. This project aims to develop a new class
of botulism antidotes that exploit the natural neuronal receptors and trafficking pathways normally employed by
the targeted toxin itself. Unlike available antibody-based therapeutics and small molecule inhibitors of the light
chain metalloprotease, the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)âbased therapeutics that we have developed can reach
an intracellular target in a postâexposure setting. Unlike conventional small molecule therapeutics, which would
equally affect all cells in the body with potentially deleterious side effects, the proposed method will specifically
deliver a therapeutic moiety only to the cytosol of the target cells (neurons). This is a unique approach toward
treating not only botulism, as embodied in this proposal, but also infectious and neurodegenerative diseases in
which the causative agents reside and exert their action intra-neuronally. The team of scientists assembled for
this project includes researchers with unique expertise who are well-qualified for the task at hand, including a
long and successful history in generating BoNT-neutralizing nanobodies, extensive expertise in expressing
neuron-targeted physiologically active fusion proteins that use metalloprotease-inactivated BoNT/C1 as a
molecular vehicle for delivery of nanobodies, expertise in test systems for development of compounds promoting
accelerated degradation of intracellular targets through the endogenous proteasomal system, and extensive
experience in developing in vitro and in vivo models that can be used to test novel botulism antidotes."
10851742,"The pathogenesis and natural history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are fundamentally
different, but the two diseases result in many common long-term complications. Most notably, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for individuals with diabetes, resulting in a shortened life expectancy.
While rigorous blood glucose management reduces the risk for CVD development, the vast majority of diabetes
patients are unable to meet recommended HbA1c targets. Given the high prevalence of diabetes (10.5%) and
pre-diabetes (33%) in the United States (U.S.), it is imperative to understand diabetes-related CVD pathogenesis
to support the development of optimal intervention and treatment strategies. However, studies comparing CVD
mechanisms in T1D versus T2D are critically lacking. To address this, we propose to establish a Cardiovascular
Repository-Type 1 Diabetes (CARE-T1D) program to facilitate collaboration and multi-modal data acquisition
across a large network of investigators. Through our leadership of 6 organ procurement and biospecimen sharing
research programs, we have 15 consecutive years of operational experience and well-established programmatic
infrastructure for collecting and distributing 16 different types of transplant-quality tissue from human organ
donors, including a recently concluded kidney project and current heart pilot program. We will leverage our
productive relationships with all 57 U.S. Organ Procurement Organizations, centralized 24/7/365 Call Center and
Organ Processing and Pathology Core to procure, to swiftly process and bank a complete CVD-related tissue
panel (heart, kidney, vasculature, blood) from 60 donors with CVD, evenly distributed across three groups (T1D,
T2D, age/sex-matched no-diabetes controls). Following whole organ radiology and calcium scoring, anatomical
dissection will be systematically performed by our highly experienced staff to prepare biospecimens in a variety
of formats (e.g., FFPE blocks, OCT blocks, flash-frozen), with protocols evolving to support emerging needs for
research applications. Each case will be subjected to tissue-specific stains with histopathologic examination by
board certified pathologists and QA/QC analysis. Resulting data will be made available alongside de-identified
donor information and medical records in a secure searchable Data Portal to aid investigators in selecting sample
sets for their research. We propose to establish a Scientific Advisory Board to evaluate research proposals and
sample requests, modeled after our existing Tissue Prioritization Committee. We will distribute biosamples to
approved researchers seeking to apply multimodal approaches for deep phenotyping of specimens to study CVD
progression in T1D vs T2D. The Data Portal will also support visualization and sharing of all externally generated
data types. Finally, we will organize annual meetings to promote collaboration across the Cardiovascular
Biorepository Consortium. In sum, we expect the proposed CARE-T1D program will support discovery and
mechanistic research, conducted by a collaborative network of investigators, that will increase our understanding
of CVD in diabetes, leading to early detection as well as novel treatments specific for both T1D and T2D."

This application proposes a pilot feasibility randomized trial of the USDA Healthy Mediterranean-style Food
Pattern versus standardized guidance on fiber intake for patients with diverticulitis in response to PAS-20-160,
Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK. Diverticulitis is one of the most
common gastrointestinal indications for inpatient hospital admission, outpatient clinic and emergency room visits,
and colon surgery. At least 20% of individuals with an initial episode of diverticulitis will have one or more painful
and unpredictable recurrences. Unfortunately, there is no proven pharmacologic means to decrease the risk of
diverticulitis. Large, prospective, observational studies have identified diet and lifestyle risk factors for incident
diverticulitis. In one study, men who adhered to a low-risk profile (< 51g/day red meat, >23g/day fiber, 2 hours
exercise/week, normal BMI, and never smoked) were 75% less likely to develop incident diverticulitis. However,
these modifiable risk factors have not been evaluated for secondary prevention. Studies of diet and plasma
inflammatory markers suggest that chronic, systemic inflammation is a potential mechanism that underlies the
dietary effects on diverticulitis development. The Mediterranean diet pattern is comparable to diets associated
with primary prevention of diverticulitis, is more strongly associated with reduced inflammation, and is familiar to
providers and many patients. Thus, we propose to conduct a randomized trial (n=75) of a USDA Healthy Med-
style Food Pattern versus standardized guidance on fiber intake for patients with diverticulitis to evaluate the
feasibility of this dietary intervention including willingness to randomize and adherence to a Med-style dietary
pattern. We will employ state-of-the-art behavioral interventions in the form of electronic feedback to improve
health-related behaviors and support dietary customization based on participantâs budget, dietary preferences,
and restrictions. We will also examine plasma inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and
interleukin-1Î²) and fecal calprotectin at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The proposed feasibility trial will set the
groundwork for a large multicenter RCT of a food patternâbehavioral intervention versus standardized guidance
on fiber intake in patients with a history of diverticulitis. It will also expand our knowledge of inflammation and
diverticulitis pathogenesis and gather prospectively collected samples for future biomarker study. Ultimately,
given the prevalence and morbidity of diverticulitis and the lack of predictive and preventative measures,
identifying a proven means of secondary prevention and a biomarker of risk would change treatment paradigms
and improve the lives of millions of patients with diverticulitis."
10851744,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Connectivity between neurons as part of neural networks governs information flow through the nervous system
and therefore shapes behavioral output. Guidance of axon to their correct targets is a key step in neural circuit
assembly during embryonic development, and understanding this process is critical, as neuronal miswiring can
cause circuit dysfunction and disease. We report identification of a novel axon guidance cue, WFIKKN2, as a
ligand for several DCC family receptors and propose to investigate the biochemical nature of these signaling
complexes and their functions in neuronal wiring. DCC is a receptor for the attractive axon guidance cue Netrin-
1, and this ligand-receptor pair shapes neuronal connectivity in organisms as diverse as nematodes and humans.
In vertebrates, the DCC family comprises five members, and Netrins can bind two of these â DCC and Neogenin.
Three additional family members â Punc, Nope, and Protogenin â have diverged considerable over the course
of evolution, do not bind Netrins, and their functions in axon guidance have remained elusive. We found that the
secreted multi-domain protein WFIKKN2 binds Punc, Nope, and Protogenin, but not DCC and Neogenin. We
provide evidence that developing sensory and motor neurons express these newly identified receptors for
WFIKKN2, while WFIKKN2 is expressed in multiple tissues in the body periphery. Additional preliminary results
show that WFIKKN2 acts as an attractant for motor axons and a repellant for sensory axons, and phenotype
analysis of WFIKKN2 knockout mice strongly supports the idea that WFIKKN2-mediated repulsion helps sensory
axons navigate to their peripheral targets. We propose a multidisciplinary approach to study WFIKKN2 and its
receptors further and test hypotheses about their functions in neural circuit formation. We will use protein
interaction assays to map the domains mediating ligand-receptor interactions and determine how ligand binding
specificity arises within the DCC family. We will also combine axon guidance assays using cultured neurons with
functional manipulations to dissect the contributions of Punc, Nope, and Protogenin to WFIKKN2-dependent
axon attraction and repulsion, and we will use biochemical approaches to identify downstream mediators of
WFIKKN2 signaling. To elucidate the axon guidance functions of WFIKKN2 and its receptors in vivo, we will
employ mouse genetics and state-of-the-art neuroanatomical methods. Our work will uncover mechanisms of
motor and sensory axon guidance, and it expands the known molecular toolkit for neuronal wiring by discovering
a novel, bifunctional axon guidance cue and its receptors. Our studies further have the potential to identify new
intracellular mediators of guidance cue signaling. In the long term, our work can help elucidate how the
evolutionary diversification of axon guidance receptor gene families may allow the wiring of more complex
nervous systems. Overall, by providing important insights into mechanisms of neuronal wiring, this research will
contribute to our understanding of neurodevelopmental disease etiology, and it can aid in the development of
novel therapeutic approaches for neural circuit repair and nerve regeneration in various disease states."
10851749,"Leptin was identified as a potential feedback signal in the regulation of energy balance in 1994,
but little progress has been made in using leptin to prevent or reverse human obesity. This may
be due to a failure to fully understand the central mechanisms by which leptin can control food
intake which can only be evaluated when they are functioning normally. Control of energy
balance is often investigated in models in which components of the system have been genetically
modified, the animal has been fed an obesogenic diet or pharmacologic doses of leptin are used
to investigate an endogenous physiologic system. Preliminary data using threshold doses of
leptin in normal weight animals demonstrate the presence of a leptin sensitive pathway that
inhibits food intake when circulating leptin concentrations rise above basal levels as a signal of
positive energy balance. We have demonstrated that activation of leptin receptors in the
hindbrain nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) lowers the threshold for activation of hypothalamic
leptin receptors through a neural network. This effect is most dramatic in the dorsomedial
ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHdm), where there is a 3-fold increase in leptin
receptor activation. Additional experiments demonstrated that loss of NTS leptin-receptor
expressing cells raised the threshold for a hypothalamic response to leptin and that loss of leptin
receptor expressing cells in the VMHdm abolished weight loss caused by hindbrain infusions of
leptin. Based on these data and evidence that hypothalamic leptin suppresses food intake by
amplifying the response to peripheral satiety signals, we hypothesize that small increases in
circulating leptin amplify the response to peripheral satiety signals through a circuit in which
NTS leptin enhances VMHdm leptin sensitivity. This application will establish the function and
anatomy of the hypothesized network. The first Aim will test whether activation of VMHdm
leptin receptors amplifies the response to peripheral satiety signals. The second Aim will test
whether these receptors protect against diet-induced obesity. The third Aim will use tract
tracing to identify the organization of the proposed neural network and in situ hybridization to
identify the neurochemical phenotype of leptin receptor-expressing neurons in the NTS and
VMHdm. Successful completion of these Aims will provide new information on the synergy
between long-term signals of energy balance and peripheral short-term satiety signals as an
integral component of a network that facilitates precise control of energy balance."

Parks are a key feature of the built environment that foster community engagement, make communities vibrant, 
and support resident wellbeing. This study will test the impact on community-level health-related quality of life 
and mental health of a community-engaged, community-level intervention that aims to improve park-based 
health and social programming. The study will leverage neighborhood parks that have recently been redesigned 
and renovated as part of the Community Parks Initiative, a capital investment and park equity program in New 
York City. We aim to work with eight lower income and predominantly Latino and Black neighborhoods through 
an asset-based and human-centered design process to co-create and implement one health and one social 
strategy in each neighborhood park. The health strategy will focus on physical activity and the social strategy will 
seek to enhance social relationships and networks in each neighborhood. Achieving broad reach, inclusivity, and 
sustainability are key factors that will be taken into account in the design process. The eight neighborhoods will 
be cluster-randomized to one of two steps in a stepped wedge intervention trial. The intervention is 24 months 
in each community, with follow-up to 48 months. We will study outcomes, including HR-QoL, depression, 
anxiety, stress and loneliness, at the community level (not among individuals participating in park activities) via 
random, representative samples of adult residents in participating communities at intervention baseline and 
months 24 and 48 post-baseline.In addition, we will examine whether the intervention effects might be mediated 
through social cohesion, neighborhood ties, sense of community, park use and perception and/or health 
behaviors such as physical activity and sleep. Finally, we will conduct qualitative research to examine the 
implementation of the community-level intervention based on constructs from the Consolidated Framework for 
Implementation Research. Study findings will help inform future best practices in urban community 
development and park programs and policies to promote population health and reduce health disparities."
10851983,"ABSTRACT
Asparaginase, an antileukemic enzyme that depletes the nonessential amino acid asparagine, is a core
component of front-line therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemias. However, the development of resistance to
asparaginase-based therapy is a common problem with a poor prognosis, and the biology underlying
asparaginase response and resistance is not well understood. Using a genome-wide genetic screen, we recently
found that Wnt pathway activation profoundly sensitizes drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase. This effect
occurs in distinct treatment-resistant subtypes of acute leukemia, including T-ALL, hypodiploid B-ALL, and acute
myeloid leukemia, but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Asparaginase sensitization is independent of
the canonical Î²-catenin branch of Wnt signaling. Instead, this effect is mediated by Wnt-dependent stabilization
of proteins (Wnt/STOP), an understudied branch of Wnt signaling that inhibits GSK3-dependent protein
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Inhibiting the alpha isoform of GSK3 is sufficient to phenocopy this
effect. In vivo, the combination of GSK3Î±-selective inhibition and asparaginase has profound therapeutic activity
against patient-derived xenografts that are completely resistant to monotherapy with either agent. Thus,
asparaginase-resistant leukemias survive treatment with this enzyme by relying on protein degradation, a
catabolic source of amino acids, to replenish the pool of intracellular asparagine. This adaptive response is
blocked by Wnt pathway activation, or by selective inhibition of GSK3Î±. However, the molecular determinants
of response and resistance to the combination of GSK3Î± inhibition and asparaginase are unknown. These
knowledge gaps are major obstacles to the rational application of this potent therapeutic combination for maximal
clinical benefit, which will be addressed by investigating the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the molecular
basis for the therapeutic index of GSK3Î± inhibition and asparaginase, and 2) Investigate why asparaginase
resistance is solely dependent on GSK3Î±, when its closely related paralog GSK3Î² is redundant for regulation of
canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Successful completion of this proposal is expected to reveal major insights
into the cellular response to amino acid starvation and its interaction with Wnt signaling. These processes are
fundamental to metazoan biology, yet their molecular regulation and therapeutic exploitation remain poorly
understood. We are uniquely poised to translate these advances into highly innovative and effective therapeutic
strategies to maximize the therapeutic index of asparaginase in cancer therapy."

Successful HIV treatment programs in Botswana and elsewhere in southern Africa have led to dramatic
reductions in mortality from tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and other non-cancer AIDS deaths. However, cancer
deaths have not decreased, and cervical cancer now is the leading cause of death for women living with HIV in
the region. Cervical cancer is preventable with early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions but
challenges of limited access to initial screening, poor performance of initial screening technologies, high
prevalence of cervical precancers, and persistent or relapsed dysplasia following therapy impair the impact of
programs for women living with HIV. Working to develop strategies to these challenges, we will establish the
Botswana CASCADE Clinical Trials Site at BHP that will participate in and contribute to the following high-
impact areas of research: 1) Enhancing cervical precancer screening uptake through patient and context
relevant approaches, including HPV self-sampling, non-clinical screening venues, and screening during
antenatal care; 2) Strategies and novel technologies to improve management of positive HPV initial screening
maximize prevention of invasive cancer while minimizing patient risk and consumption of health system

10832007,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pancreatic cancer accounts for approximately 3% of all cancers in the United States
and approximately 7% of all cancer related deaths. New treatment paradigms are direly needed. Emerging tumor
ablation techniques have shown significant promise in both clinical and pre-clinical cancer studies. This proposal
will focus on histotripsy, which is the first non-invasive, non-ionizing, non-thermal, image-guided tumor ablation
modality that destroys tumors through the precise control of acoustic cavitation and is capable of overcoming
many of the limitations of the other tumor ablation modalities currently under development for this malignancy.
Recently, our research team completed proof-of-concept studies demonstrating that histotripsy is effective at
targeting the pancreas and produces consistent, fast, and complete ablations, even in proximity to critical
structures. Intriguingly, work by our team and others has also shown that histotripsy is effective in inducing
systemic anti-tumor responses, resulting in post-treatment tumor regression both locally and at metastatic sites.
However, the exact mechanism and level of control of this phenomenon is still unclear. The objective of this
proposal is to utilize our pre-clinical mouse and novel pig animal models to expand upon the preliminary data
presented in this proposal to generate critical mechanistic, safety, and efficacy data necessary to support future
clinical trials in pancreatic cancer patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that histotripsy can achieve safe and
selective focal ablation of pancreatic tumors and improve systemic anti-tumor immune responses. SPECIFIC
AIM 1: Determine histotripsy treatment parameters for precise and complete pancreatic tumor ablation.
Our preliminary data demonstrates the general feasibility of histotripsy ablation in the pancreas. This Aim will
test the hypothesis that histotripsy can achieve precise, efficient, and complete ablation of pancreatic tumors
without injuring critical structures, such as major blood vessels, bile ducts, and intestines. SPECIFIC AIM 2:
Establish histotripsy treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer that optimize tumor ablation and
systemic anti-tumor immune responses. This Aim will test the hypothesis that histotripsy is an effective
treatment modality for precise and complete pancreatic tumor ablation in vivo. We also postulate that due to the
unique features of histotripsy, focal tumor ablation results in predictable and tunable systemic anti-tumor host
immune responses reducing metastatic burden and preventing recurrence. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Define histotripsy
treatment parameters and determine its safety profile utilizing physiologically and clinically relevant
porcine models of pancreatic cancer. Pigs better mimic human patients in terms of anatomy, size, and
instrument scale. This Aim will test the hypothesis that histotripsy parameters can be established to effectively
ablate orthotopic pancreatic tumors under physiologically and clinically relevant in situ conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE: The studies outlined in this proposal will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of histotripsy for
pancreatic cancer ablation and will provide critical data necessary for clinical translation to human patients."

also train our students to be mentors. Our proposal seeks 10 annual training positions which will fund students
in their second and third year of graduate school. Our 20 year old program has trained many scientists who have
gone onto high-impact, research-related careers."
10832105,"ABSTRACT
Intestinal Epithelial Cells (IEC) provide the first line of defense against enteric pathogenic bacteria. However
bacterial pathogens developed different strategies to colonize intestinal epithelium causing severe
gastrointestinal disorder. One strategy, used by âattaching and effacingâ bacteria (AEB), such as
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), involves bacterial adhesion to IEC
without entering the host cells. The other strategy used by adherent Invasive E. coli (AIEC) or Salmonella
results in bacterial internalization into IEC. These different colonization routes bear a key mechanistic
similarity: they require rearrangements of the epithelial actin cytoskeleton to enable bacterial attachment and
invasion. One important but understudied mechanism of pathogen-induced cytoskeletal remodeling involves a
major actin cytoskeleton motor, non-muscle myosin II (NM-II). Our preliminary data demonstrate a striking
dualism of NM-II-dependent regulation of bacterial-IEC interactions. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of
NM-II increases AEB attachment to IEC, but inhibits AIEC invasion in vitro and in vivo. These contrasting roles
of NM-II in IEC-bacterial interactions likely reflect exploiting two different NM II-dependent functions: its actin
filament contractility and actin filament cross-linking activity, by different pathogens. This exciting data provides
a scientific premise for the following innovative hypothesis: NM-II plays a dual role in regulating enteric
pathogen interactions with intestinal epithelium by inhibiting AEB attachment to epithelial cells, but
promoting epithelial entry of invading pathogenic bacteria.
This hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: (1) to determine the roles of NM-II in regulating intestinal
epithelial cell interactions with attaching and effacing bacteria; (2) to dissect the mechanisms of NM-II-driven
internalization of invading bacteria into intestinal epithelial cells. We will study EPEC, EHEC, AIEC and
Salmonella colonization of model IEC cell lines, organoid-derived IEC monolayers in vitro and intestinal
colonization by Citrobacter rodentium, AIEC and Salmonella in vivo. NM-II activity will be modulated by
pharmacologic and genetic approaches. The genetic approach will target two major epithelial NM-II isoforms,
NM-IIA and NM-IIC, by selectively downregulating their expression in human IEC using CRISPR/Cas9 gene
editing and RNA interference. In vivo NM-II functions will be examined by using mice with either intestinal
epithelial specific knockout of NM-IIA, or total knockout of NM-IIC. To determine which NM-II activity is
essential for bacterial-IEC interactions, we will utilize IEC cells and transgenic mice expressing NM-IIA mutants
deficient in either actin filament cross-linking, or filament contraction activities. Significance: the proposal will
reveal novel insights into understanding how the intestinal epithelium controls pathogenic bacterial infections

Dysregulation of the insulin signaling pathway has been linked to metabolic disorders, such as diabetes 4. As type 2 diabetes affects more than 400 million people worldwide 5, understanding the signaling pathways impacting this disease is of paramount importance. Genetic mutations of the insulin receptor (IR) cause rare and severe insulin resistance 6. Yet, the causes of insulin resistance seen in type 2 diabetes are numerous and the mechanisms are multifactorial leaving many unanswered questions.
Upon insulin binding at the plasma membrane (PM), IR triggers the activation of bifurcated signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT pathway for metabolism and the MAPK pathway for growth. Active IR is then internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis 7. The IR endocytosis has been extensively studied for decades 7. Yet, how cell surface levels of functional IR in the basal and insulin-stimulated states are regulated, how IR trafficking affects the activation of specific signaling pathway in vivo, and how dysregulation of IR trafficking contributes to human insulin resistance remain largely unclear. Answering these questions requires identifying specific mediators and regulators of IR endocytosis, and a mechanistic understanding of the IR endocytic pathways in an animal model.
Our long-term goal is to understand how systemic IR signaling controls metabolic homeostasis and genome stability. Our recent studies show that MAD2, a key mitosis regulator, cooperates with IR substrate (IRS) to promote IR endocytosis through the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 to the IR 8-10. Mechanistically, MAD2 constitutively binds to the IR through a well-conserved MAD2-interacting motif (MIM). The MAD2 inhibitor p31comet blocks the MAD2-dependent AP2 recruitment to IR. A phosphorylation switch of IRS controlled by MAPK and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 ensures selective internalization of insulin-activated IR. Targeting this feedback regulation prolongs the metabolic branch of IR signaling and improves insulin sensitivity in mice. Our preliminary data show that IR4A/4A mice (deficient for MAD2-binding and endocytosis) are resistant to diet-induced insulin resistance. We found that MAD2 is also required to keep ATP-binding-deficient IR (kinase dead) mutants in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We hypothesize that mitotic regulators maintain metabolic homeostasis by exerting spatiotemporal control of IR signaling inside the cell. To test this, we will:
AIM 1. Establish the physiological function of IR spatiotemporal control by MAD2. Our preliminary data show that IR4A/4A mice, in which IR cannot bind to MAD2, display delayed IR endocytosis and prolonged IR signaling. We hypothesize that IR trafficking by MAD2 controls glucose and lipid metabolism. We will analyze the metabolic phenotypes of IR4A/4A mice, using wild-type (WT), liver-specific-p31-/- (liver-p31-/-), and liver-IR-/- mice as controls. We will also test the role of IR spatiotemporal control in metabolism using chemical inhibitors of SHP2 in mice and cultured cells.
AIM 2. Determine the mechanism by which IR-MAD2 binding promotes hepatic lipogenesis. mTOR complex (mTORC) promotes lipid synthesis through activation of SREBP1 in the liver 11,12. mTORC1 also attenuates IR signaling by negative feedback loops 13-17. Our preliminary data show that IR4A/4A mice display hepatic defects in SREBP1 activation and de novo lipogenesis, although the PI3K-AKT pathway (an important activator of mTORC1) is enhanced in the liver. We hypothesize that IR trafficking by MAD2 promotes hepatic lipogenesis through the mTORC-SREBP1 pathway or through the negative feedback loops. We will test if endocytosed IR can still retain partial activity, and signal locally to promote lipogenesis. If so, then we will identify molecular targets of the endocytosed IR kinase required to control lipogenesis in the liver. We will also examine the role of IR-MAD2 binding in the mTORC1-dependent negative feedback loops in both mice and cultured cells.
AIM 3. Elucidate the mechanism of quality control and trafficking of IR by MAD2 and PTP1B. The receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B is implicated in the regulation of IR signaling at the PM and in the ER 18-22. Our preliminary results show that an ATP-binding-deficient IR mutant, but not catalytic dead IR mutants, is retained in the ER. Strikingly, both disruption of the IR-MAD2 interaction and knockout of PTP1B lead to release the ATP- binding-deficient IR mutant from the ER. We hypothesize that PTP1B and MAD2 increase functional IR levels at the PM by sequestering ATP-binding-deficient IR in the ER. We will probe whether MAD2 and p31comet facilitate IR-PTP1B interaction in the ER and promote degradation of the retained IR. If so, then we will determine how MAD2-PTP1B controls such degradation. By determining the structure of PTP1B-IR-MAD2-p31comet complex by cryo-EM, we will elucidate the mechanism by which MAD2-PTP1B regulates IR quality control and trafficking.
Our innovative approach combining mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, cryo-EM, and genomics to investigate the roles of mitotic regulators in metabolic homeostasis will advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism(s) governing spatiotemporal IR signaling. Importantly, both the IR signaling and the spindle checkpoint machinery are highly conserved from mice to hu lts will aid in the development of clinical applications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."

Many agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Service (CMS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have identified (Alzheimerâs Disease and
related dementias (ADRD) as a top research priority. This is driven by the high burden of ADRD on patients
and society. In 2020, the estimated societal cost of ADRD was more than $300 billion and the projected annual
economic cost of ADRD will exceed $1,500 billion by 2050. To address this, the National Institute on Aging
calls for the development of short courses on interdisciplinary behavioral and social sciences research on
Alzheimerâs Disease and related dementias to improve the skills of the ADRD workforce in treating this disease
(RFA-AG-22-010).
In response to this call, scientists at Indiana University (IU) propose to launch the Agile Nudge University
program. The aims of the program are to establish a diverse network of highly engaged scientists who
specialize in treatment and research for Alzheimerâs Disease and related dementias and to develop virtual
curriculum to train a racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse workforce to conduct projects on health
equity and anti-racism in ADRD care. The expert team of ADRD scientists at IU have been developing
curriculum in the emerging field of Agile Science for the past ten years, equipping researchers and healthcare
leaders with tools, adaptive processes, and agile strategies for designing, implementing, and spreading
sustainable ADRD solutions that leverage behavior change principles. This has prepared Indiana University to
be the Agile Nudge University programâs hub to deliver training for skills development in Agile Innovation, Agile
Implementation, and Agile Diffusion of behavioral nudges with the main goal of the program of improving
ADRD care. The program will offer comprehensive interdisciplinary mentoring and collaboration opportunities
for diverse graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career, midcareer, and senior faculty interested
in ADRD research. It will also provide an online platform, supporting an open-source online library of individual
tested nudges and general theory-based nudge strategies, group-based problem-solving sessions.
The high costs of treating Alzheimerâs disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible
and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Training the ADRD workforce in the
effective design and implementation of interventions will bridge the gap between the bookshelf and real-world
application within the healthcare system."

Serotonin and dopamine dysfunction have been long implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression.
However, to date, delineating the role of these neuromodulators in depression has largely and necessarily
relied on inference, with neuroimaging (including PET, fMRI, EEG) studies revealing responses in brain
regions associated with dopamine and serotonin release and medications targeting the dopaminergic and
serotoninergic systems improving symptoms for some individuals. In order to make significant advances in
understanding the neural underpinnings of depression and developing novel therapeutics for the disorder,
tracking neuromodulator responses quickly, accurately, and in vivo is required.
Recent advances allow exactly the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high
temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, we are able to directly and simultaneously measure
dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 10 ms) required to
examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. The product of these
advances is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application
merges the clinical and affective neuroscience expertise of MPI Chiu with these advances of MPI Montague to
directly examine the relationship of dopamine and serotonin responses to depression.
To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant
epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. The depth electrodes
are implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Techâs medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Project Co-I
Witcher; Carilion Clinic clinical site PI). During recording, participants will be in a standard (i.e., non-surgical)
hospital monitoring suite and perform i) an affective processing task (emotional Stroop) and ii) a value-based
learning task (two-arm bandit) that have been shown by our group and others both to engage processes
thought to be related to serotonin and dopamine function, and also to be related to negative mood and
anhedonia symptoms, respectively, of depression."

Rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene account for approximately 10% of all human
leukemias. Such rearrangements are more common in pediatric leukemias. Up to 80% of infant acute
lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 35-50% of infant acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by MLL
rearrangements. MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia patients have particularly poor response to standard
treatments and a dismal prognosis. To date, no effective targeted therapies have been approved for treating
these deadly cancers. WD40 repeat domain protein 5 (WDR5) is an essential subunit of the MLL1 histone
methyltransferase complex (MLL1 complex) and is crucial for MLL1 complex-mediated regulations of gene
transcription. WDR5 also interacts with non-MLL partners such as c-MYC. Importantly, interactions between
WDR5 and its various binding partners are essential for sustaining oncogenesis, and genetic depletion of WDR5
suppresses the proliferation of MLL-r leukemias. Therefore, WDR5 is a promising drug target for MLL-r
leukemias. However, while small-molecule inhibitors that effectively block the protein-protein interactions (PPI)
between WDR5 and its binding partners have been developed, these WDR5 PPI inhibitors are largely ineffective
in killing MLL-r leukemia cells and lack in vivo efficacy, as opposed to the cell killing effect of WDR5 genetic
knockout or knockdown. We hypothesize that pharmacological degradation of WDR5 by small-molecule
degraders as a novel therapeutic strategy will be effective and superior to pharmacological inhibition of WDR5
by PPI inhibitors for the treatment of MLL-r leukemias. To test this hypothesis, we propose to discover first-in-
class WDR5 small-molecule degraders using the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology and
evaluate them in MLL-r leukemia cellular and mouse models. We have generated very promising preliminary
results, suggesting that the proposed research is feasible. The WDR5 PROTAC degraders generated in this
project will not only help us test our innovative therapeutic hypothesis, but can also be developed further into a
drug candidate for advancing to clinical trials with MLL-r leukemia patients. These WDR5 PROTACs are also
valuable chemical probes for assessing the therapeutic potential of WDR5 degradation in other cancers."

Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection
remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to
advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by
participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's
Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will
provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development
and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science
agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV.
We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex
with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large
minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in
WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With
availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of
approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the
MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the
WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active
role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims,
frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and
clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore
cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression,
and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex
differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on
exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and
immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate
immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies
and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral
predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance
use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5.
Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot
studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research."
10832042,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Currently no successful
treatment for ALD is available. The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury is characterized by
hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Cells can
adapt and protect themselves in response to stress by activating cellular protective mechanisms such as
autophagy and lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, these protective mechanisms are
impaired after chronic alcohol consumption. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which chronic
alcohol impairs autophagy are not known. In our preliminary studies, we found that chronic plus acute
alcohol binge (âGao-bingeâ) inactivates transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal
biogenesis, resulting in impaired lysosomal biogenesis and insufficient autophagy. Overexpression of
TFEB protects against but knockdown of TFEB exacerbates Gao-binge alcohol-induced liver injury in
mice. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms for how alcohol impairs lysosomal
biogenesis in hepatocytes, in order to identify steps in the protective pathway that are points for
intervention in alcoholic liver disease. The objective of this proposal is to understand how alcohol
metabolism activates mTOR results in TFEB inactivation and how genetic and pharmacological activation
of TFEB protects against alcohol-induced liver injury. The two specific aims that we propose are: 1) to
determine the mechanisms by which Gao-binge alcohol inactivates TFEB in hepatocytes; and 2) to
determine the mechanism(s) by which TFEB protects against alcohol-induced liver injury. Understanding
the mechanisms by which alcohol impairs TFEB-mediated autophagy as well as lysosomal and
mitochondrial biogenesis may ultimately help to develop novel interventions on the improvement of the
pathogenesis of ALD.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Alcohol abuse and consumption are major causes of alcoholic liver disease, which has high morbidity and
mortality and no specific treatment is available. Alcohol consumption impairs lysosomal biogenesis results
in insufficient autophagy and alcoholic steatosis and liver injury. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of
how activating TFEB to improve lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy that are impaired by alcohol will help
to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating alcoholic liver disease."

 This K01 proposal describes a five-year research and training plan that will facilitate the transition of Dr.
Konstantin Tsoyi to an independent academic researcher in the field of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial
lung disease (RA-ILD). Dr. Tsoyi has a strong background in molecular biology and pharmacology and has
completed post-doctoral training in immunology and lung fibrosis. RA is a systemic inflammatory disorder
affecting approximately 3 million people in the United States. ILD is the most common lung complication of RA
and is associated with increased mortality. RA-ILD occurs in approximately 10% of patients with advanced RA,
and another 30% with early disease, half of whom will progress. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms
involved in the pathogenesis of RA- ILD. The current application endeavors to create a niche of basic and
translational investigation to better understand the role of fibroblasts, in the pathophysiology of RA-ILD with the
ultimate goal of developing therapeutic interventions.
 The candidate has previously demonstrated the antifibrotic properties of syndecan-2 (SDC2), a member
of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan family, in an animal model of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The
overarching aim of this proposal is to delineate the role of SDC2 in a model of RA-ILD using in vivo and in vitro
approaches. The applicant hypothesizes that SDC2 deficiency increases susceptibility to experimental lung
fibrosis in an established arthritis murine model. Furthermore, SDC2 exerts antifibrotic effects by
activating CD148 (a membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatase) and reducing PI3K/Akt/Sp1
signaling and peptidylarginine deiminase-2 (PAD2) expression in lung fibroblasts. The significance of this
research is that knowledge gained from this study will contribute to the development of future therapeutics for
patients affected with RA-ILD.
 Dr. Tsoyi will receive mentorship from his scholarship oversight committee, composed of distinguished
scientists with expertise related to key areas of this proposal, including lung fibrosis, RA and fibroblast biology.
The training opportunities and resources at Brigham and Womenâs Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School
(HMS) provide an ideal environment for the candidateâs career development. The Department of Medicine at
BWH is committed to Dr. Tsoyiâs success and has assured 100% protected time to devote to the activities
described in this proposal. The candidateâs mentors, Drs. Ivan Rosas and Michael Brenner, are NIH-funded
investigators and leaders in the fields of interstitial lung disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This application outlines
a detailed career development and training plan that includes the proposed mentored research, didactic
coursework, self-directed readings, seminars, and presentations at scientific meetings. The expertise and
knowledge gained from this K01 will enable Dr. Tsoyi to obtain R01 funding to launch an independent research
career focused on the study of molecular mechanisms involved in the development of RA-ILD."

The proposed research plan focuses on determining the importance of sphingolipids in host-microbiome
interactions and specifically whether sphingolipids function as one of the few examples of reciprocal
interkingdom communication molecules. Sphingolipids are a dynamic class of signaling and structural
molecules that are produced in all eukaryotes and a select few bacterial species that are prominent beneficial
symbionts. The unique ability of select beneficial microbes and their hosts to produce and utilize sphingolipids
suggests that sphingolipids could serve as important host-microbe communication molecules. We hypothesize
that the transfer of sphingolipids between host and microbe influences phenotypes important for symbiosis.
Host-supplied sphingolipids, whether taken in through the diet or produced by de novo synthesis, could serve
to promote a beneficial microbial community in the gut, while contributions of bacterial sphingolipids could
stimulate beneficial sphingolipid-dependent pathways in the host. To address these possibilities, we propose to
characterize the function of sphingolipids in host-microbe interactions. We have developed mass spectrometry-
based methods to measure both bacterial and host sphingolipids and certain associated metabolites.
Moreover, we use precursors to sphingolipid synthesis that are modified with a terminal alkyne to
metabolically label sphingolipids and trace their transfer between microbe and host. Application of these
methods in diet-controlled and gnotobiotic mouse models of host-microbe metabolite exchange, allows us to
define mechanisms of sphingolipid-dependent crosstalk. Over the next five years, the goals of the proposed
research are to (Project 1) define how bacterially-derived sphingolipids are processed and utilized by the host,
(Project 2) define the effect of bacterial sphingolipid synthesis on microbiome composition, and (Project 3)
define how host-controlled contributions to the intestinal sphingolipid environment influence microbiota
community structure and metabolism. The long-term objective of the project is to characterize host-microbe
lipid exchange to an extent where we could manipulate this system for the benefit of host health."

We are applying for support to continue the Harvard Training Program in Mental Health Policy. This Program,
embedded in Harvardâs Interfaculty Ph.D. Program in Health Policy, aims to provide trainees a broad array of
skills and knowledge necessary to produce research that informs mental health policy-making in the U.S., as
well as to inspire pre- and post-doctoral scholars to devote their careers to the study of mental health policy.
The Training Program in Mental Health Policy has three fundamental aims:
 1) To offer pre-doctoral trainees strong disciplinary-based training for application to the broad area of
 health policy. The disciplinary areas of concentration within the Ph.D. Program in Health Policy cover
 the range of skills necessary for effective policy analysis: a) decision science, b) economics, c)
 management, d) methods for policy research, and e) political analysis.
 2) To provide pre-doctoral trainees with formal and informal experiences that will prepare them to
 incorporate into their research the features of mental illnesses, the institutional context within which
 mental health services are delivered, and the nature of public policy decision-making in the mental
 health arena.
 3) To provide post-doctoral trainees with mentoring and research experiences in areas relevant to mental
 health policy and that augment their disciplinary training (either as social scientists or clinicians). In
 particular, we aim to match each post-doctoral fellow with research experiences that offer an in-depth
 exposure to mental health care institutions, clinical circumstances, public policy structures, and social
 science research methods to round out their research skills.
Graduates of the Training Program in Mental Health Policy are pursuing a variety of careers in research, policy
analysis, and teaching related to mental health policy. Thus far, the Training Program has produced 45 new
Ph.D. graduates pursuing research careers related to mental health policy (with 10 others currently in training,
including 3 who will graduate in May 2023). Twenty-four post-doctoral fellows have completed the Training
Program (with two others currently in training) and are currently engaged in mental health policy-related
careers. Former pre- and post-doctoral trainees are employed in major research universities, teaching
hospitals, government, and private research organizations. Our former trainees have gone on to successfully
compete for NIH research funds (15 K awards and multiple R01 and U awards as PI or co-PI). Research
conducted by program trainees and their mentors have made important contributions to the mental health
policy evidence base and to policy debates for over 25 years."
10850579,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to change the treatment paradigm for proteinuric glomerular diseases by combining
therapeutics development with cell-specific delivery to enhance podocyte repair and regeneration in vivo.
 Podocytes, highly specialized terminally differentiated epithelial cells, are injured in the majority of
glomerular diseases. As podocytes cannot self-renew, podocyte loss leads to glomerular scarring. A
subpopulation of parietal epithelial cells (PECs) can serve as podocyte stem cells (`PEC progenitors'), but their
regenerative potential is insufficient to overcome disease-associated glomerular damage. Enhancing
productive repair of podocytes thus requires a dual synchronized approach: (i) replacing lost podocytes to
increase their number, and (ii) limiting/reversing damage to the remaining podocytes. However, major
knowledge gaps prevent us from achieving these goals; these include our limited knowledge on the molecular
factors stimulating PEC self-renewal and podocyte regeneration/repair, as well as options methods for
delivering these factors to specific kidney cell types in vivo.
 Our team of four expert investigators will wield complementary tools to close these knowledge gaps and
produce innovative therapies. Dr. Wessely will apply Design of Experiment (DoE) approaches to identify novel
combinations of molecules that increase PEC progenitors and reduce podocyte loss; Dr. Roberts will conjugate
these therapeutics to VHHs (nanobodies) for delivery to PEC progenitors and podocytes; Dr. Freedman will
generate gene-edited human kidney organoids to validate effects of VHHs compared to clinical data from
patients; Dr. Shankland will use lineage tracing animal models of podocyte depletion and human organoids
transplanted into mouse kidneys for in vivo safety and efficacy analysis. This pipeline will ultimately test the
hypothesis that targeted delivery of PEC- and podocyte-specific therapeutic cargos can enhance podocyte
repair and regeneration in vivo, and restore glomerular function to below the clinical disease threshold.
 The work will be accomplished through two Specific Aims, each with unique Milestones. The first Aim is to
increase glomerular regeneration in vivo by cell targeted delivery of novel combinations of peptides and small
molecules to augment podocyte progenitors of parietal epithelial cell origin. The second Aim is to increase
productive repair of damaged podocytes by cell-type specific delivery of newly identified therapies. For both
aims, we will employ the above pipeline to discover candidate therapeutics by DoE and cross-referenced with
glomerular disease signatures from human patients. These will be combined with cell type-specific VHHs from
high diversity recombinant VHH libraries to selectively deliver them to human PECs (Aim 1), or podocytes (Aim
2). Enhanced regeneration in vivo will be demonstrated in animal models of FSGS and transplanted human
organoids. This process will establish a new paradigm for the treatment of kidney disease, and produce lead
therapeutic candidates for further pre-clinical development and ultimately human clinical trials."
10850591,"Abstract
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion is a class of
mitochondrial disease that causes neurological dysfunction with intellectual and developmental
disabilities and myopathy. Deficiency of ADP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), a
component of the TCA cycle, is one of the causes of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with
mtDNA depletion. SCS is an important integration point of the TCA cycle, intersecting energy
metabolism and posttranslational succinylation. Previous studies have demonstrated that
embryonic mice homozygous for a constitutive mutant Sucla2 allele are embryonic lethal and
exhibit ADP-specific SCS deficiency and mtDNA depletion with detrimental effects on energy
metabolism. For this proposal, to generate adult Sucla2 deficient animals, a conditional
knockout strategy of Sucla2 limited to the postnatal forebrain is employed. Initial investigations
reveal that the mutant animals exhibit a defect in learning and memory and perturbations of
energy metabolism and global protein succinylation in the cortex in the absence of mtDNA
depletion. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that adult phenotypes of Sucla2
deficiency are caused by a combination of TCA cycle dysfunction and perturbations of
global posttranslational succinylation. The Sucla2-forebrain knockout model will be
analyzed by a targeted battery of behavioral assays designed to fully characterize different
cognitive domains for deficits. To determine the potential differential effects of developmental
timing of Sucla2 loss, a conditional knockout with prenatal onset of Sucla2 deficiency will also
be generated and subjected to longitudinal broad behavioral and in vivo physiological screening,
including basic motor, autonomic, sensory, and cognitive assays in both adolescent and adult
stages. Cortex from the forebrain conditional knockout model will be analyzed for
histopathological changes, metabolomic alterations, TCA and ETC enzyme activities, global
posttranslational succinylation and mtDNA content. An innovative approach using integrated
single nuclear (sn) RNA-seq and snATAC-seq to identify differential gene expression patterns
and alterations in chromatin accessibility landscape in different cortical cell types defined by
distinct expression clusters will be employed and the datasets used to inform histopathological
and metabolomic analyses. These studies will provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms
of Sucla2/SCS deficiency and establish a preclinical model to explore and develop novel
therapeutic approaches."

role in the regulation of CKD-dependent vascular calcification. Our long-term goal is to identify new
pharmacological strategies for the prevention of vascular calcification. Our studies have demonstrated that
simultaneous activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and IKKï¢-NFï«B-inflammation pathways in
vascular smooth muscles cells (VSMCs) are major events in the induction of vascular calcification in CKD. We
have also revealed that ER stress-mediated integrated stress signal (ISR) in VSMCs plays a causative role in
the pathogenesis of vascular calcification. Unexpectedly, however, the inhibition of IKKï¢-mediated
inflammation drastically exacerbated vascular calcification in CKD mice. In addition, both ER stress-ISR
(ATF4-CHOP) activation- and IKKï¢ inhibition-mediated vascular calcification are highly associated with
vascular cell death. There results led us to hypothesize that one of the regulated cell death (RCD) pathways is
a major player in the initiation of vascular calcification. To find clues about the mechanism, we recently
screened a library of chemicals that inhibit RCD. Based on the RCD chemical library screening, we identified
an RCD pathway that selectively contributes to IKKï¢ inhibition-induced and CHOP-induced vascular
calcification. We therefore propose two specific aims to elucidate. Aim 1 will examine whether the RCD
pathway affects vascular calcification by altering the secretion of calcifying macrovesicles in cultured cells. Aim
2 will examine whether modulation of the RCD pathway affects CKD-dependent vascular calcification in vivo.
Completion of this project will provide novel therapeutic targets for CKD-mediated vascular calcification."

Young lesbian, bisexual, and other women who love women (YLBWLW) are more likely to report considering
and attempting suicide than their heterosexual female peers, or gay/bisexual male peers. However, most
researchers combine lesbians/bisexual women with other sexual minorities, resulting in a paucity of research
specific to YLBWLW, and even fewer have examined potential differences between YLBWLW. Further, within
the scant protective factor research, YLBWLW are severely under-represented, and no studies have examined
relationships between individual identity protective factors or interpersonal social connectedness protective
factors specific to YLBWLW and their suicide risk. Another important area of study in suicide research with
YLBWLW involves understanding how developmental transition periods (e.g., into high school, college, or the
workforce) affect suicide risk since developmental transitions can result in a major loss of social connections
that serve as protective factors against minority stress and suicide ideation. To address gaps in the research,
we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) Examine the moderating effects of individual and interpersonal
sexual identity-specific protective factors on theoretical pathways of risk for suicide ideation among YLBWLW;
(2) Test developmental transition periods as a multi-level moderator within the theoretical model; and (3)
Explore in-depth the effects of changes in social connections over time, especially during transition periods, on
suicide risk. The sample will include a nationwide sample of 780 racially and ethnically diverse YLBWLW aged
14 to 30 recruited through social media platforms. Participants will complete an online survey every three
months over an 18-month period. We will address Aim 1 by performing stratified latent variable moderated
mediation analyses for YLBWLW separately to test and compare the following hypotheses: a) individual
protective factors (identity centrality, authenticity, and affirmation) will moderate the risk relationship of minority
stress on entrapment; and b) interpersonal social connectedness factors (social inclusion/belonging,
lesbian/bisexual community involvement, social support) will moderate (weaken) the risk conferred by
experiences of entrapment on suicide ideation. For Aim 2, we hypothesize that a) compared to those not going
through transitions, those going through a transition will experience increased feelings of stress and
entrapment; and b) social connectedness and positive identity factors will moderate associations between
stress, entrapment, and suicide ideation. Aim 3 will involve conducting individual interviews with a subsample
of 70 participants going through a developmental transition and reporting some suicide ideation to glean
insights into YLBWLWâs experiences of these transitions and aspects of social connection that were most
helpful in reducing their distress. The impact of this research involves identifying modifiable individual identity-
and interpersonal social connectedness-level protective factors that will guide suicide prevention efforts across
different levels of influence to promote mental health and reduce deaths by suicide among YLBWLW."

This project would continue support for the Multidisciplinary Training Program in Neuroscience at Oregon
Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland. The program, which is entering its 25th year, provides
broad, early stage training for graduate students entering the Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP). The
NGP is based within the Vollum Institute, but includes faculty and students in many centers, departments, and
institutes on the OHSU campus. The program includes 61 students including the incoming class (ca. 10-12 per
year). Our training faculty of 44 scientists offers thesis research opportunities that include all levels of modern
neuroscience research from state-of-the-art cryoEM studies of membrane proteins and protein complexes to
systems neuroscience to disease-oriented and translational neuroscience. The recruitment of new faculty has
brought new areas of expertise that supplement the ongoing research strengths in the NGP. The program has
a number of unique strengths and innovative features as fully outlined in the proposal. This aspect is
highlighted by the creation since the last renewal of a Racial Equity and Inclusion Center that works specifically
and solely with NGP and Vollum trainees and faculty, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the diversity of
students in the program. Programmatic innovations include a unique core curriculum structure that begins in
the first year with a six-week long session of didactic and practical lectures and workshops that provide a
strong educational and community building foundation for the start of graduate studies. This is followed by a
12-week intensive course that provides a broad foundation in neuroscience for all students in the program.
This curriculum format allows first-year students to engage in fulltime laboratory rotations within four months of
matriculation. The core curriculum is supplemented by workshops and individual instruction in specific
techniques as well as professional skills, ethics, and career planning. At all levels of training, emphasis is
placed on fostering skills in experimental design, programming, and quantitative approaches so that trainees
become experts in scientific methodology and rigor. The spirit among the large neuroscience community at
OHSU, numbering approximately 140 affiliated scientists, combined with the broad scope of many research
institutes and the close proximity of basic and clinical research facilities, provide an outstanding environment
for early stage pre-doctoral students to establish and benefit from cross-disciplinary collaborations. This
foundation will foster the skills necessary for graduates to be successful in a full range of science-related
careers."
10853512,"This is a Shared Instrument Grant proposal for the acquisition of a high content imaging system, the Perkin
Elmer Opera Phenix Plus to replace three discontinued IN Cell high content systems which will no longer be
supported as of 2025. The current three IN Cell instruments reside in three important Core facilities at the
Mission Bay Campus of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). High content imaging is a key
service for many investigators at UCSF who use the core services of the Small Molecule Discovery Center
(SMDC), the Center of Cellular Construction CCC) and the Environmental Research and Translation for Health
(EaRTH). Many of our investigators have research projects that screen for morphological changes in a high-
throughput manner for varying conditions (e.g. pH, gene knockouts, environmental chemicals, small molecule
drugs) in a wide variety of biological samples (e.g. mammalian tissues and organoids, Stentor, budding yeast,
nematodes, zebrafish, neurons and phase separation droplets) using high content image-based screening.
The Opera Phenix Plus system can act as a replacement for all three IN Cell instruments due to its
simultaneous 4-camera system that reduces the acquisition time such that it is at least four times faster than
the top of the line IN Cell 6000 and 6500 that reside currently in our Cores. With the faster throughput, the new
instrument will be able to accommodate all the users from the three different Cores. In addition, the faster
acquisition will allow 3D time-lapse imaging that many of our investigators attempted on our IN Cells but were
not satisfied with time it took to complete a 96-well plate, typically over an hour for a typical sample compared
to twelve minutes with the Opera Phenix Plus. The new instrument also is equipped with water immersion
lenses for 20, 40 and 63x magnification, which due to better refractive index matching, gives higher resolution
images than could be obtained in the IN Cell instruments which relied on air objectives. The Opera Phenix Plus
is also equipped with lasers for multi-wavelength imaging, environmental control, automation and easy-to-use
imaging processing software that are needed for our investigators to successfully conduct their research. The
innovative research programs of our users span a wide range of basic, translational, and clinical research
areas as well as address many health-related areas in the realms of cancer, developmental, reproductive and
neurological disorders. All 17 Major and Minor users have NIH grants that support their high content imaging.
The Opera Phenix Plus will be essential to continue and further develop our biomedical research for many
years to come."

Characterization of protein conformational changes is a crucial prerequisite to understanding biological
functions on a molecular level. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been an essential component of the
biophysical tool kit for decades, exploiting the chiral properties of small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids
to provide information on molecular structure and its changes. For example, changes in secondary structure
caused by protein unfolding (induced by perturbants such as temperature or pH), or folding (induced by the
binding of a small molecule ligand, protein, or nucleic acid) can be quickly and easily quantified as changes in
the far-UV CD spectrum. Separately, CD spectroscopy is also an essential technique in the study of chiral-
selective properties of small molecules, including drugs, fluorescent dyes, and chemical catalysts designed to
mimic enzymatic catalysis. Over the past decade, advancements in instrument optics and nitrogen purging, as
well as the development of additional functionalities such as simultaneous fluorescence and absorbance
detection, have further enhanced the utility of CD spectroscopy for biomedical studies. This proposal, in
response to Program Announcement PAR-22-081, requests funds to purchase a state-of-the-art Jasco J-1500
CD spectropolarimeter to advance the research goals of University of Notre Dame scientists. This instrument
will replace Notre Dameâs current Jasco J-815 instrument, which although still productive and carefully
maintained for its >13-year lifespan, is optically inferior to modern instruments and operated by an obsolete
computer. The new instrument will be housed in a recently renovated and expanded core facility; its acquisition
is an important piece of a large effort currently underway to expand and improve research infrastructure at the
University of Notre Dame. As such, supervision, care, and maintenance of this instrument will contribute to
employment stability for core facility staff, while access to this state-of-the-art research equipment will continue
to grow the research enterprise at Notre Dame."

This Clinician Scientist project is proposed by Elie Dib, MD, MS, FACP, a member of the
Michigan Cancer Research Consortium (MCRC)-National Community Oncology Research
Program. MCRC is well established and based at the Trinity Health Ann Arbor (THAA) Hospital,
which is a small academic medical center, associated with the nationâs fifth largest health
system. Dr. Dib practices as a medical oncologist within THAA and Chelsea Hospital, a joint
venture with Michigan Medicine. Over 40 trial sites and 140 investigators conduct research as
part of MCRC. Dr. Dib concurrently serves as Adjunct Faculty Lecturer at Johns Hopkins
University, teaching in the areas of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics and Individualized
Genomics and Health. Dr. Dib has been a highly productive MCRC co-I since 2016, contributing
the following major deliverables: a) site PI for over 60 protocols enrolling 800 patients across
MCRC; b) enrolling investigator for 200+ patients completing NCI trials; c) co-founder and Vice
Chair of Alliance Immuno-Oncology Committee; d) community co-chair of seven Alliance trials
and representative to the NCI iMATCH initiative. He is also serving a 3-year term with the NCI
Genitourinary Cancers Steering Committee.
Aims of the project will be to continue established and successful clinical trials activities and
gain protected research time to complete the following: a) contribute to newly-funded MCRC
initiatives aimed at increasing the rate of clinical trials enrollment by minority and underserved
individuals; b) launch safety lead-in work and more Phase I trials at MCRCâs most capable sites;
c) evaluate and help adopt AI and PROs tool(s) for improving efficiencies in research such as
patient screening and building capacity to use real-world evidence; d) continue collaboration
development within MCRC community sites, that are joint ventures with Michigan Medicine, to
bring a wider range of NCI-funded studies to community settings. In completing this work, Dr.
Dib will provide essential knowledge, skills, and abilities as a community-based oncologist to
NCI clinical trials initiatives. This project fills a gap for NCI by bringing a highly-qualified
community oncologist into the Clinician Scientist program. Nationally, most oncology care is
delivered in the community, often in tandem with high-functioning clinical trials programs. Thus,
his perspective and experience are representative of the broader cancer care community. His
work will have high impact for all of MCRC, Alliance, NCI, and the large population of patients
and families who access cancer care outside of major academic medical centers."
10860992,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the 12,000 deceased organ donors yearly in the US, there are racial disparities that have persisted
over decades, with the Black population most recently donating at 69% of the White population. Relatively
lower organ donation rates among racial minorities not only contribute to the organ shortage but also contribute
to racial disparities in waitlisted candidateâs access to transplantation, with some racial minorities having longer
wait times owing to difficult matching.
Historically, efforts to address racial disparities in deceased organ donation have examined inpatient medical
facility deaths, using inpatient death counts to estimate the potential organ donor pool, to benchmark
successful organ recovery, and to target interventions. While only individuals who die in an inpatient medical
facility can have their organs recovered for transplantation, the focus on this highly selected population is
limiting. Structural racism, a determinant of racial disparities in health, affects healthcare resource availability,
with Black individuals being 40% less likely than White individuals to have a usual source of healthcare in
racially segregated neighborhoods. To date, healthcare resource availability has not been examined as a
potential mediator of racial and geographic disparities in deceased organ donation.
To better understand the impact of structural racism on deceased donor rates, we will perform novel linkages
with three nationally representative datasets (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, CDC WONDER, and
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) to study the following aims: (1) To examine county-level risk
factors for inpatient and outpatient death under medical conditions consistent with organ donation; (2) To
examine the relationship between structural racism and the potential organ donor rate; and (3) To examine
whether healthcare access mediates the relationship between structural racism and the potential organ donor
rate.
We hypothesize that structural racism affects inpatient facility death distribution, and subsequent organ
donation rates, through its differential effects on healthcare access according to race and across geographies.
If the proposed aims are achieved, we will directly inform national healthcare access and organ allocation
policy, and population-level structural interventions to eliminate racial disparities in transplantation."
10860994,"Neutrophilic airway inflammation is associated with increased asthma severity. Nearly 50% of patients with
asthma are non-eosinophilic and thus less likely to respond completely to corticosteroid therapy or current
biologics, illustrating the unmet need to improve our understanding of this group of patients. Despite these
associations, the pathways involved in neutrophilic asthma (NA) are only partially understood. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) exert a powerful effect on gene regulation and have been implicated in T helper 2 airway inflammation
in asthma. However, there is a knowledge gap in our understanding of the role of miRNAs in NA.
 MiR-223-3p is associated with severe NA and leads to airway epithelial changes, implicating miRNAs in NA.
Work by our group at the Yale Center for Asthma and Airway Disease cohort (YCAAD) found that miR-223-3p
belongs to a network of a dozen miRNAs in sputum cells associated with airflow obstruction, asthma
hospitalizations, decreased asthma quality of life, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in the sputum. To
understand this cell-specific association we performed in situ hybridization to identify sputum cells expressing
miR-223-3p and found that neutrophils express high levels of miR-223-3p. This miRNA is positively correlated
with toll-like receptor pathways and IL-17 expression in patients with asthma.
 We hypothesize that the sputum miRNA network is involved in the regulation of the Th17 pathway and
neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma. We will utilize two well characterized cohorts, YCAAD and the New
York University/Bellevue Asthma Registry (NYUBAR), to execute the following aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the longitudinal expression of the sputum miRNA network and its role in neutrophilic
airway inflammation. This aim will determine the stability of miRNA expression in the YCAAD cohort and will
validate the expression of the miRNA network in the NYUBAR cohort.
 Aim 2. To define the network miRNAs released in extracellular vesicles and their association with neutrophilic
airway inflammation. This aim will determine the extent to which unique network miRNAs are released into the
extracellular environment via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exert their functional role in the regulation of Th17
inflammation in airway epithelial cells.
 Aim 3. To determine the effect of the miRNA network in airway epithelial gene expression and its contribution
to neutrophilic airway inflammation. This aim will elucidate how the miRNAs in the network interact with each
other and how their regulatory role converges on specific inflammatory pathways.
 These studies will investigate a poorly understood asthma endotype using a novel paradigm of miRNA
regulation of neutrophilic airway inflammation. The results derived from this project will lay the foundation for the
improved identification of gene regulatory networks involved in NA and lead to potential therapeutic manipulation
of miRNAs in neutrophilic airway inflammation."
10857493,"Project Summary/Abstract
Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) can be as debilitating as hip or knee OA, and in the US, shoulder
arthroplasty rates for OA are rising more rapidly than hip and knee arthroplasty. Yet few studies have
investigated glenohumeral OA risk factors, resulting in insufficient insights to guide evidence-based prevention
and treatment strategies. For OA at other joints, many risk factors are known, including sex, occupation, and
genetics, but effects can vary considerably by joint type. Therefore effects on glenohumeral OA cannot be
inferred without studies specific to the shoulder. While occupational risk factors for shoulder pain have been
identified, there has been limited investigation of factors that specifically effect glenohumeral OA. Moreover,
the genetics of glenohumeral OA is an unexplored area. Shoulder arthroplasty is also strongly correlated with
hip and knee arthroplasty, and is known to be more common in patients with a history of shoulder instability.
But estimates of the absolute risk of shoulder arthroplasty and how this risk differs across patient populations
has not been well-defined. This information could improve patient counseling, and could indicate opportunities
for early evaluation of OA in high-risk patient groups. Our central hypothesis is that glenohumeral OA results
from a mix of modifiable (occupation) and non-modifiable factors (age, sex, genetics), and that these factors
can be used alongside surgical history to produce informative risk predictions for glenohumeral OA. As no
sufficiently large studies systematically capture radiographic measures of glenohumeral OA, our study will
focus on shoulder arthroplasty as a measure of end-stage glenohumeral OA. Our objectives are to determine
associations of occupational exposures with OA-related shoulder arthroplasty risk (Aim 1), identify genetic
variants associated with risk of OA-related shoulder arthroplasty (Aim 2), and develop prediction models for 5-
year and 10-year risk of OA-related shoulder arthroplasty (Aim 3). Across all aims we will use the UK Biobank
(UKB), a population-based, 500,000-person cohort with more than a decade of prospectively linked hospital
records capturing diagnoses and procedures, including >1200 OA-related shoulder arthroplasty cases. For Aim
1, we will link a novel job exposure matrix to UKB job titles to measure shoulder-specific occupational tasks.
For Aim 2, we will combine whole-genome sequencing data available in UKB and the US-based All of US
cohort to conduct an innovative sequencing-based genome-wide association study for OA-related shoulder
arthroplasty. For Aim 3, we will leverage both the UKB and the US Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project to
develop prediction models for us in both the general population, and specific high-risk patient populations. An
understanding of glenohumeral OA risk factors is critically needed to allow informed design of prevention
approaches. As shoulder arthroplasty is strongly correlated with OA at other joints, better understanding of
genetic influences of glenohumeral OA can provide deeper insights regarding OA etiology. Findings from this
study can enable better prediction of glenohumeral OA, improving patient counseling in the future."

While the amygdala is a key focus in psychiatric treatments and invasive modulation of amygdala activity has
shown promise in treating certain refractory cases, its widespread use among millions of treatment-resistant
patients is impractical and entails inherent neurosurgery-related risks. The development of transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a potential noninvasive alternative. However, the effective modulation
of the amygdala with TMS
is hindered by
the lack of knowledge in pinpointing a TMS-accessible cortical site
that can reliably target and modulate the amygdala. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) emerges as
a promising candidate for stimulation based on findings from extensive preliminary data, published work, and
large human connectome datasets. The overall objective in this proposal to determine whether and how
DLPFC repetitive stimulation modulates the amygdala activity with an unparalleled combination of
invasive and noninvasive stimulation and recording methods in humans. The central hypothesis is that
both invasive and noninvasive stimulation of DLPFC modulate the amygdala activity through their functional
connectivity mechanism. This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: determine
invasive modulatory effects of intracranial stimulation of DLPFC on the amygdala recorded with intracranial
EEG (iEEG) in epilepsy patients (Aim 1), translate stimulation with noninvasive TMS of DLPFC while tracking
modulatory effects on the amygdala with iEEG in epilepsy patients (Aim 2a) and with functional MRI in healthy
individuals (Aim 2b), and evaluate the role of DLPFC-amygdala functional connectivity in predicting
modulatory effects of DLPFC stimulation on the amygdala (Aim 3). The proposed research is innovative,
because it can determine a unique causal prefrontal pathway for noninvasive amygdala modulation in
humans. It also represents the first attempt of any group worldwide to creatively combine multimodal cutting-
edge brain stimulation and recordings to comprehensively evaluate modulatory effects of DLPFC stimulation
on the human amygdala. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide compelling
and conclusive causal evidence of amygdala modulation by DLPFC stimulation and inform a novel circuit-
based strategy that can efficiently pinpoint a stimulation site within the DLPFC for noninvasive amygdala
modulation. Ultimately, such knowledge will facilitate the rational design of personalized, circuit-guided
noninvasive neuromodulatory therapies aimed at modulating the amygdala for psychiatric disorders."

 Behavior and its associated executive processes can be categorized into lower-level movements, but
also into higher-level states. States are controlled on a moment-to-moment basis by goals and likely
implemented by specific brain circuits, including dorsal prefrontal cortical structures. The ability to properly
select behaviors and to switch between them is critical for healthy cognitive functioning. Disruption of state
control is a hallmark of addiction. Understanding how the brain implements and switches between states
therefore offers the hope of improve their control. The central premise of this proposal is that understanding the
neural control of states in macaques can help us understand neural control of states more generally. We
believe this is best done in freely moving animals because behavioral expression is too constrained to be
interpretable in typical laboratory contexts. A major barrier is the difficulty in tracking macaquesâ body positions,
which is essential for state identification. We have recently solved the tracking problem. Using an
electrophysiological recording system amenable to recording in a freely moving environment, we will record
responses of hundreds of neurons in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (dlPFC). These cortical regions, which are unique (dlPFC) or greatly modified (dACC) in the primate
order, are strongly associated with control of behavior, are associated with simple cognitive states and with
regulation of behavior in humans, and are prominently dysregulated in addiction. They also have strong and
direct projections to the primary and secondary motor systems, putting them in an ideal position to drive
behavior, and suggesting they may have a high-level relationship with control of behavior. However, while they
are linked to these processes, we know almost nothing about their neuron-level relationship with control of
behavior. We will place animals in our large cage system and have them perform a foraging task in which they
naturally cycle through behaviors and then link them with brain activity in dACC and dlPFC. This will let us
resolve several outstanding issues, including what role these regions have in behavioral control and how they
relate to each other."

Standard first-line therapy for drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) is highly effective but complicated by long
treatment duration and rifamycin drug-drug interactions, particularly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in high HIV-
TB burden countries. A well-tolerated and efficacious rifamycin-free regimen that can shorten TB treatment
duration is critically needed to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) targets towards ending TB. Our group
pioneered the use of an artificial-intelligence-enabled parabolic response surface (PRS) platform allowing rapid
identification of the most effective drug-dose combinations by testing only a small fraction of the total drug-dose
efficacy response surface. This approach determined that drug combinations including bedaquiline (BDQ),
clofazimine (CFZ), and pyrazinamide (PZA) at optimal dose ratios were more effective than standard DS-TB
treatment, achieving relapse-free cure in mouse models within 3-4 weeks. Adding delamanid (DLM) as a 4th drug
was equivalent in potency, achieving 100% relapse-free cure in only 3 weeks. This is substantially shorter than
time to relapse-free cure in mouse studies supporting other TB treatment shortening trials. Bactericidal and
sterilizing ability confirmed in other experiments, and favorable intra-lesional pharmacokinetics (PK), provides
additional justification for evaluation of the BDQ-CFZ-PZA-DLM (BCZD) combination for treatment shortening.
This 8-week rifamycin-free ultrashort regimen fulfills key requirements of the WHO target regimen profile for DS-
TB: lower potential for drug-drug interactions, established tolerability and safety, constituent agents registered
and accessible, and optimized dosing based on clinical data. We hypothesize that BCZD will demonstrate
superior microbiologic efficacy relative to standard therapy during the first 8 weeks of treatment for patients with
DS-TB. To test this, we shall conduct a Phase IIc, open-label, randomized controlled trial to investigate the
efficacy and safety of an 8-week regimen of BCZD, paving the way for a definitive treatment-shortening trial and
potentially shifting clinical practice. Our trial, called PRESCIENT, will randomize 156 adults with smear-positive
DS-TB, with and without HIV, to receive BCZD for 8 weeks versus standard therapy for 26 weeks (1:1 ratio). The
primary objective is a superiority efficacy comparison of time to liquid culture conversion through 8 weeks; the
Phase IIc design also enables evaluation of clinical endpoints through extended post-treatment follow up to 56
weeks (Aim 1a - efficacy). Secondary objectives include rigorous assessment of safety and tolerability (Aim 1b
- safety), and drug susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing to determine frequency of treatment-
emergent resistance to BCZD (Aim 1c - resistance). We shall also explore the effect of experimental drug
exposure, derived from population PK models, on time to culture positivity as a measure of mycobacterial burden
and treatment response, and on corrected QT interval (Aim 2 - PK/PD). PRESCIENT will be conducted at
established clinical research sites in Haiti and South Africa which have access to large populations of patients
with DS-TB and have the necessary expertise and infrastructure to successfully implement this project."

The overall goals of the research proposed are to develop, validate and apply innovative magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) biomarkers that can be used to improve our understanding of the processes involved in muscle
deterioration that occurs with aging. MRI can provide not only superb depiction of soft tissue anatomy, but
appropriate MRI images can be analyzed to provide quantitative parametric maps that report intrinsic
pathological changes in tissue composition, microstructure, and function. We propose to develop novel
parametric images based on quantifying changes in R1Ï, the spin-lock relaxation rate, and its variation with the
locking field amplitude, which we term R1Ï dispersion imaging. We hypothesize this novel methodology can be
used to quantify degenerative changes in microvasculature as well as the abnormal accumulation of
macromolecules in the membranes of muscle fiber. The specific aims of this proposal are to refine and
implement novel methods of MRI data acquisition and analysis to derive quantitative parametric images based
on R1Ï dispersion and validate their interpretation in terms of pathophysiological changes via gold-standard
methods including histology, and imaging mass spectroscopy. To achieve these goals, we will perform
longitudinal MRI imaging studies of rodent models of skeletal muscle deterioration with aging. Optimized
methods will then be evaluated in a cohort of human subjects on a clinical 3T MR scanner. The quantitative
measures of microvascular changes along with macromolecular deposition will provide new information on the
progression of the characteristic changes that occur with aging and provide a new tool that may catalyze new
hypotheses and therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the effects of tissue degeneration.
During this career development award, the awardee will gain crucial training in geriatric, the biology of aging,
advanced MRI sequence development, quantitative methods of histology, and how to translate methodological
innovations into human studies. A comprehensive didactic training and career mentorship program will provide
the knowledge and experiences needed to accomplish the career goal of becoming an independent researcher
at the interface of imaging and aging study. The institutional environment at Vanderbilt University Institute of
Imaging Science is exceptional and will provide an exemplary opportunity to build a strong foundation in
developing imaging biomarkers for translational applications."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to a diverse population of blood cells, including myeloid and
lymphoid cells, platelets, and erythrocytes. These cell types play important roles in defending against disease,
responding to tissue injury, and transporting vital cellular nutrients. Hematopoiesis, the generation of blood
cells from HSCs, is a carefully orchestrated process that is highly conserved among vertebrates. In recent
years, it has become apparent that HSCs are heterogenous and may be biased with respect to their production
of different blood cells. Further, somatic mutations acquired over the course of an organismâs life may alter
HSC output. If the mutations confer a survival or proliferative advantage, this may lead to the expansion of
cells derived from a specific HSC (clonal expansion) and clonal hematopoiesis. In 2014, a clinical entity called
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) was described in which specific genetic mutations
appeared to be promoting HSC clonal expansion without any obvious hematologic abnormalities. Individuals
with CHIP are at an increased risk for hematologic malignancy but also and more surprisingly at an increased
risk for developing coronary heart disease (CHD) secondary to increased inflammation. At present, scientists
do not fully understand how mutations in HSCs lead to increased inflammation nor know how to predict which
individuals with CHIP will progress to malignancy. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to gain
insight into HSC biology and immune cell development in unperturbed hematopoiesis and genetically-
induced clonal hematopoiesis through single-cell analyses and lineage tracing. In Aim 1, HSC output,
immune cell development, and hematopoietic lineage relationships will be studied in unperturbed zebrafish.
This will be accomplished with scGESTALT, a new method for in vivo cellular barcoding and fate mapping.
Adult kidney marrows and thymi from scGESTALT zebrafish will be dissected and single-cell RNA sequencing
will be performed to obtain transcriptional and ancestral information. Aim 2 will assess the impact of mutations
found in clonal hematopoiesis on HSC clonal output and immune cell development and differentiation.
CRISPR-Cas9 will be used to mutate zebrafish orthologs of human ASXL1, NRAS, EZH2, and RUNX1 at
genomic locations frequently mutated in patients. Transcriptional profiling and lineage tracing will be performed
on kidney marrows and thymi from scGESTALT zebrafish with and without expanded clones. The ability of
macrophages and lymphocytes to promote clonal expansion will be explored via targeted knockout/knockdown
approaches. Identifying altered cells, developmental and transcriptional programs, and regulatory networks in
clonal hematopoiesis will shed light on the contributing cells and mechanisms to both clonal expansion and
increased inflammation. Such knowledge has the potential to better inform clinical management of CHIP and
potentially point to strategies aimed at preventing the progression of CHIP to malignancy."

Since its discovery, adult mammalian hippocampal neurogenesisâparticularly humanâhas attracted attention
and controversy. Envisioned as a unique, intrinsic capacity of the brain center for learning and memory and
mood control to repair and regenerate, over the past three decades it has been scrutinized in model
organisms, which provided a wealth of data confirming its functional relevance. The case for human
neurogenesis, however, has faced a much harder road to acceptance because the only means to study it has
been by immunostaining of the postmortem tissue. It is thus of no surprise that we know very little about it.
While most agree that adult human hippocampus harbors newborn neurons that decline with age and with
diseases such as Alzheimerâs, their functional importance has proved elusive without a live and non-invasive
measure.
As noted in the RFA, developing a means of measuring neurogenesis rates in vivo in a non-invasive manner is
of critical interest. Doing so in a technique that can be readily used in not only animal models, but also in
humans would give us a vital tool in our effort to not only understand neurogenesis per se, but to also
understand how neurogenesis may lead to impairments found in aging and in AD/ADRD. This proposal takes
as its foundation the innovation by our group of the first and only in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS)-based marker of neurogenesis: a lipid-based signal resonating at 1.28 ppm. While our groupâs initial
work in this area has identified and validated this biomarker, several critical gaps exist that must be addressed
before it can be widely adopted in human studies of aging and AD/ADRD. Our goal in this proposal is to adapt
a number of existing techniques to the accurate measurement and quantification of the 1.28ppm signal and to
further develop analytical methods based on deep machine learning so that it can be broadly and reliably used
to assess levels of and changes in human adult neurogenesis. In particular, we will: 1) Acquire data from
phantoms, in vivo and ex vivo mice, and humans using techniques that will allow for more reliable
quantification and validation, 2) Adapt the MEGA-PRESS technique successfully used to quantify GABA to
isolate the neurogenic-associated signal at 1.28ppm from the nearby lactate signal; 3) Adapt pre-processing
tools we have developed in related studies that enhance signal-to-noise in MRS signals from the hippocampus;
4) Further develop time-domain based processing tools to isolate the neurogenic signal from overlapping
components; and 5) Further develop a neural-network based approach to detect and quantify it. In each of
these areas, we have existing solutions that are functional, but we believe can be improved upon to provide
more reliable and robust quantification of the neurogenic signal. Here, we will formally evaluate the new
approaches relative to the existing approaches to produce a final acquisition-through-quantification pipeline
that can be used by the field."
10858009,"Summary: For patients who have a heart attack (myocardial infarction; MI), 1 in 3 will not survive 5 years after
the event. Therefore, there is a critical need to facilitate the long-term goal of providing potential intervention
targets to prevent, slow, or reverse progression to heart failure in heart attack patients. The long-term goal of
the proposal is to understand how CD8+ T-cells are impairing the wound healing response after MI leading to
eventual development of heart failure. The specific objective is to understand the temporal changes in the
genetic and physiological profiles of the CD8+ T-cell population and how this regulates cardiac wound healing
after a heart attack. The central hypothesis is that temporal changes in CD8+ T-cell heterogeneity mediates
alterations of the constitutive properties of the ischemic scar and subsequent ventricular dysfunction. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that temporal regulation of CD8+ T-cell activation is a fundamental determinant of the
constitutive properties of ischemia induced myocardial scar. Aim 2 will test the hypothesize that CD8+ T-cell
downstream effects during post-MI remodeling are not fully regulated by antigen presentation. This proposal
will take a cutting-edge and integrative multidisciplinary approach to evaluate CD8+ T-cells in the MI setting.
The completion of the study will provide a better understanding of critical mechanisms underlying adverse
effects of the adaptive immune response and wound healing after MI. The proposed study aligns with the
mission of the healthcare system by providing molecular knowledge to clinical practices so that we can
continue to provide exceptional health care that improves patient health and well-being."
10833480,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity
for many individuals with overweight/obesity. Yet, many patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be
largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific
instances of nonadherence to the prescribed calorie target(s) in BOT) are frequent during weight loss attempts,
and are associated with poorer weight losses and higher daily energy intake. Despite the potential for lapses to
influence BOT outcomes and health, poorly understood variability in types of lapse behaviors and their
mechanisms interferes with our ability to intervene on them. In our research, participants have identified distinct
behaviors associated with lapse (e.g., eating an off-plan food, eating too large a portion of food). Across several
studies, we have established the concept of âdietary lapse typesâ (i.e., specific eating behavior(s) and contextual
factors underlying a dietary lapse). We have shown that behavioral, psychosocial, and contextual mechanisms
may differ across dietary lapse types, and that some lapse types appear to be more detrimental than others for
weight control. Elucidating clear dietary lapse types therefore has major potential for understanding and
improving adherence in BOT, but we have been unable to do so because our work is limited to secondary
analyses of data from larger trials that have incomplete measures of lapse types, potential mechanisms, and
clinical outcomes. We propose to extend our research by using behavioral phenotyping (i.e., data-driven
identification of underlying behavioral, psychological, and contextual factors of a health behavior) to establish
lapse phenotypes, and understand their impact on clinical outcomes. While typical phenotyping studies cluster
individuals via unique characteristics, we aim to understand phenotypes of lapses as a specific behavior within
individuals. We will use multimodal real-time assessment tools within a multi-level factor analysis framework to
uncover phenotypes while accounting for behaviors occurring within individuals and within days. Adults with
overweight/obesity (n=150) will participate in a well-established 12-mo. online BOT and 6-mo. weight loss
maintenance period. Participants will complete a 14-day lapse phenotyping assessment battery at baseline, 4,
8, 12 and 18 months. EMA and passive sensing tools (i.e., wrist devices, geolocation) will assess dietary lapses
and relevant phenotyping characteristics identified from our prior work. Participant energy intake will be assessed
with 24-hour dietary recalls and weight will be measured pre- and post- assessment. Results will yield a set of
lapse phenotypes and knowledge of their underlying mechanisms, which will can inform novel interventions to
improve dietary adherence in BOT (and in other treatments for which dietary adherence is critical). This
innovative approach will advance the science of adherence more broadly by supporting the development of
sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and give rise to novel phenotyping methods that can be
leveraged to better understand and treat non-adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medications, activity)."
10833482,"ABSTRACT: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor, remains uniformly lethal due to many
factors, including a potently immune-suppressive microenvironment. While attempts to alter immune activation
have been successful in other advanced cancers, a series of diverse strategies has yet to markedly increase
GBM patient survival. These results demonstrate a key clinical barrier to success and underscore the need to
better understand the immune-suppressive GBM microenvironment, which is part of a unique neuroimmune
system. Central to immune suppression in GBM is the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
an immature lineage comprised of monocytic (m) and granulocytic (g) subsets that potently suppresses cytotoxic
immune response. Interrogating the function of MDSCs in GBM has been a major focus of our laboratory. Using
an integrated approach, we have shown that MDSCs associate with poor GBM prognosis, drive cancer stem cell
function, and interact with the tumor through multiple signaling networks that can be neutralized to increase
immune activation. We have also interrogated MDSC subsets to reveal differences in localization and function
in a sex-specific manner and identified MDSC subset signaling programs that can be altered to increase immune
activation and decrease GBM growth. While our work has implicated MDSCs as biomarkers and drivers of GBM
progression and identified them as next-generation therapeutic targets, there are several knowledge gaps that
remain, and addressing them is the focus of this application: it remains unclear how MDSCs originate and the
extent of their plasticity; it is unclear how MDSC lineage commitment is informed by cell-intrinsic programs and
is altered as a result of interaction with unique neural microenvironments, microbial interactions, and signaling
programs; and the efficacy of targeting MDSC subsets in combination with immune activating strategies has yet
to be determined. The overarching hypothesis of this application is that MDSC subset lineage commitment is
driven though the integration of cell-intrinsic (including sex-specific genetic and epigenetic programs) and cell-
extrinsic (including systemic factors from the gut-brain axis) interactions that can be leveraged for the
development of more effective anti-GBM therapies. Through this R35 mechanism that allows for longer-
term/flexible funding to develop parallel areas with synergistic potential, we will test distinct aspects of this
hypothesis though three complementary but integrated focus areas: (1) the cellular and molecular basis for
MDSC lineage commitment and plasticity, (2) the response of MDSCs to microenvironmental cues, and (3) pre-
clinical MDSC targeting in combination with immune activating therapies. These studies have immediate
implications for GBM and other neurological disorders and establish a platform for understanding immune
responses in other neurological disorders by providing unique insights into neural/immune interactions mediated
via MDSCs, as well as by assessing brain-penetrant immune-altering therapeutic strategies."
10833627,"SUMMARY
There are currently no FDA-approved drugs available targeting the ERK pathway in which RAS
mutations drive ERK activity. The long-term goal is to help develop therapeutically useful ERK
inhibitors for the clinical treatment of malignancies. The overall objectives in this application are
to (i) characterize the chemical and allosteric mechanism and develop a novel class of covalent
ERK inhibitors, (ii) elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which they induce anti-proliferative
activity in combination with FDA-approved drugs vertically targeting the ERK pathway and (iii)
determine the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of combination treatments using patient-derived organoid
and tumor models. The central hypothesis is that combination therapy using covalent, allosteric
inhibitors of ERK can be developed to possess suitable potency to induce apoptotic cell death
and promote tumor regression in patient-derived tumor models predictive of clinical efficacy. The
project's rationale is that developing a new chemical strategy to inhibit ERK and determination of
its preclinical therapeutic efficacy and associated mechanisms is likely to offer a robust scientific
framework for developing new cancer therapeutic approaches. Testing the central hypothesis
occurs by pursuing two specific aims: 1) The design and elucidation of the mechanism of ERK
recruitment site inhibitors and 2) investigating covalent ERK inhibitors in patient-derived CRC
Tumor Models. The first aim is to optimize a new class of covalent allosteric ERK inhibitors and
delineate allosteric binding and inhibition mechanisms to identify highly specific leads. The second
aim delineates ERK inhibition's mechanisms and consequences by leads in RAS- and RAF-
transformed patient-derived models and identifies agents that, combined with FDA-approved
drugs targeting the ERK pathway, induce tumor regression. In the applicant's opinion, the
research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on developing leads from
a new class of ERK inhibitor compounds that covalently target a site of protein binding on ERK.
These compounds will exhibit improved pharmacodynamics and block compensatory feedback
signals from ERK signaling and induce durable ERK inhibition to promote robust cytotoxic anti-
cancer effects. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide substantial
scientific justification for the continued development and future clinical trials of novel ERK inhibitor
therapies. Ultimately, such knowledge can offer new opportunities for the development of
innovative therapies to treat cancer."
10833628,"We are probing the role of the myosin motor in aging and in progressive, genetically based diseases of
skeletal and cardiac muscles using transgenic models of Drosophila melanogaster. We take advantage of
the powerful genetic tools available for Drosophila to study myosin in an integrative manner, from atomic

and locomotion. We are examining the functional significance of specific residues within the skeletal muscle
myosin motor and rod domains that are post-translationally modified during human aging. These
modifications cause indirect flight muscle atrophy and dysfunction in our transgenic lines. To understand the
basis of these defects, we are assessing myosin ATPase activity, in vitro motility, thick filament formation

enhancer FOXO ameliorates such disrupted proteostasis. Secondly, we will define the roles of proteins that
anomalously accumulate in aggregates in our Drosophila models of inclusion body myopathy type 3 and
myosin storage myopathy. Both are progressive skeletal muscle disorders that we found to exhibit aberrant
proteostasis, yet they display phenotypically different protein aggregates. We will examine the structural and
functional defects in skeletal muscles that arise from up- or down-regulating expression of the aberrant
aggregate proteins as well as the effects of over-expressing FOXO. This will yield insights into roles of
these proteins in aging and in degenerative muscle diseases. Finally, we are examining how mutations
associated with human age-exacerbated dilated cardiomyopathy affect the structure and function of the
Drosophila heart. We will determine mutation effects on cardiac proteostasis and examine if FOXO
ameliorates mutation effects. Using a unique in vivo method to produce mutant myosins, we will gain
mechanistic insights into biochemical and structural defects through ATPase and in vitro motility assays

myosins in skeletal muscles to understand functional effects on muscle contractile properties. Overall,
our project will test significant questions regarding basic myosin function during aging of healthy and
diseased skeletal and cardiac muscles and assess whether improving proteostasis aids in rectifying muscle

This research proposal has been developed to equip the candidate, Dr. Jessica Hoffman, with the experience,
skills, and tools needed to successfully transition into a faculty position at a large public research university. The
proposed research will discover novel metabolic mechanisms that lead to small size and long life across natural
genetic variation and lifespan extending interventions with a specific focus on the degradation of tryptophan to
kynurenine. Dr. Hoffman will receive extensive training in mouse husbandry techniques, molecular biology, and
metabolomics data acquisition and analysis under the guidance of her mentorship team, Drs. Steven Austad,
Stephen Barnes, and Liou Sun, all at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and active members of UAB's
Nathan Shock Center for Excellence in the Biology of Aging. Preliminary studies completed under the direction
of Dr. Steven Austad indicate size plays a large role in explaining the variation in metabolomic profiles within a
species (companion dogs) that show a negative correlation between body size and longevity. And work with Dr.
Sun suggests that metabolomic profiles are different between small, long-lived growth hormone (GH) disrupted
mice and wild type mice. One pathway found to be similar between the two species is the breakdown of
tryptophan to kynurenine. In both small dogs and small GH disrupted mice kynurenine levels are higher and
tryptophan levels are lower than their larger counterparts. This suggests that the degradation of tryptophan to
kynurenine may be influencing the longevity extension seen in small individuals of a species. The overall goal of
this project is to expand our knowledge of small size and long life and to further tease apart the molecular
mechanisms that underlie the size longevity tradeoff seen across species. The overarching hypothesis is that
tryptophan metabolic dysregulation is partially modulated by GH and energy intake and provides an IGF-
I independent mechanisms of long-life and small body size across species. This hypothesis will be
addressed by three specific aims, each of which will help develop Dr. Hoffman as an independent investigator.
1) Determine the dynamics of tryptophan metabolism to the longevity effect of reduced GH activity. 2) Determine
how metabolomic profiles, specifically tryptophan degradation metabolism varies across different interventions
that show smaller size and longer life across species. 3) Determine lifespan consequences of genetic
manipulation of tryptophan metabolism genes in fruit flies. Overall, this proposal will increase our knowledge on
the molecular underpinnings that lead to variation in body size and lifespan and will provide new hypotheses
about potential interventions to improve lifespan and healthspan."

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most common neurodegenerative dementias and one of the
Alzheimer disease related dementias (ADRDs), but much less is known about underlying pathophysiology and
structural brain changes in DLB. DLB is frequently misdiagnosed clinically, most commonly as Alzheimer
disease (AD). Currently, DLB diagnosis can only be confirmed post mortem, and early accurate diagnosis is
critically needed to aid treatment, prognosis and long-term care. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and task-
based electroencephalography (EEG) are promising neurodiagnostic modalities for better characterizing DLB
and potentially serving as biomarkers, an unmet need. While EEG monitors neuronal activity, dMRI can assess
white matter pathways and neuronal degeneration in vivo. The primary goal of this K23 study is to characterize
pathophysiologic and microstructural changes occurring in DLB, and advance our understanding of how they
correlate with DLB clinical symptoms. I will investigate the pathophysiologic and microstructural changes
occurring in DLB using a novel dMRI technique (Aim 1), and evaluate neuronal desynchronization in DLB using
task-based quantitative EEG (Aim 2). The proposed research addresses a significant gap in the current
literature on the underlying pathophysiology and brain structural changes associated with clinical
manifestations of DLB.
My long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator and leader in the field of ADRDs,
with a focus on Lewy body dementias. The proposed study builds on MRI research that I completed earlier in
my training and will allow me to expand this into Lewy body dementias. I propose a rigorous training program
with advanced coursework in structural imaging and EEG techniques, biostatistics, research design and
execution, professionalism, leadership, and responsible conduct of research. My primary mentor, Dr. David
Vaillancourt, is a well-established NIH-funded researcher in imaging and EEG techniques. He is an
experienced mentor who has successfully trained many young trainees into independent, NIH-funded
investigators. The University of Florida is an ideal environment for this project, not only for the necessary
laboratories, equipment and supplies needed to complete the proposed studies, but also for the Fixel Institute
as one of the leading Lewy body dementia Research Centers of Excellence. Together, the assembled team
and environment will allow me to conduct mentored research with advanced neurodiagnostic techniques
important for understanding DLB pathophysiology, and improving therapeutics in the future."

About 50,000 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are diagnosed in the US every year, making DCIS the
most common type of non-invasive breast cancer diagnosed in women. Up to 20% of all patients will experience
disease recurrence accompanied by invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Current cyto- and histopathological
approaches do not accurately predict disease progression, resulting in patients being under-treated or over-
treated for DCIS. Our long-term goals are to identify key factors that lead to IDC that will enable the development
of a molecular based approach to predict the risk of IDC, and a more tailored approach to treat DCIS. The
chemokine receptor CCR2 is a G Protein Coupled Receptor, which is normally expressed on macrophages and
regulates chemotaxis in response to CCL2 during inflammation and cancer progression. Using a mammary
intraductal injection model (MIND) to mimic DCIS formation in animals, we have challenged current paradigms
on CCL2/CCR2 signaling, by demonstrating that CCL2/CCR2 signaling to breast cancer cells promotes DCIS
progression to IDC. This R01 renewal project characterizes the role of metabolism and c-MET in CCL2/CCR2
mediated DCIS progression, and may identify better predictive markers for DCIS progression, with implications
on reducing patient over-treatment, and provide justification for developing CCR2 as a therapeutic target to
reduce under-treatment. Metabolic reprogramming is an important hallmark of cancer, but is poorly understood
in early stage breast cancer. Preliminary studies indicate that CCL2/CCR2 enhancement of DCIS progression is
associated with increased glycolysis and glutamine metabolism, which facilitate fatty acid synthesis. CCL2
mediated breast cancer invasiveness and metabolism may be dependent on interactions between CCR2 and c-
MET receptor tyrosine kinases in breast cancer cells. We hypothesize that CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling in
breast cancer cells enhances glucose and glutamine metabolism through c-MET dependent mechanisms to
facilitate DCIS progression. Aim 1 is to determine the relevance of CCL2, CCR2, c-MET and metabolic enzyme
expression to DCIS progression to invasive carcinoma using patient samples and magnetic resonance
imaging/spectroscopy approaches in DCIS bearing animals. Aim 2 is to determine the functional contribution of
c-MET to CCL2/CCR2 mediated breast cancer growth, survival, invasion and metabolism through modulating c-
MET in breast cancer cells in vitro and in the MIND model. Mechanisms of CCR2/c-MET/SRC interactions in
breast cancer cell lines will be examined through molecular and biochemical approaches. Aim 3 is to determine
the biochemical and molecular mechanisms through which CCL2/CCR2 mediated metabolic changes promote
breast cancer growth, survival and invasion through modulation of glycolytic, glutamine and fatty acid synthesis
pathways in breast cancer cells in biochemical and cell culture assays. Protein degradation pathways that
potentially regulate HKII, GLS1 and FASN expression in breast cancer cells will be examined through
biochemical approaches."
10840300,"The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are a large protein toxin family grouped into seven BoNT serotypes (A-G)
based upon limited cross protection of ï¡-sera against each BoNT serotype. BoNT are the most toxic proteins
known for humans and the causative agent of botulism. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine against
botulism and the experimental penta-serotype toxoid vaccine previously available from the CDC for at-risk
populations was discontinued in 2011. Thus, there is a need to develop a potent and effective BoNT vaccine
against all BoNT serotypes to protect at-risk humans from exposure, including civilians in harmâs way, first
responders, the military, and researchers. BoNT are organized into three domains involved in catalysis (LC),
LC translocation (HCN), and receptor binding (HCC). Earlier efforts have focused on developing recombinant
HCC-based vaccines to overcome the shortcomings of chemically inactivated toxoids, but recent studies have
shown that recombinant full-length BoNT vaccines are more potent than vaccines comprising the receptor
binding domain. In addition, ELISA studies implicated the HCN translocation domain as the immunodominant
domain, not the HCC receptor binding domain, in recombinant full-length BoNT vaccinated mice surviving
native botulinum toxin challenge. This supports the hypothesis that a recombinant full-length non-toxic BoNT
mutated to inactivate the three independent functions of toxin action (catalysis, LC translocation, and receptor
binding) will improve vaccine potency for outbred populations.
The current study will utilize informatics and assessment of structure-function alignments of the seven
serotypes of botulinum toxin, along with cell biological analysis and immunological assessment of the antibody
(IgM and IgG) response of animals immunized with recombinant, full-length BoNT vaccine versus chemically
inactivated botulinum toxoid. Two models for botulinum toxin vaccines will be tested: a single high dose BoNT
vaccine for rapid response to threats of BoNT exposure and a low dose BoNT vaccine for long term protection
against BoNT exposure. The low dose protective vaccine will be tested versus chemically inactivated
botulinum toxoid in mice and rabbits. Understanding of the structure-function properties of bacterial toxins
allows production of Next Generation vaccines that are safer, less expensive, easier to produce, and
genetically malleable for rapid modification than chemically inactivated toxoids. The studies proposed in this
application provide future directions for these advances in toxin vaccinology."
10840307,"Project Summary
Genome integrity depends on a robust DNA replication program and the activity of replication-coupled repair
pathways that operate during different phases of the cell cycle. My laboratory has had a longstanding interest in
the causes and consequences of replication stress. Replication stress arises when lesions in the genome persist
due to repair deficiencies or when components of the replication machinery are dysfunctional. Although disease-
causing mutations in essential replication factors are rare, they can cause pleiotropic and severe disorders, such
as immunodeficiency, cardiomyopathy, or growth defects. In recent years, we have investigated the molecular
mechanism that underlies these rare diseases. We have identified compound heterozygous patient mutations in
the replication factor minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (MCM10), and have modeled them in human
somatic cell lines. Although these mutations cause relatively mild cellular replication defects, they pose
significant problems to telomere maintenance. One caveat of the current cell models is that they are immortalized
and express telomerase constitutively. To better understand the impact of replication defects in the context of
cellular development of affected tissues, we propose to engineer genome-edited induced pluripotent stem cells
and differentiate them into specific cell types in vitro. This presents a valuable alternative to animal models which,
relevantly, do not fully mimic telomere homeostasis in humans. Moreover, we are interested in the pathways that
cells activate for survival under conditions of mild replication stress. Previous work has identified a network based
on ubiquitination and SUMOylation, and ring finger protein 4 (RNF4) as a key component. RNF4 is a SUMO-
targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in double-strand break repair, however, its role at replication
forks and in telomere maintenance is not well understood. A genetic interaction screen has identified Bloom
helicase (BLM), a RecQ-family helicase that causes premature aging, and ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7),
a deubiquitinase, as strong negative interactors. Mutations in USP7 have been linked to rare
neurodevelopmental disorders, but its cellular action has remained obscure. Interestingly, USP7 and BLM also
regulate DNA replication and telomere length. We will investigate the relationship between RNF4, USP7 and
BLM in chromosome inheritance in telomerase-positive and -negative cells. Lastly, a common feature of
replication stress is under-replication due to an inability to duplicate the entire genome. As a result, single-
stranded gaps persist that can either be filled by post-replicative repair that is regulated by the ubiquitination of
PCNA or, as a last resort, by mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). MiDAS is a break-induced replication (BIR)-like
pathway that, unlike a classical replication fork, copies DNA by displacement synthesis. We will study how
ubiquitinated PCNA controls MiDAS, and will determine whether other BIR-related pathways are regulated by
PCNA ubiquitination. In summary, the questions addressed in this proposal will elucidate fundamental and
disease-relevant mechanisms of genome stability pathways in human cells."

The scope of Alzheimerâs disease and related Dementias (ADRD) in the United States is unprecedented,
affecting 14 million Americans at an annual cost of $200 billion.1,2 Addressing the needs of patients with ADRD
requires substantial long-term behavioral and social care supports not typically available under traditional fee-
for-service insurance. Due to their cognitive limitations, older patients with ADRD may not know that other
potentially beneficial insurance options are available to them. Managed care products may be expected to
improve patient outcomes while restraining health care use. By helping patients, this might also alleviate need
for caregiver support. Thus, managed care might offer critical benefits for ADRD patients and their caregivers.
However, little is known about the role of managed care in dementia care. It is important to understand whether
older individuals with ADRD are using managed care products, which ones they use, and the role of caregivers
in such decisions. It is also important to understand the impact of managed care on health outcomes for older
patients with ADRD including use of informal care. Given the burdens of dementia, and associated impacts on
caregivers, there is a critical need to pursue research to address these knowledge gaps. Using longitudinal
Medicare inpatient data, plus national survey data, the proposed research will use instrumental variables
analysis to explore the impact of managed care on older adults with ADRD including receipt of caregiving.
Innovation: The grant will be the first to rigorously examine the role of managed care programs on outcomes for
a debilitating disease requiring self-management from older adults and their family caregivers. To do so, it will
use a unique and robust mix of survey and claims data to examine managed care and dementia outcomes.
These analyses will be conducted by an interdisciplinary study team with clinical and research expertise in
dementia care, caregiving, and outcomes measurement as well as leaders in policy research. Finally, we have
a robust dissemination strategy exploiting the strengths of our institutional resources for rapid dissemination.
Impact: This project will leverage large national datasets and rare linkages between survey and administrative
data to provide insights for clinicians and policymakers into improving coverage and care strategies for ADRD,
and actionable methods that can support older individuals and their informal caregivers. It will inform insurers
about the extent to which managed care is successful in addressing the needs of the ADRD population and
help patients and caregivers learn select insurance products that are most beneficial for their health."

The overall incidence of HPV+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has exhibited an increasing
trend over the last few decades, and has now in the U.S. overtaken cervical cancer as the most common site of
HPV related cancer. The majority of patients present with advanced-stage HNSCC are without a clinical history
of pre-malignancy. Because there is a paucity of pre-cancer clinical samples the studying the steps of cancer
progression that would provide an understanding of the carcinogenic we have developed an in vitro progression
model. Interestingly, HPV+ patients compared to HPV negative (HPV-) patients have an improved overall
prognosis and greater disease-free survival, attributed partly to a better response to radio- and/or chemotherapy.
The mechanisms and natural history of oral HPV infection and carcinogenic progression are poorly understood.
 Men and women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher rates of HPV16
infection, longer persistence of HPV16, increased incidence of HNSCC, poorer prognosis, as well as
more recurrences after definitive therapy. There have been substantial changes in the burden of cancer
affecting HIV-infected individuals in the U.S. during the period spanning the introduction of highly active anti-
retroviral therapy (HAART). Scaling-up of HAART therapy has dramatically increased the life expectancy of
people living with HIV (PLHIV). As a result of these temporal changes, non-AIDS-defining cancers have come
to comprise the majority of cancers in HIV-infected persons during the HAART era. Among these emerging
malignancies, HPV-associated cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx increased significantly following an
AIDS diagnosis. Most patients with HIV/HPV co-infections on HAART therapy have reduced risk of developing
HPV-associated cancers such as cervical cancer but have a higher risk of developing HPV-associated oral
cancers the risk is suggested to be due to longer life expectancy as a results of HAART therapy. But it is unclear
why HAART therapy may have different effects on HPV+ HNCSCC versus HPV+ cervical cancers.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that HAART therapy affects the progression of HPV+ HNC. This increases
the numbers of PLHIV who have persistent oral HPV infections that progress to HNCSCC, poorer prognosis,
and death. We propose to focus on three areas to test this hypothesis.
Specific Aim 1. Analyze HAART induced differences of HPV carcinogenic propensity in oral epithelial
cells. Specific Aim 2: Investigate the effect of HAART on carcinogenic markers and metabolic pathways
associated with HPV+ HNSCC. Specific Aim 3: Study the effect of HAART on glycolysis versus
mitochondrial respiration."

including fMRI/DTI, high-density EEG, fNIRS, multifocal ERG, and Adaptive Optics, as well as a range of
screening tools for visual and cognitive assessments and workstations for imaging data analysis. Most of the
equipment is housed in the Neuroimaging Core space in the Neuroscience COBRE suite in the Department of
Psychology, adjacent to the labs of the 12 cognitive neuroscience faculty who are the primary users. The fMRI
facility is a contractual partnership with our community hospital (Renown Health) and includes excellent long-
term access and low cost for research scanning at both of their MRI facilities. The core supports a large user-
base and a number of active grants, as well as several of the Centerâs previous and current projects and pilot
projects. It provides unique resources at the university that are essential to the research programs of all of our
cognitive neuroscience faculty as well as additional users. In Phase III we will continue to expand and
strengthen these services including supporting the Pilot Project Program and the broader neuroscience
community, and will develop the business plan and recharge mechanisms that will transition the core to a
permanent user- and institution-supported facility by the end of the COBRE funding."

Homology-directed repair (HDR) is a major, high-fidelity pathway for the elimination of DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB)s and for DNA replication fork maintenance. Deficiencies in HDR invariably cause genome
destabilization and can lead to neoplastic cell transformation and tumorigenesis. HDR is initiated via the
exonucleolytic resection of the 5â strand of DSBs to generate extended stretches of ssDNA. DNA resection is
subject to negative control by 53BP1 and associated factors including DYNLL1 and the hetero-tetrameric
Shieldin (SHLD1,2,3-REV7) and the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) heterotrimer. The mechanism of DNA end
resection restriction by the 53BP1 complex and the manner in which this restrictive action is overcome by the
tumor suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1 will be defined in Project 1 and Project 2.
 In HDR, the 3â ssDNA tails derived from DNA end resection serves as the template for the assembly of
a helical nucleoprotein filament of the RAD51 recombinase. The assembly of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein
filament is facilitated by the tumor suppressor BRCA2 in conjunction with its obligatory partner DSS1. The
presynaptic filament catalyzes DNA strand invasion, a crucial step of HDR. Surprisingly, we have found that
CST strongly inhibits the DNA strand exchange activity of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. This
result indicates a novel post-resection function of CST in regulation of DSB repair. Furthermore, we have found
that the inhibitory effect of CST is alleviated by the BRCA2-DSS1 complex. These paradigm-shifting results
provide new insights into the mechanism of DSB repair pathway choice. Project 3 will delineate the
mechanistic underpinnings of the novel post-resection regulatory circuit of DSB repair in humans. Our aims are
to study: 1) the mechanism of CST-imposed restriction of RAD51-promoted DNA strand exchange; 2) the
mechanism of BRCA2-DSS1 reversal of CST-imposed restriction; and 3) the role of the higher order BRCA
complexes in overcoming CST restriction. Because mutations in BRCA2 and BRCA1 proteins are responsible
for nearly a half of all hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, the proposed studies will not only uncover the
fundamental mechanisms of regulation of HDR in humans which involve these proteins but will also help in the
development of novel cancer therapeutics."

This postdoctoral research training program in pulmonary and critical care medicine, open to MDs and PhDs in
health sciences, is in its fourteenth year. It is designed to provide 2-3 years of support for training in clinical and
translational research and offers optional participation in the Vanderbilt Master of Science in Clinical Investigation
(MSCI) and Master of Public Health (MPH) programs. Since its inception, 27 trainees have joined the program,
18 MDs, 3 MD/PhDs, and 5 PhDs. This program has gender and racial/ethnic diversity with 27% female trainees.
And 15% under-represented minorities; to further improve diversity and inclusion, we have established a
comprehensive diversity recruitment program in collaboration with our Office for Diversity in Medical Education
and Office of Minority Student Affairs. Ten of 27 trainees have participated in the MSCI program, and two in the
MPH Program. The vast majority of our graduates have gone on to primary research or research-related careers
in academic medicine. In addition, 27 junior faculty have participated in our innovative mentor-in-training program.
Given the success of the first 14 years, we are requesting renewal of funding support. Remarkable advances in
the prevention, treatment, and management of acute and chronic disease have occurred in past decades.
However, there is growing national concern that expert clinical investigators who can translate new research
findings to practice are decreasing in numbers. It has never been more important to create and maintain a cadre
of well-trained translational and clinical scientists, given the unprecedented developments at the cellular and
molecular level, including knowledge of the human genome and the advent of big data science. Vanderbilt has
a very successful history in developing well trained researchers who have the vision and the skills with which to
embark on successful careers in academic research, both basic and clinical. This innovative training program,
""Clinical and Translational Research Training Program in Pulmonary Medicine"" focuses on mentoring
researchers in all aspects of clinical and translational research necessary to prepare them for the unique
challenges associated with advancing science in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. The program accepts
2-3 new trainees per year (maximum 5 participants/yr) selecting applicants who show exceptional aptitude for
successfully pursuing an academic research career. The program offers trainees opportunities to explore
hypotheses anywhere on the continuum of translational research in four core areas: Airway Disease, Pulmonary
Vascular Disease, Parenchymal Lung Disease and Critical Care Research; all of these are areas of international
recognition and research presence for Vanderbilt. The Program Directors lead a team of expert mentors in these
areas who are engaged in successful academic research careers, who play significant roles in supporting
trainees in developing research skills; applying those skills; identifying and resolving research-related process
problems; and understanding and applying the principles of responsible conduct of research. The overarching
goal is to prepare trainees to utilize the skills they acquire in the pursuit of future academic research careers."
10847463,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) relentlessly erode affected
individuals' decision-making abilities. As these abilities decline, persons with AD/ADRD often engage another
person, typically their care partner, in decision making. In clinical encounters, the addition of a third party, the
clinician, further complicates communication and decision making. There is a critical need to identify
interventions with the potential to improve dyadic and triadic communication. Supported decision making is
such an intervention. In supported decision making, an adult with impaired decisional abilities enters into a
structured agreement with another person; this agreement identifies domains in which the adult with impaired
decisional abilities needs and wants decision-making help, and it specifies the kinds of help sought. This
agreement then guides the supported decision-making process. For example, based on the agreement, this
other person may talk through the pros and cons of various treatment options to aid the adult with impaired
decisional abilities in reaching a decision. Supported decision making acknowledges the potential
vulnerabilities of persons with impaired decisional abilities while also promoting their ability to engage in self-
determination and, in turn, their wellbeing. Supported decision making is increasingly being used with young
adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) who reach the age of majority (i.e., are no longer
minors under parental care), and evidence suggests that supported decision making promotes their wellbeing.
Moreover, many states are beginning to recognize supported decision making as an option for persons with
impaired decisional abilities. Yet, no extant supported decision-making resources are AD/ADRD-specific, and
there is a lack of evidence on the outcomes of supported decision making for persons with AD/ADRD, their
care partners, or clinicians. In Aim 1, we will modify existing supported decision-making tools for use in
AD/ADRD with input from Delphi panelists including patients, care partners, clinicians, and experts in consent,
capacity, and supported decision making. In Aim 2, we will interview patients, care partners, and clinicians to
understand the attitudinal, normative, and self-efficacy beliefs associated with greater intention to use the
AD/ADRD-specific supported decision-making toolkit, as well as perceived barriers to its use. In Aim 3, we will
pilot test the AD/ADRD-specific supported decision-making toolkit with patients, care partners, and clinicians at
the Penn Memory Center and assess decision making following delivery of the intervention relative to usual
care. In order to develop potent, scalable behavioral interventions to meet the medical decision-making needs
of the millions of Americans with AD/ADRD, we must increase our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying supported decision making and assess its ability to improve their wellbeing."

The skin functions as a protective physical barrier as well as an immunologic organ that protects the
host from pathogens but is also subject to autoinflammatory disease. Immunity in the skin involves the
development of inflammatory cytokine cascades between different cell types that both promote host
defense but are pathogenic in disease. For example, IL-23 from dermal dendritic cells drives
production of IL-17 from T cells resulting inn host defense against extracellular pathogens but this
cascade is also pathogenic in diseases such as psoriasis vulgaris and hidradenitis suppurative. A
similar cascade involving IL-4 and IL-13 has been described for defense against parasites and atopic
dermatitis. Recently, it has become appreciated that TRPV1-expressing cutaneous neurons play an
obligate role in cutaneous inflammation across a wide variety of contexts, but the exact mechanism
remains unknown. In the past cycle of this grant we explored whether activation of TRPV1-expressing
neurons in the absence of any tissue damage could trigger inflammation. Using optogenetics, we
found that multiple rounds of activation of TRPV1-expressing neurons with laser light was sufficient to
trigger Type-17 inflammation which was dependent on the neuropeptide CGRP released from sensory
nerve terminals and dermal dendritic cells. Host defense against epicutaneous C. albicans and S.
aureus infection was augmented, and both the Type-17 inflammation and host defense extended
beyond the site of stimulation through a nerve reflex arc providing regional anticipatory immunity. The
temporal precision of optogenetic stimulation allows us to interrogate the early stages of TRPV1-
mediated neuroinflammation. In this proposal we seek to test the hypothesis that neuroinflammation
triggered by TRPV1-expressing neurons initially activates mast cells resulting in clustering of immune
cells which then allows for CGRP-dependent production of IL-23 from dermal dendritic cells. We will
also test whether TRPV1-expressing neurons not only trigger inflammation but also provide a positive
feed-back loop that is required to maintain ongoing inflammation. Finally, we examine whether
stimulation of TRPV1-expressing neurons affect adaptive immunity and is sufficient to trigger Th17
differentiation and reactivation of cutaneous resident memory Th17. Our expectation is that by more
fully delineating neuroinflammatory pathways, we will obtain basic insight into the development of
innate immune responses and allow for potential therapeutic intervention. Moreover, modulation of
adaptive immunity by TRPV1-expressing neurons would link neuroinflammation with flares in
established Type-17 autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis as well as potentially with the
development of autoimmunity associated with chronic pain"
10847466,"Treatment with naltrexone (NTX), a nonselective Âµ, d, k (MOP, DOP, KOP) classical opioid receptor antagonist,
is considered a gold standard of care for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for
novel and more efficacious pharmacological approaches to AUD since only a minority of patients benefit from
NTX. Findings of the previous funding periods suggest that both innate and chronic EtOH-induced
overexpression of classical opioid receptors contribute to enhanced motivation for EtOH whereas activation of
the antiopioid nociceptin/orphanin (N/OFQ) receptor (NOP) system reduces EtOH intake and seeking.
Preliminary data supporting this renewal suggest that simultaneous blockade of classical opioid receptors with
concurrent activation of NOP has superior efficacy compared to classical opioid receptor antagonists such as
NTX or manipulation of single receptor subtypes. These findings provide a solid foundation for a systematic
investigation of the therapeutic potential of a novel pharmacological agent (BU10119) that blocks MOP, DOP,
and KOP receptors while activating NOP receptors. The major objective of this project, therefore, is to establish
the efficacy of BU10119 (and, by inference, mixed nonselective classical opioid antagonists/NOP agonists) for
AUD treatment as well as the neurobiological basis of BU10119âs actions. Specific Aim 1 will establish the
effects of acute BU10119 vs. NTX on EtOH drinking and context or stress-induced EtOH seeking in rats with
intact NOP function [nondependent Wistar rats (ndW)] compared to both rats with innate [Marchigian Sardinian
alcohol preferring rats (msP)] and chronic EtOH-induced [(postdependent Wistar rats (pdW)] NOP
overexpression and rats with deficient NOP function [NOP-knockout (NOP-KO) rats]. Specific Aim 2 is designed
to characterize the effects of BU10119 in the context of chronic treatment. This objective is translationally
relevant as well as necessary given the known sensitivity of N/OFQ-NOP function to adaptive changes with
repeated pharmacological manipulation and will establish the direction in which such possible changes modify
the effects of BU10119 vs. NTX. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate how recruitment of the N/OFQ system contributes
to the efficacy BU10119 by establishing the effects of concurrent classical opioid receptor blockade and NOP
activation and by identifying the brain site(s) in which NOP activation conveys enhanced efficacy to mixed MOP,
DOP, KOP antagonists / NOP agonists. Successful completion of this project is expected (a) to define the
therapeutic potential of drugs acting as classical opioid receptor antagonists / NOP agonists for AUD treatment
while directly informing the development of BU10119 as an AUD therapeutic, and (b) to generate novel
information on the neural basis of the âanti-addictionâ effects of this class of pharmacological agents."

DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s are eliminated primarily through two mechanistically distinct pathways,
namely, non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Importantly, HDR
also functions to repair damaged DNA replication forks and to protect stressed replication forks against
attrition mediated by cellular nucleases. The selection of HDR versus NHEJ is subject to intricate regulatory
control and is linked to the cell cycle. Most notably, the 53BP1 axis, consisting of the chromatin epigenetic
mark reader 53BP1 and associated factors, including DYNLL1 and the hetero-trimeric CTC1-STN1-TEN1
(CST) complex, functions to restrict HDR in G1 phase of the cell cycle to channel DSBs into NHEJ. Our
Program Project research teams at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Columbia
University, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute focus on delineating the mechanisms that underpin the DNA
end resection and RAD51 presynaptic filament assembly steps of HDR, and how these processes are
negatively regulated by the 53BP1 axis, and the manner in which this restriction is overcome by HDR protein
complexes that harbor the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Protein Biochemistry and
Enzymology (PBE) Core is directed by a seasoned nucleic acid biochemist/enzymologist and will help our
Program Project overcome technical bottlenecks and achieve project objectives by (1) providing state-of-
the-art support in protein expression and purification, protein-protein interaction studies, nucleic acid
biochemistry, and also enzymatic assays germane for the research goals being pursued; (2) meeting new
challenges through consultation with investigators on matters pertaining to our areas of expertise; (3)
training students and fellows in various protein biochemistry and enzymological methods and techniques;
and (4) fulfilling the protein production needs of the Structural Biology and Biophysics (SBB) Core.

Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States, and
despite the advances made in EOC therapy, the five-year survival rate has been stagnant at approximately 45%
for decades. The current standard therapeutic approach is accompanied by toxic side effects, and the high cost
of chemotherapy places an enormous financial burden on patients, reducing their quality of life. Thus, there is a
critical need to identify low-cost approaches that can both enhance responses to current therapies and improve
survival by inhibiting tumor progression. Calorie Restriction has a strong capacity to alter the responses of cancer
cells and host cells in the tumor microenvironment, yet the mechanisms of such cross-talk are elusive. Our long-
term goal is to identify dietary mechanisms that can be modulated to impede EOC progression and thus be
translated into the development of more effective therapies and lifestyle changes for EOC patients. Our studies
show that 30% calorie restriction (CR), without malnutrition, in a mouse model of EOC decreases tumor burden,
ascites, and metastases. Additionally, our preliminary data strongly suggest that CR inhibits EOC due to a
decrease in alternatively-activated pro-tumorigenic (M2-like) macrophages and a corresponding increase in
classically-activated anti-tumor macrophages (M1-like), resulting in an increased M1/M2 ratio. This is important
as 50% of cells in EOC ascites are pro-tumorigenic macrophages (M2-like) and an increased M1/M2 ratio is an
indicator of better prognosis in EOC patients. Macrophage polarization is regulated, in part, through metabolic
reprogramming, with M1-like macrophages mainly relying on glycolysis and M2-like macrophages primarily
utilizing aerobic respiration. AMPK, a well-known regulator of energy metabolism, controls the balance between
glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration and our studies demonstrate that mice fed a CR diet have increased
AMPK activity. The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine the mechanism by which a CR
diet regulates macrophage polarization in EOC. Our central hypothesis is that the increased activity of AMPK
due to a CR diet remodels the glycolysis-tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway to promote an M1 (anti-tumor)
phenotype, thus leading to a robust anti-tumor immune response and reduction of the tumor. This hypothesis
will be tested in two aims: Aim 1 will identify the effects of increased AMPKÎ±1 activity due to CR on the EOC
progression, and Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms underlying CR-mediated macrophage polarization in
EOC. The proposed study is expected to have a translational impact by elucidating how the simple approach of
dietary intervention can cause metabolic regulatory changes responsible for macrophage plasticity during EOC.
Ultimately, this process could be exploited to tailor novel complementary therapeutic strategies and life-style
modifications to curb progression of EOC and other types of cancer."

The need for increased academic physician-scientists in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, and collaborative
rigorous investigation of new treatment modalities with focus on pathobiology, health disparities, and long-term
morbidities, is clear. This renewal application requests the resources to continue our four-year post-doctoral
research training program in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine within the Department of Pediatrics at the University
of California, San Francisco. The goal of the program, which began in 2006, is to increase the number of highly
trained, successfully funded and sustainable pediatric critical care physician-scientists, who will perform high
level laboratory, clinical-translational, and/or health services research that will ultimately improve our
understanding of the pathobiology of critical illness, improve short and long-term outcomes, and reduce the
incidence of children with residual disabilities and/or chronic disease. To this end, this program aims to provide
comprehensive science training and mentoring career development for pediatricians with an M.D. or M.D./Ph.D.
degree who commit themselves to an academic career with a strong research component. The key elements of
the training program are (1) a mentored research experience, (2) scientific course work, (3) career development
workshops, (4) interdisciplinary experiences, (5) continuing review and evaluation. The centerpiece of the
program is the continuation of a 4-year fellowship training program, with two years devoted to intense research
training in basic laboratory, clinical-translational, health services, or epidemiologic science related to pediatric
critical care disease. A large number of exceptionally qualified faculty have committed their support as mentors
for fellows supported by the proposed training grant. These faculty are affiliated with several of the UCSF
campuses and organized research units and programs (i.e., the Cardiovascular Research Institute and the
Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics), and several UCSF clinical campuses including UCSF Benioff
Childrenâs Hospitals in SF and Oakland, and the Zuckerberg SF General Hospital and Trauma Center. All fellows
will take courses in (1) Responsible conduct in research; (2) Scientific writing; (3) Art of lecturing; (4) Statistical
Analysis; and (5) Bioinformatics. In addition, all trainees and faculty will complete DEI training. A strong Trainees
Mentoring Program will support post-doctoral fellows in their training and career development. Mentors will meet
with the fellow on a regular basis, to assist him/her in setting and monitoring training and career goals. The
program has a strong track record in recruiting and training pediatric sub-specialists. Amongst the 16 trainees
who have completed training, 15 career development awards have been received. In addition, our first two
trainees have received RO1 funding, and 15 of the 16 continue in full-time academic faculty appointments. Thus,
the rationale for this renewal is based on the well-documented need for well-designed training programs to
prepare pediatric-scientists for a sustained productive career in Pediatric Critical Care research and the fact that
UCSF has the vision, experience and infrastructure to train the next generation of leaders in pediatric science."

Long-term, continuous monitoring of heart electrical activities via electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in
early diagnosis and timely interventions of various heart diseases. Concurrent detections of heart mechanics via
seismocardiogram (SCG) can yield important data that complement ECG with enhanced utility in early detections
of cardiac complications. However, existing ambulatory cardiac monitors are often single-modality and can only
detect ECG. Moreover, they usually suffer from poor long-term usability because nonporous constituent materi-
als limit their user-friendliness and long-term biocompatibility. To overcome these handicaps, this project aims
to develop multifunctional porous soft materials and explore their applications in next-generation user-friendly
skin-interfaced cardiac patches with bimodality (concurrent ECG and SCG recording) and long-term biocompat-
ibility. The central hypothesis is that rationally designed porous constituent materials and judiciously tailored
device fabrication process can enable next-generation skin-interfaced wearables with outstanding user-friendli-
ness-related properties (e.g., skin-like compliance, high breathability, antimicrobial) without sacrificing their elec-
trical performances. Two research aims include i) developing multifunctional porous elastomer with antimicrobial
property via phase separation and investigating extrusion printing of silver nanowire-based conductive materials
on obtained porous elastomers; and ii) fabricating mobile cardiac monitoring system with porous materials and
evaluating its performance via on-body tests. The major innovations include (1) creation of unprecedented mul-
tifunctional porous soft materials that can simultaneously achieve skin-like compliance, high breathability, anti-
bacterial, and waterproof; (2) establishment of maskless, additive, high-throughput fabrications of bioelectronic
devices on porous materials; and (3) generation of novel skin-interfaced cardiac patch that can outperform con-
ventional ones in terms of its user-friendliness, long-term biocompatibility, and long-lasting, reliable, concurrent
ECG and SCG recording. From a clinical perspective, the enabling cardiac monitoring device can shift the current
paradigm of ambulatory cardiac monitoring and benefit the people who suffer from heart diseases by providing
unprecedented user-friendliness for patients to wear and collecting real-time, reliable, comprehensive (ECG and
SCG) data for physicians to make crucial care decisions. From a fundamental science perspective, the proposed
research concerns foundational questions in skin-interfaced wearables: how to improve the user-friendliness and
long-term biocompatibility of skin-interfaced wearables via material innovations (e.g., development of multifunc-
tional porous soft materials) and how to fabricate high-performance bioelectronics with porous materials. From
a technical perspective, the created materials and addressed fabrication principles can be used to construct
various customized skin-interfaced wearables with outstanding user-friendliness, long-term biocompatibility, and
long-lasting fidelity of biosignals recording to meet a variety of arising requirements of home-based, personalized
healthcare (e.g., monitoring of wound healing, sleep, surgical recovery, stress, COVID-19, and elderly falls)."

Heavy drinking is common among young adult men who have sex with men (MSM), which increases likelihood
of engaging in sexual behaviors with risk for HIV. Text messaging - a ubiquitous technology- is starting to be
used to address alcohol/HIV risk, but more theory-based work is needed to rigorously develop and test the
content of text messages to optimize behavior change. Thus, in this MOSAIC K99/R00, the applicant will, in the
K99 phase, develop and refine, and then, in the R00 phase, test the efficacy of an interactive text messaging
program to reduce heavy drinking and HIV risk utilizing construal level theory (CL T) to define intervention targets.
Both prior evidence and theory inform this proposal. Specifically, CL T suggests that individuals can think about
a behavior or behavior change (e.g., drinking less) abstractly (e.g., why the person wants to drink less) or concretely
(e.g., how the person will limit their drinking). Interventions and experimental manipulations based on
CL T use the why/how paradigm to ask participants a series of why/how questions intended to induce abstract or
concrete thinking, respectively. Evidence suggests that abstract thinking may enhance motivation to change
whereas concrete thinking may facilitate effective implementation of behavior change; however, CL T has largely
been applied to facilitate weight loss and reduced smoking. Despite its applicability and potential, CL T has yet
to be applied to alcohol and HIV research. In this proposal, the applicant seeks to develop and test CL T-based
why/how text messages to induce abstract/concrete thinking, respectively, about alcohol and HIV risk and in turn
reduce alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, and negative consequences of drinking, at the day-level.
During the K99 phase, the applicant, working with an advisory panel of young adult heavy drinking MSM, will
develop and refine the text messaging protocol (Aim 1; months 1-9). We will then conduct a series of pilot tests
and exit interviews (2 rounds of n=12 participants) to iteratively assess and improve feasibility and acceptability
of the intervention (Aim 2; months 10-24). During the R00 phase, participants (N=240) will first complete baseline
assessment and GamePlan - an existing brief alcohol/HIV intervention to enhance motivation to change with
demonstrated promise. Participants will then be micro-randomized at the day-level (i.e., randomized every day)
for 8 weeks to receive (1) CLT-concrete messages; (2) CLT-abstract messages; (3) control messages; or (4) no
messages. Participants will complete assessments daily and at the end of the intervention.
These aims are in line with the applicant's goals to acquire training in (1) developing and testing behavioral
interventions (Dr. Christopher Kahler); (2) conducting micro-randomized trials (Dr. Stephanie Goldstein), and (3)
analyzing intensive longitudinal data (Dr. Jennifer Merrill}, and to facilitate a successful transition to independence.
This project will enable the applicant to work with a highly skilled, experienced team, and provide data for
a future R01 to test the effectiveness of the intervention on a larger scale, as well as provide critical theoretical
information regarding potentially novel mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol/HIV research."

Abstract:
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved process. A functional MMR pathway is essential for
maintaining genome integrity; loss of MMR results in genome instability and cancer in higher eukaryotes. For
example, defects in MMR genes result in Lynch Syndrome, a common hereditary cancer syndrome resulting in
early onset cancers of the colon, endometrium, ovaries, small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, upper urinary tract
as well as other tissues. In our most recent publication, we showed that in yeast, deletion of Modulator of
Transcription (also known as Not4) or General Control Nonderepressible 5 (Gcn5) modulate the levels of
Msh2, a major MMR component. Loss of Gcn5 significantly decreases Msh2, whereas deleting Not4 stabilizes
functional Msh2. Not4 and Gcn5 are proteins that ubiquitylate and acetylate various proteins respectively. We
hypothesize that Not4 and Gcn5 modify yeast MutSÎ± (comprised of Ms2 and Msh6) and that the modifications
affect the stability of the complex. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), the first aim of
the proposed research is to establish the role of Gcn5 and Not4 in the regulation of the major mismatch
recognition complex MutSÎ±. Our previous experiments have also shown that yeast MutS tracks with the
replication machinery during DNA replication. Human MutSÎ± is recruited to chromatin through specific histone
modifications and interacts with the replication machinery by binding PCNA, the DNA polymerase processivity
factor. However, the modifications that recruit human MutSÎ± are not utilized in yeast. How yeast MutSÎ± is
recruited to chromatin remains elusive. The second aim of this research is to determine the role of post-
translational modifications in MutSÎ± recruitment to chromatin.

Aging has a strong influence on breast biology. While an early age of first full-term pregnancy substantially
reduces breast cancer initiation, women that experience their first pregnancy after 35 years of age experience
insufficient milk production, and are more likely to develop breast cancer. This suggest that age of pregnancy
delivers distinct cellular and molecular perturbations to breast cells that influence the overall tissue development.
Yet, it is unknown how aging and age of pregnancy influences molecular mechanisms that control breast tissue
function, and to what extent these changes are evolutionarily conserved across mammals.
Our goal is to understand how aging influences the epigenome of mammary epithelial cells (MECs), in a manner
that alters cell differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and cancer initiation. We have recently found that an early age
of pregnancy in mice leads to enduring changes in the epigenome of MECs and milk production. Using an
inducible cMYC overexpressing mouse model, we also found that an early age of pregnancy blocks cancer
initiation and the transcriptional output downstream of this oncogene in post-pregnancy MECs. In this proposal
we will define how aging influences these robust phenotypes.
First, we will use epigenomics and transcriptomics to define how aging influences the establishment of
pregnancy-induced epigenomic landscape. We hypothesize that cellular alterations, and changes to the milieu
of transcription regulators brought by pregnancy will be altered in mammary tissue from aged mice. Second, we
have made an unexpected observation that an early age of pregnancy induces a substantial expansion of Natural
Killer T-cell (NKT) immune cells in the mammary gland of mice. Given that aging is known to broadly suppress
the immune system, we aim to deepen our understanding on how age of pregnancy, or an aged mammary
microenvironment, influences the reprograming of resident immune cells, as well as their role in cancer initiation.
Finally, in the last aim of this proposal, we will seek to determine how aging modulates the molecular state and
evolutionary origins underpinning pregnancy-induced epigenetic changes. Using systematic approaches to
examine the role of the age of pregnancy in the mammary tissue at both long (human-mouse) and short (human
population) evolutionary time scales, we aim to reveal novel aspects of epigenomic response to age in the breast
epithelium.
Collectively, the proposed research will provide fundamental insights into the effects of aging on the mammary
gland tissue biology, and carry the potential for discoveries that could be harnessed to improve breast health in
humans."
10848386,"SUMMARY:
 The objective of this study is to determine if the polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) along with other melanoma driver
pathways, is a therapeutically actionable druggable target for melanoma management, and what are the
mechanisms and interacting partners of PLK4, during melanocytic transformation and neoplastic progression.
 Melanoma is a clinically challenging skin cancer, if not diagnosed early. Epidemiological and genomic data
suggest that BRAFV600E mutations may be the initiating lesion in melanocytic nevi; however, these mutations
alone are not sufficient for malignant transformation. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and activation of other
oncogenic pathways are known to contribute to the neoplastic progression of melanocytes. In the recent past,
the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma management has seen dramatic changes with the approval
of new drugs such as BRAF inhibitors as well as immune-checkpoint inhibitors. However, these treatments are
linked with acquired resistance occurring in nearly 50% of patients. Therefore, novel mechanism-based
therapeutic approaches are needed for effective management of this dreaded neoplasm. Based on limited
number of recent studies, PLK4 is being considered as a potential druggable target for certain cancers. PLK4
inhibition has been shown to cause a failure of centriole and centrosome duplication, whereas its
overexpression results in excess centriole formation, which are sufficient to drive centrosome amplification
(CA) and genome instability that is linked to carcinogenesis. A recent study has suggested a role of PLK4 in
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via modulating PI3K/AKT pathway. We recently demonstrated that
PLK4 is significantly overexpressed in melanoma, and small molecule PLK4 inhibition resulted in a significant
anti-proliferative response in multiple melanoma cell lines [Mol Cancer Res, 2018]. Our preliminary data has
shown that PLK4 CRISPR K/O A375 melanoma cells show significantly decreased tumor growth in melanoma
xenografts suggesting an important role of PLK4 in melanoma. We also found that combined inhibition of PLK4
with BRAF and MEK inhibition exerted synergistic antiproliferative effect in melanoma cells. In this study, we
propose to challenge a hypothesis that PLK4 signaling, together with other driver pathways of melanocytic
transformation and neoplastic progression, will provide therapeutically-actionable novel co-targeting
approaches, for melanoma management. Three aims are proposed to; 1) determine the association between
PLK4 and other driver pathways of melanocytic transformation and neoplastic progression ex vivo; 2)
determine the functional and mechanistic significance of PLK4 in melanoma progression and metastasis in
vivo in a variety of human-relevant genetically engineered mouse models; 3) determine the therapeutic
significance of PLK4 inhibition, alone and in combination with other promising target-based anti-melanoma
modalities in vivo. We expect that our study will establish the exact role of PLK4 in melanoma, and its
diagnostic/prognostic as well as therapeutic significance in this neoplasm."
10848490,"Project Summary: Growth and Differentiation Factor 11 (GDF11) and GDF8 are two closely related molecules
of the larger TGFÎ² superfamily. While GDF8 is well known for its role in the regulation of muscle mass, evidence
is now emerging that implicates GDF11 as a factor that has beneficial effects on multiple biological systems.
Both GDF11 and GDF8 are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms. Each ligand is made as a precursor with
an N-terminal prodomain that remains noncovalently bound to the mature, keeping the signaling component
latent until activated by Tolloid-like proteases. In addition, extracellular antagonists such as Follistatin and GASP
bind and block ligand signaling. We propose that GDF11 and GDF8 are present in the serum in multiple activity
states ranging from a latent form to an activated form. However, studies that investigate how the different activity
states are differentially regulated are limited. We rationalize that a better understanding of these mechanisms
will facilitate efforts to understand the systemic role of GDF11 and GDF8 in human biology and the aging process.
To achieve this objective, we will use a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches coupled with in
vitro and in vivo experiments. Our proposal is centered on three specific aims where we will (1) test the
hypothesis that GDF11 and GDF8 exists in multiple âactivityâ states that regulate a transition from a latent state
to an active state, (2) test the hypothesis that the ânetâ GDF11/GDF8 activity in serum decreases with age, and
(3) test the hypothesis that GDF11 signaling and its regulation/extracellular antagonism can be decoupled.
Collectively, these aims will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of extracellular regulation of
GDF11 and GDF8 and how these potentially change during the aging process. Furthermore, we expect to
produce novel GDF11 and GDF8 molecules that can be used as tools to further probe the mechanisms
associated with GDF11 and aging, and can also be used to restore youthful levels of GDF11 in aged animals."
11040396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a high lifetime prevalence, imposing
a severe economic burden on society. Despite a number of clinically effective treatments for MDD, many patients
exhibit resistance to current antidepressants. Thus, novel interventions based on pathological mechanisms of
MDD are needed. We recently discovered that glutaminase (GLS1), the enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis
of glutamine to glutamate, is highly upregulated in activated microglia in the brain of mice subject to Chronic
Social Defeat Stress (CSDS), a well-established rodent model used to study stress-induced mood disorders,
including depression. We then reported that inhibiting the elevated glutaminase activity with JHU083, a glutamine
analog prodrug, dramatically inhibited the stress-induced microglial glutaminase upregulation, inflammatory
cytokine induction, and normalized the CSDS-induced social avoidance and anhedonia. Although JHU083
showed therapeutic efficacy, its translational potential is hampered by its propensity to cause gastrointestinal
toxicity likely associated with its reactive diazo group and its non-selective inhibition of all glutamine-utilizing
enzymes, not just GLS1. Given the significant clinical potential of this mechanism, we propose to overcome this
limitation by utilizing our recently developed selective GLS1 inhibitor JHU29 and directly targeting microglial
GLS1 by attaching JHU29 to hydroxyl-dendrimer nanoparticles delivery system. Our team discovered that
hydroxyl-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers (~4-10 nm) selectively target activated microglia in
the injured brain while showing minimal uptake in healthy brains. This is a highly translational approach, as
targeted dendrimer delivery has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated and efficacious in multiple large and
small animal models and was recently shown efficacy in a Ph2 clinical trial (NCT04458298). We have assembled
a highly experienced team with extensive expertise in neuroinflammatory mechanisms and preclinical models of
chronic stress (Zhu), dendrimer nanoparticles (Rangaramanujam), pharmacokinetics (Rais), glutaminase drug
discovery and clinical translation (Slusher). Together we will develop a dendrimer-glutaminase inhibitor
conjugate (Dendrimer-JHU29) for chronic stress-associated psychosocial behavior deficits by implementing the
following three aims: AIM 1- Synthesize and characterize generation-4 (G4) and generation-6 (G6) Dendrimer-
JHU29 conjugates. AIM 2- Assess their oral pharmacokinetics, microglial target engagement, tolerability, and
biodistribution. AIM 3- Using the optimal conjugate and dosing paradigm from Aim 2, evaluate its therapeutic
and tolerability profile in CSDS and vicarious defeat stress (VDS) mice models. Successful execution of these
aims will result in a Dendrimer-JHU29 conjugate ready for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies to
support future clinical studies to combat chronic stress-associated depression."
11040430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The cranial neural crest (NC) contributes to the formation of many craniofacial structures including the
bones and cartilage of the face, tooth dentin and peripheral ganglia. Cell signaling regulates different aspects
of cranial NC specification, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and differentiation and disruptions in
this developmental program results in many cranial NC-derived craniofacial birth defects including
craniosynestosis, Treacher Collins and CHARGE syndromes, and cleft palate. BMP signaling plays a crucial
role during the specification and differentiation of cranial NC, and more recently, BMP signaling was shown to
control cranial NC EMT. A mechanistic understanding of the role of BMP signaling during cranial NC
development is essential to develop novel preventative and therapeutic measures against craniofacial
defects.
 This proposal will determine the molecular mechanism of BMP gradient formation in the chick
gastrula, and how this gradient regulates the formation of cranial cell types including neural, cranial NC,
placode and epidermal fates. These experiments will use in vivo and in silico approaches to test the
hypothesis that extracellular BMP ligands are produced primarily by the cranial NC and are actively shuttled
over long distances to signal most strongly in the nonneural ectoderm. Next, quantitative expression analysis
and live imaging will be used to establish the timeline of BMP signaling during gastrulation and neurulation,
and analysis of the resulting datasets will determine population- and single-cell-level responses to BMP
signals. Differences in signal timing and strength will then be correlated with direct input into different target
genes. Finally, the role of BMP target genes Id1/2/3/4 and Fibin during cranial NC EMT will be investigated
using in vivo functional analyses. Together, the results of these aims will provide a comprehensive
understanding of the regulation and roles of BMP signaling events during early cranial NC development.
 In addition to identifying targets for translational avenues to prevent craniofacial birth defects, the
mentored phase of this proposal will provide Dr. Michael Piacentino with necessary training as he prepares to
begin his independent career. Dr. Marianne Bronner's lab at California Institute of Technology, and his
assembled advisory council, provide the necessary tools, expertise, and training environment to efficiently
execute the proposed aims and establish Dr. Piacentino's independence. This training will be instrumental as
Dr. Piacentino begins his independent research program and will provide the experience needed to make
lasting impacts on the field of BMP signaling during craniofacial development."

Pilot Project Program
The Pilot Project Program for the Center of Integrative Neuroscience will continue to build a critical mass of
extramurally-funded investigators in neuroscience at the University of Nevada, Reno and facilitate access to
the research infrastructure provided through the Centerâs four research core facilities. The program will achieve
this through two strategies. Pilot project funding will be provided to two junior neuroscience faculty each year to
develop research projects utilizing the core facilities. The project leaders will receive mentoring by a senior
expert in their area with a focus on acquiring the preliminary data from the pilot project to develop a submission
for extramural grant awards. The second strategy will be to provide small pilot awards for investigators within
the broader neuroscience and biomedical research community to support fees for using the facilities and
services in each of the cores. These awards will again be prioritized to allow investigators to acquire the data
needed for pursuing extramural funding. These programs will increase the user base and impact of the cores
for supporting both published research and grant funding, and will help continue to build the need and user
base for the cores that will allow them to transition to permanent supported facilities by the end of the COBRE
funding."
10849757,"The Administrative/Program Enrichment Core is the organizational unit responsible for facilitating research in
the basic biology of aging throughout the San Antonio (SA) Nathan Shock Center. The goal of the Core is to
provide continuous leadership and infrastructure that catalyzes scientific discoveries, promotes education and
research career development, and partners with other scientists and the community at large.
 The Administrative/Program Enrichment Core will foster and promote transformative research in geroscience
using a comprehensive research platform that integrates studies on longevity (lifespan), integrated physiology
(healthspan), pathology, and molecular phenotypes. These studies will drive discovery of molecular and cellular
mechanisms that influence aging and the development of novel strategies (including the identification of
pharmacologic targets) to promote healthy lifespan. The Administrative Core will monitor, stimulate, sustain,
evaluate, and report progress toward our goals through the following Specific Aims:
 1. To provide administrative, budgetary, and regulatory management support for the overall center;
 2. To foster education and an environment that stimulates collaborative efforts and synergies among research
resource cores and promotes education and research career development of early-career investigators;
 3. To promote interactions in aging research through the sharing of core services with investigators at other
institutions and building collaborations with other Nathan Shock Centers;
 4. To provide biostatistical support to all core users, and data management and project tracking for each of
the resource cores;
 5. To conduct continuous internal evaluations of the center and periodic external evaluations.
 Innovation: To further the continuing development of our center's research programs, the Administrative Core
will incorporate innovative features including:
 (1) An innovative web-based project management system to promote efficient monitoring and reporting of
project outcomes and to stimulate collaboration on the analysis of projects supported by the resource cores;
 (2) Novel statistical methodology to analyze complex outcomes and phenotypes relevant to aging research;
 (3) Facilitation of webinars to be run by the core leaders; as part of the educational and training goals of the
center, webinars will explain and promote the services that can be offered by each core.
 The Core will lead to three kinds of progress. First, it will foster a cooperative research environment within
UTHSCSA that will attract investigators to aging research via specific educational programs (i.e., seminars,
faculty and student retreats, and symposia that focus on various aspects of aging). Second, it will foster external
collaborative efforts with other Nathan Shock Centers. Third, it will assist with development and expansion of
aging research at other institutions with fewer resources for biology of aging research compared with UTHSCSA."
10849758,"The Aging Animal Models and Longevity Assessment Core (Animal Core) will continue a nearly 25 year
history of leadership, service, training and innovation in 1) providing new and established aging animal models,
2) administering nutritional and pharmacologic interventions, and 3) collecting lifespan and life-history data for
investigators in San Antonio and across the nation. The Animal Core is an essentail pillar of the San Antonio
(SA) Shock Center's overarching mission - to provide investigators with the resources required to integrate
lifespan and pathologic data with physiologic (healthspan) and molecular aging phenotypes for the expansion
of knowledge on the biology of aging and the identification of pharmacological and nutritional targets to promote
heathy aging. The Core achieves its goals through the following Specific Aims:
1) To breed and age new and established investigator-driven rodent models to elucidate mechanisms of aging.
2) To conduct lifespan studies of genetically, nutritionally, and pharmacologically manipulated mice and rats.
3) To provide aging marmosets to facilitate research on mechanisms of aging in non-human primates.
4) To educate and advise investigators on the requirements for rigor and reproducibility in aging animal research.
 The Core is housed in facilities specifically designed for the exclusive husbandry of aging animals. It provides
exceptional continuity of care and data collection by highly trained staff. It is the only Core providing access to
aging mice, rats, naked-mole rats and a non-human primate model, the common marmoset. Over the past 5
years, the Animal Core has continued its history of providing services to many investigators across the nation,
supporting multiple grant applications and publications, and contributing to impactful advances in the biology of
aging including: a) identification of the first murine model of the human female survival advantage; b) discovery of
the protective effect of calorie restriction on aging neural stem cells; c) demonstration of a central role for
hyperadrenocorticism in the suppression of inflammation by calorie restriction; d) discovery of a causal role of H2S
generation on kidney aging in mice; and e) establishing the first interventional lifespan extension study with a
pharmacologic agent in marmosets. These and other advances enabled by the Animal Core underscore its
importance as a generator of biogerontologic discovery."
10849760,"The Integrative Physiology of Aging Core (IPAC) of the San Antonio (SA) Nathan Shock Center provides
intellectual and technical services to internal and external scientists on the selection, design, and conduct of
functional assays in rodents and marmosets at the molecular, tissue/organ, and whole-organism levels. The Core
achieves its goals through the following Aims:
 1) To assist investigators with the design of experiments and the selection of tests to measure age-associated
 functional changes.
 2) To coordinate Core activities with other SA Shock Center and institutional resources to maximize the impact
 of each individual project.
 3) To carry out integrative (from systemic to molecular) functional assessments and analyze and interpret data.
 4) To disseminate knowledge through hands-on training and education of researchers, locally, and throughout
 the National Shock Center Program, on concepts and tools used in the field.
 IPAC provides services in (a) metabolism and bioenergetics, (b) neuromuscular and cardiac function, and (c)
cognitive and non-cognitive brain functions. Services are also matrixed by level: molecular, tissue/organ, and
whole-organism. The Core can perform focused functional phenotyping within one or more domains and levels,
or batteries of coordinated functional assessments that include measures from all three domains.
 During the present funding cycle, the IPAC served 63 investigators (2.8-fold increase from the previous
period), many external to UTHSCSA, resulting in 194 publications, leading to 80 funded grant proposals.
Examples of discoveries made with support from the IPAC include: the first demonstration of cellular senescence
in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease; the identification of the cardiolipin-remodeling enzyme ALCAT1 as a key
link between cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related pathology; the finding that mTOR
is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia; the discovery of TMEM127 as a new component of mTOR
complex 1 that controls development, growth and metabolism; the elucidation of NFÎºB as a central modulator of
insulin sensitivity and muscle growth throughout the lifespan; characterization of physiologic and hematologic
effects of long-term mTOR inhibition with rapamycin in the marmoset; and elucidation of numerous physiologic
changes with aging in the marmoset that lay the foundation for interventional studies in this species.
 The IPAC advances the field by employing emerging animal models of exceptional interest in aging. For
example, a unique feature of the Core is the development of the common marmoset as a model of aging to
help close the translational gap between rodent and human physiologic studies. Other innovations proposed in
this period include (1) measures of cellular and whole body resilience; (2) functional lipidomics to assess the role
of lipid metabolism and signaling in aging; and (3) single cell assessments in rodents and marmosets."
10849763,"Pathology increases exponentially with age. Therefore, to determine if an intervention has effects on aging,
longevity, and healthspan, investigators must know how the intervention affects age-related pathological
lesions. Furthermore, pathological assessment of old animals helps investigators determine whether changes
(functional, biochemical, molecular, etc.) are associated with, or independent of, underlying pathological
conditions and histological changes. Such assessments also provide insights into potential
biological/molecular mechanism(s) of the intervention. In addition, pathological analysis of young animals can
reveal how genetic, pharmacological, and other interventions affect early life development. Thus, it is essential
to obtain accurate and thorough histopathological assessments of animals throughout the lifespan.
 During the current funding period, the SA Shock Center Pathology Core performed services for 50
investigators (35 external to UTHSCSA). The resultant data were used in 26 publications (including papers in
Cell, Cell Metabolism, Nature Cell Biology, Nature Communication, and Nature Medicine). With the rapid
expansion of aging biology research locally and across the country, we anticipate that the demand for
Pathology Core services will grow even more.
 The Pathology Core will provide investigators with detailed pathological analyses of age-related lesions in
mice, rats, and other animal models, e.g., non-human primates. The Core will also offer histopathological,
morphometric, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses of specific lesions and tissues. These include
neoplastic lesions, inflammation, senescent cells, glomerulonephritis, brain gliosis, and histological
characteristics of adipose tissue. The Specific Aims of the Core are:
1. To conduct comprehensive end-of-life and cross-sectional pathological analyses of established and new
 rodent models and other species used in aging research (including non-human primates).
2. To conduct immunohistochemical, molecular and quantitative morphometric analyses of tissues/organs of
 rodent models and other species to better understand age-related histological changes.
3. To continue to: a) amass a comprehensive database of histopathological data and images as a resource
 for the scientific community; b) provide basic pathological information for new studies; and c) create a
 tissue archive as a resource for morphological, biochemical and molecular analyses.
4. To provide histopathology services for investigators by preparing paraffin and frozen blocks, making
 unstained slides, and performing special staining. Histology services also include: a) preparation of tissue
 array slides for histological/morphological experiments; and b) performing laser capture microdissection.
5. To assist faculty and trainees with the interpretation of data from pathological analyses in models of aging
 and help them with their grant applications and manuscripts."
10849764,"Pharmacologic agents are powerful tools for research in the biology of aging and the pathophysiology of age-
related disease. A pharmacologic approach to study aging offers a number of experimental advantages including
flexibility regarding the beginning and end of an intervention, the ability to combine a drug with other
interventions, and the capacity to treat any animal including genetically modified models. Further, the potential
to move a drug between laboratory animal models into human studies provides a solid basis of the translational
relevance of the work. Consequently, the demand to develop and test potential aging-modulating compounds
has increased substantially in the last 5-10 years. To meet these needs, we created the Analytical Pharmacology
Core in 2015. The overall goal of this Core â which is unique among all Nathan Shock Centers â is to promote
the application of existing and novel drugs to studies of aging and age-related diseases. This goal is achieved
through the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Assist investigators by developing dosage forms that effectively deliver drugs to specific
mechanistic targets in animal models of aging (e.g. mice, rats, and marmosets) at UTHSCSA and other
institutions. The Core assists investigators through the following services:
a) Developing and validating bioanalytical assays for drugs and small molecules; b) Designing and creating
usable, effective dosage forms; c) Measuring and confirming concentrations and stability of drugs in dosage
forms; and d) Quantifying and confirming drug concentrations in blood and tissues.
Specific Aim 2: Provide consultation and education regarding experimental design, data interpretation, and
grant/manuscript writing for investigators using drugs in aging research. Specific areas of expertise include:
a) Informing on the process of dosage form development; b) Recommending pharmacologic approaches, such
as level/timing of doses in studies; c) Proposing and justifying pharmacokinetic experiments, as needed; and d)
Assisting in interpretation of data and preparation of papers and grants.
 During the current funding period, the Analytical Pharmacology Core measured levels of 21 different
compounds in laboratory animal food and biospecimens (tissues, plasma, urine) for 23 laboratories across the
U.S. that conduct investigations related to aging biology. For the new funding period, we have incorporated
leading-edge HPLC/MS/MS systems that have significantly enhanced assay sensitivity, halved new bioanalytical
assay development and service turnaround time, and doubled productivity. Another innovative feature for the
next funding period is the incorporation of a procedure with dried blood spots that allows collection of multiple
tail blood samples from rodents during single-dose pharmacokinetic experiments. This method will be particularly
useful because it lowers supply costs, eliminates the need for freezer storage, provides drug stability, reduces
the numbers of animals (especially mice), and avoids the need to sacrifice them."
11004174,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed research seeks to elucidate the structural and mechanistic basis of RNA-dependent innate
immune antiviral proteins regulation that stop translation to curb viral infection. The proposal employs a
synergistic combination of structural biology (X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM), biochemical analyses (kinase,
RNA cleavage assay) and biophysical methods (fluorescence polarization, smFRET, calorimetry) to understand
how viral RNA structures inhibit the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase R (PKR, Aim 1) and the 2Â´-
5Â´-oligoadenylate synthases/endoribonuclease RNase L pathway (Aim 2) to escape the immune response, as
well as the mechanism of interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide 1 (IFIT1) induced translation control
(Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will not only produce critical insights into host-virus interplay and
host translation control, but will also reveal novel principles of riboregulation. Such in-depth mechanistic
understanding will provide a solid foundation for future work to design functional RNA devices that elicit specific
functions of PKR and OAS/RNase L, with potential applications in the treatment of infectious and autoimmune
and inflammatory diseases that are severe and costly threats to public health. Upon transition to independence,
the research findings from this proposal will form the basis of the candidateâs first R01 funding application.
The candidate seeks to acquire additional mentored research and career development training through a detailed
plan tailored to his specific training deficiencies and proposed research outside of his current expertise. Such
requested training in the mentored phase, wholly funded by the NIH Division of Intramural Research, will enable
him to become a successful principal investigator upon his transition into research independence. The K99-R00
award will provide excellent opportunities for the candidate to acquire concepts and research skills new to him
through a combination of formal course work, hands-on training, and frequent discussions and evaluations with
his co-mentoring team formed of five internationally renowned intramural and extramural scientists. The major
new research skills to be acquired include cryo-EM, smFRET and eukaryotic protein expression. In consultation
with his mentors and advisors, the candidate has developed a detailed career development plan that is tailored
to remedy his specific deficiencies in teaching, mentoring, lab management, and career development skills. The
plan includes a mentoring course followed by mentoring a NIDDK post-baccalaureate assigned to him, a
leadership and management course, and systematic trainings in career development skills including career
counseling and assessment, mock interviews, practice job and chalk talks."

Boston University (BU) proposes a comprehensive program entitled the `Boston University Summer Institute for
Research Education in Biostatistics and Data Science' (BU SIBS) that includes biostatistical analysis,
epidemiology, infectious disease modeling, design and analysis of clinical trials, statistical genomics, and
statistical computing within a data science framework. The structure includes online modules preceding a five-
week in-residence program followed by additional remote work on a mentored group research project. The
rigorous curriculum is interspersed with current examples highlighting the relevance of biostatistics with particular
emphasis on biomedical big data, machine learning approaches, and high performance computing. BU SIBS is
designed to interest and engage a diverse group undergraduates, recent graduates and early graduate students
from across the US. Our faculty is enthusiastic and committed, as are our guest speakers who are practicing
data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and physician-scientists from academia and industry. Hands-
on analyses with teaching data sets from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Framingham
Heart Study and Jackson Heart Study, along with relevant COVID-19 and tuberculosis examples, reinforce skills
in computing, data visualization, statistical and computational modeling, and interpretation of findings while
deepening exposure to a central theme of health inequities. The typical daily schedule will include a morning
lecture with incorporated R programming examples and active learning exercises. After lunch at the BU dining
facilities participants will return to the computer classroom to complete short assignments either relevant to the
lecture content or focused on new computing skills (SAS/Linux) or to work on the group research project. The
research project will span the entire program and will deeply engage students in a content area. Working with a
research mentor, the students will determine a research question, develop an analysis plan and proposal,
conduct the analysis, and synthesize and present results. The daily schedule will be interspersed with guest
speakers and site visits (e.g. to the Framingham Heart Study). Multiple sessions on career paths and graduate
school are also included. Strong institutional support from BU provides a 50% tuition scholarship, teaching
assistants, and infrastructure to support all aspects of student life during the program. BU has run a Summer
Institute in Biostatistics (BU SIBS) since 2004. Our track record is very strong. We successfully maintain follow
up of 92% of our BU SIBS alumni (2004-2020) and ~65% of our prior participants have either entered into
graduate programs in biostatistics or a closely related discipline or taken jobs in the field. Our experience with
our prior BU SIBS programs will enable us to rapidly implement a new BU SIBS program, maintaining proven
aspects of our past program while introducing new elements including a data science framework, an expanded
infectious disease module, stronger health inequities emphasis, and a more in depth research experience."

A range of cellular and circuit-level adaptations develops in response to chronic opioid exposure, which are
strongly linked to several facets of opioid addiction: tolerance, withdrawal and processes that may contribute to
compulsive use and relapse. However, we still do not have a comprehensive picture of the dynamic connections
and activities of neuronal networks in the brain that express the opioid receptors and peptides. Therefore, a
critical need exists to map the global cell-type identity, transcriptomic trajectory, shifting connectivity, and
ensemble activity of the key opioidergic networks underlying the onset and maintenance of cellular dependence,
and withdrawal. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing
neural circuits in key cortical and subcortical brain regions, in order to determine how these circuits maintain
cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four
complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks
using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to all MOR-expressing, as well
as withdrawal-active MOR-expressing neurons, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then
integrate these dynamic neuroanatomical maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes by
combing single-nuclei sequencing and spatial cellular-resolution transcriptomics via hyper-multiplexed in situ
hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell
types and retro-labeled connections. Lastly, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within the cortical and
subcortical target regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted
microscopes to image the neural ensemble activities across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. To bridge
these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network
Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify
potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. Our datasets will provide formal summaries and a
publicly available, searchable database logging the activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve
with repetitive opioid exposure, withdrawal, and abstinence."

Incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), are
intestinally derived hormones that regulate postprandial metabolism. The incretin system accounts for up to
70% of postprandial insulin secretion in healthy individuals and diminishes to ~30% in people with type 2
diabetes (T2D). Understanding the mechanisms that regulate incretin control of insulin secretion, and how this
becomes dysfunctional with metabolic stress, is central to understanding the pathophysiology of T2D. We have
recently discovered that proglucagon products from alpha-cells are essential for normal beta-cell function â a
phenomenon termed alpha-to-beta cell communication. Specifically, we found that intra-ï¢-cell tone is dictated
by the level of cAMP generated by input from proglucagon peptides. Impairing alpha-to-beta cell communication
greatly diminishes insulin secretion and results in glucose intolerance in the context of metabolic stress. The GIP
receptor (GIPR) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are expressed on beta-cells and potentiate glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion. On the other hand, alpha cells only express the GIPR and not the GLP-1R. Indeed, GIP
stimulates glucagon secretion, while GLP-1R decreases it. The goal of this project is to understand the importance
of GIPR activity in alpha cells and the potential contribution to metabolic regulation in both healthy and diseased
states. Our recent discovery that glucagon production from alpha cells is necessary for nutrient stimulated insulin
secretion, support the hypothesis that GIPR activity in alpha cells enhances alpha-to-beta cell communication.
A corollary to this hypothesis is that GIPR activity in alpha cells contribute meaningfully to the incretin effect in
a postprandial situation by enhancing insulin secretion. Moreover, interventions that limit GIPR activity in alpha
cells would be expected to decrease insulin secretion and impair glucose tolerance. Testing this hypothesis has
the potential to extend our concept of the incretin effect beyond beta cell activity to incorporate the alpha cell as
a vital component. Furthermore, clarification of GIPR activity in alpha cells can provide insight into the new
generation of anti-diabetic medications that incorporate GIPR activity, potentially explaining the increased
efficacy achieved by these compounds above and beyond GLP-1R monoagonism."

Africa
As antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves survival among HIV-infected individuals, they become susceptible
to diseases of middle and older ages, including epithelial cancers. In sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV
prevalence approaches 20%, breast cancer has become the most common malignancy and cause of
cancer-related death among women. Few studies have addressed the effects of HIV infection and ART on
the clinical presentation, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer. We propose to continue our study of
those effects among South African women. In our prior work, we investigated demographic and clinical
characteristics of 1200 breast cancer patients (18% HIV+), diagnosed 2007-2012 at the Chris Hani
Baragwanath Academic Hospital Breast Clinic in Soweto, Johannesburg. Since 2015, for our R01-funded
(CA192627) South African Breast Cancer and HIV Outcomes (SABCHO) study, we recruited and followed
women with breast cancer newly diagnosed at 5 hospital centers in Johannesburg and KwaZulu Natal, to
investigate the effects of HIV and ART on breast cancer treatment and outcomes. This collaboration of
University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) has yielded 16
publications to date (Wits contact PI and PD are former CUMC D43 trainees). We now propose: 1) to
analyze determinants of mortality among the >3,000 women enrolled in the SABCHO study (21% HIV+), of
whom 28.5% of HIV+ and 20.8% of HIV- patients have already died. We will assess cancer treatments,
comorbidities, viral load control, clinical and sociodemographic mediators of the effects of HIV on mortality;
2) to examine the associations between sarcopenia , chemotherapy dose reductions and grade 3/4 toxicities,
and early mortality among 600 black women (150 HIV+, 450 HIV-) newly diagnosed with BC;
3) to compare in HIV+ and HIV- patients, self-reported tamoxifen adherence and tolerance, plasma levels of
tamoxifen and its metabolites, and factors that may affect these levels: treatment adherence, enzyme
inhibition- and induction-based drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in
tamoxifen metabolism and pharmacokinetics; and
4) to train a) Sefako Makgatho University investigators in epidemiologic research, research ethics, contracts,
grant budgeting and management, informed consent, survey research, and blood specimen logistical
management; and b) masters students from Zimbabwe in pharmacogenomics and drug-drug interactions
pertinent to breast cancer patients receiving ART and other chronic comorbidity treatments."

Physicians well-trained to identify and treat patients with unhealthy substance use continue to be in short
supply; this is an acute need in the setting of the ongoing overdose epidemic. Advancing research and training
that would strengthen the clinical and research skills of physicians who are on the front lines of the current
addiction epidemic is our aspirational goal. These physicians are generalist physicians caring for patients from
adolescence through adulthood who are experiencing unhealthy substance use and subspecialty physicians
caring for patients with HIV and Hepatitis C virus infection. This renewal application proposes funding for years
21-25 (2022-2027) of the Clinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Program to expand upon
previous successes to develop substance use disorder expertise among physician researchers and educators.
The CARE Program has the following Specific Aims: To carry out (1a) CRIT (Chief Resident Immersion
Training) â immersion training in Addiction Medicine to educate Chief Residents (CRs) to teach state-of-the-art
clinical care of patients with substance use; (1b) CARE Faculty Scholars Program â training for residency
program faculty to incorporate Addiction Medicine content into their residency program training, mentor other
faculty in this realm in their medical school and improve addiction services at their institution; (2) FIT (Fellow
Immersion Training) â immersion training in Addiction Medicine in order to prepare clinical subspecialty fellows,
including Adolescent Medicine, Infectious Disease, and Gastroenterology to incorporate substance use topics
into their research; and (3) PRiT (Physician Researchers in Training) â mentored experiences to expose
medical trainees and support early career physician faculty in the development of clinical addiction research
careers. The CARE Program faculty include NIDA-funded physician investigators experienced in both clinical
research methods and the medical care of patients with or at risk for substance use disorders. The CARE
Program components will make important contributions to the development of the next generation of diverse
physician substance use researchers and to the dissemination of addiction research in order to provide better
care for patients from adolescence through adulthood. These contributions will improve health outcomes,
especially among groups whose unhealthy substance use is undertreated â such as African American,
Hispanic, and Native American patients, as well as adolescents, resulting in reduced medical, social, and
financial burdens of addiction."
11004179,"PROJECT SUMMARY: End-stage lung disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Lung
transplantation is often the only option for patients with advanced lung disease, yet 50% of recipients die within
five years due to the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). This project seeks to examine
the basis for the loss of region-specific stem cells and impaired airway regeneration, with a long-term goal of
improving cell-based regenerative medicine approaches. We will make use of innovative transgenic ferret
models in our well-established orthotopic lung transplantation model. We will investigate the role of glandular
myoepithelial cells (MECs) in renewing submucosal gland (SMG) cells and generating abnormal surface basal
stem cells (BSCs) in CLAD. We hypothesize that sustained regenerative pressures drive MECs to exit their SMG
stem cell niche to reconstitute surface BSCs with abnormal lineage properties that promote an immune response.
Additionally, this project will determine the regenerative function of KRT7+ glandular duct cells (DCs) during the
progression of CLAD. We hypothesize that the gland duct is a maturation point for MEC stem cells to adopt a
surface BSCs phenotype that is bypassed under sustained regenerative stresses in CLAD. Finally, we will
determine the relationship of antigen-experienced B-cells in promoting alloimmune and autoimmune reactions
against airway stem cells to drive CLAD. We hypothesize that prolonged regeneration of surface BSCs by
reserve MEC stem cells leads to the retention of MEC proteins on the airway surface. This ectopic expression
of self-antigens promotes an autoimmune response against the SMG stem cells niche. Currently, end-stage lung
disease is a significant cause of morbidity. However, we expect that by clarifying the processes that deplete stem
cells in transplanted lungs, we will improve the likelihood of developing long-term objectives of developing
effective stem cell therapies to sustain lung function and resilience to prevent CLAD."
10849272,"Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have historically served as crucial animal models for diseases, and for testing of
new therapies and vaccines that cannot be evaluated in rodents. Neotropical primates are used in biomedical
research less frequently in the U.S. than Old World primates, but there is growing interest in these animals as
models due to the close recapitulation of certain clinical diseases and simpler husbandry considerations. Studies
involving marmosets, squirrel monkeys, and owl monkeys comprise the bulk of NIH-funded research featuring
neotropical primates in several areas, including neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases, and aging.
In this resource application, we propose to develop a number of marmoset, squirrel monkey, and owl monkey
antibodies to address the gap between project goals and available reagents. Species-matched antibodies can
deplete targeted lymphocyte subsets and allow investigators to probe the impact of specific immune populations
on progression, protection, and recovery. Diagnostic antibodies that distinguish antibody classes and
subclasses, cell surface biomarkers, and soluble mediators will reduce limitations imposed by poor reagent
accessibility. To derive these reagents, the squirrel monkey and marmoset immunoglobulin repertoire will be
exhaustively defined and characterized. Furthermore, a novel antibody specificity assay will be developed with
straightforward adaptability to any species of interest. These resource activities will be integrated with antibody
reagent activities supported by other funding sources.
The antibody resources described here can raise the bar on neotropical primate translational research by
providing investigators validated tools to evaluate the immune response in models of infectious or inflammatory
disease."

10847104,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the
U.S. Approximately 75% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor ï¡ (ERï¡) positive. The current standard of
care for postmenopausal women with ERï¡+ breast cancers involves the choice of an upfront aromatase
inhibitor (AI), a tamoxifen (Tam)-AI, or AI-Tam switch strategy. Tam is the first line therapy for premenopausal
women, second line for postmenopausal women, and a chemopreventive agent for all age groups. Thus, Tam
continues to remain an important selective ER modulator for treatment of ERï¡+ breast cancer patients.
However, ~ 30% of ERï¡+ patients do not respond to Tam because of de novo resistance, and most who do
respond eventually acquire Tam resistance (TamR). Breast cancer patients who relapse on Tam retain
functional ERï¡ signaling, suggesting that endocrine resistance involves agonistic function of Tam or estrogen
independent ERï¡ activity. Crosstalk between ERï¡ and growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling pathways is
believed to contribute to endocrine resistance. However, clinical trials with GFR inhibitors have yielded mixed
results, indicating complex ER biology and involvement of novel crosstalk or additional/alternate mechanisms
in endocrine resistance. In this application, based on our data from isogenic models of acquired and de novo
TamR, we propose a novel transcription reprogramming induced mechanism of TamR that ensues from ERÎ±-
dependent/Tam-induced upregulation of Î²-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity. This is further
supported by our data that show ectopic Î²-catenin expression in Tam-sensitive ERÎ±+ breast cancer cells
transforms Tam from an antagonist to an agonist with resultant ERÎ±-dependent Tam-induced transcriptional
activation of Î²-catenin/TCF-responsive genes. Rad6B (a.k.a UBE2B), an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC),
stabilizes and activates ï¢-catenin by K63-linked polyubiquitination (polyUb) of its lysine 394 residue, a
ubiquitination event that protects ï¢-catenin from 26S proteasomal degradation. Rad6B is itself a ï¢-catenin
transcriptional target, thus creating a vicious positive feedback loop between Rad6B gene expression and ï¢-
catenin oncogenic activation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that Rad6B-mediated Î²-catenin
polyubiquitination and transcriptional activation drive TamR by facilitating Tam-induced ubiquitinated-Î²-
catenin/ERÎ± complex formation and transcriptional reprogramming of Î²-catenin/TCF gene targets. Hence a
hyperactive Rad6B/Î²-catenin axis would drive cells from a Tam-sensitive to a Tam-refractory state, whereas
inhibition of Rad6B catalytic activity will inhibit Î²-catenin ubiquitination/activation and uncouple TCF/Î²-
catenin/ERÎ± coregulated transcriptional programs resulting in restoration of Tam sensitivity. We will test this
hypothesis with two specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Establish the causative role of Rad6B in tamoxifen-induced
Î²-catenin/TCF transcriptional reprogramming and TamR breast cancer development and progression. Specific
Aim 2. Identify and characterize Î²-catenin/ERÎ± complex regulated transcriptional networks and underlying
alterations in epigenetic landscape associated with TamR and assess their vulnerability to Rad6B or Î²-catenin
inhibition. This study will uncover the molecular underpinnings of a novel paradigm shifting hypothesis that has
the potential to impact clinical management of endocrine resistant breast cancers. It will lay the foundation for
testing a new nontoxic strategy for treating TamR breast cancers, as well as identify markers with
diagnostic/prognostic and/or therapeutic potential."
10850549,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The problem: With an aging population, challenges to maintain good oral health are set to increase worldwide.
Systemic complications (high blood pressure, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders) add to local factors, such
as the exposure of the more susceptible root surfaces and the use of medications that cause hyposalivation.
Collectively, these factors increase caries rates, especially root caries, and reduce the oral health and quality
of life of older adults. As oral and general health are indivisible, poor oral health outcomes in older individuals
are associated with increased frailty and mortality. Challenges to overcome the increased rate of root caries in
older adults include the lack of a specific approach for root caries control, the standard of care being the
prescription of high fluoride toothpastes. These toothpastes have modest clinical effectiveness, since the
retention of fluoride in the biofilm is not proportionally enhanced as the fluoride concentration in the product
increases. Although fluoride has been the most effective agent for caries prevention for several decades,
surprisingly, no innovations to improve its anticaries efficacy have been made. Hypothesis: We devised a new
therapy able to enhance the anticaries effect of fluoride, while maintaining its dose and safety profile. In pilot
studies, we observed that this therapy, involving the use of fluoride nanoparticles, increase by approximately
100-fold the penetration and retention of fluoride in cariogenic biofilms, and exhibit an improved fluoride-
releasing profile. Thus, we hypothesize that the positively charged nanoparticles will penetrate the cariogenic
biofilm, bind to negatively charged biofilm components, and release fluoride at levels high enough to improve
the physicochemical effect of fluoride (needed for the control of root caries) as well as inhibit acid production by
the biofilm (reducing the predominance of acid-producing species, i.e. biofilm dysbiosis). This hypothesis will
be tested in the following specific aims: S.A.#1: Define the mechanisms of interaction between the therapy
components and dental biofilm; S.A.#2: Determine the effects of the therapy on root dentin demineralization;
S.A.#3: Establish the efficacy and safety of the therapy for caries control using in vivo rodent caries models.
Significance: Upon successful completion of this project, we will understand the preventive potential of a new
anticaries approach to reduce the cariogenicity of dental biofilm and control root caries. This work has the
potential to exert a long-lasting impact on the control of rampant caries progression in high caries-risk groups
and improve the health and quality of life of older adults suffering from hyposalivation."
10853791,"ABSTRACT
Recent studies in model organisms have demonstrated that the intertissue communications play a critical role in
the regulation of aging and longevity. In mammals, we have demonstrated that the intertissue communication
between the hypothalamus and adipose tissue, particularly mediated by extracellular vesicles-contained
extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltrasferase (eNAMPT), the rate-limiting NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme in
mammals, functions to counteract age-associated physiological decline and promote longevity in mice. Most
recently, we have demonstrated that Ppp1r17-positive neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMHPpp1r17
neurons) regulate white adipose tissue (WAT) function, including lipolysis and eNAMPT secretion, through the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the feedback loop between DMHPpp1r17 neurons and WAT plays a critical
role in the regulation of aging and longevity in mice. Our preliminary results suggest that this critical feedback
loop between DMHPpp1r17 neurons and WAT wanes over age, which is one of the key triggers for aging. Indeed,
chemogenetic stimulation of DMHPpp1r17 neurons in aged mice significantly ameliorates multiple aging phenotypes,
decreases age-associated mortality rate, and extends longevity. However, why and how this critical feedback
loop wanes over age remains unknown. In this research proposal, we hypothesize that adipose tissue starts
decreasing adipose-resident immune cells, particularly type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), and increases
cellular senescence, causing WAT dysfunction and decreasing the content and the secretion of adipose EVs.
Such WAT dysfunction then affects the regulation of Ppp1r17 function in DMHPpp1r17 neurons, affecting their
function and accelerating WAT dysfunction through decreased SNS function. Maintaining this hypothalamus-
WAT feedback loop is critical to counteract age-associated physiological decline and promote lifespan in
mammals. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following three SPECIFIC AIMs: SPECIFIC AIM (1) will
examine the effect of miR-20a, a microRNA species in adipose EVs, on the expression of Prkg1 in DMHPpp1r17
neurons during aging. SPECIFIC AIM (2) will elucidate how adipose immune cells are dysregulated during
aging. We will particularly focus on ILC2s, which are dramatically reduced in adipose tissue during aging.
SPECIFIC AIM (3) will address whether restoring ILC2 function by transplanting young ILC2s could delay aging
and extend lifespan in mice. The anticipated outcome of the proposed research will advance our understanding
of the importance of intertissue communications in mammalian aging and longevity control and open a new
opportunity to develop an effective anti-aging intervention based on the intertissue communication between the
hypothalamus and WAT."
10853792,"Although PTSD and cognitive dysfunction are frequent comorbidities of chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) in
Veterans, the neurophysiological basis of how TBI affects these processes remains unknown. In addition, there
are currently no effective treatments available for these prevalent, severely disabling comorbidities. The limbic
system, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and regions of the prefrontal cortex, underlies fear acquisition
and extinction, as well as many aspects of learning and memory. An exaggerated fear response is thought to
be essential to the pathophysiology of PTSD, as well as an associated lack of extinction of fear responses.
Extinction, rather than a âforgettingâ of the trigger and response, has been demonstrated to be a different form
of learning, with new circuits over-riding existing fear responses. A number of studies in humans and rodents
have demonstrated that TBI can exacerbate fear responses, while also diminishing the ability to extinguish fearful
associations. Tremendous advances have recently been made in understanding how the memory of fear and
associated aspects such as contextual information is encoded in the amygdala and its associated neural
networks, how neuronal activity in this network interacts with oscillations to encode information, and how fear
related memories are recalled and extinguished. Surprisingly, however, there have been few reports to date of
how the neurophysiological mechanisms of fear encoding, recall, and extinction are affected by chronic TBI.
Elucidating the mechanisms by which TBI affects the circuitry encoding fear learning and extinction in the
amygdala and associated brain regions will lead to better targeted treatments, including neuromodulation, for
PTSD comorbid with TBI and other learning-associated cognitive dysfunction. Treating PTSD with Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS, a form of neuromodulation) is being tested in Veterans, and it is essential to develop animal
models of this clinical intervention, including the potential influence of TBI on behavioral outcomes. Therefore,
the overall objective of the current application is to determine how the encoding of fear in extended amygdalar
circuitry is exacerbated following TBI, and to utilize electrical stimulation to restore normal balance to this system,
enhancing extinction and potentially restoring cognition. As the limbic system underlies many forms of cognition,
learning and memory, this may have broader implications in chronic TBI as well. Our central hypothesis is that
TBI disrupts normal communication between the amygdala and the hippocampus underlying fear associated
memory which leads to overexpression of fear responses, an inability to extinguish learned fear in chronic TBI,
and that this network imbalance can be rectified with neuromodulation. We will test the above hypotheses first
by determining the effects of chronic TBI-induced disruption on the circuitry underlying fear responses and
cognitive tasks in rats using simultaneous fear conditioning, multisite recordings, cognitive tasks, and
neuropathology. Next, we will test the ability of electrical stimulation (neuromodulation) to restore balance in the
extended amygdalar fear circuitry, restore extinction of fear, and improve cognition in a rat chronic TBI model.
In addition, we will compare pure diffuse TBI (mild TBI) and combined focal/diffuse injury (moderate/severe TBI)
in a large animal model in order to determine whether loss of connections between limbic regions leads to chronic
deficits in hippocampal-amygdalar dependent learning and memory, including fear learning and extinction.
These studies will help to determine how TBI disrupts the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction and cognition
and will facilitate the rational design of neuromodulatory and other therapies targeting these chronic sequelae of
TBI. These findings should provide crucial insights into the neural mechanisms of chronic TBI comorbid with
PTSD and associated cognitive dysfunction, and lead to improved treatments for these prevalent and disabling
comorbidities in both Veterans and the civilian population."
10860996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mammalian development relies on spatiotemporally orchestrated transcriptional programs that define cell fates.
While the mechanisms that govern such transcriptional states remain unclear, clues are emerging from the study
of enhancers within the non-coding genome and their long-range interactions with gene loci otherwise distant on
a linear scale. Such contacts are facilitated by the three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin, a nuclear
property whose dynamic regulation allows for cell fate decisions during embryonic development. SOX2 is a
transcription factor (TF) critical to the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In early
embryonic development, SOX2 expression persists in neural progenitors, where it is also crucial to their self-
renewal and multipotency, but it is not transcribed in mesendoderm. In human ESCs (hESCs), pluripotency-
associated TFs, such as OCT4, form heteromultimers with SOX2 and are thought to drive SOX2 transcription
by binding the SOX2 promoter. However, the mechanism whereby SOX2 transcription selectively persists in
neuroectoderm in the absence of pluripotency TFs remains unknown. Our group, which is interested in human
neural stem cell (NSC) biology in health and disease, recently discovered that, in human NSCs, transcription of
SOX2 is regulated by a novel enhancer located 600 kb away from the gene locus via 3D chromatin looping.
Importantly, this putative enhancer is repressed in hESCs and mesendodermal progenitors where the contact
between the distal enhancer and promoter is lost. These findings lead us to hypothesize that, during
differentiation of hESCs to early neural precursors, SOX2 transcription becomes de novo dependent on a
developmentally regulated distant enhancer, which exerts its effects on the SOX2 locus via dynamically
configured chromatin looping dependent on the chromatin organizer CTCF. In support of this hypothesis, we
found that CRISPR excision of critical CTCF DNA binding motifs in the SOX2 genomic neighborhood disrupt this
3D chromatin loop to impair neuralization of hESCs and bias hESC differentiation to endodermal fates in
teratoma assays. The proposed research plan will answer the following questions: 1) What are the effects of
experimentally induced enhancer silencing and activation in human neurogenesis? 2) How does perturbation of
the 3D chromatin folding affect neural development and how does it modulate enhancer activity? 3) Does SOX2
act as a conditional initiator of enhancer activation depending on protein-protein interactions with
developmentally regulated TFs? Our studies will shed light on previously unrecognized but critical long-range
interactions between a gene essential to neural development, SOX2, and a distant enhancer, which are mediated
by dynamic reorganization of 3D genome architecture. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms will allow us to
apply these biological concepts toward understanding and treating neurodevelopmental disorders."
10860997,"Although complement is historically not suspected to be implicated in the âpauci-immuneâ anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), recent clinical and experimental evidence has
shown it to play a key role in amplifying the initial inflammation and subsequent orchestration of innate and
adaptive autoimmune organ injury in AAV. Human AAV is a severe systemic autoimmune disease that affects
small vessels in multiple organs, but most prominently the kidney and the respiratory tract. If untreated, AAV is
fatal with an average survival of only 5 months. Current treatment regimens of AAV is limited to non-specific
immunosuppression which carries significant side effects and is not always efficacious in preventing relapse.
Therefore, more effective and less toxic therapeutic approaches are needed. A defining feature of AAV is the
presence in patientâs blood of ANCA with specificity to one of two neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens,
myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3. How complement contributes to ANCA-mediated organ injury such
as necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN) and lung hemorrhage is not yet fully understood. In this
project, we will use a robust mouse model of MPO ANCA disease that we have recently developed to dissect
the role of complement in NCGN and lung hemorrhage. Additionally, we will use this mouse model to test anti-
complement therapies to provide proof of concept for targeting specific complement proteins in the treatment of
NCGN and lung hemorrhage. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that pathogenesis of both
necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN) and lung hemorrhage in our mouse MPO ANCA disease
model requires the interplay between MPO-specific antibodies, alternative pathway of complement, and pre-
existing anti-MPO cellular immunity; Aim 2. To test the role and mechanism of action of complement proteins
and effectors, including properdin, C5aR and membrane attack complex (MAC), in the development of MPO
ANCA-induced NCGN and lung hemorrhage; Aim 3. To test and compare therapeutic efficacy of systemically
blocking properdin, C5, C5a or C5aR in preventing and treating MPO ANCA-induced NCGN and lung
hemorrhage. Our innovative mouse model of MPO ANCA disease fully recapitulates the human disease
phenotype, including development of NCGN and lung hemorrhage. By using this model, we expect to shed
new light on the role of complement in the pathogenesis of AAV, and validate the therapeutic potential of
blocking complement in the treatment of both NCGN and lung hemorrhage, two major disease manifestations
of human AAV."

The U.S. is facing a biomedical workforce crisis, exacerbated by insufficient diversity among individuals entering
the career path, starting with attrition from STEM majors in undergraduate training. The result, particularly for
diseases that disparately impact minority and underserved populations, is a lack of innovative solutions to
advance health outcomes. Chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease disproportionately affect
African Americans and represent a substantial medical and economic burden in the U.S., with annual
management costs estimated at $120 billion. Duke University is uniquely positioned to address this critical
problem by building a robust, diverse, and sustainable pipeline of future academic biomedical scientists. Our
recently established Office of Physician Scientist Development (OPSD) offers a sustainable structure for
mentorship, professional development, and research funding. By leveraging this institutional structure, we are
well positioned to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of a program that links resources
across the training spectrum to introduce undergraduate students to varied research career opportunities, while
preparing senior trainees transitioning to faculty positions to become strong independent investigators skilled in
mentoring students from diverse backgrounds. To address the biomedical workforce gap, we propose the
Paired Undergraduate Mentoring Program (PUMP) in Uronephrology, which will recruit diverse cohorts of
undergraduate students and expose them to research skills-building and mentored research experiences in
urology and nephrology. We will provide evidence-based professional development activities targeting both the
student participants and the trainees who will serve as the day-to-day research project mentors. Duke PUMP
will achieve our long-term goal, addressing barriers that limit the recruitment and retention of a diverse
uronephrology workforce, through intensive research experiences, structured triangular mentorship, and
sustained virtual engagement. The program focuses on 1) implementing a mentored summer research
enrichment program to develop interest in uronephrology research careers among a diverse cohort of rising
junior and senior undergraduates; 2) preparing next-generation uronephrology investigators to mentor a diverse
biomedical workforce by training graduate students and postdoctoral associates in mentorship and providing
them critical experience leading student research projects; and 3) preparing a diverse cohort of undergraduates
for post-graduate training and entry into uronephrology research careers through sustained engagement that
extends and enriches the summer research program experience. Successful implementation of the proposed
program will lead to a scalable model for development of a robust pipeline for a diverse biomedical research
workforce across disciplines."

designated Comprehensive Cancer Center whose mission is to prevent cancer in the community and transform
cancer patient care through scientific discovery. SCC accomplishes this mission through strong research
programs, shared resource support, education and training, pilot funding programs, and community outreach.
The translational research and scientific discovery facilitated by our seven multidisciplinary research programs
and 10 shared resources (11th requested in this application) is driven by the needs of patients in our 82-county
catchment area throughout Missouri and southern Illinois.
 The center applies the exceptional talent among our 230 members, from four schools and 23 departments,
to further understand the mechanisms of cancer pathways, speed the conduit from bench to bedside, and
implement prevention strategies that impact cancer screening, incidence, and mortality in our catchment area.
 SCCâs Breast Cancer Research, Hematopoietic Development and Malignancy, Mechanisms of Cancer
Biology, Oncologic Imaging, Prevention and Control, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, and Tumor Immunology
Research Programs promote novel, multidisciplinary cancer research and encourage intra, inter, and cross-
institution collaboration. Success is evidenced by SCCâs key metrics in the project period; data below are current
as of this application and each represents an all-time high for the center:
 ï· NCI funding â $41.0M direct, excluding CCSG dollars
 ï· Number of large collaborative grants â 72

10992993,"Abstract: Project 3: Somatic and germline gene therapy for male infertility
Infertility impacts 10-15% of couples in the United States and a male factor is implicated alone or in
combination with female factors in about 50% of cases. Infertility can be caused by hormonal, anatomical,
immunological or chromosomal deficiencies, diseases or medical treatments, but is frequently of unknown
origin (idiopathic). Idiopathic infertility is difficult to counsel and treatment options are limited. This program will
focus on patients with the most severe form of male infertility, nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Improved
knowledge about the genetic basis of NOA obtained in this program will aid in the counseling of infertile
couples; justify the development of diagnostic screens; and may lead to new patient-specific treatment options.
Project 3 will test the hypotheses that: 1) gene therapy/gene editing can be used to treat mouse models
of human NOA that exhibit somatic cell or germ cell dysfunction; 2) gene editing can be performed in
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from mouse models of NOA, which can be differentiated into
transplantable germ cells or sperm; and 3) gene editing can be performed in NOA patient-derived
iPSCs that can be differentiated to primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs). Project 3 will provide âgold
standardâ reproductive phenotyping in mouse models with NOA-associated variants that are discovered in
Project 1 and validated with in vitro assays in Project 2. Mouse models that replicate the patient NOA
phenotype will be used for development of gene therapies for male infertility. For Sertoli cell defects, Aim 1 will
extend our previous results by demonstrating that adeno-associated viruses carrying corrective genes can be
introduced to Sertoli cells in vivo and restore spermatogenesis with low toxicity and without integrating in the
genome or modifying the germline. For germ cell defects, Aim 1 will prove the principle that NOA-associated
variants in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can be corrected ex vivo with CRISPR/Cas9 or Prime editing and
transplanted to restore spermatogenesis and fertility in mouse models of NOA. Aim 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9 or
Prime editing to correct NOA-associated variants mouse iPSCs followed by differentiation to transplantable
PGCLCs or SSC-like cells (SSCLCs) to restore spermatogenesis and fertility. Aim 3 will use CRISPR/Cas9 or
Prime editing to correct validated NOA-associated variants in NOA patient-derived iPSCs followed by
differentiation to PGCLCs. This project will establish the safety and feasibility of gene therapies for male
infertility in mouse models and human cells to support future translation to the human clinic."

disputes arise, the Program Director (Dr. Orwig) will solicit input from the Scientific Advisory Committee."
10854023,"We are requesting funds for a ZetaViewÂ® x30 QUATT Multi-Fluorescence Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer with
colocalization of four lasers. This instrument is essential to biomedical research involving extracellular vesicles
and other bio-nanoparticles. It enables high-throughput measurements of the size, concentration, zeta potential,
and fluorescence of nanoparticles with the unique feature to assess colocalization of fluorescence signals on the
particles. This allows molecular characterization and phenotyping of various subpopulations of extracellular
vesicles, which is critical for the precision and accuracy of research. Currently, there is no similar instrument that
can perform the colocalization analysis at the UC San Diego and the surrounding areas. Providing local
researchers with access to this instrument will expand state-of-the-art technologies, enable new methodologies,
and facilitate synergistic discoveries in multiple fields.
The ZetaViewÂ® x30 QUATT will be placed in the Pathology Department Diagnostic Discovery Laboratory (PDDDL)
centrally located on the UC San Diego main campus, maximally facilitating access by users from the School of
Medicine, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Moores Cancer Center, and other Schools
and Departments at the UC San Diego and the surrounding areas. The web-based Facility Online Manager
(FOM) will be used for maintaining the services and resources offered, managing requests and reservations,
completing billing events, running reports and managing settings as needed. The Department of Pathology will
provide full administrative support. The institution will guarantee any shortfall for the service contract for at least
five years. An advisory committee has been formed to oversee the usage and management of the instrument.
Current Major Users are from several departments at the UC San Diego Health Sciences and nearby research
institutions, and represent a diversity of research fields including cancer, metabolic diseases (diabetes and
obesity), cardiac homeostasis, prenatal conditions and embryonic development, circulating RNA markers,
therapeutic development, and neuroscience. The 10 NIH-funded Major Users will have protected use of ~80%
of the instrument time whereas Minor Users and new users will be able to use the remaining instrument time.
This instrument will be a worthwhile and timely investment to improve the research environment overall and
enhance the quality of science performed at the UC San Diego. It will result in clear benefits for the research
community of extracellular vesicles and other bio-nanoparticles at the UC San Diego and surrounding research
institutions. This cutting-edge technology will not only directly benefit the faculty on campus but will also help
trainees and junior PIs to launch a successful career in related research areas."
10834007,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and asthma related morbidity costs the US medical
system tens of billions of dollars every year. Adherence to asthma medications (specifically inhaled
corticosteroids) has been shown to improve asthma related outcomes. Dr. Hoch will evaluate medication
usage patterns in depth over one year and develop an intervention with the input of adolescents and providers
to improve asthma adherence and control. Dr. Hochâs overarching hypothesis is that medication adherence
trajectory patterns will exist, and that the qualitative analysis will yield actionable ideas for a personalized
intervention, aimed at each childâs specific medication use pattern. The purpose of this application is to assist
Dr. Hoch in her transition into an independent, federally funded researcher. To this end, Dr. Hoch will use this
award to gain additional training in 1) research study methods, including recruitment and retention of subjects
and longitudinal data collection, 2) qualitative research methods and 3) the conduct of pragmatic trials in
behavior change. She is uniquely positioned within the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to
conduct this work. She will be supported both by the research infrastructure at the University of Colorado
School of Medicine and Childrenâs Hospital Colorado, as well as the Adult and Child Consortium for Health
Outcomes Research and Delivery Science (ACCORDS) center. Through these two institutions, she will be
guided by a group of internationally recognized researchers, including Dr. Stanley Szefler (Primary mentor and
asthma clinical trials expert), Dr. Allison Kempe (health services research mentor and pragmatic trials expert),
Dr. Jodi Holtrop (qualitative and mixed methods research expert) and Dr. Angela Bryan (health behavior
change expert). In order to accomplish Dr. Hochâs short term research goals, she proposes a project with the
following specific aims: 1) To better characterize adherence trajectory phenotypes, and to combine
adherence with short acting beta agonist (SABA) use patterns to create defined asthma treatment
phenotypes, 2) Use qualitative methods among adolescents and providers to evaluate reasons for
adherence/nonadherence and motivating factors for adherence, feelings about device monitoring and
suggested strategies for intervention among each of the highest risk treatment phenotypes using a
self-determination theory framework, 3) To develop and pilot test an intervention strategy using the
RE-AIM framework, with a focus on the highest priority treatment phenotypes (those with poor
adherence/poor control, and those with good adherence/poor control). This approach will yield lessons
that will be helpful for the future treatment of asthmatic children by personalizing treatment based on
medication use patterns, and train Dr. Hoch for her career as an independent researcher."
10834011,"ABSTRACT
Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are atherosclerotic plaques comprised of hard fibro-calcific material
that restrict luminal cross-section by 100% resulting in complete stoppage of blood flow in the affected artery for
at least three months. CTO symptoms include shortness of breath with chronic fatigue and chest pain. The
three primary CTO treatment regimens are medical therapy (MT), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and
percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). MT can reduce symptoms such as chest pain but fail to address the
underlying disease mechanisms. CABG does provide marked improvements in both patient morbidity and
mortality, however, this open-heart surgical intervention is highly invasive, traumatic, expensive and has a limited
lifetime. Because most CABG grafts utilize re-purposed veins, 50% become occluded within ten years after
bypass surgery. PCI procedures are provided over a 24-hour hospital stay, have one-two days of recovery time
and cost approximately one-fourth of CABG yet are currently administered to only 10% of CTO patients. In the
most common PCI procedure, subintimal crossing, a mechanical wire is advanced past the CTO inside the vessel
wall. Few interventionalists practice subintimal crossing because the procedure is difficult, risky and associated
with higher MACE, restenosis, acute MI and death. Although many intravascular devices have been introduced
to perform PCI true-lumen CTO crossing, all have failed in the coronary arteries. Failure of these previous
devices is due to at least one of three causes: 1) large-diameter catheters that are too rigid with poor steerability;
2) non-specific injury to the vessel wall resulting from CTO cutting; and 3) absence of a navigational guidance
system based on real-time imaging of the catheter tip relative to the arterial wall. An optoacoustic (OA) and
ultrasound (US) image-guided cold laser wire (CLW) is proposed that provides controlled cutting that will allow
any interventional cardiologist to provide patients safe and efficacious PCI true-lumen CTO crossing.
Development of the transvenous OA/US image-guided CLW will be accomplished by completing three specific
aims: Aim 1: Develop an Optoacoustic (OA)/Ultrasound (US) Transvenous Image-Guided Cold Laser
Wire; Aim 2: Test CLW True-Lumen PCI CTO Crossing in ex vivo Human CABG Hearts; Aim 3: Test CLW
True-Lumen PCI Crossing of Calcified CTOs in in vivo Animal Models. Successful completion of the
proposed research and development program will introduce a true-lumen PCI CTO crossing procedure that
when followed by stenting can establish a superior and new treatment paradigm for interventional cardiology
and can impact other surgical disciplines."
10834121,"ABSTRACT
Weight is a dyadic health issue in married and cohabitating couples. Partners tend to enter this critical
interpersonal relationship with a similar weight status and gain weight together over time. Despite this shared
risk, standard behavioral interventions focus on individuals, not couples, largely ignoring the inherently dyadic
nature of weight management. Early tests of couples weight loss programs lacked a clear conceptualization
guiding spouse/partner involvement and results were mixed. Yet there are promising signals â theoretical and
empirical â to guide how couplesâ relationships can be harnessed to improve weight loss outcomes. The
proposed study aims to build on this work and develop an efficacious couples-based mHealth approach to
weight loss using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. In the preparation phase, we
developed a conceptual model drawing on Transactive Goal Dynamics Theory, our own pilot work, and the
published literature that includes four dyadic intervention components: dyadic action planning, joint feedback
on goal progress, autonomy support training, and home environment modifications. In the proposed
optimization phase, we plan to conduct an innovative and efficient factorial experiment to identify which
combination of the four dyadic intervention components â when added to the core components of a standard
behavioral weight loss program (BWL; e.g., weekly lessons, self-monitoring, feedback) â results in the greatest
weight loss at 6 months (primary outcome). The 6-month intervention will be delivered to married and
cohabitating couples (N=368 dyads) via a native smartphone app to enhance the reach of the intervention,
minimize burden, and attract couples with more demographic and relationship diversity. Assessments will
occur at 0, 3, and 6 months. Weight loss and theoretical mediators as framed by Transactive Goal Dynamics
Theory (e.g., goal coordination) will be assessed along with hypothesized moderators (relationship and
demographic variables). The set of novel dyadic intervention components that maximizes weight loss will be
selected for inclusion in an optimized intervention package to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled
trial. The proposed study is the first test of a fully mHealth weight loss intervention for married and cohabitating
couples. Using the MOST design, it will advance both intervention and theory development by isolating active
dyadic intervention components and their mechanisms of action."

10834238,"Project Abstract:
Developmental gene regulation is a multidimensional problem where signals converge to generate patterns of
transcription at the proper location (spatial regulation) and correct time (temporal regulation). An equally
important feature of this regulatory process involves generating the correct amount of transcription during
development as many key regulatory genes function in dosage sensitive manners where too much or too little
expression can lead to developmental defects or disease. At present, we have only a primitive understanding
about how the transcriptional output of developmentally regulated genes is established. Experiments outlined in
this proposal aim to directly address this problem by employing an in vivo imaging system in C. elegans larva
where GFP molecules are directly tethered to nascent RNAs while they are being actively transcribed in the
nucleus. This new platform enables us to directly quantify and model the real-time expression dynamics that
ultimately dictate transcriptional output of individual genes throughout development. In Aim 1, we will use this
system to dissect the mechanisms by which two transcription factors, BLMP-1 and LIN-42, modulate features of
transcriptional bursting (including burst frequency, duration, and amplitude) to tune transcriptional levels of key
microRNAs (including lin-4 and let-7) that dictate sequential patterns of cell fate specification. We will then probe
the genomic and molecular mechanisms that BLMP-1 employs to prime future transcription by remodeling
chromatin accessibility near target gene loci. In the final Aim, we will characterize the physical and functional
interactions between LIN-42 and several conserved nuclear hormone receptors (NHR-23RORÎ³ and NHR-85Rev-
erbÎ²) that mediate temporal aspects of lin-4 and let-7 transcriptional activation. This avenue of research will reveal
the principles by which chromatin remodeling and its impact on modulating the transcriptional output of cyclically
expressed genes ensures the precision and robustness of cell fate specification during development."
10845555,"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a rare but potentially catastrophic obstetric emergency, and a leading cause
of severe maternal morbidity and preventable mortality in the U.S. Women of racial and ethnic minority groups
and living in underserved and remote areas are at greatest risk. Obstetric units must be prepared to manage
PPH, and obstetric (OB) attendings must maintain technical skills necessary to control PPH. To address this,
simulation is a promising approach. Obstetric simulation has shown effectiveness for team-based training, yet
there is compelling evidence for the use of simulation to improve technical skills. Further, prior studies and
simulation research from other surgical specialties demonstrate the high likelihood of successfully validating an
existing high-fidelity simulator and establishing its effectiveness in training OB attendings in technical skills
needed to manage PPH. However, a simulation program directed at OB attendings who work in varied hospital
settings across the country is subject to known obstacles for implementing and spreading simulation. We
propose a staged, multicenter study to establish simulation, using innovative approaches to mitigate barriers,
as an effective means for training OB attendings in three technical skills demonstrated as effective for
controlling PPH: Bakri balloon placement, B-Lynch suture placement, and O'Leary suture placement. OB
attendings will be assessed at baseline, mentored, and re-assessed. The primary outcomes will be change in
assessment scores (measured by validated and widely used OSATS) and change in percentage of OB
attendings who achieve competency (score of 60) from baseline to program completion. Our main hypotheses
are that the PPH technical skills simulation program will show a significant increase in skill level among OB
attendings and that the proposed innovations (affordable, remote, asynchronous) will address known barriers
to implementation. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Establish simulation as an effective means
for training OB attendings in technical skills for treating PPH by validating a high-fidelity simulator and
rigorously evaluating its effectiveness for a PPH technical skills simulation program with an in-person
mentoring program. Aim 2: Evaluate three innovations aimed at overcoming common barriers to simulation
training for OB attendings: Aim 2A: Validate a novel, affordable medium-fidelity simulator and evaluate its
effectiveness in a PPH technical skills program using in-person mentoring; Aim 2B: Evaluate a PPH technical
skills simulation program with remote synchronous mentoring; Aim 2C: Evaluate a PPH technical skills
simulation program with asynchronous mentoring. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of a PPH technical skills
simulation program in rural and community hospital settings, using the approach that sufficiently addresses the
barriers to implementation established in Aim 2 (affordable, remote, asynchronous) and is acceptable to OB
attendings. If successful, results will inform best practices in obstetrics, advance integration of simulation in
medical education and training standards, and enable dissemination in varied settings nationwide.

10845557,"Abstract
As the aging population is growing worldwide, identifying factors that may confer protection for Alzheimerâs
disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a global public health priority. Yet, several key social determinants of
ADRD, such as years of education, are completed earlier in the lifecourse and are thus unamenable to change
in older age. In parallel, growing evidence suggests that engaging in cognitively stimulating activities across
the lifecourse is associated with improved cognition and overall health. These data put forward a compelling
hypothesis that late life learning (LLL, non-formal educational activities outside formal credentialed learning)
may provide a window of opportunity, in older age, to mitigate ADRD risk by providing prospects for intellectual
stimulation and social engagement. Yet, very few studies have evaluated the benefits of LLL. The long-term
goal of our research is to pinpoint how we can intervene to prevent or delay ADRD, especially in low-resourced
settings where opportunities for engaged aging are limited such as in Lebanon, a low to middle income country
(LMIC). Lebanon has the largest proportion of older adults in the Arab region, and Lebanese older adults are
exposed to a host of lifecourse psychosocial adversities (e.g., war stressors, financial hardship) all of which
would be expected to increase ADRD risk. The current project moves towards our long-term goal by proposing
an innovative study in which we capitalize on an ongoing LLL program at the American University of Beirut,
The University for Seniors (UfS), to evaluate the influence of LLL on cognitive and overall health. The UfS has
been running for the last 11 years and its registry includes 1,300 participants, providing a well-established
platform from which to launch our study. Information on LLL will be abstracted from UfS records. Assessments
at the baseline and follow-up visits will include a life history questionnaire, a cognitive battery, among other
measures. This research application, which builds on existing collaborations between investigative teams in
the US and Lebanon, (Aim 1) is embedded within a detailed capacity building program aimed at enhancing
research capacity in several needed areas such as cognitive aging and ADRD, social and lifecourse
epidemiology, and quantitative methods, while also providing a networking and support base for researchers in
Lebanon and the region. For this project, we propose to (Aim 2) design a community-based study, the 3LC
(Late Life Learning, Cognition and Aging), by including 500 previously enrolled UfS participants, 200 newly
enrolled UfS participants, and 700 age- and sex-matched non-UfS-participating community residents; and
(Aim 3) apply rigorous analytical techniques to determine the strength of associations of LLL with cognition
and related outcomes, examine mediating mechanisms, and whether LLL may modify the influence of prior
psychosocial exposures on cognition and other health measures. Given the role of biological sex in dementia
risk, we will allow for distinct models for men and women. This application will build research and infrastructure
capacities to delineate opportunities for dementia prevention in Lebanon and other low-resourced settings."
10845559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
By 2030, 8.5 million Americans will be diagnosed with Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (ADRD); yet
because socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are underrepresented in ADRD research, the extent of
ADRD disparities by socioeconomic factors are poorly understood. Food insecurity, a condition of limited food
availability due to insufficient resources, is an understudied dimension of socioeconomic disadvantage and a
persistent health concern in the United States. Food insecurity has increased 128% among older adults since
2001, and has been associated with lower cognitive function in limited cross-sectional studies. The lack of
rigorous research investigating the effect of food insecurity on cognitive impairment and ADRD risk is a widely
acknowledged gap in the health disparities and ADRD literature, and represents a major missed opportunity to
better understand how a key social determinant of health can influence cognitive aging in later life. The overall
objective for this application is to understand the longitudinal and dynamic effects of food insecurity on
cognitive impairment and ADRD risk. The central hypothesis is that food insecurity increases the risk of
accelerated cognitive impairment and ADRD through poor diet quality, cardiometabolic health conditions,
psychological distress, and poor mental health, all of which has been demonstrated by prior research. Food
insecurity is both preventable and reversible; therefore, the rationale for this project is that establishing food
insecurity as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and ADRD risk will inform public health strategies to address
and prevent the dual burden of food insecurity and ADRD among older adults. To achieve the proposed aims,
this project will leverage data from two well-established cohort studies: 1) the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), the longest running nationally representative household panel survey, and 2) the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS), the leading nationally representative study on aging. Our specific aims are to: 1)
evaluate the dynamic effects of food insecurity in adulthood on ADRD risk; 2) identify the longitudinal effects of
food insecurity on trajectories of cognitive impairment; and 3) examine heterogeneity by sociodemographic
characteristics and diet quality on the effects of food insecurity on cognitive impairment and ADRD risk. By
leveraging data from two nationally representative studies, this project will be the first to provide a
complementary and comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects of food insecurity on cognitive
impairment and ADRD risk. These results will have significant clinical, public health, and policy implications by
identifying a modifiable risk factor to promote healthy cognitive aging and improve quality of life, particularly
among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations."
10845687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose a multi-tiered Maximizing Access to Research Careers at the University of California Santa Barbara (MARC-
UCSB) program that continues the successes of our current MARC program and increases retention and matriculation into
PhD and MD/PhD programs of all undergraduates (but especially underrepresented [UR] and disadvantaged students)
interested in pursuing careers in biomedical research. Nationwide, and at UC Santa Barbara, the greatest loss of UR
students from STEM fields occurs during the first two years. Consequently, the first phase of the MARC-UCSB program will
begin with a series of engagement points for MARCâeligible students that stimulate new points of entry into research and
scientific community, and integrate into existing infrastructure at UCSB. These engagement points will include: gateway
classroom outreach and early research experience; a mentoring network of peers, graduate students/postdoctoral
scholars, and faculty; and an introduction to research course called the âPractice of Science.â As they build community
and increase awareness of various research and career opportunities, students will be prepared to further develop as
researchers through the next phase of MARC-UCSB: the two-year MARC Scholars program, and accompanying MARC
Affiliate initiatives. Ten motivated students will be selected as MARC Scholars each year. In addition to acquiring extensive
research experience, they will grow their leadership skills through various professional opportunities such as presenting
at conferences, serving as mentors for lower division students, and developing a team-based community service project
in the service-learning course âScience for the Common Goodâ. Although 50 students will receive MARC scholarships, an
additional ~100 MARC-Affiliates will be impacted by our activities and will be well-prepared to apply for other synergistic
research internship programs and eventually to advanced degrees and careers in biomedical research. Underpinning this
Scholar retention and success will be a suite of faculty and graduate student/postdoc mentor training initiatives integrated
into developing infrastructure to impact the training landscape for sustained impact. Through the MARC-UCSB program
our long-term goals are to: a) enhance an institutional culture where students are immersed into a cohesive social,
academic, and research community that nurtures their success from an early stage; b) cultivate studentsâ confidence
and skills to enable them to matriculate into and succeed in top advanced degree programs; and c) grow and maintain
an institutional culture of mentoring excellence to create a more inclusive environment for our entire STEM campus
community. We propose a three-pronged approach to achieve this that will: 1) apply âproposed innovationsâ to meet our
objectives and address challenges in our current program, 2) expand âbest practice elementsâ that have been core

10832047,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application proposes to establish The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a Clinical Research
Site (CRS) for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Womenâs Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined
Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). The proposal represents a collaborative effort between investigators from
The UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, Center for AIDS Research, UNC Gillings School
of Global Public Health, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, and Cecil
G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research.
We propose to rapidly establish the UNC MACS/WIHS-CCS CRS, contribute meaningfully to the MACS/WIHS-
CCS (CCS) Unified Science Agenda, and undertake ambitious research that encompasses pulmonary,
cardiovascular, neurocognitive, and other HIV-related comorbidities; HIV pathogenesis/cure; social
epidemiology and health outcomes; behavioral research; and advanced epidemiologic methods.
We aim to: (1) Enroll 310 male and female participants who reflect the HIV epidemic in the southeastern US,
and re-consent current WIHS enrollees for participation in the CCS; (2) Lead critical components of the CCS
Unified Science Agenda; (3) Support all aspects of the CCS Science Agenda at the UNC CRS.
By contributing a representative population of men and women, innovative science, and a strong,
multidisciplinary cadre of investigators, UNC will enhance the efforts of the CCS, expand the range of
questions that can be addressed and, in collaboration with the entire group, improve the health of men and
women with or at high risk for HIV infection."
10831955,"Tobacco packaging influences tobacco use behavior. Branded package characteristics like color and artwork are
designed to command attention and to prompt consumers to have more favorable cognitions about a productâs
flavor and its potential harms; and more favorable cognitions are related to increased tobacco use intentions
and behavior. Standardizing tobacco packages is designed to diminish the favorable cognitions brought about
by branded packages. In its most comprehensive form, standardized packages have a uniform drab color with
the brand name and variant appearing in a uniform font size, type, and color in the same location on each
package; no colors or artwork are permitted. By removing elements of packaging that influence perceptions of
product flavor, safety, and tobacco product users, the hope is that the resulting packages will lose their
influence on consumers. A comprehensive approach to standardizing tobacco product packaging is not
possible in the United States because such an action would impinge on the tobacco industryâs First
Amendment-protected commercial free speech rights and devalue longstanding trademarks. A more narrowly
focused version of a standardized packaging regulation will be needed in order for it to be legally implemented
in the US; for example, standardizing the color of a portion of tobacco packages while permitting the display of
branded information on other parts of packages (i.e., partial color standardization). The proposed study will
experimentally evaluate the extent to which partially standardizing the color of tobacco packaging influences
tobacco use intentions among young adults who have varying levels of tobacco use experience. The retail
environment is an important context in which to study standardized packaging because hundreds of branded
tobacco product packages are prominently displayed on the tobacco power wall in this environment, and
exposure to package-dense tobacco power walls influences use intentions. To model use intentions as a
function of packaging standardization in a controlled retail setting, this research will utilize the RAND
StoreLab (RSL), a life-sized replica of a convenience store. A condition that displays tobacco packages that
have partial color standardization will be tested against two comparison conditions in a between-subjects
design. Young adults will be randomized to shop in the RSL in one of three conditions (conditions are
described by the percent of package surface area allocated to standardized color relative to trademark (Â®)
branding). The partial color standardization condition will display packages that are 50% color
standardized/50% Â® branded. The two comparison conditions are: (1) 100% standardized/0% Â® branded
(fully standardized) and 0% standardized/100% Â® branded (fully branded). Tobacco use intentions will be
the dependent variable. Mediators (e.g., attention; perceived flavor and harms) and moderators (i.e., level of
tobacco use) will also be tested. The results have the potential to provide first evidence of how partial color
standardization influences important tobacco use outcomes."
10831958,"Project Summary
Biologically available sulfur is essential for the synthesis of methionine (Met) and its derivative, S-adenosyl-L-
methionine (SAM). SAM is used for diverse metabolic purposes, serving primarily as a methyl donor for DNA
and protein methylation, as a 5â-deoxyadenosyl radical donor for radical-SAM reactions, as an aminopropyl donor
for polyamine synthesis and volved in the synthesis of acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing molecules in
bacteria. As a consequence of this metabolism, a dead-end, sulfur-containing byproduct, 5â-methylthioadenosine
(MTA) is formed. MTA is a product inhibitor of polyamine synthesis and MTA accumulation is thought to be toxic.
Since the assimilation of inorganic sulfur is energetically costly and many organisms encounter sulfur-poor
environments, maintaining or salvaging appropriate cellular organic sulfur pools is critical. Moreover, disruption
or reduced functioning of methionine salvage pathways (MSPs) has many health-related consequences
including influences on cancer cell growth and liver cirrhosis; intermediates of the pathway have also been shown
to influence apoptopic processes, while analogs of these intermediates are promising therapeutic agents. Newly
discovered MTA pathways from our laboratory, the DHAP-ethylene and methanethiol shunts, were recently
described, the genes of which appear to be widespread and selectively found among several pathogenic species.
Nonpathogenic species from these genera do not contain these genes. Thus, the hypothesis is that the shunt
genes/enzymes hold some special significance to metabolism of these pathogenic species. Moreover, the same
novel genes and enzymes were recently found to participate in radical SAM reactions to generate and metabolize
5â-deoxyadenosine (5dAdo), a structurally similar byproduct to MTA, which could potentially be recycled for
carbon salvage. The long-term goal will thus be to determine the role and physiological significance of the
DHAP/MTA/5dAdo pathways for sulfur and carbon salvage, and the potential of these pathways to influence the
successful metabolism of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), including uropathogenic (UPEC)
strains which contain these genes on a specific pathogenesis island. A specific aim (Aim 1) will be to determine
the precise role of these genes and encoded enzymes and resolve further metabolic steps in sulfur/carbon
salvage via whole cell feeding experiments using radio-labeled (14C) and 13C MTA and 5dAdo metabolites in wild
type and mutant strains. These in vivo studies will be supplemented by in vitro analyses with specific enzymes.
The second aim (Aim 2) will involve resolving how these genes are genetically regulated, an important facet of
sulfur/carbon salvage in these organisms. Resolution of the specific aims of this project have considerable health
relevance as ExPEC/UPEC strains cause major health problems and infect millions of people. It is conceivable
that the identification and resolution of a specific sulfur/carbon salvage pathway essential for
pathogenesis/fitness will open the way to design specific targets to inhibit infections caused by these organisms."
10832048,"Project Summary
 This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has
been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS
was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the
natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term
controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these
changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and
HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually
since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including
HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of
plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have
permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV
disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.
 The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort
(about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites
of the Womenâs Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort
Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel
application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that
single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV),
Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS),
Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical
Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS,
AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to
contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and
support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support
these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already
available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our
understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today."

data and blood samples we collect, the NC CRS actively contributes to core protocols and thematic sub-
studies to characterize the long-term, natural and treated history of HIV infection in a representative cohort of
people at substantial risk of becoming infected with the virus. We strictly adhere to good practice guidelines,
established policies and procedures, and robust quality assurance and quality control measures to ensure the
accuracy, reproducibility, and integrity of the clinical and laboratory data and blood samples. Scientific and
administrative management provides both the flexibility and means to conduct multidisciplinary research
projects as well as the resources to respond rapidly to recent scientific progress. For the past 35 years, we
have maintained a comprehensive portfolio of biomedical and social science research on HIV and its related
coinfections, comorbidities, and other complications. The diversity of the work makes possible a broad and
multidisciplinary view of these high priority topics for understanding the basic biology of HIV, immune
dysfunction and chronic inflammation, and genetic determinants. Scientific questions take full advantage of the
strengths of the cohort, namely, its duration and the continuity of data and blood samples that timespan
provides. Data and blood samples are available from people before and after infection, before and after
beginning medications, or before and after the development of comorbidities or their complications. Productive
relationships across the combined cohort, as well as other consortia and organizations, have coalesced around
specific issues to advance scientific knowledge, the health of people, and policy development. By capitalizing
on the expertise and unique resources of a multidisciplinary team of experts, we will build on our studies of
genome sequence, patterns of gene and protein expression, and metabolite concentrations and changes
(trans-omics dataset), along with information from people's medical records, to identify genes and pathways
that play a role in disease and determine how they interact with HIV. Hierarchal models that predict the
network behavior that gives rise to a phenotype will unravel the complexity of disease to provide novel and
important insights into biological processes for testing or generating a set of hypotheses about disease
mechanisms. During the next 7-year funding cycle, the NC CRS will continue support for the cohort and trans-
omics for HIV/AIDS research that complements and extends the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative that
connects genotype and phenotype and aligns with the NIH Big Data Initiative that supports innovative and
transformative approaches to advance understanding of human health and disease."
10832051,"Project Summary
 Tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and has
become a growing epidemic in developing countries in Africa. Among HIV+ individuals on antiretroviral
therapy, smoking causes more life-year loss than HIV infection. While both behavioral approaches and
pharmacotherapy are typically used together in high income countries, pharmacotherapy is largely unavailable
in sub-Saharan Africa due to cost. Instead, developing and evaluating behavioral smoking cessation
interventions, which could be realistically disseminated is a priority for addressing tobacco use among persons
with HIV in countries such as Botswana. Yet, unique aspects of HIV (e.g., high rate of depressive symptoms)
and delivery of care in such settings (e.g., decentralized, limited infrastructure) must be considered when
designing a behavioral approach in LMICs such as Botswana.
 Depressive symptoms are common in HIV populations and often comorbid with smoking, and addressing
depressive symptoms has been related to better smoking cessation rates. Behavioral activation therapy,
rooted in a behavioral economics framework, has been effective at treating depression and preliminary data in
the US, including in our group, suggests that it may effectively address smoking as well. Behavioral activation
aims to increase engagement in healthy rewarding activities (i.e., substitute reinforcers) by reducing patterns of
avoidance, withdrawal, and inactivity, and decrease activities that enhance the rewarding aspects of smoking
(i.e., complementary reinforcers). In a parallel way, problem solving approaches have been used with HIV
populations for behavior change regarding medication adherence, have also been successful at decreasing
depressive symptoms, and are ideally suited for helping smokers select and implement personalized
behavioral activation activities to quit smoking. We therefore created the novel Behavioral Activation/Problem
Solving for Smoking Cessation (BAPS-SC), culturally adapted it and pilot tested it in Botswana and found it to
be feasible and appealing and to have preliminary evidence of efficacy.
 We will conduct a 1:1 randomized trial comparing a BAPS-SC with standard counseling for smoking
cessation in 650 HIV+ smokers in Botswana. We will leverage HIV care sites and deliver the interventions by
phone to extend the reach of skilled practitioners. We will also assess whether depressive symptoms moderate
the effect of BAPS-SC and test our proposed mediating pathways for the interventions' effects
 This project will determine whether the novel intervention is superior to standard counseling to establish a
new paradigm for LMIC smoking cessation programs. We will also further our understanding of whether
depressive symptoms, reinforcers, and problem solving are modifiable mediators of smoking. Leveraging the
HIV care infrastructure will facilitate scale-up in sub-Saharan African settings where HIV is common and
smoking continues to emerge as a threat to HIV+ individuals' health and survival."

10831961,"As the HIV epidemic has matured, understanding the impact of HIV on overall health becomes more important
as HIV is managed as a chronic illness. This is particularly true in the Southeastern part of the United States,
where the epidemic is worsening relative to other parts of the country. Alabama and Mississippi are located
in the heart of the Deep South and have some of the highest rates of new HIV cases annually, especially
among minorities. Barriers to access to care are among the worst in the US, and the prevalence of obesity,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and health care disparities are most pronounced. Therefore, studying people
living with HIV in the Deep South will provide the opportunity to understand the current epidemic as it is
emerging today. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has a rich tradition of AIDS research, dating
back to the mid-1980s. As the epidemic has matured, UAB scientists have established expertise in many
areas, including psychosocial/behavioral, neurocognition, aging, cancer, pathogenesis, and health disparities.
UAB scientists have emerged as leaders in innovative cohort research that evaluates the long-term outcomes
via multisite cohort studies (e.g., CNICS, NA-ACCORD, ART-CC, and FRAM). By creating a linkage to the
University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as a subaward partner, we take full advantage of their years
of expertise in HIV clinical care, outreach, and cohort research. Collectively, we represent an ideal cohort for
the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), both in terms of scientific expertise and representation of
the current HIV epidemic in the US. The Specific Aims for our CCS site are:
1. To continue to provide scientific leadership and expertise within the CCS, focusing on
 psychosocial/behavioral, structural and genetic determinants of HIV and co-morbidity-related
 outcomes; neurocognition among aging PLWH; and immunopathogenesis of HIV disease.
2. To collect high-quality data and specimens from MACS/WIHS-CCS core and sub-study visits to
 contribute to the Unified Scientific Agenda (USA) and protocols; and collaborate with the overall
 team of MACS/WIHS-CCS investigators across sites.
3. To continue to achieve operational excellence by maintaining outstanding records for recruitment,
 retention, data quality and completeness and cost-effectiveness.
4. To ensure sharing of data/specimens with the data center, the NIH community and external
 investigators, and communication/engagement with local communities.
5. To develop, mentor and support junior and minority investigators in coordination with
 Developmental Award Advisory Committee (DARC).
6. To recruit and retain a cohort of 230 women and 270 men, HIV-positive and age-matched HIV-
 negative controls, who are strategically selected to enable the conduct of the USA."
10831962,"Project Summary/Abstract
Wearable devices are the primary method for objectively assessing physical activity (PA) type and energy ex-
penditure (EE) in free-living individuals. Current practice involves using only accelerometer-based devices, which
are generally better for predicting outcomes at the group level rather than the individual level. A ceiling effect
has been reached for accuracy and precision of accelerometer-derived predictions, and thus there is a critical
need for other approaches that can yield more accurate and precise methods to classify PA type and estimate
EE. A potential solution is to combine data from accelerometers with data from other sensors. Accelerometers
record linear acceleration, which captures a large amount of human movement. However, many daily activities
contain turning motions that are not captured by only using accelerometers. Gyroscopes record angular velocity,
and thus may be useful in combination with accelerometers for capturing a richer picture of human movement.
This can result in improved accuracy and precision when assessing PA type and EE. Using an ActiGraph GT9X
(worn on hip, wrists, or ankles), we have previously shown that combining accelerometer and gyroscope data
led to individual-level accuracy improvements of ~6%, compared to accelerometer only. Importantly, this in-
cluded up to 30% improvement for classifying sedentary activities. In addition, classification accuracy between
sedentary and non-sedentary behaviors when using only the accelerometer, ranged from 76.7-96.7% across
wear locations, whereas the gyroscope correctly classified 100% of the time at all wear locations. The overall
objective of this R01 application is to use gold standard measures of EE (doubly-labeled water, room calorimetry
and portable indirect calorimetry) and activity classification (video direct observation) to develop and refine ma-
chine learning algorithms using both accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data. The specific aims of the study
are: 1) Develop and validate gyroscope-inclusive machine learning models that classify PA type and estimate
EE in adults, using a 24-hr stay in a room indirect calorimetry (n=50) and 2-hr of semi-structured activities with
portable calorimetry (n=50); 2a) Assess free-living performance of the models, and 2b) Re-train and refine the
models using free-living data with ground truth from direct observation and portable indirect calorimetry (n = 100
participants during 12 hrs of free-living activity); and 3) Assess validity of EE models during a prolonged free-
living period using the doubly-labeled water technique (n=100). The central hypothesis is that the gyroscope will
provide meaningful and discriminative information on rotational movements that occur during human movement,
thereby complementing the accelerometer data. Combining accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data will im-
prove accuracy and precision for classifying PA type and estimating EE compared to using either sensor alone,
and will have a significant impact on the ability to assess free-living PA in adults."
10831965,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are progressive, debilitating, and
terminal illnesses1 that cause significant suffering to individuals and families. Dementia is the sixth
leading cause of death in the United States; 1 in 3 older adults die with a dementia syndrome.
Distressing symptoms -- shortness of breath, pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and feeding problems,
are common, and worsen over the disease trajectory. Transitions between care settings increase as
AD/ADRD progresses, often resulting in poorly coordinated and fragmented care. Family caregivers
provide extraordinary emotional and practical support through all stages of illness, resulting in high
rates of caregiver strain, depression, physical illness, and loss of employment. Palliative care seeks to
improve quality of life and reduce suffering by addressing patient and caregiver distress, managing
symptoms, clarifying goals of care and aligning goals with preferences. While in many conditions,
palliative care has been associated with a wide array of beneficial outcomes including improved quality
of life, increased patient and caregiver satisfaction, and cost saving, these outcomes have not been seen
consistently in ADRD. In fact, there is a dearth of evidence to guide clinicians in providing high-quality
palliative care in ADRD. The overall objective of this application is to improve the evidence base for
dementia palliative care interventions by identifying and upskilling dementia and palliative care
investigators in the conduct of rigorous clinical trials focused on improving quality of life for persons
living with dementia and their care partners. Using our experience of training researchers in palliative
care clinical trials and leveraging our strong network of dementia palliative care investigators, we will
seek to a) Identify promising diverse investigators in palliative care, geriatrics and clinical neurosciences
and provide the opportunity for further training in the design, funding, conduct, monitoring/oversight,
ethical performance, and reporting of ADRD palliative care clinical trials; b) Enhance the pipeline of
rigorous, well designed ADRD-PC clinical trials by equipping investigators with a strong foundation in the
conduct of ADRD-PC clinical trials based on the NIH Stage Model, including intervention development,
community-engaged research and implementation science; c) Promote ongoing professional career
development by supporting participants before, during an after a week-long in-person training program;
and d) Create a network for collaboration and sharing of educational resources for clinical trialists in
dementia palliative care."

TB research career by providing specific mentorship and training, and (2) Lowering the barriers to entry for New
Investigators and non-TB researchers to bring innovative ideas and technologies to TB research through a set
of innovative pilot awards. By providing access to expertise in planning TB experiments and the relevant, trained
manpower to execute the experiments, we will have removed probably the biggest barrier for NIs to engage in

investigators with the acquisition and processing of rodent and human tissue, and specialized cell lines that are
broadly required for diabetes research. For the past 20 years, the services provided by the BDC-based facility
has provided high quality tissues to BDC investigators. DRC funding would allow us to expand access to all DRC
investigators studying the pathogenesis of Type1 (T1D) and Type 2 (T2D) diabetes. In addition, there is
increased need for primary human tissue. We have established a centralized facility to facilitate access to human
tissues from external sources (University of Alberta, Edmonton; see letter of support), and internally through the
UC-AMC Pathology Biorepository/Tissue Distribution Facility (see letter of support). Furthermore, administrative
support for the preparation of IRB approval, human exempt protocols and material transfer agreements for these
tissues will be available upon request by DRC members. The core will also provide diabetes-related
histopathology services, training in basic and specialized sample preparation and processing procedures, and
will offer DRC members access to resources such as validated commonly used reagents and equipment. Finally,
the TPP Core will provide a cell banking service to distribute validated diabetes-related cell lines to DRC
investigators. These services will facilitate individual studies, in addition to promoting collaborations between
investigators. Major services to be provided by the TPP core include 1) tissue preparation, including rodent and
human islet isolation and processing; 2) procurement of primary human tissues from local, national and
international sources; 3) sample processing for histological analysis; 4) validated and optimized reagents, such
as antibodies and probes; and 5) validated cell line distribution. These services have been selected based on a
campus-wide survey that solicited information from UC AMC diabetes investigators about their research needs.

support provides an opportunity to leverage these resources for diabetes researchers. The mission of this core
is to provide access and enable effective usage of these sophisticated systems so that diabetes researchers can
incorporate innovative approaches, to both maximize research productivity and catalyze new research directions.
We will achieve these goals through the following aims: AIM 1: Enable access to state-of-the-art high-resolution
multi-color confocal microscopy for diabetes researchers; AIM 2: Provide expert assistance to incorporate new
advanced microscopy approaches to enhance diabetes research; AIM 3: Provide access to, and expert
assistance for, state-of-the-art mass cytometry and multiplexed ion beam imaging for diabetes-related
applications; AIM 4: Train diabetes researchers in incorporating new imaging and cytometry technologies in their
research."
10833187,"PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Pilot and Feasibility Program (P&F) is a key component of the UC Denver DRC that will allow DRC
leadership to: 1) recruit new talent into diabetes research, 2) attract established investigators from other
disciplines into diabetes-related scientific pursuits, and 3) support innovative/high-risk diabetes research
projects. Our priority is the support of young, newly independent investigators at the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus (UC AMC), and its affiliated institutions, who are embarking on diabetes research
careers, but have yet to attain substantial funding. In addition, the UC Denver DRC P&F Program is an important
means of promoting interdisciplinary diabetes research by fostering collaboration between DRC members and
improving university-wide interactions between DRC members and other UC Denver NIH Centers or Deanâs
Initiatives. The P&F program will also serve as a mechanism to increase the diversity of the UC AMC diabetes
research community and its research portfolio. We will achieve these goals through the following specific aims:
AIM 1: To establish a transparent and streamlined process for grant solicitation, scientific review, funding, project
guidance/management, and progress assessment.
AIM 2: To enhance the UC AMC diabetes research community and diversify its innovative research portfolio by
providing funding to: a) early career diabetes investigators who lack substantial research funding; b) established
investigators from other fields that intend to apply their knowledge and expertise to investigation of diabetes-
related topic(s); c) established diabetes investigators who propose innovative, high-risk projects that deviate
from their current funded research programs, and that would be unlikely to be funded through the usual granting
agencies without compelling preliminary data; d) develop novel models (i.e. organoids) to examine unique
physiological targets such as sex as a biological variable and immunomodulation.
AIM 3: To provide career guidance and a scientific home for P&F funded investigators.
AIM 4: To formally evaluate the impact of the UC Denver DRC P&F Program on individual grant recipients, as
well as on the UC AMC diabetes research community as a whole."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to help early career psychiatrist investigators (i.e., mentees) develop and maintain
a research career path via our multi-component Research Colloquium for Junior Psychiatrist Investigators program (the
Research Colloquium). The Research Colloquium aims to strengthen and diversify the psychiatrist-scientist workforce. It
offers team-based and one-on-one mentorship and research career development to mentees in two tracks that differentiate
participantsâ current research experience (i.e., beginner and intermediate) across six core research areas including basic
neuroscience and translational research, clinical psychobiology, health services/health disparities research, treatment and
intervention research, alcohol, pain and other substance use research, and military and veteran mental health research. Each
year, the Research Colloquium gives 40-50 early career psychiatrist investigators, a year-round, immersive research
experience. This application seeks 5 years of support to facilitate the in-person components of the Research Colloquium
specifically for the Alcohol, Pain, and Other Substance Use Research Area for the 2023 â 2028 cohorts. Each year, the
funds from this award will partially support a cohort of 15 early research career psychiatrists with interest in Alcohol, Pain,
and Other Substance Use research to attend the in-person components of the Research Colloquium, which include: 1) the
initial 2-day Research Colloquium held contiguous to the APA Annual Meeting; 2) the 6-month follow-up Booster Session
held contiguous to the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) Annual Meeting; and 3) the 12-month
follow-up Booster Session held contiguous to the Society of Biological Psychiatry (SOBP) Annual Meeting.
The specific aims are to: 1) identify current and future senior psychiatry residents, research fellows, and junior psychiatrists
who are promising candidates for successful research careers in the mental health space; 2) assess the strengths, weakness,
areas for improvement, and specific goals to be accomplished by mentees during their participation in the Research
Colloquium; 3) provide a 2-day, intensive mentored training session that will allow mentees to present their current or
proposed research protocols in small group and poster sessions and receive feedback for enhancements and guidance for
future career progression; 4) provide a 1-day, intensive mentored 6-month follow-up booster session where mentees will
present updates on their research and progress towards their goals for the program in small group sessions, discuss any
barriers to their success, and receive guidance to facilitate progress; 5) provide a 1-day, intensive mentored 12-month follow-
up booster session where mentees will present their final research projects in small group sessions and receive guidance on
transition to the next step in their career development; 6) provide mentees with mentoring (i.e., from senior researchers and
statistical mentors) and peer feedback; 7) provide information and resources that will enable mentees to find and obtain
funding and launch successful research careers, as measured by the receipt of grant support or research fellowships,
publication in peer-reviewed journals, or academic appointments at research institutions (i.e., private or public academia or
industry settings); and 8) provide innovative opportunities for ongoing post-Colloquium mentoring and career guidance
through ad hoc webinars, blog posts, and discussion boards housed on the Research Colloquium Online Community."
10833533,"Abstract
It is an extraordinary accomplishment that most developing neuronal networks
achieve an appropriate level of excitability, during a dynamic period of embryonic
development when there are several challenges to a network's excitability. Errors
in such a complicated process can lead to alterations in the excitability of neonatal
spinal circuit, which can be observed behaviorally as myoclonus, hypertonia, recurrent
tremor, and spasticity. Understanding the rules and mechanisms that underlie the
maturation of network excitability are therefore essential. An exciting new field has
emerged, which provides critical insights to understanding the rules that networks
follow in order to achieve appropriate levels of activity. Many studies have now
shown that perturbations to network activity trigger changes in synaptic strength
which are thought to homeostatically recover and maintain activity levels within an
appropriate range. Compensatory changes in intrinsic cellular excitability (cell's
responsiveness to synaptic input) also likely contribute to the homeostatic process,
although these changes have received far less attention than synaptic
compensations. By taking advantage of the accessibility of the chick embryo we
have been able to follow an actual homeostatic recovery of activity (embryonic
movements). Because of this, we have been able to identify a critical and
previously unrecognized homeostatic mechanism where changes in resting
membrane potential mediate the initial homeostatic recovery of perturbed activity
levels in the living embryonic spinal cord. We will identify the mechanism
underlying this compensation in the first aim of the grant. Based on a recent study
and our proteomic analysis from our previous grant period, we are proposing to
examine an unexpected critical relationship between mitochondrial function and
homeostatic plasticity in aim 2. Finally in aim 3 we will carry out this work in the
genetically advantageous mouse model system. Our study will identify the
mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity in the living system and will begin to elucidate the
calcium triggers for these forms of plasticity. The work can instruct pharmacological
interventions that ameliorate hyperexcitability associated with neurodevelopmental
disorders, and help us better understand the function of homeostatic plasticity."
10833555,"Project Summary
Joint damage and synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are influenced by genetic and
environmental factors. Individual patients and joints have shown variation of response to the same treatment.
To reveal the underlying mechanisms, genome-wide characterization of the RA pathogenesis that require
small amount of input materials and at relatively low cost is necessary. Currently, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq
satisfy these requirements to map transcriptome and open chromatin in the RA samples, which can provide
complementary delineation of the pathogenic mechanisms. We propose here to perform RNA-seq and ATAC-
seq in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) for both RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We will develop and
improve a new computational pipeline that integrates these data to evaluate each transcription factor's
importance in individual patients. By comparing FLS RA and OA samples, we will identify disease-specific
regulators in Specific Aim 1. By comparing individual RA patients, we will identify patient-specific regulators in
Specific Aim 2. We will perform biologic experiments to validate the top predicted regulators in Specific Aim 3.
Once completed, this study will open a new avenue of understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying
RA and dictating the variable responses to treatment in individual patients, which paves the way towards
precise and personalized therapy."
10833506,"We have little current understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that link brain
development and the proper regulation of sleep throughout life. Understanding these mechanisms is a
longstanding challenge in sleep biology with great clinical relevance. Neurodevelopmental disorders including
autism are prevalent and closely associated with sleep disturbances, but the underlying genetic and
neuroanatomical mechanisms remain obscure. Our studies use the powerful Drosophila model system to
characterize a conserved genetic pathway whose activity is required during neuronal development for the
sleep regulation in adulthood. This pathway is composed of Insomniac (Inc), the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin
ligase, and their targets. Reduced activity of this pathway in the developing brain severely curtails the duration
and consolidation of sleep in adulthood. Our findings suggest that this pathway has two distinct developmental
functions that influence the structure and function of the mushroom body, a sleep regulatory center in the fly
brain. In Aim 1 we will determine whether inc acts in neuroblasts to control the proliferation and number of
sleep-regulatory neurons. We will also validate Inc substrates, including a target that may link Inc to
asymmetric neuroblast division. In Aim 2, we will determine whether inc acts post-mitotically to regulate the
structure and anatomy of sleep-regulatory neurons. In Aim 3, we will determine how inc affects the function of
sleep-regulatory circuits. Because all of the genes under study are conserved and expressed in the
mammalian brain, our studies may provide insight into mechanisms underlying normal sleep, sleep
dysfunction, and various neurological disorders."
10834232,"The overarching goal of this research program is to discover new catalytic methods for the synthesis of
biologically active targets, both natural and unnatural. We have previously reported the synthesis of phenolic
lipid natural products and efforts toward two families of polycyclic terpenes, as well as a general process for
the synthesis of the cobalt complexes used in the photocatalytic investigations described in Project 2. The
targets described in this proposal include molecules that will serve as mechanistic probes to study
neurodegeneration and viral diseases, as well as leads that may provide new therapeutic opportunities. We are
investigating methods to target specific structural motifs with established biological activity, such as amino-adamantanes
and limonoid natural products, as well as catalytic methods designed to apply to a broad
spectrum of chemical targets. The enabling technology behind these methods is photocatalysis, which
harnesses light energy to drive complex catalytic processes. Photocatalysis continues to provide new
mechanisms and transformations that are difficult or impossible to access otherwise. Understanding the
governing principles of these processes allows us to apply that insight to the discovery of new, broadly useful
synthesis methods.
Substituted adamantanes appear in a wide variety of molecules with important function including
clinically approved drugs for Alzheimerâs dementia and viral diseases, however efficient synthesis remains a
challenge. In Project 1, new amino-adamantane derivatives will be accessed through a new aminoalkylation
reaction and new catalytic strategies that enable unique selectivity that is complementary to existing
approaches. The unique strategies described here include a detailed study of the selectivity of new and
established H-atom transfer methods, providing guidelines necessary for selecting the proper HAT catalyst for
different substrate classes. In Project 2, a novel polar/radical crossover manifold inspired by the biochemistry
of vitamin B12 will be developed for the efficient use of inexpensive and readily available alcohols for bioactive
molecule construction. These methods will be applied to the synthesis of promising natural product targets
such as the neuroprotective limonoids. The investigation of the neuroprotective activity of limonoids is of
central importance, therefore alternative pathways will be explored to access to these molecules and
derivatives for mechanism of action studies. Overall, the concepts described here will provide general
platforms for the rapid construction of pharmacophores and bioactive natural product derivatives that can be
immediately deployed by biomedical researchers."
10834753,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Throughout modern history, tuberculosis (TB) has killed more people than any other infectious
disease to date (estimated > 2 billion people over the past 350 years) and TB continues to kill
4,000 patients each day. In 2019 alone, the World Health Organization estimated that ~1.4 million
people died of TB and 8-9 million patients were newly diagnosed. The only approved vaccine, M.
bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has had many successes but its protection is variable and
BCG-vaccinated TB patients still transmit M.tb. Across the globe, an equilibrium of transmission
and disease exists such that one new case of pulmonary TB arises from each existing TB patient;
thus, efforts must be reinvigorated to drive TB rates lower. New strategies are needed to combat
TB including discovery and advancement of new vaccines to control the pathogen Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M.tb). With that end goal in mind, we answer the call for RFA AI-21-007: Innovation
for Tuberculosis Vaccine Discovery (ITVD), forming partnerships between PIs with vaccine
development expertise, and expertise using animal models of TB. We propose three novel means
to advance TB vaccines. In the R61 phase, we develop and identify the best performing new
vaccine candidates. Specifically, we (i) combine the ID93 protein antigen with new adjuvants
designed to maximize mucosal immune responses and durability; (ii) capitalize on novel RNA
platform to create vaccines expressing ID93 and related M.tb antigens to induce rapid and durable
immunity; (iii) optimize heterologous protein/RNA prime-boost candidates for strong and durable
mucosal, humoral, and cellular anti-M.tb immunity, and select the final candidates to move into
challenge studies. To maximize early-stage development, rigor, and reproducibility, we perform
immunogenicity studies in a selected panel of Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred strains,
representing known differential susceptibility to M.tb infection. In the R33 phase, i.e., M.tb
challenge studies, we exploit the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population for its outstanding
representation of genotypic and phenotypic diversity equivalent to humans, a major hurdle in TB
vaccine development efforts to date. We will also test the final vaccine candidates in guinea pigs,
the classic preclinical model for TB vaccines to ensure success in 2 animal models."
10834756,"Project Summary
The oral cavity represents a unique healing environment that is relatively unexplored. Regeneration within the
oral mucosa occurs rapidly, with wounds closing at four times the rate of the skin, and the inflammatory reaction
to wounding is relatively suppressed. Chronic wounds within the oral cavity compromise the ability of patients to
obtain nutrition and are prone to debilitating infections, thus constituting an important oral health problem.
Understanding how the oral mucosa is able to achieve such regeneration, and therefore how wound healing is
disrupted in disease environments, would be a significant achievement for the field of craniofacial research. The
specific cellular mechanisms used by the oral mucosa to facilitate its distinct regenerative phenotype remain
elusive and are addressed in this proposal.
 Studies comparing dermal and oral wounds have shown that oral wound healing displays a short
inflammatory phase followed by a rapid transition into wound closure via epithelial cell proliferation, migration
and differentiation. Chronic inflammation in the oral cavity is the cause of many pathologies, such as periodontitis,
oral mucositis and osteonecrosis of the jaw, but how inflammation leads to epithelial atrophy or lingering open
wounds in the oral mucosa is unknown. Given that the oral epithelial progenitor cell (OEPC) population mediates
re-epithelialization, this proposal will test the hypothesis that inflammation acts as an important coordinator of
wound closure and re-epithelialization via direct regulation of the OEPC population. Wound healing will be
assessed in animals under three inflammatory states: normal, low and high. The effects of attenuated and
exacerbated inflammation on regeneration will be established by scoring for time to wound closure, epithelial
layer integrity and proliferation and apoptosis within the entire tissue (Aim 1). Next, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of inflammatory regulation on the OEPC population will be determined using single cell RNA
sequencing under the three conditions, and direct regulation of the epithelium by the immune system tested
using an in vitro co-culture system (Aim 2). Data from these aims will determine how inflammation regulates
wound closure and elucidate key mechanisms through which inflammation influences re-epithelialization, which
will yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of wound closure within the oral mucosa.
 These research goals will be conducted in conjunction with a comprehensive training plan designed to
develop the applicantâs career as a dentist-scientist. The training includes structured mentorship from two highly
qualified clinician-scientist sponsors, and scientific and technical training through individual and group meetings,
seminars, journal clubs, classes and departmental events. Research and training will take place at the University
of California, San Francisco, which offers both an outstanding research environment and an excellent dental
school for clinical training."
10834757,"ABSTRACT
 N6-methylation (m6A) is one of the most abundant endogenous modifications in eukaryotic mRNA.
Accumulating evidence suggests that dynamic m6A RNA methylation has significant roles in multiple biological
processes, and tumorigenesis by introducing another layer of post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one of the most common types of acute leukemia, is a
hematological malignant disease. In AML patients, gene mutations and genomic rearrangements often occur in
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and turn HSPCs into leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which play a
central role in the development and maintenance of AML. To date, there is not an effective targeted therapy
available for AML. The roles of m6A modification and its associated machinery in the pathogenesis of AML and
the maintenance of LSCs/LICs remain elusive. As a nuclear m6A RNA reader that has been identified,
YTHDC1 recognizes nuclear m6A-sites and acts as a critical mediator of nuclear m6A. YTHDC1 has unique
roles in the regulation of nuclear RNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation, nuclear export and decay.
However, its role and function in AML has not been reported yet. Our preliminary studies showed that YTHDC1
is overexpressed in human AML. We found that YTHDC1 is required for MLL-AF9-induced leukemogenesis
and the survival of LSC/LIC. Thus, we hypothesize that YTHDC1 upregulation leads to post-transcriptional
deregulation of a set of genes that are required for the maintenance of LSCs, thereby contributing to the
pathogenesis of AML. In this proposal, we will determine 1) the role of YTHDC1 as a nuclear RNA reader in
the initiation, development and maintenance of AML by regulating LSC self-renewal and survival; and 2) the
underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate the role of YTHDC1 in the pathogenesis of AML. We will
employ both genetic murine models as well as patient-derived xeno-transplantation (PDX) models to
investigate the role of YTHDC1 in the pathogenesis of AML in vivo, and will combine transcriptome and
epitranscriptome analysis to identify the key downstream targets and associated downstream pathways that
mediate the role of YTHDC1 in leukemogenesis. In addition, we will elucidate molecular mechanisms by which
YTHDC1 epigenetically controls the expression of its direct targets in AML cells. Our studies will define the
unrecognized role of YTHDC1 in the AML development/maintenance and regulation of LSC/LIC self-renewal,
quiescence and survival, and clarify the underlying mechanisms of YTHDC1. Thus, success of our project will
provide new insights into the complicated mechanisms underlying epitranscriptomic regulation of
leukemogenesis."

For research on sensitive topics like HIV, it is critical to understand the capacity of adolescents to provide
informed consent, as parental consent has been identified as the greatest barrier to adolescent participation in
biomedical research. In many countries including low-and middle-income countries, where 90% of adolescents
live, adolescents can consent to sexual and reproductive healthcare but require parent/guardian permission to
participate in research before age 18 â leading to adolescent underrepresentation and systematic exclusion from
biomedical and behavioral studies. Among adults, research has identified effective biomedical HIV prevention
tools such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that have successfully decreased HIV transmission. Youth in
East and Southern Africa have the highest HIV incidence in the world, yet less than 1% of biomedical HIV
prevention trials include minor adolescents. Thus, developmentally tailored HIV prevention and care research
for adolescents and young adults is urgently needed.
 Improving understanding of Capacity to consent to sensitive biomedical Research among adolescents in Rakai
Uganda (ICARE) will leverage The Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) to test adolescent capacity to
consent to biomedical research, identify differences in developmental decision-making, characterize eligibility
for, beliefs about and interest in oral and injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and construct a digital
toolkit for including adolescents in biomedical research. The RCCS presents a unique opportunity to compare
cognitive capacity to consent for biomedical research among adolescents with and without prior research
experience at three developmental stages â early (10-14 years), middle (15-17 years), and late (18-19 years) â
with the cognitive capacity of their parents/guardians. Limited data are available on adolescentsâ actual capacity
to consent, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and low resource, high HIV prevalence settings.
Findings will contribute to addressing a major barrier to research participation through an examination of the
capacity of adolescents to comprehend risks, benefits, and the other elements of informed consent and,
therefore, to provide informed consent to biomedical research. ICARE has the potential to offer guidance for
ethical boards seeking to harmonize adolescent treatment and prevention with research procedures, thus
addressing disparities in research by age and facilitating studies that prioritize adolescents to end the HIV
epidemic."

The overarching theme of the Johns Hopkins Autoimmunity Center of Excellence (ACE) is that distinct immune
cell subsets are the major drivers of immunopathogenesis in different autoimmune diseases, and that targeted
therapies at a critical juncture of disease trajectory will modify or halt the propagation of disease. The primary
clinical project led by Pavan Bhargava, MBBS, MD, proposes to selectively target effector-memory T cells, class-
switched memory B cells, and inflammatory microglia in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) by
blocking the potassium channel Kv1.3 using dalazatide. Utilizing, cutting-edge immunological, imaging and
biomarker assessments, this trial seeks to identify pathogenic immune cells driving disease in SPMS while
testing a novel treatment strategy that could be applied to a range of other autoimmune disorders. The alternate
clinical project led by Julie Paik, MD, MHS, proposes to target B-cells using a novel, third generation anti-CD 20
agent, ublituximab, early in the course of active, autoantibody positive myositis (excluding inclusion body
myositis). The current challenge in the therapeutic landscape of myositis is that B-cell depleting agents are
considered third line despite the wealth of literature supporting their efficacy. Therefore, this proposed Phase 2
randomized, double-blind trial of ublituximab in myositis can potentially lead to a paradigm shift in the utilization
of B-cell depleting agents as first-add on therapy to background immunosuppression. And lastly, the collaborative
project led by Elias Sotrichos, MD, seeks to perform deep phenotyping of single immune cells in the peripheral
blood and cerebrospinal fluid in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein antibody disease (MOGAD) to identify subsets that are involved in disease pathogenesis. All three
projects highlight the extraordinary cross-discipline synergy that exists at Johns Hopkins through the
collaborative resources of the Johns Hopkins Institutional Precision Medicine initiative. The establishment of the
Johns Hopkins ACE will further leverage the Multiple Sclerosis and Myositis Precision Medicine Centers of
Excellence to achieve the following aims: 1) Enable the implementation and execution of innovative, investigator
initiated therapeutic trials, (2) Discover key cellular drivers of autoimmunity through modification of immune
function with investigational therapeutic agents, and (3) Increase interdisciplinary collaborations within Johns
Hopkins and the broader ACE network to advance the understanding and treatment of autoimmune diseases.
These aims will be achieved through the resources of the Administrative coordination group which will be a
conduit to integrate all scientific and administrative oversight of the Hopkins ACE. Additionally, the funds
management core will provide support to studies throughout the ACE network, while the Biobanking core can
handle a variety of samples and will be an indispensable resource to support the clinical research projects that
are ongoing in the ACE network."

The MapHabit System (MHS) is our neuroscience-based interactive care management platform that utilizes a
patented visual mapping system supported by smart devices to improve cognition and reinforce routine habits
in individuals living with AD/ADRD. The MHS approach relies on the discovery that certain regions of the brain
that underlie habit and procedural learning are spared during the course of AD/ADRD, and these regions can
help maintain activities of daily living (ADLs). Unmet needs addressed by the technical innovation for this
FastTrack: Caregiving is commonly acknowledged as one of the most stressful, under-recognized, under-paid,
and under-supported jobs. The new MHS+Caregiver Training Program (CTP) will offer key innovative feature
to enhance the caregiversâ own quality of life, which, in turn, will result in reduced turnover and reduced
caregiver-related cost burdens in all types of care settings, hospital systems, and for payers and providers.
This will make MHS a unique mHealth product in the AD/ADRD community and will increase its market
competitiveness, attract in-home users and be especially appealing to memory care facilities that are
concerned with achieving measurable improvements in managing caregiver burden. The CTP will feature
innovative components designed to directly support caregivers in their role, including self-paced learning
starting with understanding the caregiverâs knowledge and skill level; interactive live coaching sessions; easy
to use caregiver-centric dashboards to share information, and social networking capabilities to promote social
support and community building.
Phase I, Aim 1, will build out the CTP into the MHS platform. Phase I, Aim 2, will assess usability,
acceptability and feasibility of the CTP using iterative usability studies involving 15 caregiver/patient dyads to
determine optimal user experience, and modify the build accordingly. Phase II, Aim 1, weâll build out enhanced
user support modules to improve the CTP experience, including visual map games to increase caregiver self-
awareness, motivation, and learning, social networks to provide social support connection to other caregivers,
and a caregiver-centric dashboard for caregivers to track their own stress and well-being, as well as key
patient performance measures. Phase II, Aim 2, will assess usability, acceptability and feasibility of the
enhanced CTP features. Phase II, Aim 3, weâll conduct a RCT (n=50 caregiver/patient dyads) to determine if
adding the CTP to the MHS leads to enhanced caregiver and patient outcomes compared to the MHS alone.
We hypothesize that enhancing caregiver knowledge and social and emotional support will improve caregiver
quality of life, which will, in turn, improve the patientâs overall quality of care and functional status. The primary
data driven outcome will be caregiver quality of life. Patient care, determined by the MHS and standardized
cognitive assessments as well as self-reported caregiver and patient satisfaction will be assessed as well. This
integrative, easy to use caregiver-centric training program will be unique to the caregiver market."

Groundbreaking work within the NIH BRAIN Initiative has revealed many new types of neurons and their
genetic signatures. The dividends from this research will include sophisticated tools allowing selective genetic
access to these cell-types, such as for imaging, optogenetic or tracing studies. To complement these powerful
genetic tools, it will be equally important to have new imaging techniques that can reveal how multiple neuron-
types work together in the live brain to support information-processing and construct different brain states.
 To address this challenge, Stanford University and The John B. Pierce Laboratory at Yale University
will create optical techniques for imaging the concurrent voltage dynamics of up to 4 separate neuron-types in
behaving animals. First, we will combine machine learning methods and an automated, high-throughput protein
screening platform to engineer 4 different categories of genetically encoded fluorescent optical indicators of
neuronal transmembrane voltage. We will then innovate several types of optical instruments tailored to work in
conjunction with the new voltage indicators. These instruments will enable unprecedented studies of voltage
rhythms and spiking dynamics in 2â4 genetically identified neuron-types in superficial and deep brain areas of
awake behaving animals. One instrument will allow us to track the concurrent, population voltage oscillations of
2 neuron-types in freely behaving rodents. Another instrument, an optical mesoscope, will enable imaging
studies of voltage waves and oscillations across the entire neocortical surface of behaving mice. A third device
will be a high-speed miniature microscope for tracking neural dynamics at single cell-, single spike-resolution in
freely behaving mice. Lastly, we will develop the capability to image with millisecond-scale precision the
simultaneous spiking dynamics of 4 targeted neuron-types in either cortical or deep brain areas. Five external
beta-tester labs will evaluate all these innovations in live mice and flies and provide critical user-feedback.
 If our work succeeds, it will be a âgame-changerâ for studies of brain dynamics, yielding vital knowledge
about how different neuron-types synergize their dynamics to shape animal behavior and the brainâs global
states in health and disease. To facilitate this outcome, we plan a 5-fold strategy for resource sharing: (i) All
voltage-indicator constructs, viral vectors, transgenic flies, software and screening data will be deposited at
public repositories for open distribution; (ii) All instrument designs will be published in extensive detail to
facilitate replication; (iii) Our novel imaging devices will be integrated into an existing NIH-supported, publicly
accessible facility for brain-imaging in rodents; (iv) In project years 2â4, we will conduct 4 training workshops
for 40 visiting scientists per year (120 in total) to learn the new technologies firsthand. These visitors will also
provide extensive user-feedback; (v) We will license our imaging instruments for commercial distribution.
 Overall, we expect our project will lead to major conceptual advances in brain science and multiple new
technologies that will reshape the practice of mammalian brain imaging."

largely controlled by the corticospinal tract (CST). We argue that promoting plasticity within the CST may support
the recovery of upper limb function after cSCI. Repetitive exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (rAIH) combined
with motor training is a safe, minimally invasive, treatment that elicits neuroplasticity resulting in improved
recovery after cSCI, but its overall effects remain limited. Our main goals are to: 1) enhance rAIH/training-induced
aftereffects on forelimb function and increase our understanding of the neuronal substrates in an adult rat model
of chronic contusive cSCI, and 2) use this knowledge to guide the development of more effective rAIH/training
approaches to improve upper limb function in humans with chronic contusive cSCI.
In Specific Aim 1, using an adult rat model of chronic contusive cSCI, we will investigate the effects of rAIH
frequency and dose on rAIH/training-mediated functional recovery of the impaired forelimb. Also, we will combine
rAIH/training with NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity through D-cycloserine treatment and study the effects on
recovery of forelimb function. Immunocytochemistry with imaging techniques will be used to assess structural
neuronal plasticity in the CST after rAIH/training. In Specific Aim 2, in people with chronic incomplete cSCI,
guided by the findings in Specific Aim 1, we will study the effects of rAIH frequency and concurrent D-cycloserine
treatment on rAIH/training-mediated upper limb function recovery. We will comprehensively analyze the effects
of rAIH on the strength of electrophysiological and functional aftereffects in the upper limb.
The proposed research will provide new knowledge on rAIH/training-mediated functional and anatomical
aftereffects (Specific Aim 1), which will be used to develop effective rAIH/training protocols for people with
contusive, functionally incomplete, cSCI (Specific Aim 2). The data from our experiments may lead to clinically
applicable approaches that improve arm and hand function recovery after chronic contusive cSCI, which would
positively impact the quality of life of our Veterans with cSCI. The relevance of this proposal is emphasized by
the limited efficacy of current strategies to improve upper limb function after cSCI."

One in three people with diabetes mellitus is at risk of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), with over 10% amputated.
The current global pandemic has driven a significant change in healthcare delivery and disrupted DFU care and
limb preservation, leaving many patients with limited or no clinical care.
Clinicians must adopt a paradigm shift
from the hospital and clinic care to community-based point-of-care (POC) - to best triage chronic DFU cases that
are high-risk lesions requiring clinical care or hospitalization. There is an unmet clinical need for smart health
assessment tools for POC treatment of patients with DFUs onsite, where no wound care expertise is available.
Smartphone technologies for wound care are limited to 2D/3D wound image analysis for size/depth. They are
insufficient as stand-alone tools to assess and triage high-risk DFU lesions without wound expertise onsite.
Hence, additional clinical assessments (e.g., the extent of oxygen supply to wound) are required during POC of
DFUs onsite.
Oxygenation measurements provide a sub-clinical physiological assessment that complements
clinical visual assessment. We recently developed a smartphone-based NIR imaging approach or SmartPhone
Oxygenation Tool (SPOT) to obtain visual tissue oxygenation measurements in wounds. Systematic
assessment of the skin tone and wound characteristics is critical during physiological imaging and has not been
investigated to date. Hence, our objective is to develop and validate a smartphone-based imaging approach
(or Smart Scanner) capable of visual and physiological analysis of DFUs across the spectrum of skin tones and
wound features via automated machine learning (ML) algorithms. Developing a smartphone-based optical device
via integration of existing NIR imaging technology, but towards smart health platform for physiological
assessment of DFUs, while accounting for varying skin colors and wound types using ML algorithms is
innovative. The specific aims are: (i) Account for the effect of skin tones on oxygenation measurements by
applying light propagation models and machine learning algorithms and validate via phantom and in-vivo studies.
(ii) Analyze tissue curvatures and account for depth variations in-vivo oxygenation maps via studies on control
subjects (~15 cases). (iii) Differentiate wound tissue types and validate physiological imaging using the SPOT
device via DFU studies (~25 cases). The expected outcomes are: (i) Develop our Smart Scanner (SPOT
device + app) to obtain accurate tissue oxygenation maps across different skin tones and wound tissue types;
(ii) Validate our SPOT device to differentiate DFUs with high-risk lesions that require clinical care, from low-risk
cases. Incidence of DFUs and related amputation rates differ by race/ethnicity, and are higher in African
Americans, Hispanic and Native Americans compared to Caucasians. In the long term, SPOT can be used as
a smart health tool to pre-screen or triage DFUs with high-risk lesions to clinical care and thus minimize potential
amputations in any racial/ethnic group (with varying skin tones)."
10847567,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
Through our pioneering work with the anti-glioma oncolytic virus Delta-24-RGD, it is now recognized that
oncolytic viruses are potent anti-cancer immunotherapeutic agents, acting not only by direct oncolysis but also
by inducing an anti-glioma immune response. This paradigm-shifting concept implies that oncolytic viruses,
including Delta-24-RGD, alter the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) and may therefore induce synergistic
effects when combined with other immunotherapy strategies. However, there is a significant gap in knowledge
regarding the ideal agent to use in combination with Delta-24-RGD. In this content, we have recently engineered
natural killer (NK) cells (called eCB-NK-TF-/GC- cells) for glioblastoma (GBM) which are resistant to tumor- and
corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression by inactivation of TGFÎ²-Receptor 2 and the glucocorticoid receptor
2, respectively. In our current SPORE, we initiated a dose escalation/window-of-opportunity clinical trial of eCB-
NK-TF-/GC- cells as a single agent in patients with recurrent GBM. In parallel pilot experiments exploring the
interaction of Delta-24-RGD and NK cells, we have shown that treatment with Delta-24-RGD increased the
recruitment, anti-cancer activity, survival, and memory of endogenous NK cells. Importantly, treatment with
Delta-24-RGD followed by eCB-NK-TF-/GC- extended the survival of glioma-bearing mice compared with
controls. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that Delta-24-RGD treatment will actively contribute
to enhancing the activity and memory of off-the-shelf eCB-NK-TF-/GC- cells resulting in strong anti-tumor activity
without undue toxicity in patients with GBM. To test this hypothesis we will: Leverage the post-treatment
biological specimens obtained from the window-of-opportunity arm of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial to
evaluate the fate of eCB-NK-TF-/GC- cells as a single agent and to determine the associated immune changes
in the TME of patients with recurrent GBM (Aim 1); Explore the combination of Delta-24-RGD and eCB-NK-TF-
/GC- cells in a variety of preclinical animal models to evaluate the impact on the TME in GBM (Aim 2); And
execute a phase I clinical trial with a window-of-opportunity arm of intratumorally administered Delta-24-RGD in
combination with eCB-NK-TF-/GC- cells in patients with recurrent GBM (Aim 3). The samples obtained from the
combination trial (Aim 3) will be compared with the samples from the single agent trial (Aim1) to assess the ability
of Delta-24-RGD to alter the TME and enhance the activity of eCB-NK-TF-/GC- cells in patients. Our SPORE
team has a consistent track record of translating therapies from the laboratory to the clinical setting, and this
project is the next critical step in achieving our long-term goal of making viro-immunotherapy a standard
treatment for malignant glioma."
10847568,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 2
 Immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockades, have not benefited patients with glioblastoma
(GBM), largely due to abundant immune-suppressive GBM-associated microglia/macrophages (GAMs), which
can comprise up to ~30% of the tumor mass. A major gap in our current knowledge is how to reverse
therapeutically the immunosuppressive features of GAMs. Although heterogeneous, GAMs almost ubiquitously
exhibit pro-tumorigenic states with defective phagocytosis. We reasoned that restoration of phagocytosis in
GAMs would promote anti-tumor activity by enhancing their ability to digest and process glioma cells and present
tumor specific antigens to activate the adaptive immune system. By analyzing human and mouse GBM samples
by single cell RNA sequencing, we found that suppression of Quaking (QKI) is a universal feature in human and
mouse GAMs and contributes to the impairment of the phagocytic activity of GAMs. QKI forms a complex with
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î² (PPARÎ²) and retinoid X receptor Î± (RXRÎ±), called QPR, which
regulates unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) synthesis, influencing membrane fluidity and driving phagocytosis.
Conditional knockout of Qki or PPARÎ² in GAMs greatly impairs the phagocytosis of GAMs and enhances
gliomagenesis by decreasing immune cell infiltration. Conversely, activating QPR through small molecule
agonists of PPARÎ² (KD3010) or RXRÎ± (bexarotene) greatly enhances the phagocytic ability of GAMs and
suppresses GBM growth in syngeneic glioma mouse models, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these
agents. Based on the above evidence, we hypothesize that activating QPR with small molecular agonists will
restore GAM phagocytosis, normalize the defective immune microenvironment of GBM and consequently halt
GBM progression. To test this hypothesis, we will: Decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of
QPR activators on phagocytic activity in GAMs in vitro (Aim 1); Investigate the molecular and cellular effects of
KD3010/bexarotene on GAMs in pre-clinical in vivo animal models (Aim 2); And perform a window-of-opportunity
clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic potential of bexarotene in patients with recurrent GBM (Aim 3). In all,
these studies will define QPR agonists as a new class of immunotherapeutics that can provide new hope for
curing GBM by overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that drives this dreaded disease.

Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, is responsible for significant morbidity
and mortality in the United States. Of the different subtypes of MB, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is the most common
and patients with Shh-Î± (mostly adolescents) who have TP53 mutations have nearly 100% mortality, and those
with Shh-Î´ (mostly adults) experience significant morbidity from standard treatment with craniospinal radiation,
and have extremely poor outcomes with limited treatment options once the tumor recurs. How best to treat these
Shh MBs remains a significant problem in brain tumor therapeutics. In this context, we recently identified a unique
somatic point mutation in a non-coding small nuclear RNA (snRNA) called U1 in 50% of Shh medulloblastomas.
This mutation, U1 (r.3A>G), is found in 97% of Shh-Î´ tumors and >65% of Shh-Î± tumors with TP53 mutations.
The U1 snRNA is an essential component of the spliceosome, and tumors with this mutation exhibit a unique
form of post-transcriptional hypermutation which results in the expression of thousands of novel epitopes that
are not expressed in normal human tissue. Because hypermutant cancers are often responsive to immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy, we hypothesize that U1 mutant Shh MBs will be similarly responsive to ICIs.
In addition, because novel tumor-specific antigenic epitopes arise from aberrant splicing in U1-mutant Shh MBs,
we hypothesize that the novel intron-derived epitopes in U1 mutants constitute excellent targets for the
development of selective immunotherapies, particularly CAR T cells. To test these hypotheses we will: conduct
a phase II clinical trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with Shh MB and correlate the clinical outcomes
with U1 mutation status (Aim 1); identify novel tumor antigenic epitopes, characterize the tumor
microenvironment and delineate the molecular biology of cells along the differentiation hierarchy in U1-mutant
Shh MBs through state-of-the-art transcriptomic profiling and analysis (Aim 2); and prioritize U1-mutation driven
tumor antigenic epitopes and use these epitopes to design, develop and test CAR T cells in preclinical models
of Shh MB (Aim 3). These aims will be achieved through collaborations across multiple institutions to facilitate
accrual to the proposed clinical trial and for the development of targeted U1 Shh MB-specific CAR T cells."
10847792,"ABSTRACT
Failure to properly repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or damaged DNA replication forks leads
to chromosome aberrations and neoplastic transformation of cells. Homology-directed repair (HDR)
mediated by the recombinase RAD51 in conjunction with the tumor suppressors BRCA1-BARD1 and
BRCA2 is a high fidelity mechanism of DSB and replication fork repair. In addition, these HDR factors
also protect stressed DNA replication forks from nucleolytic attrition. The commitment step for HDR
is 5â strand resection of a DNA end to create a 3â-tailed ssDNA region for the assembly of HDR
complexes that contain RAD51 as a central component. The three Research Projects of this Program
will investigate the biochemical regulation of the DNA end resection and RAD51-ssDNA assembly
steps of HDR and how these processes are negatively regulated by protein factors, such as DNYLL1
and the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complex, of the 53BP1 regulatory axis. The Chromosomal and
Replication Analysis (CRA) Core provides valuable shared resourses to help translate biochemical
data into outcomes of DSB repair, replication fork repair and restart, chromosomal stability, mitotic
success, and cellular survival. CRA will create specific mutations in HDR and 53BP1 axis proteins
using CRISPR/Cas9 and generate cell models using RNA interference when gene mutations are
incompatible with viability. The CRA will subject these modified cell lines to DNA fiber analysis, end
resection analysis, cell cycle phase analysis, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy of foci,
isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND), replication fork fusion/degradation analysis,
cytogenetic and mitotic chromosomal structural analysis and correlate these with cell survival in
replication stress. Our in-depth cellular analyses will permit the three Research Projects to construct
epistatic pathways and, importantly, will help identify new targets for synthetic lethality in inherited
disorders of HDR that lead to breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers. Such targets are of great
clinical relevance as the vast majority of these cancer patients eventually develop resistance to
currently available synthetic lethal therapy, such as the PARP1 inhibitors. As such, the CRA will bind
the Research Projects together by integrating biochemical data with replication fork, chromosomal,
and cellular outcomes.

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia in older adults, but there is no
cure for this debilitating condition. We hypothesize that aging and AD-related pathologies cause maladaptive
changes within hippocampal formation circuits that serve as connectome hubs for large numbers of critical brain
regions, ultimately leading to age- and AD-related cognitive deficits. In response to RFA-AG-22-008, we have
assembled a strong multi-investigator team across multiple institutions with complementary expertise in neural
circuit mapping, next-generation AD mouse model development, single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics
analysis, and mouse brain common coordinate framework / atlas development. We will leverage the exceptional
resources offered by the UCI Center for Neural Circuit Mapping, the MODEL-AD Consortium and the Allen
Institute for Brain Science. We propose to perform large-scale, cell-type-specific mapping of hippocampal
formation circuits to generate cellular resolution connectome data that combines molecular and anatomical
annotations. To capture a more accurate composite of human AD features, we will use three complementary
AD mouse models including two next-generation AD mouse models. These include 1) the 5xFAD mouse model
with familial mutations, 2) the hAÃ-KI mouse that expresses human wild-type AÎ² sequence from the endogenous
mouse App locus to model late-onset AD features, and 3) Trem2 R47H knock-in mice that model the increased
risk of the R47H coding variant for late onset AD. We will comprehensively map and characterize hippocampal
formation brain circuits, including CA1, the subiculum (SUB) and the entorhinal cortex (EC) that show earliest
neurodegeneration across AD mouse models and in human patients. These sub-circuits serve as hubs for neural
processing from many other cortical and sub-cortical brain regions. We will use genetically modified
transsynaptic neurotropic viruses developed by our team to map brain-wide anterograde and retrograde neural
networks. The brain connectomes generated from viral tracing experiments will be enhanced with spatially
resolved, single-cell transcriptomics-based molecular annotation using MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust
fluorescence in situ hybridization). We will identify molecular candidates that confer vulnerability versus disease
resistance as we superimpose spatial transcriptomic data on AD-modulated circuit connectomes. The entire
data set will be annotated using the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework to facilitate resource
and data sharing. Our work will improve our understanding of brain circuits susceptible to aging and AD towards
developing better early diagnostic tools and new treatment strategies for AD."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal form of interstitial lung disease (ILD), affecting
100,000 per year in the US, with a 3-year survival rate of 50% and a large socio-economic healthcare burden.
Early, accurate diagnosis is essential to determine treatment, which differs drastically between IPF and other
ILDs. Initiating treatment as early as possible is a key strategy to prevent irreversible loss of lung function and
maximize patient outcomes. Definitive IPF diagnosis can be made by CT in ~50% of cases when classic
imaging features are present, which must include peripheral honeycombing. However, CT is unable to resolve
features < 2 mm, including microscopic honeycombing present in ~50% of cases, which includes nearly all
cases of early IPF. When CT fails to diagnose IPF, surgical lung biopsy (SLBX) is required to obtain tissue for
microscopy, but has high morbidity and mortality risks. Evaluating therapeutic response is also critical for
deciding which patients should stay on expensive, poorly-tolerated therapy and which should not. IPF
microscopic features are indicators of disease progression, but cannot be assessed over time with either CT or
SLBX. Our objective is to meet this critical need by clinically validating endobronchial optical
coherence tomography (EB-OCT) for early microscopic IPF diagnosis and therapy response
assessment. EB-OCT provides rapid 3D imaging with microscopic resolutions (< 10 Î¼m) well beyond CT
capabilities. We have developed thin OCT catheters that can bronchoscopically access the subpleural lung,
assessing 100x more lung volume at more distinct sites than SLBX without the associated risks. We have
shown in a pilot study of 18 ILD patients that in vivo EB-OCT can detect microscopic honeycombing not visible
with CT. Our data suggest that EB-OCT can differentiate IPF from non-IPF ILDs with near perfect accuracy as
compared with SLBX. In order to validate this conclusively, we will conduct the proposed studies: In Aim 1, we
will use our ex vivo EB-OCT and matched histology database to determine accuracy for IPF diagnosis ex vivo
in an independent multi-reader, blinded assessment and validate automated methods to quantify individual IPF
microscopic features known to indicate disease progression against histology. In Aim 2, we will translate these
findings to a multi-centered prospective clinical study. We will determine the accuracy of EB-OCT for IPF
diagnosis in patients with non-diagnostic CT undergoing diagnostic SLBX in an independent multi-reader,
blinded assessment. We will then repeat EB-OCT in IPF patients, 6 months later, at the same locations and
quantify EB-OCT features at each time point using the automated methods validated in Aim 1. We will
compare EB-OCT changes amongst patients on and off therapy and against changes in lung function testing
and survival. The accomplishment of these studies will eliminate a major obstacle in IPF by validating EB-OCT
as a minimally-invasive, low-risk method for early, accurate diagnosis and assessment of therapy response.
This will permit earlier therapy initiation, earlier assessment of efficacy, and increase survival for IPF patients."
10847335,"Targeting Inflammasome with stable endocannabinoid ligand AMG315: CRISPR/Cas9 and
nanotechnology study in the context of HIV and cannabinoid.
PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT):
Although the use of cannabis for medical purposes has shown great promise for the treatment of certain
medical conditions, cannabinoid abuse exerts significant impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral
functions and these effects are exacerbated in patients with HIV infection. Studies suggest that even after
HIV-1 suppressing combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-1 Tat is being produced in the brain from
proviral DNA and implicated as a causative agent for latent infection and development of inflammasome
mediated neuroinflammation in HIV infected patients. CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology has been
shown by us and others to be effective for excising the HIV genome integrated into the host genome. Our
preliminary studies using a
recently discovered and potent metabolically stable endocannabinoid analog
AMG315 demonstrate that this synthetic cannabinoid exerts anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing
NLRP3 inflammasome and HIV infection. Accordingly, we hypothesize that elimination of the HIV-1 Tat gene
in CNS cells using Tat specific CRISPR/Cas9 and suppression of inflammasome with CB1-specific stable
endocannabinoid analog AMG315 can eliminate active HIV infection/induce permanent latency and prevent
neurodegeneration, respectively.
However, AMG-315 and CRISPR are impenetrable to the brain in sufficient
quantities necessary to prevent HIV-infection, inflammasome activation, and subsequent neurodegeneration.
To overcome this, we will use our patented magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENP) technology and
liposomes to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 and AMG315, and for on-demand controlled-release. For the sustained
release and to protect CRISPR from lysosomal degradation, MENP-bound CRISPR and AMG315 will be
encapsulated in liposomes. Accordingly, in Specific Aim # 1, we will develop, characterize, and evaluate the
delivery of Tat-specific CRISPR Cas9/gRNA and AMG315 across the in vitro BBB using MENP-based drug
delivery approach to excise HIV-1 Tat gene, and attenuate cannabinoid and Tat-induced inflammasome,
respectively. In Specific Aim # 2, we will study the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of MENP nanoformulation
containing CRISPR, and AMG315 using doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice (iTat) as an
HIV/neuroAIDS and cannabinoid administration animal model. In Specific Aim-3, we will validate the effects
of these nanoformulations on neuronal plasticity and neurocognitive functions in vivo. Successful completion
of this grant will have a translational significance in preventing HIV-1 Tat and cannabinoid-mediated
neurodegeneration in HIV infected cannabinoid-abusing patients. This multidisciplinary new break-through
concept targeting inflammasome in the brain with stable endocannabinoid ligand AMG315 and Tat specific
CRISPR/Cas9 using MENP-based technology is in response to RFA-DA-20-026 and will be useful for the
suppression of HIV replication, NLRP3 inflammasome activity and to treat cannabinoid-induced neuronal
impairments in HIV infected cannabinoid abusers."

(NEURON-Aging)
ABSTRACT: The goal of this NIA R25 proposal âNetworking and Expanding Undergraduate Research On the
Neurobiology of Aging to Advance Diversity (NEURON-Aging)â is to expand the pool of researchers interested
in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical aspects of brain aging and Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias
(ADRDs) through undergraduate research activities that enhance diversity. Minority health disparities for
cognitive outcomes in advanced age are well documented, with older adults from minority groups being more
likely to self-report impairments and to develop dementia. Healthcare and research professions that are critical
for addressing clinical needs in diverse elderly populations, however, have inadequate representation from
diverse and disadvantaged groups. This is a significant barrier for mitigating these health inequities. Thus, there
is an urgent and unmet need to support educational pipeline programs that increase the diversity of the research
and clinical workforce focused on understanding and treating brain aging and ADRD to reduce minority health
disparities. The current proposal will expand the pool of undergraduate trainees interested in pursuing research
and clinical careers related to understanding and treating brain aging and ADRD with 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will
increase the participation of University of Florida (UF) underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate students
conducting mentored research on the neurobiology of aging and ADRDs in NIH-funded laboratories and expand
their research network to facilitate an interest in brain aging. Aim 2 will increase the representation of URM
undergraduates from outside UF and non-Research I Institutions conducting mentored research in NIH-funded
laboratories examining brain aging and ADRDs. Finally, using institutional matching funds provided by Centers
and Institutes at the University of Florida, Aim 3 will increase the numbers of diverse students proceeding on to
top graduate programs focused on brain aging by proving 12-24 months of postbaccalaureate training as a bridge
to PhD training. The proposed education and research training program will have the following measurable
objectives: (1) NEURON-Aging students will develop an appreciation for brain aging and related diseases
through year-round mentorship and networking; (2) NEURON-Aging students will have an increased sense of
scientific efficacy through mentored, hands-on research training; 3) NEURON-Aging students will have an
enhanced understanding of experimental design and data interpretation in brain aging-research areas, (4)
NEURON-Aging students will develop professional communication skills by presenting their research locally and
nationally; (5) NEURON-Aging students will develop awareness of graduate and professional school program
application processes; and (6) The majority (>50%) of NEURON-Aging students will matriculate into graduate or
clinical training programs related to aging within two years of receiving their Bachelor's degree."

90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, 90% of all people
receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression) and an end to the AIDS epidemic by 2030. To achieve
these goals, and to eventually end the HIV epidemic, simple, safe, effective and potent ARV-regimens will be
needed as well as simple and inexpensive, point-of-care devices for HIV diagnosis and viral load monitoring.
The planned global rollout of a 1st-line dolutegravir based ART with a generic, single table regimen of tenofovir-
lamivudine-dolutegravir (TLD) with an estimated cost of $75 (USD)/year has the potential the dramatically alter
the course of the AIDS epidemic in resource limited settings (RLS). In West/Central Africa, home to ~5.0 million
people living with HIV (PLHIV), ~280,000 new infections and ~160,000 deaths per year, and lagging 90-90-90
targets (64%, 51%, 39%) the goal of an AIDS free generation is complicated by the fact that both HIV-1 and HIV-
2 are co-circulating in West Africa, each with itsâ own challenges for diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment (ART).
Currently, 1st-line ART for HIV-2 (and dual HIV-1/HIV-2 infection) is tenofovir-lamivudine-lopinavir/ritonavir due
to HIV-2âs intrinsic resistance to NNRTI. Rollout of TLD in West Africa has the potential to dramatically alter the
treatment landscape by providing a single potent 1st-line ART regimen for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. The Senegal
National AIDS Program (Initiative Senegalaise dâAcces aux ARV (ISAARV)) is planning for the transition to TLD
for 1st line ART for HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 dual infections in early 2020. The UW-Senegal Research
Collaboration has a 3 decades history of performing cutting edge translational and clinical studies of HIV-2
treatment with our Senegalese partners. For the Renewal of our current R01 entitled âImproving Diagnosis,
Treatment & Detection of Drug Resistance in HIV-2 Infectionâ we propose to build on our previous work with
the following Specific Aims: AIM 1: To determine the clinical and immuno-virologic outcomes (HIV virologic
failure(VF)/viral suppression (VS) rates, HIV drug resistance (DR), CD4 counts, switch rates to 2nd-line
ART, adverse events, OIs & co-morbidities, LTFU and death), in ARV-naÃ¯ve and ARV-experienced HIV-2
and HIV-1/HIV-2 infected patients, newly initiated on dolutegravir-based ART (TLD) in the ISAARV
program. AIM 2: Determination of genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility, resistance mechanisms and
pathways, of HIV-2 to novel and pipeline antiretroviral agents. AIM 3: 3A: Validation & field evaluation of
the POC m-PIMA HIV-1/2 Viral Load (VL) & Detect Assays in Senegal. 3B: An implementation trial of m-
PIMA clinical uptake & utilization for patient care decisions regarding HIV-2 & HIV-1/HIV-2 VF & ART
management in the ISAARV."

The Structural Biology and Biophysics (SBB) Core will provide Program Project Investigators with high-qual-
ity atomic resolution mapping and quantification of salient protein ligand binding sites using NMR and other
biophysical techniques. The vast majority of proteins involved in DNA homology-directed repair and its regulatory
axis are comprised of significant stretches of intrinsically disordered (ID) residues that serve as ligand interac-
tions sites. With class-leading expertise in the structural and biophysical characterization of ID proteins, the SBB
Core will combine state-of-the-art NMR to map, at atomic resolution, the protein ligand interfaces and nucleic
acid binding sites, thus identifying critical amino acid residues mediating these interactions to guide the devel-
opment of separation of function mutants. By their nature, intrinsically disordered protein ligand complexes are
highly dynamic, transiently populated, and weakly associated, features that preclude high-resolution structure
determination by cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography. The approaches, techniques, and overall expertise available
within the SBB Core circumvent these technical limitations to assist Program Project investigators in defining
crucial ligand interaction interfaces at atomic resolution. Our biophysical and structural biology wherewithal will
furnish insights for understanding the structure-function relationship of salient protein-protein and protein-nucleic
acid interactions. The SBB Core will work closely with the PBE Core in providing superior services to achieve
the optimization of high-quality protein preparations and their characterization. Additionally, with available bio-
physical approaches, namely, isothermal calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale ther-
mophoresis (MST), size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS),
and mass photometry (MP), the SBB Core is well positioned to determine the kinetics and thermodynamics of

After a stroke, walking ability can be compromised, which can lead to reduced quality of life and decreased ability to
perform activities of daily living. Post-stroke walking recovery is mediated by nervous system reorganization (e.g.,
neuroplasticity), however our understanding of these processes related to improvements in walking function are
limited due to the neurophysiological complexity of walking itself. Additionally, current practices of assessing stroke-
impacted neuroplasticity are heavily focused on the motor system. Of keen interest is the integration of sensory and
motor systems (e.g., sensorimotor integration-SMI), which are necessary for initiating, sustaining, and coordinating
walking while providing continuous feedback on body state and actions. Additionally, impaired sensation post-stroke
can lead to lower extremity dysfunction, balance problems, and falls, highlighting the need to investigate the effects
of stroke on SMI in relation to walking function and recovery. Given the importance of SMI in walking, the capacity for
these sensorimotor networks to exibit plastic changes may be a crucial mediator for improvements in walking
funciton, thus necessitating relevant methods of assaying sensorimotor plasticity. To address this gap in knowledge,
in the F99 Phase (Aim 1) I will characterize lower extremity sensorimotor plasticity in individuals post-stroke. I will
specifically target the connections between the primary sensory cortex (S1) and and the primary motor cortex (M1)
using paired associative stimulation (PAS), a novel method of assaying sensorimotor plasticity. PAS is based on the
Hebbian principle of associative plasticity, in that repetitive stimulation of pre- and post-synaptic neurons within S1
and M1 leads to increased synaptic efficacy, evidenced by rapid and long-lasting increases in transcranial magnetic
stimulation-induced muscle responses, or motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. We intend to account for
individual differences in SMI by adjusting the timing between stimuli, and measuring the time it takes the electrical
stimulation to reach S1, via somatosensory evoked potentials. Changes in MEP amplitude following PAS are thought
to reflect the induced associative plasticity between S1 and M1, and are shown to be reflective of upper extremity
function, with limited work done in the lower extremities. Therefore, we hypothesize that individualized PAS protocols,
will facilitate increases in MEP amplitude, and changes will be associated with clinical measures of walking function.
In the K00 Phase (Aim 2), I will pursue advanced training in post-stroke sensory and motor reorganization via multi-
modal techniques to understand walking and balance recovery. I will seek out postdoctoral mentorship that will allow
me to build on my predoctoral work by acquiring advanced electrophysiological and neuroimaging skills. I will also
focus on individualized assessments and the identification of mechanisms underlying the response to treatment
between individuals over the course of rehabilitation. The F99/K00 will help facilitate my path to independence through
research training and career development, enroute to my long-term goal of becoming an independent researcher at
an academic medical center. The proposed work and career direction aim to inform lower extremity rehabilitation
efforts by providing functional and structural neural correlates of recovery."

Arenaviruses comprise a diverse family. Several species are associated with severe
arenaviral hemorrhagic fever (AVHF) in humans. Human infection with arenaviruses
typically occurs through contact with materials contaminated with the excretions of an
infected rodent although direct human- to-human transmission may occur in clinical settings.
AVHF resulting from infection with the Old World arenavirus Lassa is estimated to cause
over 300,000 annual infections in Western Africa, of which 15-20% of hospitalized patients
die while survivors often suffer permanent sequelae. Given the limited treatment and
prophylactic options, the mortality/morbidity rate, the potential for both zoonotic and
human-to-human transmission, geographical transplantation and bio-weaponization
six arenaviruses have been recognized as Category A pathogens. Currently, we have a
clinical highly potent arenavirus entry inhibitor in Phase 1 clinical trial with comparable activity
for all six Category A arenaviruses. The manufacturing of the compound requires 3 step
synthesis with yields of 60-80% and purity >99.5%. In addition, the compound is amenable to
simple formulation for both tablets and capsules with suitable oral bioavailability and half-life to
support once or twice-a-day dosing. Here we propose initiating steps toward registration of
both drug substance and product by evaluating, validating and locking down manufacturing
processes and in parallel manufacture the first of 3 registration drug product batches to be used
for Phase 3 clinical trial."

Individuals suffering from atopic dermatitis have increased risk for serious recurrent and disseminated viral
infections, but the cause is unclear. Defense against local infections relies on tissue resident memory CD8+ T
cells (TRM) that deliver rapid defense against invading pathogens. We hypothesize that impairment of CD8+ TRM
contributes to severe infection in patients with atopic dermatitis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that IL-4
counters TGF-b-induced expression of CD8+ TRM receptors that are required for persistence within peripheral
tissues. In parallel, in vivo studies reveal that exposure of CD8+ T cells to IL-4 decreases their accumulation
within inflamed skin. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-4 prevents TGF-b-mediated
signaling and/or changes the chromatin landscape surrounding TGF-b target genes in CD8+ T cells, resulting
in an altered CD8+ T cell phenotype. We predict that these phenotypic changes impede the long-term
persistence of cutaneous CD8+ TRM and impair TRM-mediated defense against local viral infection. We will test
these hypotheses by i) using mouse models of allergic eczema to analyze the impact of local Th2-type
inflammation on CD8+ TRM persistence and protection from HSV infection ii) analyzing the effect of Th2
cytokines on the phenotype and function of human CD8+ TRM, and iii) investigating the impact of IL-4 on TGF-
bR signaling and the chromatin landscape of CD8+ T cells."

After spinal cord injury, a plethora of cellular responses impact functional recovery. Neurons may be preserved
or undergo cell death, axon degeneration and/or regenerative attempt. Astrocytes may become hypertrophic,
seal off the injury epicenter and influence axonal response in complex ways. Other cell types such as
fibroblasts/pericytes, microglia, macrophages also play important roles. Understanding how different cell types
respond to injury, how their responses are regulated and how they contribute to functional recovery is critical
for developing therapeutic intervention to promote functional repair after spinal cord injury. In the past, our lab
has mostly focused on the molecular control of neuronal responses to injury, and in particular axon
regeneration and sprouting following CNS injury. Regeneration is axonal growth from injured neurons and
sprouting is axonal growth from uninjured neurons. Both may contribute to functional recovery. DLK and LZK
are mammalian homologues of invertebrate DLK that has been shown to play important roles in axon
regeneration in C. elegans and Drosophila. The role of mammalian DLK and LZK in spinal cord repair in not
known. In the process of studying DLK (MAP3K12) and LZK (MAP3K13) in axonal repair after spinal cord
injury, we have identified a critical role for LZK in astrocytic scarring. This result corroborates with published
literature on Stat3 and Pten to illustrate an emerging theme that signaling pathways regulating axonal repair
may also regulate astrocyte response to injury. In this proposal, we will comprehensively investigate the
neuron and astrocyte specific roles of LZK and DLK in the multicellular response to spinal cord injury using an
array of inducible loss and gain of function mouse genetic lines. Downstream effectors of DLK and LZK will be
identified through transcriptomic analyses in neurons and astrocytes. Functional synergies or redundancies will
be tested between DLK and LZK, and the interaction with other signaling pathways including Stat3 and Pten
will be tested as well. Together, these studies will determine the contribution of DLK and LZK in axonal repair
and astrocyte response after spinal cord injury, which may pave the way for therapeutic development targeting
these molecules to promote repair and recovery after spinal cord injury."

The hair follicle (HF) is composed of an epithelial and dermal population and is a classic model to study the
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions governing appendage development. During HF development, the first
morphologically distinct dermal population is the dermal condensate (DC), a dense cluster of specialized cells
that matures into the dermal papilla (DP). As the DP holds the revered capacity to induce new HF growth, large
efforts have been made to program undifferentiated fibroblasts into differentiated DC/DP cells but met with
limited efficacy. The principal challenge has been the inability to assess molecular differences between cells
before they are morphologically apparent. As such, we lack a molecular âroadmapâ of the transition states that
direct lineage commitment and morphogenesis that could guide faithful methods to recapitulate these events in
vitro. To meet this challenge, we recently used an unbiased diffusion map technique to systemize single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from mouse embryonic skin. Using this technique, we identified a
molecular DC differentiation trajectory, an inferred pathway of transcriptional states through which DC cells
pass, before and during HF morphogenesis. Guided by this map, we showed that dermal Wnt/ï¢-catenin
signaling is required to progress to an intermediate phase of DC cell differentiation and that DC cells are
immediate quiescent progeny of a molecularly distinct (Dkk1+), highly proliferative population. Currently, the
critical transition steps that Dkk1+ cells pass through and the signals that regulate them remain unknown.
Combining innovative computational methods and mouse models, our preliminary data reveal that Dkk1+
progenitors utilize two molecular pathways to generate DC cells that distinguishes DC initiation from DC
expansion processes prior to morphogenesis. We hypothesize that DC formation is a dynamic process wherein
DC initiation and DC expansion utilize distinct molecular pathways to generate DC cells and that signals that
regulate the transition from proliferation to quiescence are essential for DC differentiation by Dkk1+
progenitors. In this grant, we use an integrative approach to build a temporospatial map of DC transition states
that govern DC formation. In Aim 1, we will couple transcriptional kinetic scRNA-seq data (RNA velocity) with
in vivo lineage tracing to define transition steps that lead to DC initiation and DC expansion, coupled with live
imaging and quantitative FISH to spatially locate critical transition steps. Using this same approach, we will
define how local epithelial signals regulate key transition states within distinct DC paths. In Aim 2, we will
examine the role of local proliferation in DC formation and signals (e.g. YAP/TAZ) that regulate the transition
between proliferation and quiescence using genetic mouse models. This complementary approach will
overcome major challenges in dissecting the early events that lead to DC cell fate. The overall goal of this
project is to build a high-resolution roadmap that delineates how DCs form to accelerate regenerative efforts,
while also providing an experimental paradigm to study the formation of other cutaneous appendages."

Within a 3-year R01 we will use the NIH stage model and principles from the Science of Behavioral Change to develop,
optimize and establish proof of concept for the Mindful, Self-Compassionate Care Program (MASC) for stressed caregivers
of persons with ADRD with challenging behaviors. In aim 1, we will use qualitative focus groups to develop MASC (NIH
stage 1A; up to 30 caregivers; n=4 groups). In aim 2, we will optimize MASC and conduct an open pilot with exit interviews
to explore feasibility benchmarks, target engagement and signal of improvement in stress, depression, anxiety and well-
being (NIH stage 1A; up to 10 caregivers; n=1 group). In aim 3, we will conduct a pilot RCT of MASC versus a Health
Education control to establish feasibility benchmarks and preliminary efficacy and explore evidence for potential
mechanisms of improvement through the proposed mechanistic targets (N=80/c0 completers). MASC combines evidence-
based skills from mindfulness programs, self-compassion programs, and behavioral management programs. MASC
structure and components are designed to facilitate uptake, skill practice, and sustainability of improvements. MASC has 6
sessions and is delivered virtually in groups. MASC has an associated web platform that facilitates skills practice and is
available to caregivers after the group ends. Our guiding hypothesis is that MASC skills of mindfulness, self-compassion,
and behavioral management will interact and lead to decreased stress, depression and anxiety and improved well-being,
through decreased loneliness, increased caregiver self-efficacy, social support, mindfulness, self-compassion, compassion
and improved relationship quality. Our team is well positioned to conduct this study with specific experience in mindfulness
and self-compassion programs; intervention development, feasibility testing and clinical trials; ADRD caregivers;
recruitment of national, geographically diverse samples. At the end of the 3-year period of this R01 we will have clear
evidence of the feasibility of study procedures, randomization, acceptability, credibility, adherence, ability to retain and
recruit as well as its proof of concepts in reducing stress in caregivers of people with ADRD and proposed mechanisms.
Results from this R01 study will be used to apply for funding to conduct a fully powered hybrid efficacy-effectiveness RCT.
The goal is dissemination and implementation of MASC to reduce stress, among all in need caregivers of persons with
ADRD."

Over the past decade, the first two phases of The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES)
demonstrated that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), phthalates and bisphenols,
influences the development of sexually dimorphic reproductive (anogenital distance) and neurodevelopmental
(internalizing/externalizing behavior) outcomes in infancy and early childhood through hormonal disruption.
TIDES III: Endocrine Disruption, Hormones, and Sex Differences in Adolescent Airway Health furthers this
research to determine sex-specific outcomes in adolescent airway health. Impaired airway health in childhood
shifts from male to female predominance, beginning in adolescence. Consequently, the morbidity and
economic burden of airway disease and reduced lung function disproportionately affects females. Emerging
evidence suggests exposures to phthalates and bisphenols may program sex-specific airway health impacts, in
part, through sex steroid hormonal action. Differential sex steroid hormone production among males and
females through adolescence may influence sex differences in airway function. In TIDES III, we propose to
conduct two new study visits (ages 12 and 14 years) in 500 adolescents to assess urinary phthalates,
bisphenols, serum sex steroid hormones, a targeted panel of 29 urine steroid metabolites, and airway
assessment (wheeze questionnaire, spirometry with albuterol, fractional exhaled nitric oxide). Our first aim will
evaluate longitudinal associations between prenatal and adolescent EDCs in relation to airway outcomes: the
ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) over forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow
(FEF25-75), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and current asthma during adolescence. The second aim will
evaluate associations between prenatal and adolescent serum sex steroid hormones and airway outcomes in
adolescence. The third aim will determine relationships between prenatal EDCs in relation to sex steroid
hormones and urinary steroid metabolites, and a final exploratory aim will evaluate hormones and hormone
metabolites as mediators between EDCs and airway outcomes. Employing a targeted urinary steroid
metabolite approach will enable identification of novel metabolites involved in sex steroid synthesis that may be
affected by EDCs. This study will directly address imperatives from The National Academy of Medicine and the
National Institutes of Health to examine sex as a biological variable. Findings will improve our understanding of
biological sex disparities. Our multi-site, longitudinal study will identify modifiable factors affecting biological
sex differences in airway health that could lead to the development of novel clinical predictive tools and policies
that aim to reduce EDC exposures."
10848363,"Gradual loss of brain function and neurodegeneration are common features of aging throughout diverse phyla. Senile dementias, including Alzheimerâs Disease (AD), likely involve failures of adult neural stem cell (NSC) number, viability, and/or functions. Our lab studies NSCâs role in central nervous system (CNS) development, adult regeneration, and in onset dementia such as AD. We are establishing aÂ field of research in regenerative medicine and aging as the first lab to prospectively isolate human NSC and use them in published preclinical and clinical trial studies. In this proposal we seek to understand basic principles and evolutionarily conserved elements of NSC involvement in neuronal regeneration, degeneration, and aging in the colonial tunicateÂ Botryllus schlosseri.Â  Botryllus has two reproductive modes: sexual reproduction which produces a primitive chordate with a simple CNS (the chordate brain), that will undergo metamorphosis into an asexually reproducing sessile invertebrate which propagates by budding. We have found that Botryllus buds contain self-renewing germline stem cells, and somatic stem cells which self-organize to form a colony composed of genetically identical individuals. This stage exhibits weekly assayable CNS tissue regeneration from candidate NSC and undergoes repeated neurodegeneration throughout its adult life, a process that resembles adult neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in vertebrates. Thus, Botryllus offers a unique opportunity to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CNS generation and degeneration through observing weekly regeneration cycles in young and old coloniesÂ (e.g. <3 months vs. >7 years). We aim to identify the mutations and/or epigenetic changes that accumulate in the NSC, and through self-renewal remain present throughout an organism's life. We have undertaken a systematic molecular (brain transcriptomic) analysis of CNS cells of old and young Botryllus colonies, paired with morphological and behavioral characterization of each of their CNS lineage cells. This analysis revealed 93 homologous genes that correlate with Alzheimerâs disease, including APP, GRN, PSEN1, GLUD2, and VPS35 that are differentially expressed between young and old colonies. Furthermore, the brains of old colonies contain a lower number of cells and have reduced neuron-mediated responses to sensory stimuli. Since stem cells are the only cells that self-renew and are maintained throughout the colonyâs life, we hypothesize that genetic mutations or epigenetic changes that accumulate over time in NSC and their progenitors are the main cause of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. To test this hypothesis, we plan to characterize the molecular and cellular diversity of the Botryllus brain in chordate larvae and young and old colonies, isolate their NSCs at the single cell level, identify mutations that accumulate in NSC DNA, and test their effect on brain regeneration and function. Morpholino anti-sense RNAs will also be used to manipulate the activity of genes whose genetic variation predicts the onset of Alzheimerâs disease and test their effect on brain regeneration and degeneration capacity, and also attempt to introduce permanent alterations of their genomes by CRISPR."

The purpose of this training grant is to provide postdoctoral training to early-stage basic scientists and
physicians in the area of neurobiology of substance abuse at the genetic, molecular, circuit and behavioral
levels. Training will take place in the multidisciplinary setting at the University of Michigan. This is an exciting
and innovative environment with world class facilities and faculty needed to develop the next generation of
scientists working in drug abuse. The faculty members have expertise in the neurobiology of substance abuse,
with particular emphasis on opioid and psychostimulant drugs. The focus of the proposal is the scientific
training of postdoctoral fellows using state-of-the-art approaches for studying mechanisms underlying drug
abuse, and development of âsoft skillsâ needed for long-term success (e.g., written and oral communication,
mentorship). Scientific training includes studying the genetic, developmental and environmental factors that
lead to vulnerability to substance abuse; the mode of action of drugs of abuse at the molecular, cellular,
anatomical and behavioral levels; the long-term consequences of psychoactive drugs on the brain, as
mediated through mechanisms of neural plasticity; and the development of medications, and prevention
strategies. The working assumption is that the functional and structural brain remodeling associated with
chronic drug use lies at the basis of tolerance, sensitization, physical dependence, and psychological addiction
to these drugs. The drug abuse research community at the University of Michigan is of high quality and has a
long history in the field. Beyond their individual strengths, the training faculty members have long-standing
collaborative scientific and training relationships with each other. These historical strengths are enhanced by a
number of initiatives at University of Michigan designed to facilitate life science research in general, and
neuroscience research in particular. They include state-of-the-art tools for mouse and rat genetics, genomics,
proteomics, and informatics and substantial programming and resources for postdoctoral career development.
Thus, our postdoctoral fellows will profit from a highly sophisticated, yet supportive, research and training
environment."

Surgical pain is caused by tissue injury and inflammation. To treat surgical pain, people are given opioids
which is leading to secondary health problems after surgery including opioid abuse, dependence, and
overdose that is driving the United States opioid epidemic. This is particularly important for older adults as
treating pain with opioids also present challenges with age-related changes in drug metabolism in addition to
drug-drug interactions due to polypharmacy. Therefore, discovering new non-opioid targets and developing
non-opioid treatments that are as effective in the young and elderly populations to alleviate surgical pain are
urgently needed.
For this HEAL proposal, the goal of the research is to develop a peptidomimetic to block the interaction of
NF-ÎºB essential modulator (IKGKB, UniProt #Q9Y6K9) with IKKÎ² and further determine whether a peptide
targeting NF-ÎºB essential modulator (NEMO) reduces surgical pain in young and old rodents. NEMO is a
promising non-opioid target to develop drugs to treat pain since NEMO is a critical protein regulating the
canonical pathway of NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammation. Here we will leverage new key findings regarding the
NEMO interaction site with IKKÎ² based upon the crystal structure to develop a peptidomimetic to block the
NEMO interaction with IKKÎ². In order to carry out this work, we developed an assay to screen NEMO peptide
modifications by using a mouse skin fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell line that contains a stable NF-ÎºB luciferase
reporter. Further, we will determine whether a NEMO binding peptide will limit pain and inflammation after
injury using a surgical incision model. To carry out these studies, we developed a rodent paw surgical incision
model that increases phosphorylated NF-ÎºB 3-fold in addition to a 10-fold increase in NF-ÎºB-regulated pro-
inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1Î². Taken together, this proposal can advance the field by
developing a potential non-opioid therapeutic to treat pain and test whether a peptide binding NEMO is
effective in reducing surgical pain in young and old rodents.
Additionally, since the studies performed for this proposal will determine whether binding NEMO limits NF-ÎºB
activation and production of NF-ÎºB-mediated proinflammatory genes, these studies also have a broad
importance to aging. This is because inflammation is a hallmark of aging and the cellular senescence-
associated secretory phenotype described in aging cells is driven by increases in IL-6 and IL-1Î²; where IL-6 is
the major driver of this phenotype. Therefore, developing a peptidomimetic that binds NEMO may potentially
have broader implications besides treating surgical pain and useful in limiting inflammatory pain for the elderly."

Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (ATAAD) are extremely lethal diseases. The contribution
of endothelial dysfunction in ATAAD has received limited attention and thus remains poorly understood. Com-
pelling evidence from our preliminary studies suggests a critical role for endothelial cell (EC) injury and endo-
thelial hyperpermeability in aortic degeneration and ATAAD development. [scRNA-seq analysis of aortas from
sporadic ATAAD patients revealed significant EC dysfunction with upregulation of RIP3 and GSDMD that trig-
ger necroptosis and pyroptosis, respectively. In a sporadic ATAAD mouse model, aortic challenge with high-
fat diet and angiotensin II infusion induced RIP3 and GSDMD in ECs, caused endothelial hyperpermeability,
nanoparticle infiltration, interlaminar space expansion, elastic fiber delamination, and microdissection. EC-Rip3-
/- or EC-Gsdmd-/- showed markedly reduced nanoparticle infiltration and aortic degeneration.] Further investiga-
tion with scATAC-seq showed that aortic challenge increased chromatin accessibility at promoters/enhancers
of the pro-inflammatory/pro-death genes, likely by activating pro-inflammatory transcription factors (TFs) such
as IRF3. In human ECs, cytosolic DNA and STING-TBK1 signaling was a potent upstream trigger for the acti-
vation of IRF3 and BRG1 and induction of GSDMD expression. The objective of this application is to test the
central hypothesis that aortic stress activates inflammatory signaling within ECs that triggers epigenetic in-
duction of a pro-inflammatory and pro-death program, leading to EC necroptosis/pyroptosis, barrier dysfunc-
tion, blood component infiltration, aortic wall degeneration, and ATAAD formation. [Aim 1 will test the hypothe-
sis that RIP3-mediated EC necroptosis and GSDMD-mediated EC pyroptosis compromise EC barrier function,
thereby facilitating the infiltration of inflammatory blood components and promoting aortic degeneration and
ATAAD formation. In our sporadic ATAAD model, we will compare aortic degeneration and ATAAD formation
in control mice, EC-Rip3-/- mice, EC-Gsdmd-/- mice, and WT mice treated with a necroptosis/pyroptosis inhibi-
tor.] Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that aortic stress activates inflammatory signaling (e.g., STING pathway)
within ECs that triggers epigenetic induction of a pro-inflammatory and pro-death program. We will perform
scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analyses of ECs in aortas from unchallenged and challenged WT mice and EC-
specific Sting KO mice. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that stress signals (e.g., cytosolic DNA) trigger sensing-
signaling pathways (e.g., STING-TBK) that directly activates chromatin remodeling complexes (e.g.,
BRG1/SWI/SNF) and TFs (e.g., IRF3) that induce GSDMD expression and promote EC pyroptosis. We will test
the hypothesis in cultured human ECs (Aim 3A) and [confirm the mechanistic links in human ATAAD aortas
(Aim 3B)]. We expect that the proposed studies will provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of
sporadic aortic degeneration and ATAAD formation, which will in turn enable development of new treatments
for preventing disease progression and its fatal sequelae.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by abnormal polymerization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin, which
damages red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in hemolysis and thromboinflammation. Sickled-RBCs lead to
heterogeneous clinical complications in SCD and induce challenges in determining the exact therapeutic
interventions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from cells, and can serve as vehicles for exchanging
biomolecules and reflect the parent cellâs functional state. Complement system (CS) activation plays important
roles in intravascular hemolysis, red blood cell EV (REV) generation, and thromboinflammation. In SCD, REVs
express phosphatidylserine and transport heme that are capable of promoting thrombosis, microvascular
inflammation triggering thrombus formation and cell adhesion. I hypothesize that in SCD: REVs will serve as a
biomarker to predict CS activation and CS-mediated thromboinflammation, evaluate disease activity, and assist
in preliminary evaluation of responses to therapeutic intervention. Here, I propose to use microfluidic systems
and functional assays I developed to enhance the mechanistic understanding of stress-induced CS activation
and REV generation, and the roles of REV in CS activation and thromboinflammation in heterogeneous
population of patients with SCD. First, I will determine the responses of SCD RBC and complement system after
exposure to individual and cumulated stresses including shear stress, hypoxia, and cycles of hypoxia-
reoxygenation using microfluidic system. I will determine the role of stresses in CS activation, hemolysis, and
REV generation. Autologous REVs generated under in vitro stresses and endogenous REVs isolated from
plasma will be characterized for defining their surface protein expression, proteomic content, and effect on
amplifying CS activation. I will refine the applied stresses to generate autologous REVs using samples at
baseline states for mimicking endogenous REVs in samples at elevated disease state. Second, I will elucidate
the roles of REV and CS activation in thromboinflammation. REV-mediated endothelial activation through
Kruppel Like Factor 4 and complement activation will be assessed using both analytical and function endpoints
including abnormal cellular adhesion and thrombus formation. Third, I will utilize analytical and functional assays
to assess (using endogenous REVs) and predict (using autologous REVs) clinical outcome and efficacies of
therapeutic intervention for individual patients. I will establish a temporal and progressive database of REV-
initiated CS activation and thromboinflammation for assist patient-specific diagnosis and prognosis. This project
will improve the understanding of the roles of CS and REV in hemolysis and thromboinflammation in SCD, and
has the potential to establish a REV database to enable accurate evaluation of disease outcomes. Given my
background as a chemical engineer, the K25 award will uniquely enable me to gain experience and become an
independent scientist in basic and translational biomedical research."

 This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel,
computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture
the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for
analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity
in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human
psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary,
collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack
of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2)
the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as
the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective
is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic
social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay
to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse
Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and
unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or
imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach
is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to
form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and âposeâ
estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the
identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational
approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective,
we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models
(Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional
assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create
a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social
behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer
vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a
context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders."

Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of
antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP
have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP.
However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus,
uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States.
Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are
mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used,
identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted
and tailored intervention and close monitoring.
Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify
patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve
in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data.
MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may
be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They
have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy.
The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random
forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators
to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings
by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third,
Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a
case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish
these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive
medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the
timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing
skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will
allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease
related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level."
10851973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adult mammals possess a limited ability to regenerate cardiac tissue after an injury, such as a myocardial
infarction. Following a myocardial infarction, up to a billion or more heart muscle cells die and are replaced by
scar tissue that contributes to heart failure and sudden death. In contrast, adult zebrafish remarkably regenerate
injured hearts with no residual scarring. Although zebrafish and mammals share homologs of genes vital for
heart regeneration, their transcriptional responses to cardiac injury are distinct. However, the mechanisms
governing gene expression during heart regeneration remain poorly understood.
My research aims to elucidate how injury-responsive gene expression is regulated to facilitate heart regeneration.
My lab identified the cardiac leptin b-linked regeneration enhancer (cLEN), which activates gene expression
upon cardiac injury. Using in vivo transgenic assays, I found that multiple activation elements are required for
injury-dependent cardiac enhancer activity. Surprisingly, I also found that cLEN contains a repressive element
that is required for preventing enhancer activation in uninjured hearts, providing the first example of an inhibitory
element within a cardiac regeneration enhancer. Based on these data, I hypothesize that cardiac regeneration
enhancers are dually governed by activation and repression to direct injury-restricted expression for heart
regeneration.
In Aim 1, I will utilize pharmacological and genetic approaches to test the model that injury-induced MEKâERKâ
AP-1 pathway signaling activates cardiac regeneration enhancers. I will also utilize ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and
RNA-seq using FACS-sorted endocardial cells from uninjured and regenerating hearts to test whether AP-1
regulates chromatin accessibility, deposition of active histone marks, and injury-induced paracrine factor
expression. In Aim 2, I will use transgenic assays to determine whether cLEN-like enhancer candidates I
identified in the zebrafish, mouse, and human genomes drive regeneration-induced expression. The functionality
of candidate repressive elements will be determined via mutational analyses. I will also utilize in vivo loss-of-
function assays to determine whether prdm1a, a transcriptional repressor that is predicted to bind to the
repressive element in cLEN, mediates heart regeneration and repression of regeneration enhancers in uninjured
hearts.
These studies will utilize genetic tools and the endogenous regenerative ability of the zebrafish heart to improve
our understanding of transcriptional mechanisms underlying heart regeneration, build gene regulatory networks,
and identify potential targets for improving heart repair."

The role of mitochondrial regulation in cell lineage specification and function
During cell lineage specification, metabolic reprogramming, together with transcriptional and epigenetic
modifications in the progenitor cells are integral parts of cellular adaptations to the cell fate instructive cues.
When this process goes awry, developmental defects as well as malignancies will occur. Common in all the
cellular systems, mitochondria are bioenergetic, biosynthetic and signaling organelles central to metabolic
remodeling. Understanding mechanisms of mitochondrial function during lineage specification will be critical for
therapeutic normalization of derailed cellular metabolism and functions in pathogenesis. Though mitochondrial
regulation is still unclear, our published and preliminary work revealed critical roles of mitochondrial
metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics during cell lineage specification. Furthermore, differentiated cells
continue to receive low-level, constitutive signaling in the basal state (âtonic signalsâ), important for cell survival
or functions. Our research suggested that mitochondrial regulation is actively maintained in mature
differentiated cells downstream of tonic signals and revealed potential new regulators for this process. The
overarching theme of our research is to unravel the diverse mitochondria mediated mechanisms regulating cell
lineage differentiation and homeostatic functions. In Project 1, we will use high resolution imaging to
characterize distinct mitochondrial morphology, and dynamic events in live cells. Using genetic tools, and an
organ culture system to model cell lineage specification, we will decipher the role of mitochondrial dynamics in
metabolic remodeling during differentiation. In Project 2, using a sophisticated system of transferring cells into
environments with defined levels of tonic signals, we will assess the alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and
functions in the presence and absence of tonic signals. Through pharmacological means or genetic
modifications such as CRISPR/Ca9 in differentiated cells, we will determine the causal relationship between
mitochondrial regulation and maintenance of cellular functions. Upon completion of our work, we will have
uncovered the versatile mechanisms by which mitochondria influence lineage specification and homeostatic

A combined behavioral couples therapy and motivational interviewing intervention to reduce intimate
partner violence and alcohol use in South India
Globally, an estimated 30% of women have reported physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in their
lifetime. Women who report intimate partner violence (IPV) have worse short- and long-term health outcomes,
including increased risk for sexually transmitted infections and HIV, poor maternal health outcomes, and
increased risk for suicide attempts. Perpetrator Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) increases risk taking behaviors,
and impairs problem-solving and cognitive processes, which may drive IPV. The current scientific
understanding of these urgent issues has following limitations: a) most interventions improve either IPV or AUD
but not both outcomes; b) interventions that successfully improve both are delivered by highly trained mental
health professionals, limiting access and scalability; and c) most interventions focus on either just the husband
or the wife but not both. These limitations have led to a strong scientific and implementation gap of
interventions that are feasible, effective, and scalable in low-resource settings to target both IPV and AUD.
Our Indo-US collaborative team pilot tested an intervention to deliver behavioral coupleâs therapy (BCT), based
on principles derived from Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) to enhance coupleâs communication, combined with
contingency management to reduce alcohol use. This intervention was acceptable, feasible and showed
preliminary efficacy of IPV and alcohol use in couples when the husband had AUD. We now propose to build
on and extend this intervention to combine BCT with motivational interviewing (MI), delivered by primary care
nurses, to reduce alcohol use and IPV among couples in India and to test this in a randomized controlled trial.
Our research team has a long history of collaborative research in South Asia. Dr. Ekstrand has a 25 year
history of research in India, supported by 11 NIH-funded studies where she was the PI or MPI, six of which
were at the proposed site. Drs. Acharya and Ekstrand currently oversee two NIH-funded R34 and R21 studies
in South Asia successfully using MI. Dr. Srinivasan has led several studies that examined the relationship
between AUD and high-risk behavior, including IPV, and was the senior PI of our pilot intervention on which
this proposal is based. Dr Srinivasan has also been MPI on three NIH-funded R01 studies with Dr. Ekstrand.
We propose to build on this evidence base and robust research infrastructure at primary health clinics at our
South India site. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (n= 400 couples) and study the impact of BCT
and MI in reducing IPV and AUD. The intervention will be delivered by nurses in primary health centers who
will be supervised by a clinical psychologist. We will perform intention to treat analyses to compare treatment
and control groups on the two primary outcomes at 12-months follow-up: 1) mean scores on the Indian Family
Violence and Control Scale and 2) number of days with a negative breathalyzer test over a 1-week period. We
will assess secondary outcomes and other measures to conduct mixed-methods analyses to assess the
theorized mechanisms of change influencing intervention effectiveness. If successful, our study will provide
evidence for a low-cost couplesâ intervention for IPV and AUD that can be delivered in primary care settings."

Todayâs technologies allow profiling thousands of gene expression features for diseases and drugs at a very low
cost. This proposal entitled âVirtual Compound Screening Using Gene Expressionâ aims to develop novel data
science approaches to leverage emerging gene expression profiles to discover novel drugs. Previously, we
developed a scoring function called RGES to quantify the drugâs potency to reverse disease gene expression
based on the drug- and disease- expression profiles. We observed that RGES correlates with drug efficacy.
Using this idea, we and others identified drugs that could be repurposed to treat a number of diseases. However,
this approach currently does not support novel compound screening or lead optimization. To implement this
approach for large-scale screening of a big compound library, we first need to generate gene expression profiles
of the library compounds. However, because of the lack of large-scale gene expression profiles of new
compounds, virtual compound screening was impossible until recent efforts including ours demonstrated the
feasibility of predicting gene expression solely based on chemical structure. The objective of this project is thus
to develop novel machine learning methods to boost the performance of drug-gene expression prediction and
utilize the predicted profiles in practical drug discovery. To achieve the goals, we have assembled a team of
experts in computational drug discovery, machine learning, drug screening, and medicinal chemistry. First, we
will develop a robust, high-performance, and generalizable data-driven chemical structure embedding method
to enhance drug-induced gene expression prediction. With the predicted profiles, we will deploy RGES to score
compounds for given disease profiles. We will evaluate the performance in the screening of compounds for liver
cancer inhibitors, SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, and cell reprogramming regulators. Finally, we will apply it to lead
optimization. Our previous drug repurposing efforts identified and validated two candidates: niclosamide in liver
cancer and Mycophenolic acid in DIPG. However, the poor solubility of niclosamide and the poor penetration of
Mycophenolic acid in the brain hindered their further development. Accordingly, we will develop a deep
reinforcement learning framework to achieve the optimization of these two drugs. In parallel, domain experts will
propose new analogs. We will synthesize the analogs and compare the performance between domain experts
and the AI model. We expect this work will unleash the power of the emerging omics data in drug discovery."

The treatment of drug use and HIV often requires sequential, individualized decision-making concerning the
type or delivery of treatment. An adaptive intervention is a treatment design that uses ongoing information from
the patient to guide whether, and how to modify the treatment over time. By providing the appropriate
treatment to those who need it, when they need it, adaptive interventions hold the promise of improving long-
term outcomes for greater numbers of people, thereby increasing the reach and impact of drug use and HIV
treatments in real-world settings. The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a powerful
experimental design that is used for constructing efficacious AIs. However, in order to make the SMART
maximally useful to drug use and HIV intervention scientists, methodological work is needed to expand the
options for analyzing data that arise from a SMART and to expand the kinds of SMARTs that are currently
being designed, which are limited in important ways. This proposal is a competing renewal application of
R01(DA039901; ending 07/31/20), in which our multidisciplinary team of behavior intervention and data
scientists has successfully developed and tested a suite of methods for the design and longitudinal analysis of
SMARTs. In this renewal we embark in new methodological directions related to use of novel treatment
technologies and resulting intensive longitudinal data (ILD) to inform the development of effective AIs. A
growing number of drug abuse and HIV interventions capitalize on modern technologies such as mobile and
web-based applications, and wearable devices to deliver and augment treatments. These technologies enable
the collection of frequent measures of an individualâs behavior and experiences. Such data have great potential
for addressing new research questions about the dynamic effects of adaptive interventions and for constructing
more sophisticated, yet less burdensome tailoring variables. However, existing longitudinal methods for the
analysis of SMARTs do not currently accommodate ILD. Further, existing SMART designs do not currently
take full advantage of the clinical potential of ILD in terms of how ILD can be employed as tailoring variables.
Our objective is to bridge these critical gaps by developing and evaluating new methods to enable drug
use/HIV scientists to analyze multiple types of ILD in a SMART; developing and evaluating new methods to
analyze existing ILD in order to design more effective SMARTs; applying and illustrating these methods using
data from three SMART studies and two observational studies in drug abuse and HIV that employ an ILD
collection protocol; and developing free, user-friendly resources to implement these methods. The methods
developed in this project will improve clinical and public health outcomes by enabling drug use and HIV
scientists to develop more potent adaptive interventions to guide the individualization of drug use and HIV
treatments."

The podocyte has become a crucial focus of research and clinical efforts as a target for kidney disease
interventions due to its vital role in regulating glomerular permeability and maintaining glomerular structure.
Podocyte injury is pathogenetically and prognostically important in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). One of the
main factors determining pathological changes in glomerular morphology and permeability is the elevation of
basal intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels in podocytes, which can occur due to activation of various signaling
cascades. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are emerging as proteins of interest for their potential to
modulate podocyte [Ca2+]i levels, especially under pathological conditions, such as DKD. Clinical studies have
demonstrated that circulating concentrations of PAR-activating proteases are associated with DKD.
Furthermore, the recent prospective OPTIMUS-5 study revealed several beneficial effects of the FDA-approved
PAR1 antagonist Vorapaxar in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, despite crucial evidence for the importance of
PAR signaling pathways in podocytes in DKD, this area is still understudied. Our preliminary data demonstrate
the functional presence of a PAR-GPCR-TRPC6 signaling pathway in rat and human podocytes that is increased
under diabetic conditions. Consistent with these findings, we found that serine proteases promote activation of
PAR1-TRPC6 cascade in podocytes from freshly isolated rat glomeruli, which triggers a rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i.
Furthermore, our pilot studies have revealed that these signaling pathways are highly upregulated in a rat model
of type 2 Diabetic Nephropathy (T2DN rats), similar to clinical observations in human patients. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that during the development of DKD in type 2 diabetes, when urinary thrombin and
urokinase concentrations increase rapidly, overstimulation of PAR1 promotes excessive [Ca2+]i levels in
podocytes through activation of TRPC6 channels, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis, development of
albuminuria and glomerular damage. Thus, inhibition of PAR1 activity will mitigate podocyte damage and may
be of therapeutic benefit in DKD. Several innovative approaches and unique rat models will be utilized to test
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PAR1 expression and its activity increase during
the progression of DKD in type 2 diabetes and that this pathway contributes to the alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis
in podocytes and glomerular damage; and Aim 2 will provide mechanistic insight into the activation of PAR-1
mediated signaling in podocytes and associated glomerular structure and function changes. In addition, the
correlation of PAR signaling in podocytes and sex difference in the development of DKD in T2DN rats will be
explored."

Sensitive and responsive caregiving interactions in early childhood, characterized by appropriate responses to
a childâs cues, provide the foundation for healthy emotional and behavioral development across the lifespan.
Infancy is a particularly critical period for these sensitive interactions with caregivers, given the important
contribution of these interactions to the development of infantsâ ability to self-regulate. Infants learn to self-
regulate through co-regulation with the mother; therefore, supporting maternal wellbeing and healthy maternal-
infant co-regulation is an important strategy for promoting emotional and behavioral development. One
evolving and modifiable threat to these sensitive interactions is the mobile device, which has become deeply
interwoven into the fabric of family life, with nearly universal adoption. A growing body of evidence suggests
that due to their engaging design and portability, mobile devices may uniquely interfere with a caregiverâs
ability to sensitively respond to their young childrenâs cues. This prior work, however, has not examined in a
comprehensive model during infancy potential pathways of association between maternal mobile device use,
maternal wellbeing, infant regulation, and maternal-infant co-regulation. Examining these potential associations
among low-income, first-time mothers and their infants may be especially important, given the buffering role
that sensitive maternal-infant interactions can have against psychosocial stress and the patterns of caregiving
that become established during the transition to motherhood. Examining these pathways of association
longitudinally across infancy would allow for identification of both key targets for intervention and the critical
developmental periods during which to intervene upon these targets. Therefore, in a cohort of 230 low-income,
first-time mother-infant dyads, we will measure maternal mobile device use, maternal wellbeing, infant
regulation, and maternal-infant co-regulation at three time points in infancy to address the following aims: Aim
1: To characterize maternal mobile device use with regard to quantity, type of app, and intent. Aim 2: To test
pathways of association between maternal mobile device use, maternal wellbeing, infant regulation, and
maternal-infant co-regulation at infant ages 3, 6, and 12 months. Aim 3: To identify temporal relationships
between maternal mobile device use, maternal wellbeing, infant regulation, and maternal-infant co-regulation
across infant ages 3, 6 and 12 months. The PI, Dr. Munzer, is a developmental-behavioral pediatrician whose
growing research program seeks to understand parenting in the digital age, and how it contributes to childrenâs
wellbeing. With the support of a multidisciplinary team of mentors, Dr. Munzer will gain experience in mobile
device sampling; observed and reported measures of maternal wellbeing, infant regulation, and maternal-infant
co-regulation; and structural equation modeling, cross lagged analyses, and imputation. At the conclusion of
the award period, Dr. Munzer will be poised to develop and test an intervention designed to promote sensitive
maternal-infant interactions and healthy infant emotional and behavioral development in the digital age."
10851829,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
 Human membrane cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 11B1 and 11B2 catalyze the final steps in cortisol
and aldosterone synthesis, respectively. Excess cortisol causes Cushingâs disease, leading to weight gain and
immune suppression (2), whereas excess aldosterone causes primary aldosteronism, leading to hypertension
(3). Treatment options for both disease states have been limited by poor drug selectivity, resulting from the high
sequence homology between CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, especially in their active sites. This proposal aims to
identify structural and functional differences between these enzymes that could be used to inform development
of selective drugs for Cushingâs disease and primary aldosteronism. One difference between the CYP11B
enzymes lies in their interaction with their shared redox partner, adrenodoxin. My preliminary data with CYP11B1
and previous Scott lab studies on CYP11B2 demonstrate that adrenodoxin allosterically modulates both CYP11B
enzymes, but with different impacts on each enzyme (9). This suggests potential differences in how adrenodoxin
binds the two CYP11B enzymes--differences that could be targeted to develop drugs that selectively block only
one enzyme. However, the basis for adrenodoxinâs allosteric effect has not been well-characterized. This
proposal seeks to fill this gap by structurally and functionally characterizing the adrenodoxin allosteric effect on
each CYP11B enzyme. First, an X-ray structure will define the residues forming the CYP11B1/adrenodoxin
interface for comparison with an existing structure of the CYP11B2/adrenodoxin complex. Second, pre steady--
state kinetics using stopped flow will determine whether adrenodoxin binding on the P450 surface changes the
P450 interactions with ligands in the distant buried active site by primarily altering ligand binding or release.
Finally, mutagenesis studies will investigate the effect of a specific loop hypothesized to be responsible for the
differences in the allosteric effect among human P450 enzymes. Overall, this study will provide a broad structural
and functional characterization of the adrenodoxin allosteric effect on CYP11B1 and CYP11B2. This detailed
characterization advances our understanding of the biochemical system but also has the potential to reveal
differences between the two enzymes useful in developing selective drug treatments for both Cushingâs disease
and primary aldosteronism."

Building a diverse pool of well-trained scientists in the biomedical research workforce is an important
mission for the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). With over $700 million in research funding and
state-of-the-art research laboratories, university-wide interdisciplinary research centers, institutional cores, and
clinical facilities, UAB is an ideal site for programs aimed at preparing undergraduate students for careers that
will lead to a PhD or MD-PhD in the biomedical sciences. UAB has a strong record of successful training for
undergraduate students and a strong commitment to training undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds.
UAB has several short-term (mostly summer) programs that provide limited research opportunities and exposure
to biomedical science careers for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (including racial and
ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and persons from disadvantaged backgrounds and/or underserved
areas) who aspire to biomedical research careers. However, there is a need at UAB for more longitudinal
research training programs for underrepresented undergraduate students to retain them in biomedical
research career training pathways and to prepare them for the transition to PhD or MD-PhD programs. A T34-
funded Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) Program at UAB would meet this need. The overall
goal of the UAB MARC Program is to provide up to two years of mentored research, education, and career
development activities for ten undergraduates (scholars) every two years (matriculating five each year) from
groups underrepresented in biomedical research for preparation and transition into high quality PhD or MD-PhD
programs. Scholars will be matched with experienced, funded UAB faculty preceptors who will mentor them and
provide high quality research experiences in biomedical sciences. The program curriculum will be tailored to
each scholarsâ needs to prepare them for success in doctoral training, and will address objectives that include
critical thinking, quantitative skills development, scientific writing, presentation skills, ethics in research,
networking, research career and exposure readiness, and preparation for graduate school. Each scholar will
have an individual development plan (IDP) and their progress will be assessed quarterly. The UAB MARC will
be led by two PD/PIs, one who was a former MARC scholar, and will be supported by two Associate Directors
and a Program Coordinator; the MARC leadership members bring unique skill sets, experience, and perspectives
across research and education in undergraduate and graduate biomedical sciences. Program oversight will be
supported by an internal advisory committee and program evaluation performed by an external evaluation unit.
The major impact of UAB MARC is expected to be at least 80% of UAB MARC participants matriculating into
doctoral training programs (PhD or MD-PhD) and at least 80% completing these programs, which will address
UABâs mission to build a diverse pool of well-trained scientists in the biomedical research workforce."
10849520,"The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS describes current global HIV data as frightening. In the
landmark year 2020, all global targets for HIV treatment and prevention were missed. During the past two years,
multiple overlapping crises have made the situation even worse, with a reversal of previous progress in many
areas of HIV treatment and prevention. Key populations have been disproportionately affected. Compared to
other groups, women who engage in sex work tend to have lower ART uptake, poorer adherence, and worse
treatment outcomes. They are frequently stigmatized, difficult to reach, and often do not benefit from treatment
and prevention efforts targeted to the general population. Despite several clinical trials of interventions to improve
the low rate of reaching an undetectable viral load (VL) in women with HIV who engage in sex work, none has
demonstrated efficacy, underscoring the need for evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to support antiretroviral
therapy (ART) adherence in this key population. To address this important HIV treatment and prevention gap,
we used an iterative development process in collaboration with women who engage in sex work to create
Motivation Matters! (MM!), an interactive mHealth intervention grounded in the Theory of Information, Motivation,
and Behavior. We generated preliminary data on efficacy and participant-level feasibility and acceptability of MM!
in a small randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the population of women engaged in sex work who were viremic
at baseline, undetectable VL at month six was achieved in 74.3% (26/35) of intervention and 46.2% (12/26) of
control participants (relative risk [RR] 1.61, 95%CI 1.02-2.55). These promising preliminary results informed this
proposal for a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to test the effectiveness of MM! for achieving
undetectable VL in women with HIV who engage in sex work. In parallel, we will evaluate key implementation,
service, and client outcomes including intervention fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, cost, safety,
patient-centeredness, engagement, and satisfaction to guide scale-up of MM!. Our aims are: 1) To conduct a
RCT to compare the safety and effectiveness of Motivation Matters! vs. standard of care (SOC, control) for
achieving undetectable viral load in women with HIV who engage in sex work and are initiating ART, 2) To
conduct a mixed-methods study, organized within the framework of the Implementation Research Logic Model
(IRLM), to examine patient-centeredness (service outcome) and key implementation outcomes including fidelity,
feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and cost of MM!, and 3) To conduct a mixed-methods study, organized
within the IRLM framework, to evaluate participants' satisfaction, engagement, and treatment related knowledge,
motivation, and behavior. A definitive trial demonstrating the effectiveness of MM! would shift the clinical practice
paradigm for supporting ART adherence in this key population by providing a simple and inexpensive EBI to
improve rates of undetectable VL. Implementation research conducted in parallel will guide scale-up to achieve
population-level impact if this is warranted based on our data."
10849522,"PROPOSAL ABSTRACT
Type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) with increasing prevalence represents a major burden for health and care system
and individuals. However, the root cause of T2D has not been understood completely. Recent human
epidemiological studies indicate that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) predisposes type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
other metabolic diseases in offspring, resulting in a vicious cycle of diabetes and pregnancy transgenerationally.
Therefore, developmental origins of health and diseases (DOHaD) may provide a new angle in the studies of
metabolic diseases including T2D. The dual roles of BNIP3 in mediating mitophagy and lipid metabolism suggest
that the deletion of BNIP3 in trophoblast cells is expected to impair placental mitochondrial function, lipid
catabolism, and thus, negatively affecting maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy and leading to the
development of GDM. We propose that BNIP3 may play a critical role in the process of placental development
and consequent programming of T2D in offspring. In this application, we hypothesize that BNIP3 mediated
placental mitophagy plays a critical role in the development of GDM and trophoblast specific knockout of Bnip3
in pregnant mice will cause maternal GDM and predispose T2D in offspring through placental programming.
Continuing our previous study, we will confirm the impaired placental mitophagy in GDM women which is
mediated by BNIP3 (Aim 1), then we will investigate the role of BNIP3 dependent mitophagy pathway in the
development of GDM in a mouse model with trophoblast specific knockout of Bnip3 (Aim 2). Using this unique
mouse GDM model, we will investigate the onset and progression of T2D in offspring (Aim 3). Taken together,
the proposed studies, for the first time, model the vicious cycle between maternal GDM and GDM predisposed
adult metabolic diseases by manipulating the placental mitophagy but not interfering with other maternal organs,
and thus, providing powerful platform in the mechanistic studies on GDM and T2D, helping develop novel means
for the prevention and treatment of these diseases, and breaking the vicious cycle of diabetes and pregnancy."

Our long-term research goals are to understand the mechanisms that regulate stem cell fate decisions. In this
first renewal application of this award, we propose to pursue the regulation of self-renewal and lineage potential
of the developmentally restricted hematopoietic stem cells (drHSCs) that we discovered in the current award
period. Although this population fulfills the most stringent criteria for functional HSC, their life-span during normal
development is restricted to a limited developmental window. A functional HSC that does not persist into
adulthood had never been observed before and therefore defines a novel wave of definitive hematopoiesis with a
distinct endpoint. Here, we focus on understanding the contradictory regulation of drHSC self-renewal and
multipotency: upon transplantation, drHSC self-renewal is induced, whereas their intrinsic lineage bias is
preserved. Amazingly, the latter â lymphoid bias and exceptional B1a reconstitution potential â is maintained
over many months even upon the repeated stress of serial transplantation. In contrast, a single, short-term
exposure to stress induces the ability of drHSCs to persist long-term. We propose to pursue the epigenetic
mechanisms governing this paradox. We will perform comprehensive molecular and cellular comparisons of
drHSCs, co-existing fetal liver HSCs, and adult HSCs, and pursue rigorous functional analysis in competitive
reconstitution assays. Importantly, we will couple single-cell transcriptional profiles with functional HSC capacity
in efficient yet rigorous in vivo assays. Using CRISPRi/a-mediated transcriptional manipulation, we will directly
test the requirements for reprogramming HSC self-renewal and lineage potential in vivo. Our transgenic models
are uniquely suited for understanding how the core properties of HSCs â self-renewal and multilineage potential -
are established during development and maintained for life and we are excited to put these powerful tools to
work to pioneer developmental hematopoietic fate decisions."

Macronutrients serve a multitude of roles beyond provision of energy, with numerous nutrients and/or their
downstream metabolites acting as signaling molecules to coordinate cellular metabolism and function. Indeed,
numerous nutrient sensing pathways (e.g. mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins) have evolved allowing us to respond to
specific nutrients/metabolites, which in turn impacts healthspan. Sirtuins are largely thought to be driven by
redox, whereby high levels of NAD, a cofactor in the sirtuin reaction and indicator of low energy charge, drives
sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation of target proteins. SIRT1, the most-studied sirtuin, is a key nutrient sensing node
that regulates a plethora of cellular functions to promote lifespan extension and healthy aging. As a result,
there is immense interest in the use of SIRT1 activating compounds (STACs) to prevent or treat a wide range
of aging-related disease. The links between dietary macronutrients, nutrient sensing and healthspan have
historically focused upon caloric or protein restriction with limited attention given to dietary lipids. However, a
small and growing body of literature has linked monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) to improved healthspan.
In addition to positive effects on lifespan and healthy aging in model organisms, dietary MUFAs have been
linked to wide-ranging health benefits in epidemiological studies and, since they are a primary constituent of
olive oil, thought to contribute to the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Despite these studies, little is known
about the biological underpinnings through which MUFAs elicit their beneficial health effects. We have
previously shown that lipid droplet catabolism (i.e. lipolysis) increases SIRT1 and downstream PGC-1a/PPAR-
a signaling as a means to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and function during times of nutrient deprivation.
Our preliminary data show for the first time that MUFAs released specifically from lipolysis are trafficked to the
nucleus where they allosterically activate SIRT1 towards select acetylated peptide substrates. This discovery
makes MUFAs the first-known endogenous allosteric activators of SIRT1. Moreover, we show that MUFAs
activate SIRT1 through a similar mechanism to resveratrol suggesting that MUFA signaling may modulate the
response to exogenous SIRT1 activators. Based on these preliminary data, the objective of this application is
to further characterize the role of MUFAs as endogenous SIRT1 activators. We hypothesize that MUFAs
selectively activate SIRT1 to modulate the response to numerous dietary interventions known to impact
healthspan. To test our objective, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To define how MUFAs modulate
SIRT1 substrate selectivity. Aim 2: To characterize the SIRT1-dependent effects of MUFAs/olive oil on
healthspan. Aim 3: To determine the contribution of MUFAs in mediating the response to STACs or caloric
restriction. Upon completion of the proposes studies, we will have further expanded our understanding of
SIRT1 biology allowing for refined approaches to activate SIRT1 to promote healthy aging."

Despite being a pressing human health problem, very little has been done thus far to develop specific
therapeutics against Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) infection and its associated
diseases. Interestingly, the KSHV genome carries a viral homolog of cellular G-protein coupled
receptor (GPCR). As essential mediators of cell signaling, GPCRs are involved in nearly all aspects
of human biology. Their clinical relevance is thus underscored by the fact that 30-40% of all FDA
approved drugs target GPCRs. The KSHV GPCR (vGPCR) is essential for virus-mediated
oncogenesis: its expression is sufficient to transform cells in vitro and induce tumor formation in vivo.
The fact that vGPCR plays a key role in KSHV oncogenesis and that it is a member of protein family
frequently targeted by FDA-approved drugs makes vGPCR a promising target for therapeutic
intervention. We will use biochemical methods and signaling assays to understand structural insight
of vGPCR and to develop novel therapeutic nanobodies for inhibiting the oncogenic function of
vGPCR."

 In an SBIR Phase II, we developed an improved polio vaccine candidate, primarily for use
in the post-eradication era. We call the candidate, ultraIPVTM, because it is produced using a UVC-
inactivation method. UltraIPVTM has major improvements compared to existing IPV products,
such as IPOL (Sanofi) and VeroPol (Staten Serum Institute). The ultraIPVTM technology is
compatible with attenuated virus strains which reduce biosafety and biosecurity concerns during
manufacturing. The method is rapid and simple; only 30 seconds of UVC exposure is required for
inactivation. The UVC-inactivation process causes less amino acid degradation in protective
epitopes, which results in more vaccine units per milligram of virus allowing more doses per batch
with reduced costs per dose. Finally, the product is stable through multiple freeze-thaw cycles,
which bodes well for long-term storage in national stockpiles. In this SBIR Phase IIB, we propose
to complete critical non-clinical development activities for the trivalent ultraIPVTM. These
activities include manufacturing scale-up, GLP animal studies of safety and immunogenicity, and
IND application submission to prepare for clinical trials. We have assembled a team of subject
matter experts with the necessary experience to advance ultraIPVTM through the IND process and
beyond. For this product, we have several development avenues ready post-IND, including early-
stage interest from potential licensees."

Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent and costly chronic diseases worldwide. Hypertension and
nondipping blood pressure (BP) are prevalent comorbidities of type 2 diabetes and significant risk factors for
detrimental cardiovascular outcomes. While up to 75% of diabetic patients are nondippers, no effective therapy
targets nondipping BP in diabetes. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are a class of
recently FDA-approved anti-diabetic drugs that provide exciting new means for the critical but challenging task
of managing cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. The use of GLP-1RAs increased rapidly due to their
recently recognized cardiovascular benefits, including lowering BP in addition to effectively reducing HbA1C
and body weight. However, whether GLP-1RA influences nondipping BP in diabetes is scarcely studied, and
the mechanisms via which GLP-1RA lowers BP remain to be defined. Our preliminary data demonstrate for the
first time that a short-acting GLP-1RA, exenatide (Ex), when injected i.p. into type 2 diabetic db/db mice at the
beginning of the inactive phase (ZT0, light on time), effectively restored nondipping BP to normal dipping BP.
In contrast, when administered at the beginning of the active dark phase (ZT12, light off time), Ex worsened
nondipping BP to reversed dipping (most harmful disruption). Our preliminary data also show for the first time
that GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) mRNA varies with the time of day and is regulated by clock gene BMAL1.
Interestingly, we also found that Ex administrated at ZT0 or ZT12 restored or inverted food intake rhythm in
db/db mice in parallel with its effects on BP. Together with our recent publication that demonstrated time-
restricted feeding effectively prevents and treats nondipping BP via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in
diabetic db/db mice and literature evidence that the vagus nerve links food intake to modulation of BP, we
hypothesize that GLP-1RA administered at ZT0 inhibits food intake, vagus nerve, and SNS via the GLP-1
receptor and its cross-talk with clock BMAL1, thus protecting BP circadian rhythm in type 2 diabetes. Two
specific aims are Aim 1. Investigate GLP-1RA as a novel chronomedicine to protect BP circadian rhythm via
inhibiting food intake in type 2 diabetes. Aim 2. Define the mechanism by which GLP-1RA protects BP
circadian rhythm in type 2 diabetes. To achieve these goals, we will determine the effects of short-acting GLP-
1RA Ex and long-acting GLP-1RA liraglutide administered at ZT0 or ZT12 on the circadian rhythms of
metabolism, food intake, clock genes, SNS, and BP in diabetic db/db, db/db-Per2Luc, Bmal1-iKO, Glp1r-KO,
brain-specific Glp1r-KO, and vagal neuron-specific Glp1r-KO mice under various feeding regimens. The
proposed studies will provide novel pre-clinical evidence suggesting GLP-1RA serves as a novel
chronomedicine targeting the nondipping BP in type 2 diabetes, thus improving prognoses and outcomes of
diabetic patients. Furthermore, results from the proposed studies will shed new light on how GLP-1RAs lower
BP, thus laying a foundation for optimizing GLP-1RA therapy for diabetic patients."
10850207,"Project 8 Abstract
The sinoatrial node is the origin of organized and rhythmic electrical depolarizations in the heart. After leaving
the sinoatrial node, depolarizations spread throughout the atrium and ventricles via the atrio-ventricular node
and specialized conduction pathways to initiate excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes. This highly
organized pattern of events is critical for blood to be pumped throughout the pulmonary and systemic
circulations. Therefore, the sinoatrial node is critical for the initiation of each cardiac cycle. To sustain the
constant diastolic spontaneous depolarizations in the sinoatrial node, blood is delivered to the node via the
right coronary artery. Although many groups have investigated the mechanisms responsible for nodal
pacemaking, we continue to have a very limited understanding of how blood flow is regulated in the sinoatrial
node during either resting or elevated physiological conditions (i.e., exercise). Adequate perfusion of the node
is critical since clinical evidence suggests that damage or blockage of the sinoatrial nodal artery is pro-
arrhythmogenic. Previous studies indicate that there are differences in microvascular density between the
superior and inferior regions of the sinoatrial node, however the significance of this is unclear. The overarching
goal of this project is to determine how blood flow is regulated during sympathetic nervous system activation
and how this regulation is affected during disease such as heart failure. First, we plan to investigate the spatial
relationship between sympathetic nerves and cell types involved in mediating vascular resistance (i.e.,
vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and pericytes) to determine where the effects of sympathetic
activation are mediated. Next, we will isolate microvasculature from the sinoatrial node and elucidate the effect
of sympathetic activation to determine whether the superior and inferior sinoatrial node artery responds
differentially to nerve activation. Lastly, we will investigate how heart failure in the mouse causes changes in
the microvascular density and response to sympathetic stimulation. This project will serve as a basis for future
studies by dissecting the key components of blood flow regulation in the sinoatrial node."

Extracellular matrix (ECM) is the most abundant biomaterial in the body. During cardiac development, the ECM
plays critical roles in the formation of shapes and patterns of the heart such as chambers and trabeculae through
elaborate interactions with differentiating cells. Although problems in ECM-cell interactions can lead to heart
diseases, signaling pathways activated by the specific ECM components are still poorly understood. We recently
succeeded in developing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac organoids (iPSC-COs) that can
recapitulate cardiogenesis. In this multi-PI R01 proposal, our team will further elucidate the mechanisms of ECM-
cell interactions that influence cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. We will apply machine learning and
novel iPSC double reporter lines (Tbx5-Clover2-Nkx2.5-TagRFP) to elucidate the effect of cell composition on
morphogenesis of iPSC-COs (Aim 1). Afterwards, we will screen 36 different combinations of ECM compositions
that can reliably induce iPSC-CO formation using 8 additional iPSC lines for validation (Aim 2). By rigorously
analyzing iPSC-COs made with optimized ECM using elastic property measurement and single-cell multiomics,
we will elucidate the biological and physical effects associated with ECM signaling and mechanotransduction at
single-cell resolution (Aim 3). In summary, understanding the exact role and mechanism of ECM-cell interactions
may contribute to finding new biomaterials or therapeutic modalities for treatment of heart diseases."

The UCSF Graduate Program in Biological and Medical Informatics (BMI) is seeking to further develop its train-
ing program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The program focuses on training diverse students to
become scientific leaders at the interface between computation, statistics, and biology. The training plan for
coursework, enrichment activities, and research reflects the fundamentally collaborative culture at UCSF.
Thus, both the formal and informal features of the program have been designed to bring together students from
different disciplines and train them for team-based problem solving. Although the focus is on computational
research, students are also exposed to experimental biology in many aspects of their training including re-
search rotations and research-based coursework. As a result, our graduates understand the sources of their
data as well as how to manipulate it and are prepared to interact in multidisciplinary teams that require an un-
derstanding of both ""wet"" and ""dry"" scientific cultures. Our program has dramatically expanded our outreach
efforts to recruit a diverse and talented group of students with computational and quantitative backgrounds,
and have developed initiatives to foster a healthy community of inclusion and respect for students across all
intersections of individual identities. We stand with all students, and train them to tackle challenging problems
in biology at scales that span the molecular to the phenotypic. The hallmarks of our program include:
â Collaborative and inter-disciplinary research. Training faculty are heavily involved in collaborative research,
 both within and outside of UCSF. Many of their labs (and trainees) are involved in Consortia or Centers
 created to address problems that cannot be solved from a single viewpoint but require contributions from
 many disciplines. Student publications reflect this culture.
â An innovative and evolving curriculum. Our core values of collaboration and interdisciplinary research are
 instilled from day one in a âCommunity Weekâ, and continue in well-tested and new intensive project-based
 core courses designed to establish a common knowledge and language, and to foster team skills. A modu-
 lar panel of âselectivesâ addresses important knowledge gaps in statistics and computer/data science, in-
 herent in the diverse scientific backgrounds of our students. Current and new âmini coursesâ facilitate deep
 exploration of research topics in small groups with faculty experts, and allow the curriculum to adjust to cur-
 rent scientific developments, and in response to student and alumni feedback and program assessment.
â Intensive training in communication, and preparation for diverse careers. We emphasize training in key
 competencies needed in diverse careers in academia, industry, or the public sector, including oral and writ-
 ten presentation, communication, and teamwork skills. Students can participate in career preparation work-
 shops and internships, and many take on leadership roles in outreach and teaching. Our alumni include
 leaders in both academia and industry, including several who have started successful companies."

The tumor suppressor p53 is often referred to as the âguardian of the genomeâ. Mutations of the p53
gene occur in ~50% of human cancer and loss of p53 function is known to play a central role in tumor
progression and metastasis. Upon exposure to a stress signal, such as DNA damage, p53 transcription
factor is activated and then induces an array of pro-survival and pro-death genes. Due to its potent role
in tumor suppression, p53 is an attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. Nerve
injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1, NINJ1) and NINJ2 constitute the Ninjurin family of cell adhesion
molecules and have been implicated in various pathological processes such as immune response.
However, the role of NINJ1 and NINJ2 in tumorigenesis is unclear. We showed previously that NINJ1
is a target of p53 and in turn represses p53 mRNA translation. Thus, NINJ1 and p53 forms a negative
feedback loop. Notably, our pilot study showed that NINJ1 and NINJ2 interact with each other through
their N-terminal extracellular domains. We also found that like NINJ1, NINJ2 forms a negative
regulatory loop with p53. To determine the biological significance of the NINJ1-NINJ2-p53 loop, we
showed that: (1) loss of NINJ1 or NINJ2 inhibits cell migration and formation of tumor spheres and
colonies in breast cancer cells and promote cellular senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in a p53-
dependent manner; (2) mice deficient in Ninj1 or Ninj2 are prone to chronic inflammation, which is
likely due to enhanced pyroptosis through wild-type p53-dependent activation of NLRP3
inflammasome; (3) two small peptides, called Pep-1A and Pep-2A derived from N-terminal alpha helix
domain of NINJ1 and NINJ2 protein were able to disrupt the formation of NINJ1-NINJ2 complex and
elicit growth suppression. These observations prompt us to hypothesize that both NINJ1 and NINJ2
play a critical role in tumorigenesis through the p53 pathway. To test this, we will determine: (1) the
feedback regulatory loops between NINJ1 and NINJ2 and between p53 and the Ninjurin family; (2) the
biological significance of the NINJ1-NINJ2-p53 loop in tumor suppression; (3) whether the Ninj1-
Ninj2-p53 loop can be targeted to kill tumor cells carrying wild-type p53."

In the U.S. alone, up to 26 million people have chronic kidney disease, over 460,000 people are on dialysis, and
100,000 people await kidney transplants with 3,000 new patients added monthly. Given the growing lack of
transplantable organs, patients typically require renal replacement therapies that themselves lead to substantial
morbidity and mortality. We posit that biomanufactured kidney tissues, and ultimately, organs may offer an
important solution to this growing problem. Indeed, recent protocols in developmental biology are unlocking the
potential for stem cells to undergo differentiation and self-assembly to form âmini-organsâ, known as organoids.
Kidney organoids exhibit remarkable tissue microarchitectures with high cellular density and heterogeneity akin
to their in vivo counterparts. To bridge the gap from these kidney organoid building blocks (OBBs) to therapeutic
organs, integrative approaches that combine bottom-up organoid assembly with top-down bioprinting are
needed. While it is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine how either organoids or bioprinting alone would fully
replicate the complex multiscale features required for kidney function â their combination could provide an
enabling foundation for de novo organ manufacturing. To generate 3D functional kidney tissues ex vivo for
potential transplantation, our highly collaborative research team will undertake two primary aims. In Specific Aim
1, we will create kidney organoids enhanced by multilineage induction that display functional differentiation of
nephrons. We will produce iPSC-derived kidney organoids and subject them to fluid flow during their
differentiation and maturation on an adherent extracellular matrix (ECM). Through multilineage induction, we will
also induce collecting duct cells that self-assemble and structurally bridge other tubular nephron segments. We
will evaluate the effects of mimicking kidney organogenesis on kidney organoid structure and function using
microperfusion and micropuncture methods. In Specific Aim 2, we will create 3D functional kidney tissues
composed of these optimized kidney OBBs with embedded macrochannels produced by bioprinting that serve
as both vascular and urinary output conduits. We will first produce a densely cellular, tissue matrix composed of
kidney OBBs that facilitates bioprinting of embedded macrochannels. We will then establish connections
between the printed macrochannels embedded in this OBB-laden matrix and the self-assembled microvascular
and collecting duct networks within individual OBBs. Finally, we will assess the glomerular filtration, tubular
maturation, and primitive urinary production of these 3D kidney tissues. If successful, our proposed project will
provide a foundational advance in kidney organ engineering for potential renal therapeutic applications."

Background: The 2,800 local public health departments (LHDs) in the United States have been increasingly
responsible for implementing evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs) to prevent and control cancer in
their local communities, which has immense potential to impact population-level cancer burden. Our team has
developed effective strategies to support LHDs and their staff to implement EBPPs, including guided facilitation
and training, but the reach and sustainability of these strategies is currently limited. A promising strategy is for
LHDs to engage in an academic-public health department (AHD) partnership, in which LHD practitioners and
academics collaborate to improve public health practice and education through joint research projects and
education opportunities for students. However, research on how AHD partnerships should be structured to
improve implementation of cancer-related EBPPs is sparse.
Goal: This proposal seeks to understand how to leverage AHD partnerships to facilitate implementation of
EBPPs to prevent and control cancer.
Methods: Aim 1: We will survey an existing, nationwide network of AHD partnerships to identify 4 high- and 4
low-performing partnerships based on their implementation of cancer-related EBPPs. We will use qualitative
interviews and document reviews to refine our existing set of strategies, which can improve the use of EBPPs
(e.g., facilitation needed, defining a tailored AHD partnership âpackageâ), based on the structures, processes,
and contextual influences among successful partnerships. Aim 2: Building on Aim 1, we will test the
effectiveness of these refined strategies designed to improve the adoption of EBPPs for cancer prevention and
control by strengthening AHD partnerships. We will conduct a group-randomized study (total N=28 AHD
partnerships) to evaluate the effect of strategies to improve the adoption of cancer control and prevention
EBPPs by supporting AHD partnerships. A mixed-methods approach will be used to evaluate changes in AHD
partnerships and understand how contextual factors may have impacted the AHD partnershipâs ability to
support EBPP implementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1 and 2 to LHD
practitioners and academic partners to support cancer prevention and control in LHDs.
Innovations and impact: The proposed study is innovative and impactful because it will be first study to focus
on local-level collaborations that leverage expertise of LHDs and academics to improve public health practice.
Also, its application of bridging factors, a component of the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and
Sustainment (EPIS) framework receiving a greater focus recently, will contribute to the application of emerging
components of theoretical frameworks in dissemination and implementation research. Last, this study
examines new models for how public practice and academic public health can work together to meet common
goals sustainably, i.e., without ongoing support from outside researchers."

Abstract
The twin pandemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and COVID-19 share uncanny similarities with
respect to racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in both incidence and mortality. Structural strategies for
HIV and COVID-19 outcomes could augment current agent-based (individual-level) interventions by
addressing those factors that limit a person's ability to carry out risk reduction, as well as address transmission
among people not easily reached by agent-based interventions. The primary objectives of this study are: (a)
to identify modifiable community-level influences on gender, racial/ethnic, and rural/urban disparities in HIV
and COVID-19 outcomes among people with HIV; and (b) to develop policy and programmatic
recommendations to address these community-level influences. The proposed study will use individual-level
2017-2023 Florida HIV/AIDS surveillance data linked to individual-level 2020-2023 Florida COVID-19
surveillance data. Linked HIV and COVID-19 data will be merged with 10 additional census tract- and county-
level community data for Florida. Using a mix of complex analytical approaches and guided by ecosocial theory
and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities research framework, we propose to
examine community factors that impact health disparities across 5 domains of influence: (1) biological, (2)
behavioral, (3) physical/built environment, (4) sociocultural environment, and (5) health care system.
Additionally, the proposed study will convene a strategic planning workgroup of HIV leaders across Florida to
develop recommendations to address community influences of HIV and COVID-19 disparities among people
with HIV. We propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Estimate the moderating effect of community factors on the
association between gender, race/ethnicity, and rural/urban residence and both differences (from pre-COVID-
19 [2017-2019] to the acute period of the COVID-19 Pandemic [2020]) and trajectories (from pre-COVID-19
[2017-2019] through the evolving periods of the COVID-19 Pandemic [2020-2023]) in HIV outcomes among
people with HIV. Aim 2. Estimate the moderating effect of community factors on the association between
gender, race/ethnicity, and rural/urban residence and COVID-19 outcomes during the acute (2020) and
evolving (2020-2023) periods of the COVID-19 Pandemic among people with HIV. Aim 3. Develop policy and
programmatic recommendations to address community influences of gender, racial/ethnic, and rural/urban
disparities in HIV and COVID-19 outcomes among people with HIV. Findings from this study will provide a
novel understanding of the impact of community context on COVID-19 and HIV disparities among people with
HIV, as well as develop an actionable plan to protect vulnerable populations of people with HIV and support
the goals of Ending the HIV Epidemic in the COVID-19 era. This study further supports NIH's 2021-2025
research priority areas of studying HIV comorbidities and syndemics, and of focusing on community and social-
structural factors influencing inequities in HIV outcomes."

There is a critical need to identify the molecular signatures that can define cell states and predict disease
progression in C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9ALS/FTD) at
a systems level. This P01 application proposes to investigate c9ALS/FTD pathomechanisms that can inform
new therapeutic targets and identify biomarkers for diagnosing and prognosticating disease. Functional
genomics approaches such as those taken in Projects 1-3 will generate hundreds of thousands of data points
requiring sophisticated analytical methods for their biological interpretation. The adoption of network-based
approaches has been a natural step as most biological systems can be accurately modeled and represented
using these methods. The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core (Core D) will therefore support
investigators in developing strategies for multi-omics data analysis and data integration of transcriptomic and
proteomic data generated in Projects 1-3, and in applying additional state of the art data analytics to individual
projects. Core D will also continue to assist Projects 1 and 3 by performing power analysis to address sample
sizes as described in the proposed projects. In addition, Core D will promote uniform standards for data
reporting through a common data dictionary and a web server to enable data exchange among the
investigators. Specifically, Core D will work with investigators across Projects 1-3 and Cores B and C to
develop a standardized set of descriptors and parameters appropriate for data harmonization and standard
formats for raw and processed data. The Specific Aims are the following: Specific Aim 1. Provide a
framework for standardized data-sharing and analyses of transcriptomics and proteomics studies. To
provide infrastructure and harmonization among all projects, Core D will: 1) design and maintain a web-portal
on a secure web server; 2) work with investigators to develop a standardized set of descriptors and parameters
appropriate for data harmonization; and 3) perform power analysis to justify sample size and assist with
statistical modeling of clinical information with confounding variables. Specific Aim 2. Construct multi-scale
gene/protein networks and integrate with single-cell transcriptomics to identify core networks altered
in c9ALS/FTD. To support bioinformatic analyses for all Projects, Core D will carry-out data integration.
Specific Aim 3. Prioritize networks and bioinformatically validate the transcriptomic and proteomic
discoveries by integrating with external published and unpublished datasets. To prioritize key drivers of
c9ALS and bioinformatically validate the findings, Core D will: 1) develop and implement bioinformatic
approaches to validate major findings of the Projects with multiple datasets encompassing human
neurodegenerative disease cases and corresponding mouse models; and 2) define core regulators of c9ALS
by integrating multi-dimensional data generated in Projects 1-3."
10861000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common human cancer worldwide. Approximately 30%
of the oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) progress to OSCC, a process that may have a multifocal origin and can
be promoted by carcinogens such as those found in tobacco. Our long-term goal is to identify the genetic
alterations that promote high risk of progression to OPLs and to determine how those alterations modulate the
response of OPLs to preventive strategies. The TP53 gene (also known as p53) and CDKN2A are the most
frequently mutated genes in oral cancer, also found altered in OPLs. p53 GOF mutations and genomic alterations
that result in loss of the CDKN2A gene associate with âcoldâ immune microenvironments in OPLs and OSCCs,
with high risk of progression to carcinoma, and with extremely poor outcomes in OSCC patients. We hypothesize
that the early appearance of mutations in p53 and CDKN2A inactivation modulate the oral tissue
microenvironment and predispose OPLs to progress to OSCC. To test this hypothesis we will study mouse models
that develop OPLs upon exposure to the tobacco-surrogate 4NQO, in the presence of p53 and/or CDKN2A
mutations. Patients with high-risk OPLs could benefit from preventive strategies designed to block the malignant
progression of OPLs. However, previous attempts with different chemopreventive agents have not been
successful. Recently, immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies directed at programmed cell death protein 1
(PD-1) has been shown to improve the survival of patients with advanced OSCC in clinical trials, confirming the
importance of the immune system in containing progression of invasive tumors. Moreover, our previous studies,
confirmed by multiple independent groups, demonstrated that anti-PD-1 antibodies can also prevent the
progression of OPLs to OSCC, in a 4NQO mouse model for oral carcinogenesis. Our preliminary studies indicate
that the p53 and CDKN2A status of the OPLs may determine the response to anti-PD-1-mediated
immunoprevention. In this proposal, we will assess the long-term benefits of anti-PD-1-mediated oral cancer
prevention, to determine whether PD-1 blockade, administered in a preventive setting, can confer survival
benefits, and to assess how p53 and CDKN2A mutations affect the sustained response to PD-1 blockade. To
overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 we hypothesize that reactivation of p53 in OPLs carrying p53 mutations
sensitizes the oral lesions to anti-PD-1. Our mouse models will allow us to test this hypothesis in vivo."

Our data indicate that kidney resident macrophages (KRM) promote cystic kidney disease in multiple mouse
models and that a similar population of KRM are present in humans suggesting that targeting these cells in
patients with cystic kidney disease may have significant therapeutic benefits. However, it is not feasible to give
patients KRM targeted inhibitors for long periods as these inhibitors deplete resident macrophages in multiple
tissues, where their presence is required for basic biological functions including recycling red blood cells and
fighting off infections. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of cystic kidney disease as patients
experience periods of intermittent cyst growth over several decades. These data highlight the fact that a tissue
specific approach to deplete KRM is desperately needed. In this application, we are proposing to study niche
filling as a means to developing a tissue specific approach for long-term resident macrophage depletion.
However, before we can accomplish this goal, we must first understand the mechanism of niche filling after
temporary depletion, genes that are required for this process, and the influence of temporary depletion on long-
term cyst growth. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Cx3cr1 is required for monocyte-
dependent niche filling and cyst progression. This hypothesis will be tested using a monocyte-specific fate
mapping mouse to track monocyte recruitment and engraftment into the KRM niche after depletion in both wild
type and cystic mice. In subsequent aims, we will identify genes that are required for this process and test the
idea that we can target a candidate gene, Cx3cr1, to delay KRM niche filling and slow cystic disease. Based on
our exciting preliminary data, we propose that targeting Cx3cr1 may lead to a kidney specific approach for long-
term resident macrophage depletion. This would have major impact on the cystic kidney disease field as well as
any field in which KRM are involved in disease progression. This includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney
diseases, both of which are a major healthcare burden.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is populated by a dense and diverse microbiota that impacts
human health. Although the microbiota composition at the species level for each individual is
unique as a fingerprint, its composition at the phyla level is more conserved. The predominant
phyla are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, followed by Proteobacteria. The gut microbiota has
been largely regarded as a resistance barrier towards enteric pathogens. However, the enteric
pathogens that cause infectious colitis, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 and
Citrobacter rodentium (extensively used as a surrogate EHEC model for murine infections,
given that EHEC does not infect mice), exploit cues and nutrients made available by members
of the microbiota to regulate their virulence program. They sense several metabolites, including
sugar sources such as fucose, and organic acids such as succinate to gauge the GI
biogeography and precisely regulate their virulence programs. The EHEC Cra/KdpE/FusR
signaling cascade plays a crucial role in this regulation. The relationship between EHEC and
different members of the microbiota varies. Our studies using a representative member of each
of the main phyla, Bacteroides thetatiotaomicron (Bacteroidetes), Enterococcus faecalis
(Firmicutes) and commensal E. coli (Proteobacteria) suggest that EHEC virulence expression
varies in response to these commensals, as well as to different combinations of them. In this
grant proposal we aim to address how different minimal microbiota compositions impact enteric
infections. These studies will build from reductionist to holistic approaches to delve into
mechanistic aspects of pathogen-microbiota-host interactions. It is notable that these studies
will also be relevant to other enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica and Clostridium
difficile, among others, which share several of these pathogen-microbiota interaction strategies
with EHEC. Hence the specific aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. Investigate the impact
of different members of the microbiota in EHECâs Cra/KdpE/FusR signaling cascade. Specific
Aim 2. Investigate the impact of different microbiota compositions on EHEC infection of
enteroids. Specific Aim 3. Investigate the impact of different microbiotas in C. rodentium murine
infections."
10861003,"Many of the 2.8 million family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with advanced cancer are underserved,
particularly African-Americans and rural-dwellers in the Southern U.S.. Most have poor access and awareness
of community-based palliative care services and have received no formal support or training despite providing
assistance to their relatives an average of 8 hrs/day. Providing intense care and witnessing a close friend or
family member struggle with advanced cancer can result in FCGs experiencing marked distress, particularly as
their care recipients near end of life (EOL). Reports from NCI and NINR caregiving summits, systematic
reviews, and the National Academy of Medicine have highlighted major limitations of cancer caregiver
interventions, including a lack of attention to underserved populations and cost, poor scalability, over reliance
on highly-trained professionals (e.g., nurses, psychologists, behavioral therapists), lengthy sessions over a
short duration, and a lack of demonstrated impact on patient outcomes and healthcare utilization. To address
this gap, we have developed and tested feasibility and acceptability of a lay navigator-led early palliative care
intervention called ENABLE Cornerstone for rural and minority family caregivers of persons with advanced
cancer in the Southern U.S.. Evolving out of our prior trials and community stakeholder formative evaluation
work, this multicomponent intervention is based on Pearlinâs Stress-Health Process Model where lay
navigators, overseen by an interdisciplinary outpatient palliative care team, employ health coaching techniques
and caregiver distress screening to behaviorally activate and reinforce psychoeducation on managing stress
and coping, getting and asking for help, improving caregiving skills, and decision-making/advance care
planning over 6 brief in-person/telephonic sessions plus monthly follow-up from diagnosis through early
bereavement. This proposed hybrid type I randomized effectiveness-implementation trial will determine
whether ENABLE Cornerstone compared to usual care can improve family caregiver (Aim 1) and patient
outcomes (Aim 2) and will evaluate implementation costs, cost effectiveness and healthcare utilization (Aim
3), over 24 weeks with 294 family caregivers and their patients with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer. To
maximize recruitment, we will recruit from two community cancer centers in Birmingham, AL and Mobile, AL.
Our theory-driven, standardized approach is innovative because it uses lay navigators in collaboration with a
palliative care interdisciplinary team to promote caregiver activation, skills and knowledge enhancement, as
opposed to other difficult-to-implement intervention models that rely mostly on delivery of services by advanced
practice professionals providing lengthy sessions over a short duration. If effectiveness is established, the
ENABLE Cornerstone intervention offers a highly scalable and reproducible model of formal caregiver support
that would be primed for dissemination and implementation."

Neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation is a multi-step process mediated by the interactions between
several receptors and ligands. Although the major receptors and ligands mediating neutrophil-endothelial cell
interactions have been identified, it remains poorly understood how receptor-ligand interactions are regulated
under inflammatory conditions. This project will provide novel fundamental knowledge of how neutrophil surface-
localized ERO1Î±-thiol isomerase complexes target allosteric disulfide bonds in different surface receptors and
promote the ligand-binding function under inflammatory conditions. Our preliminary data demonstrated that
neutrophil surface-bound ERp57 and PDI cooperatively and distinctly regulate the process of neutrophil
recruitment and extracellular ERO1Î± coordinates this regulatory mechanism. Using biochemical, cellular, and in
vivo studies with novel blocking antibodies, peptides and mouse models, we will test the hypothesis that two
structurally-similar thiol isomerases, ERp57 and PDI and their oxidase ERO1Î± facilitate modification of allosteric
disulfide bonds in different surface molecules and enhance neutrophil adhesive function, contributing to tissue
damage under thromboinflammatory conditions. In Aim 1, we will determine how PDI and ERp57 distinctly
regulate the adhesive function of different neutrophil receptors. Also, we will test whether extracellular ERO1Î±
controls the activity of those thiol isomerases. In Aim 2, we will test how inflammatory environments influence
the function of extracellular PDI, ERp57 and ERO1Î±. In Aim 3, using in vivo live imaging techniques, we will
study the pathological roles of extracellular PDI, ERp57 and ERO1Î± in intravascular cell-cell interactions and
tissue damage in thromboinflammation. Our studies will provide insights into novel molecular and cellular
mechanisms of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions, which can be used to design new strategies for the
treatment of thromboinflammatory disease."
10861010,"The spliceosome is a collection of protein and non-coding RNA subunits, interacting to bind, cleave, and
ligate RNA. Alternative splicing can contribute to cancer development through the expression of novel
protein isoforms. Oncogenic driver genes that modulate splicing arise from mutations, over-expression, and
chromosomal translocations in leukemias, carcinomas, and sarcomas. EWS-FLI1 is one such oncogenic
fusion protein derived from a tumor-specific chromosomal translocation in Ewing sarcoma (ES). Previous
investigations have described the modulation of transcription by EWS-FLI1 and connected transcription with
its oncogenic potential, yet some mutants that do not bind DNA still have oncogenic activity. This suggests
EWS-FLI1 has oncogenic capacity outside of transcriptional regulation. We have found that EWS-FLI1
interacts with spliceosomal proteins and significantly alters the isoform landscape in ES. Others have shown
some splicing factors are critical for EWS-FLI1 oncogenesis. Yet, the contribution of splicing to ES
oncogenesis as well as the role of EWS-FLI1-interacting proteins in the spliceosome, remain unknown.
EWS-FLI1 was often termed an `undruggable' target. To develop alternative strategies for therapeutic
targeting of EWS-FLI1, we identified compounds that directly bind to EWS-FLI1 and inhibit its interaction
with specific partners. In 2009 we reported one such compound, named YK-4-279, that blocks the EWS-
FLI1 binding to a key protein partner. ES cells treated with YK-4-279 show altered splicing patterns that
mimic EWS-FLI1 loss. An analog of YK-4-279, TK216, is now in phase I clinical trials in ES patients. We
therefore hypothesize that regulation of RNA splicing of a small number of critical genes is a rate-
limiting oncogenic mechanism of EWS-FLI1 in addition to its canonical role as a transcription
regulator. We focus this proposal on three aims. (1) We will determine the relative effects of EWS-FLI1
mutants on transcription and splicing through characterizing key domains and residues. We will then
determine the effects of these mutants on oncogenesis. (2) We will define interactions between EWS-FLI1
and splicing factors required for differential splicing. (3) We will investigate how EWS-FLI1-induced splice
isoform switching of target genes contributes to oncogenesis. We demonstrated that EWS-FLI1 induces
differential splicing of a number of target genes in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC); now we will
identify key domains and residues in EWS-FLI1 that induce differential splicing. Our approach will also
answer whether EWS-FLI1 creates de novo splice variants that are uniquely found in ES or whether EWS-
FLI1 is part of a pathway that leads to a spliceosome with novel splicing activities similar to those occurring
in myelodysplastic syndromes. Detailed knowledge of splicing drivers that are altered in specific tumors will
enhance our understanding of oncogenesis, lead to stratification markers for personalized medicine, and
inform approaches to new anti-cancer targets."

Microbial genes in gut and diseased tissues were recently linked with progression and outcomes of different
human diseases, including cancer and immune diseases. Deciphering the pathogenic roles of different microbial
genes can improve diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of human diseases. Yet, current methods for RNA
and shotgun metagenomic sequencing focus on microbial species, and do not allow a systematic detection or
quantification of microbial genes. Therefore, current methods for disease prognostication and biomarker
discovery are unable to consider microbial genes that influence human diseases. Our overarching hypothesis is
that there are unknown associations between human diseases and the microbial genes in diseased tissues and
in the gut. Our long-term goal is to unravel these associations using novel computational approaches that will
allow detection and quantification of microbial genes in diseases. In Aim 1 we will develop methods that harness
RNA sequencing to detect microbial gene expression in diseased tissues. This will allow microbial biomarker
discovery and provide a comprehensive database of the microbial genes that are expressed in various human
tissues and conditions. In Aim 2 we will develop methods to quantify gut microbial gene capacity in human
diseases. This will allow identification of gut microbial proteins, peptides, and domains that are important in
human diseases, to ultimately yield new diagnostic and treatment strategies based on gut microbiomes. Overall,
this project will provide innovative methods to allow detection and quantification of microbial genes from
abundantly used sequencing technologies. We will establish user friendly software and databases, allowing new
discoveries with existing sequencing platforms. We expect that the methods developed through this project will
be extensively adopted by the relevant research communities, improving our understanding of the roles of
microbes in human diseases and ultimately allowing the development of new disease detection and intervention
strategies based on microbial genes."
10858615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and incurable brain tumor. The inter-patient and intra-tumoral
heterogeneity of GBM, resulting from genetic alterations and epigenetic plasticity, poses a major challenge in its
treatment. GBM IDH-wt tumors are composed by different proportions of transcriptionally defined cell states,
which although resemble neurodevelopmental cell types, are highly plastic and interconvertible -rather than
hierarchic- as we and others have shown. This suggests the presence of a core regulatory logic that enables
toggling among different transcriptional states, endowing GBM tumors with increased phenotypic plasticity and
fitness. Here, we aim to unravel core regulatory modules that are critical for GBM programs with a particular
focus on enhancers, which together with transcription factors govern cell-state specific programs. Enhancer
dysregulation by genetic variants and epigenetic mechanisms is increasingly appreciated as a key process in
oncogenic transformation and drug resistance. However, dissecting and modulating enhancer function remains
very challenging due to the large number of putative enhancers and the complex ways they control their target
genes in the context of the three-dimensional (3D) genome. By constructing 3D enhancer-promoter interaction
networks in four patient-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and normal neuronal stem cells -as controls- we
have identified a subset of GSC-specific hyperconnected enhancers, which we coin ""3D regulatory hubsâ. 3D
hubs harbor genes with robust and coordinated transcriptional levels that enrich for oncogenic pathways and are
associated with worse patient outcomes. Importantly, epigenetic perturbation of a highly-recurrent enhancer hub
in GSCs resulted in concordant donwregulation of multiple hub-connected genes, leading into significant shifts
in the transcriptional states and altered clonogenic and proliferation capacities. Building on this foundational
work, we propose that de novo 3D regulatory hubs (established by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms)
lie in the core of GBM networks, where they connect and control multiple target genes, resulting in non-
linear effects on the transcriptional program and oncogenic behavior. To address this hypothesis, our
interdisciplinary team will combine advanced chromatin topology assays, computational modeling and network
analysis with state-of-the-art epigenetic engineering and proteomics tools as well as powerful ex vivo and in vivo
functional assays. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: (i) characterizing the inter-patient and intra-
tumoral heterogeneity of 3D regulatory networks and identifying conserved structures across patients and states,
(ii) predicting and targeting candidate central hubs and interrogating the molecular and functional consequences
and (iii) uncovering critical players of hub organization and unique vulnerabilities. The findings will provide
insights into enhancer-based reprogramming of cancer fate, opening new avenues for therapeutic targeting of
GBM and establishing a paradigm for identifying and prioritizing key enhancers and regulatory factors in
oncogenic programs.

The overarching goal of the proposed study is to better understand COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity in
immunocompromised individuals, particularly patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and other
musculoskeletal disorders. A paucity of data exists regarding vaccine safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, durability
and especially mechanisms of vaccine responses in AID patients, leading to an unmet need to elucidate these
critical mechanisms. We performed a âsystems vaccinologyâ study of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA
vaccine in 18 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), using multiple methods including single cell
profiling technologies. We showed vaccination was generally safe but led to minor disease flares in a subset of
patients. Vaccine efficacy, based on anti-spike IgG responses and pseudovirus neutralization assays for multiple
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), were highly variable and not fully explained by immunosuppressive
medications. Vaccine nonresponders (NR) had severely blunted induction of IFN-Î³, CXCL9, CXCL10, and
CXCL11 proteins following vaccine boost. SLE patients had universally lower frequency of CD8+ and CD4+
spike-specific T cells throughout the vaccination series. This R01 application proposes 3 aims. Aim 1 will enroll
an expanded SLE longitudinal COVID-19 vaccine cohort and a new SSc vaccine cohort. We will continue to
follow the SLE inception cohort to determine how their immune responses evolve with future COVID vaccines.
In parallel, we will enroll two new cohorts, one in SLE and the second in SSc, a disease which shares several
features including AAb, anti-cytokine AAbs (ACA), and lung and skin pathology. We will test the hypothesis that
immune mechanisms of vaccine responses will be shared between diseases, but that differences in autoreactive
B and T cell receptors, antibody repertoires, and innate immunity will be discovered. We will compare CTDs with
each other and with healthy people, across vaccine platforms (e.g., mRNA vaccines, protein vaccines, and DNA
vaccines) currently in development for COVID-19 prevention. Aim 2 will characterize adaptive immune responses.
We will characterize antibodies, T cells, and B cells. Antibodies will be measured using custom, bead-based
arrays for measurement of AAbs and ACA to ensure vaccines do not enhance secretion of existing or new AAb
after vaccination; and anti-viral IgG responses, including in vitro and pseudoviral functional blocking assays
against emerging VoC over time. B cell studies will include B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires and transcription
modules, and creation and analysis of recombinant monoclonal Ab (rMAb); T cell studies will include phenotyping
of virus-specific T cells using MHC Class I and II spheromers. T cell populations known to be associated with
AID, will be studied. Aim 3 will characterize COVID-19 vaccine responses in the innate immune compartment.
The role of innate immune cells will be explored using bulk-RNA-seq, measurement of plasma analytes using
âomicsâ technologies, and Epigenetic profiling by Time of Flight (EpiToF) to measure âinnate memoryâ. CITE-seq
will then be used to deeply phenotype innate immune cells from responders and NR."

Dramatic progress has been made in the fields of cell and developmental biology in recent years, largely due
to the application of new technical approaches to classical problems. This has led to a need for advanced
training in the models that have been important in making new discoveries, such as the African clawed frog
Xenopus. This grant proposal seeks to continue the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) short course on
the Cell & Developmental Biology of Xenopus, which has been taught annually at CSHL since 1993 as part
of an integrated portfolio of courses in a number of areas of modern biology. The CSHL Xenopus course
provides extensive laboratory exposure over a two week period to the biology and manipulation of embryos
from the species Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis, and in doing so prepares students for independent
research in the cell, genetic, and molecular analysis of vertebrate development. The course introduces the
unique attributes of Xenopus that allow the functional analysis of developmentally important genes, while at the
same time introducing the major technologies of modern molecular and cellular developmental biology in a
system that allows direct manipulation of embryos and visualization of developmental processes. It is
appropriate for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early-career investigators, for those who are
experienced Xenopus researchers as well as those seeking a versatile interdisciplinary animal model. The
course also provides a rich resource network that students can easily access after they have returned to their
home laboratories and initiated research projects using concepts learned in the course."

 The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how
they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are
characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only
for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation
has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting
and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called
âjumping genesâ). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain
critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. âjunk DNAâ), and their high
copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in
health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging.
In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between
males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity.
However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and
across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we
propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells),
and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group
will use a unique combination of âomicsâ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal
models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful
genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I
have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will
decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex-
chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of
transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic
tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as
a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to
prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation
landscapes.

 Platelet integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 is central to platelet activation, which occurs through highly complex molecular
interactions and structural alteration. Ultimately, Î±IIbÎ²3 matures its affinity for fibrinogen and von Willebrand
factor. Dysregulation in Î±IIbÎ²3 affinity maturation events causes Glanzmann's thrombasthenia or
thrombocytopenia. Therefore, fine-tuning these interactions through the Î±IIbÎ²3 receptor is a proven and effective
strategy for both therapeutic thrombotic pathology targeting and immunotherapy. Currently, there are no Î±IIbÎ²3
inhibitors for long-term clinical use, while current inhibitors for short-term use may cause serious
thrombocytopenia. The overall goal of our proposed research is to understand the molecular basis of the Î±IIbÎ²3
shapeshifting and the mechanochemistry of Î±IIbÎ²3 activation and inhibition by small molecules, including clinical-
drugs. Our guiding hypothesis is that multiple forms of Î±IIbÎ²3 exist in a dynamic conformational equilibrium that
is temporally and spatially regulated by cell signaling, association with the cytoskeleton, and interactions with
exocellular ligands. We will determine, for the first time, the single-particle cryoEM structure of intact Î±IIbÎ²3,
characterize structural transitions at the atomic level as they relate to physiological ligands (e.g., fibrinogen), and
determine the effects of clinically relevant antagonists on Î±IIbÎ²3 conformational equilibrium both in situ and in
vitro. All specific aims will elaborate integrin Î±IIbÎ²3 events at the molecular level pertaining to these objectives.
Aim 1 experiments will characterize shapeshifting structural changes of Î±IIbÎ²3 induced by ligands or clinical-
relevant drugs. We will investigate the kinetics of the conformational dynamics of the purified full-length Î±IIbÎ²3
using a single-particle cryoEM approach and wide-ranging biochemical techniques for the protein in solution.
Aim 2 experiments will study architectural changes in intact Î±IIbÎ²3 by probing its conformational states on the
cell surfaces using conformation-reporting mAbs and by directly solving in situ structures using cutting-edge
advanced cryoET imaging techniques. Collectively, our proposed studies will provide unique molecular insights
into structural and bidirectional signaling regulation of Î±IIbÎ²3, which will advance our understanding of integrin
biology and may identify new antagonists for modulating Î±IIbÎ²3 function."
10832660,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Human and murine lung development requires the coordinated efforts of the lung epithelium with the
surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), but the ECM-directed mechanisms that govern epithelial cell behavior
in the lung remain undefined. In epithelial tissues, integrins serve as receptors for the basement membrane
components collagen and laminins (LMs), with LMs being the most important ECM protein for lung
organogenesis. Lung epithelial cells bind to LMs through integrins Î±3Î²1, Î±6Î²1, and Î±6Î²4. Recent studies
reported that mutations in these integrins cause pulmonary hypoplasia or neonatal emphysema complicated by
abnormal airways, suggesting they play a major role in human developmental lung diseases.
 To investigate the role of LM-binding integrins, we generated lung epithelial specific integrin deletions.
Deletion of both the Î²1 and Î±6 subunits resulted in marked branching defects and early death. Deletion of Î±3
caused only minor airway branching disruption. Î²4 deficient mice exhibited normal branching but, surprisingly,
were also perinatal lethal. The Î²4 histological examination was notable for proteinaceous material filling the
airways and lack of cilia, similar to Î±6 deficient mice, suggesting their demise resulted from airway dysfunction.
 Pathway analysis of Î±6 deficient lung sequencing data revealed disruptions in BMP signaling, a critical
pathway for airway branching. BMP receptor expression was increased in Î±6-null epithelial cells, but BMP
target gene expression remained markedly reduced, implicating Î±6-containing integrins in regulation of the
BMP pathway in the fetal lung. Consistent with loss of cilia in Î²4 deficient mice, Î²4-null epithelial cells exhibited
reduced expression of transcription factors linked to MCC terminal differentiation. As a critical component of
hemidesmosomes, Î±6Î²4 controls tight adhesion to the basement membrane and connects with the
intracellular keratin intermediate filaments. Keratin also forms a support network apically for cilia, suggesting
that Î±6Î²4 regulates keratin organization critical for terminal differentiation of MCCs in the lung. Taken together,
these findings indicate that: 1) Î±6Î²1 is the principal integrin required for airway branching likely through BMP
signaling and 2) Î±6Î²4 regulates terminal differentiation of MCCs. Based on preliminary data, we propose the
hypothesis that Î±6-containing integrins are critical integrins for fetal lung development through
regulation of BMP signaling during airway branching and terminal differentiation of multi-ciliated
epithelial cells.
AIM 1: Determine the mechanisms whereby Î±6-containing integrins regulate lung branching
morphogenesis.
AIM 2: Define the mechanisms whereby Î±6-containing integrins regulate BMP signaling during fetal
lung development.
AIM 3: Identify the role of Î±6Î²4 integrin in airway epithelial cell differentiation."

10833507,"Summary/Abstract
 The trafficking of leukocytes from the blood stream to the sites of inflammation to find infectious agents
is a hallmark of the innate immune response. Neutrophils, myeloid leukocytes of the innate immune response,
are the so-called âfirst respondersâ and will rapidly traffic to the sites of inflammatory insult. Trafficking is
initiated by the leukocyte adhesion cascade, a well-characterized, stepwise sequence of events in which
blood borne immune cells tether, roll, firmly arrest, and migrate on the endothelium and then enter tissues to
perform immune cell functions. These events all occur within blood vessels, normally post-capillary venules,
where cells encounter high shear rates while interacting with and transmigrating through the endothelium.
 Recently, an interesting phenomenon wherein certain cells of hematopoietic origin â such as
lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells) as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) â will crawl
upstream, against the direction of flow, after arrest on surfaces that present the ligand intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Upstream migration is mediated by the Î²2 integrin, Î±LÎ²2, also known as Lymphocyte
Function-associated Antigen-1 (LFA-1), which binds to ICAM-1. Neutrophils express LFA-1, as well as an
additional receptor for ICAM-1, Macrophage-1 Antigen (Mac-1), which is upregulated when neutrophils are
activated. Our laboratory hypothesized that neutrophils could also be induced to crawl upstream on ICAM-1
if Mac-1 was disabled or blocked, allowing LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions to dominate. Our preliminary results
show that by either blocking MAC-1 (with an antibody) or by genetically manipulating Mac-1 (using CRIPSR-
Cas9 deletion), neutrophils can migrate upstream on ICAM-1 surfaces, setting the premise for this application.
 Here, we propose to determine the critical signals which govern the upstream migration of neutrophils,
how neutrophils generate force when migrating upstream, and identify the physiological implications of
upstream neutrophil migration. In Aim 1 we will determine the key molecular signals involved in upstream
migration in neutrophils, by first analyzing the differential signaling that occurs on ICAM-1 vs. VCAM-1
surfaces and then identify and delete the signals that operate downstream of LFA-1 and Mac-1 using CRISPR
editing. Specifically, we will focus on deleting the signals downstream of Mac-1/ICAM-1 binding to determine
the signals that inhibit neutrophil upstream migration. In Aim 2, we will measure and quantify the forces
generated by neutrophils engineered to migrate upstream using traction force microscopy. Using the
knockouts generated in aim 1, we will measure the differences in the spatial arrangement and magnitude of
force generation between upstream and downstream crawling neutrophils. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine
the physiological relevance of upstream migration in neutrophils by determining the change in time
needed for altered to transmigrate in vitro on endothelium and the differential trafficking of disabled neutrophils
into the peritoneal cavity in a murine model of acute inflammation."

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) can be a lethal disease that is often preceded by premalignant
lesions, making it is an ideal disease for screening initiatives. However, current screening protocols/tests cannot
reliably differentiate between inflammatory and premalignant dysplastic lesions. Further, the histologic diagnosis
of dysplasia is an imperfect predictor of malignant transformation as only ~15% of premalignant oral lesions
progress to cancer. Our long-term goals are to establish molecular-based diagnostic tests for prognostication
and screening that are capable of identifying high-risk patients most likely to progress to oral cancer but would
greatly benefit from closer surveillance and less morbid curative intent procedures. Our central hypothesis is that
premalignant lesions contain identifiable genetic mutations that can be used for reliable biopsy prognostication
(tissue biopsies) and screening (saliva). We will identify dysplasia-specific mutations underlying the
pathogenesis of OCSCC. We will validate the mutations identified in a retrospective case-cohort study of
dysplastic oral tissues with known clinical outcomes to investigate their potential as tissue-based prognostic
biomarkers. We will conduct a case-cohort study using saliva samples from five existing longitudinal population-
based United States cohorts to determine whether driver somatic mutations can be identified in saliva prior to
the diagnosis of oral cancer. These studies are conceptually innovative and likely to result in state-of-the-art risk
stratification and screening. They would be the first to define the functional driver mutations of oral
premalignancy. They would also be the first to determine if mutations in driver genes can be detected in saliva
prior to oral cancer diagnosis, to define the time-course of mutation detection, and to test the predictive ability of
identifying high-risk individuals with somatic mutations. They are technically innovative, as they evaluate the
diagnostic accuracy of a novel non-invasive molecular salivary screening platform. This research will benefit
human health by improving our ability to identify high-risk premalignant oral lesions likely to progress to cancer,
thereby allowing for earlier and potentially more curative interventions with limited morbidity and mortality."

Candida albicans is a fungal commensal organism that causes oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and
may disseminate systemically in immune compromised people. However, most healthy people have
oral
levels of C. albicans and it is a beneficial organism in the human gut microbiome. Mice infected with C.
albicans also have low numbers of oral fungi but have much higher numbers of
C. albicans in the gut so
that they are a good model to study what factors permit fungal tolerance at human mucosal sites.
C. albicans hyphae secrete the aspartyl protease Sap6 that mediates virulence in OPC, induces cytokine
release from oral epithelial cells, and initiates neutrophil recruitment. Oral infection by C. albicans in mice
caused recruitment of neutrophil âswarmsâ surrounding invading hyphae, as well as localized Arginase1
positive (Arg1+) granulocytic cells. These Arg1+ cells showed suppression of T cells thus identifying them
as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). MDSCs have a well-known immunosuppressive role in
cancer causing tumor immune evasion, but also have a major role in host immune responses to bacterial
and fungal infections by favoring pathogen persistence and chronic infection. We are the first to identify
MDSC recruitment upon C. albicans oral infection but we do not know their role here. C. albicans infection
resulted in changes the oral epithelium (Ep) including expression of kallikrein (KLK5) proteases
accompanying increased Ep desquamation, and increased levels of tissue Arginase 1 (Arg1). The Aims
of this project are to 1) Identify in what manner Arg1 and KLK5 expression in oral Ep alters C. albicans
infection by examining the effect of Arg1 and KLK5 depletion; 2) Determine how C. albicans induces
neutrophil swarming and recruitment of MDSCs in vitro by using live imaging of neutrophil swarming
induced by C. albicans and Sap6 and to measure fungicidal activity of MDSCs; and 3) Ascertain the
contribution of MDSCs in oral and gut Ca infection in vivo by comparing C. albicans infection in tongue
and intestine following MDSC depletion or adoptive transfer of MDSCs. The goal of this proposal is to
determine the function of MDSCs in mucosal immunity as well as how Arginase metabolites and KLK5
expression control the final outcome of fungal infection. It is proposed that MDSCs are a novel and
unexplored arm of oral epithelial immunity that contribute to oral or gut tolerance of fungal pathogens.
The long-range goal of this project is to understand host response to C. albicans and that will guide future
strategies to reduce the immune escape of C. albicans and add to our understanding of host tolerance."
10833633,"Project Summary
Mitochondria regulate a number of critical cellular pathways including energy homeostasis, calcium handling
and lipid production. In a number of cell types, distinct populations of mitochondria are created and maintained
within subcellular compartments driving unique responses to physiological challenges in different regions of the
cell. While many of the molecular players that modulate mitochondrial shape, and therefore function, have
been identified, complete understanding of their functions and interactions in establishing these subpopulations
of mitochondria within cells remain difficult to define. The deficit in understanding subcellular mitochondrial
shape and function is largely due to a limited ability to visualize, and manipulate, these dynamic organelles in a
truly physiological environment at high spatial and temporal resolution. Our approaches are designed to
address these gaps in knowledge by leveraging newly developed technologies enabling genetic labelling and
manipulation, across multiple cell types, with high spatial and temporal imaging of mitochondrial morphology,
dynamics and function in vivo. In project one, members of the laboratory will target the four known mammalian
receptors (MFF, FIS1, MIEF1/2) of the dynamin-like protein one (DRP1), the main effector of mitochondrial
fission, to test their roles in the creation and maintenance of different mitochondrial subpopulations in cortical
neurons and skeletal myocytes in vivo. Through the use of loss of function experiments, CRISPR/Cas labeling
and targeting-motif analysis coupled with high resolution imaging we will map the molecular mechanisms
regulating subcellular mitochondrial fission dynamics across multiple mitochondrial subpopulations. In project
two, members of the laboratory will implement methods for sparse, bright labeling of cortical neuron and
skeletal myocyte mitochondria with fluorescent reporters for adenosine triphosphate, calcium, pH and reactive
oxygen species, and couple it with 2-photon imaging in living mice to reveal how these mitochondrial
subpopulations inform mitochondrial and cellular function in vivo. By manipulating different subpopulations and
visualizing the effects on mitochondrial and cellular function in multiple cell types in vivo, we will provide a
uniquely integrated approach to understanding the universal and cell-specific roles of mitochondrial
subpopulations found within cells."
10837516,"Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infections in
pregnancy are associated with fetal loss, preterm birth (PTB), small-for-gestational age (SGA), infant mortality,
and other adverse outcomes. Approximately one in four pregnant women in East Africa have at least one of
these sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and prevalence is higher among women living with HIV (WLHIV). In
Kenya, syndromic STI management persists as standard of care (SOC) leading to untreated asymptomatic
infections and inappropriate antibiotic use. We found that only 34% of pregnant Kenyan women with STIs had
symptoms and NG in pregnancy was associated with 4-fold higher infant mortality. In response to this urgent
issue of public health importance, WHO and the US Preventive Services Task Force call for antenatal STI testing
models in HIV priority settings with robust cost-benefit data. The wide network of GeneXpertÂ® machines at
decentralized laboratories at facilities in Kenya could be leveraged to provide molecular antenatal STI testing.
To optimize cost-benefit efficiency, one option is to treat women who are symptomatic and only test women
without STI symptoms. A second option is to provide universal STI testing regardless of symptom presentation,
which would provide more accurate diagnoses and guide appropriate antibiotic use. To date, no RCTs in HIV
priority settings compare different antenatal STI testing models that integrate the XpertÂ® platform within routine
antenatal care and no studies assess cost or implementation outcomes. In collaboration with the Kenya Ministry
of Health, we propose a randomized trial in Kisumu and Siayaâregions with 20% HIV prevalence among women
and 10% PTB rateâto compare models of STI testing in antenatal care. We will expand on our prior studies to
offer CT, NG, and TV testing using XpertÂ® assays in routine antenatal care, and prospectively ascertain perinatal
outcomes. This hybrid effectiveness-implementation RCT is designed to provide evidence to inform policy
decisions. We hypothesize that antenatal STI testing is a cost-effective strategy for improving perinatal outcomes
among women in HIV priority settings, a population disproportionately affected by STIs and perinatal morbidity.
Aim 1 will conduct a 3-arm RCT to compare SOC (syndromic management only) vs. CT, NG, and TV testing
using XpertÂ® assays universally vs. only among women without STI symptoms among antenatal care attendees
followed through 9 months postpartum. The primary outcome is a composite of fetal loss/stillbirth, PTB, SGA,
and neonatal death. Aim 2 will evaluate implementation outcomes of integrating STI testing into antenatal care
for pregnant women within public facilities guided by the Proctor framework (acceptability, appropriateness,
satisfaction, feasibility, and penetration). Aim 3 will estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of implementing
different STI testing strategies in antenatal care. Our proposal addresses the combined high STI burden in
pregnancy and high perinatal morbidity in HIV priority settings and is designed to provide crucial evidence to
inform policy recommendations for STI testing in pregnancy in Kenya and other HIV high-burden settings."
10839366,"Abstract
Neuronal systems must adapt to fast and slow changes in the environment. A classic example is
the visual system which can adjust to changes in several orders of magnitude in light levels
within just seconds. Adaptation has also been observed on a much longer time scale, such as
seasonal changes in the light period. In Drosophila, shifts to an extended light period trigger a
reduction in the size of rhabdomeres, the light-sensitive organelle of photoreceptors, and a
down regulation of their synaptic active zones. We recently discovered that regulation of this
structural plasticity depends on the unfolded protein response (UPR). After just one night with
continued light exposure, both the IreI and the PERK arm of the UPR are activated. Interference
with the normal regulation of the UPR results in the loss of visual neurotransmission and severe
structural deterioration of rhabdomeres, the microvillar arrays that house the key elements of
the phototransduction cascade. This phenotype was observed for fic and BiP mutants that
interfere with the regulation of the activity of BiP, a major regulator of the UPR. Screening for
additional elements of this pathway, we identified an unconventional kinase-like protein, called
Allnighter, as a candidate. Its sequence predict that this protein may be a kinase acting in the
secretory pathway. Preliminary data indicate that, similar to fic and BiP mutants, an extended
light period causes allnighter mutants to lose visual neurotransmission and structural integrity
of rhabdomeres. This proposal aims to characterize the mechanisms regulating photoreceptor
structural plasticity and the specific role of Allnighter in this process. Specifically, we will test
how regulation of two key stress pathways, the unfolded proteins response and autophagy,
contributes to structural plasticity and the mechanisms by which the Allnighter protein modifies
both of these pathways. Completion of these experiments will significantly enhance our
understanding of the mechanism that drive structural plasticity of photoreceptors and maintain
visual acuity during long-term adaptation."
10837290,"Cryptococcus neoformans infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among AIDS patients.
Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is the most common disseminated fungal disease in AIDS patients and is
responsible for 15% of AIDS-related deaths globally. Because host immune responses are so vital to the
control of cryptococcosis, the overall objective of our laboratory is to determine the mechanism(s) necessary to
elicit protective immunity against C. neoformans infections in immune deficient hosts. To this end, studies in
our laboratory employ a C. neoformans strain engineered to express interferon (IFN)-ï§, designated H99ï§, as a
model system to define protective immune responses against C. neoformans. Published studies by our lab
demonstrated that immunization with H99ï§ induces protective immunity against cryptococcosis in mice
altogether deficient in B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells and neutrophils. Preliminary results provided
herein suggest that conventional DC1 cells (cDC1s) are critical for the development of macrophage anti-
microbial activity, optimal T cell responses and the induction of protective immunity against cryptococcosis.
Taken together, our results lead us to hypothesize that cDC1s are critical for the elicitation of protective
vaccine-mediated immune responses against cryptococcosis in CD4+ T cell deficient hosts. The
foundation for our hypothesis is supported by a scientifically rigorous set of published and preliminary results
that demonstrate the potential impact of strategies that prime cDC1s to elicit protective immunity against
cryptococcosis in immune deficient hosts. To test our hypothesis, we propose to define the mechanism(s) by
which IFN-ï§ primed cDC1s mediate protective anti-Cryptococcus immune responses in immune compromised
hosts."
10931759,"Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and pain in disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), like constipation-type irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS-C) or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), afflicts >10% of the population with reducing
quality of life at a cost of ~$30B/y in the U.S. The etiology of VH in DBGI is not known. VH reflects recruitment
of silent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) visceral afferents, reducing their threshold to fire, and increasing their rate of
firing, action potentials. Current analgesics, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates, are
inadequate, with poor efficacy and side effects, highlighting the clinical need for novel therapeutics. The intestinal
receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) binds cognate peptides at the extracellular domain that activate an
intracellular catalytic domain, converting GTP to cyclic GMP, the downstream effector. GUCY2C is the receptor
for diarrheagenic bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (STs), and the homologous hormone uroguanylin in small
intestine and their receptor activation induces secretion (diarrhea for STs). This secretion is the basis for treating
DBGI constipation syndromes with linaclotide (Linzessâ¢), an ST analog, or plecanatide (Trulanceâ¢), a
uroguanylin analog. Beyond secretion, GUCY2C agonists relieve pain in DBGI patients and rodents, reducing
visceral nociception produced by colorectal distension (CRD). While visceral pain relief by agonists is mediated
by GUCY2C, mechanisms, and their role in the pathophysiology of VH, are unknown. Interestingly, GUCY2C
agonists are formulated for activity confined to small intestine. Our recent studies revealed that DBGI patients
with VH lose uroguanylin, silencing GUCY2C in small intestine. Additionally, we discovered that GUCY2C is
over-expressed by small intestine neuropod cells, which synapse with DRG neurons controlling gut-spinal
cord signaling. Silencing GUCY2C produced spontaneous VH identical to that produced by inflammation. In
close agreement, neuropod cells produce DRG neuron hyperexcitability which is eliminated by GUCY2C
signaling. These data suggest a novel Anatomical Hypothesis in which neuropod cells in small intestine control
the excitability of DRG neurons afferent to the spinal cord which, in turn, inhibit nociceptive signaling from CRD.
The Pathophysiological Hypothesis suggests that VH in DBGI reflects uroguanylin loss, silencing GUCY2C
in neuropod cells in small intestine, disrupting the control of DRG neuron excitability which amplifies colorectal
nociception. The Therapeutic Hypothesis suggests that GUCY2C-cGMP signaling can be selectively amplified
only in neuropod, but not other intestinal, cells to suppress neuron excitability controlling visceral pain without
producing secretion and diarrhea, the major therapeutic limitation to oral GUCY2C agonists. Proposed studies
will define key elements of a new gut-spinal cord axis in which GUCY2C drives neurotransmission by neuropod
cells in small intestine to regulate neuron excitability controlling visceral pain in the colorectum. The potential to
translate these insights into new therapeutic paradigms for VH targeting neuropod cells to maximize analgesia,
but minimize diarrhea, is highlighted by the availability of oral GUCY2C agonists to treat constipation."
10839176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroimaging studies show a relationship between accelerated biological aging and accelerated brain atrophy
even in healthy populations. Recent machine learning approaches have used neuroimaging variables, such as
cortical thickness and subcortical volume, to calculate an estimated âbrain ageâ as a measure of biological aging.
Estimated brain age greater than an individualâs chronological age is thought to reflect an accelerated rate of
age-related changes to the brain and may predict future impairments in cognitive functioning. Accelerated
biological brain aging may occur among people with HIV (PWH), as central nervous system complications from
HIV infection may occur even in individuals taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methamphetamine (METH) use,
which is common among PWH, may also be detrimental to brain health. It is hypothesized that METHâs effects
on the central nervous system may have a synergistic effect on the long-term impact of HIV infection. This K01
application will use structural and functional neuroimaging measures to develop a normative model of brain age
using data from the Human Connectome Project to leverage hypothesis testing in a locally collected dataset by
the UC San Diego Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC) that includes adults
stratified by HIV infection and methamphetamine use. Specific Aim 1 will estimate brain age in the TMARC
cohort using a composite measure of cortical thickness and subcortical volume derived from T1-weighted
structural scans and compare it to chronological age and cognitive measures. We hypothesize that HIV infection
and METH use will individually accelerate brain age, but that their combined effects will be associated with
greater accelerated aging. Specific Aim 2 will integrate T1-weighted and resting-state functional neuroimaging
scans to develop a brain-age model based on multi-modal neuroimaging data which is hypothesized to be more
sensitive to the effects of METH use and HIV status on brain age and cognitive measures. Specific Aim 3 will
investigate whether inflammation indexed by CRP, MCP-1 and NfL from cerebrospinal fluid has an indirect effect
on the association between brain age and history of METH use or between brain age and HIV status.
Disentangling the biological effects of HIV in older adults and its relation to history of METH use will advance the
HIV field through informing our understanding of how biomarkers of neural integrity and inflammation related to
cognition, which may inform future health interventions. This K01 application has broad, long-term objectives
that include obtaining experience in data-science methodologies using neuroimaging data in order to generate
models that will push neuroimaging research towards more clinical applications in substance use and HIV
infection. This proposed K01 project will provide the applicant with critical training in data science using
neuroimaging data, which will broaden her research skill-set and provide preliminary findings for the preparation
of an R-level application."

10848226,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Administrative Core
The goals of the Administrative Core are to provide oversight and cohesive organization, so that the Aims across
the Center can be achieved with both great efficiency and broad impact. The Administrative Core will be led by
Center Director, Dr. Mark Thomas, Professor in the Department of Neuroscience. Dr. Thomas is a long-standing
NIDA-funded investigator who has been researching the neural circuits underlying drug addiction since the late
1990âs. During his tenure at the University of Minnesota (UMN), he has launched two successful Core facilities
and played a key role in the establishment of the UMNâs Medical Discovery Team on Addiction (MDTA).
Our Administrative Core will be organized to fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to build and maintain an
administrative framework with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. We designed our Center with several
groups of investigators and advisors, each with well-defined roles and responsibilities, to carry out the mission
of the Center. In addition to the Center Director and the Core co-Leads, these groups include the Steering
Committee, responsible for governance of Center operations, and the Scientific Advisory Panel, composed of
internal and external Scientific Advisors for each Core who are responsible for technology consultation and
development. Working together, these entities will ensure the Center has the maximal impact on local and
national science. Aim 2 is to develop and promote education, training and outreach opportunities for Core
investigators. We propose a variety of measures that will promote: a) effective use of the scientific resources in
the Center by individual investigators, regardless of their level of prior experience with the technologies; b)
widespread dissemination of the science made possible by the Center; c) sharing of the technology and, when
feasible, data sets, for use by the international scientific community; and d) outreach activities and events to
inform the public of the Centerâs scientific research."
10848228,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Viral Innovation Core
Contemporary research on the neuroscience of addiction utilizes a broad set of genetically encoded tools that
can be used to control neuronal excitability, highlight connectivity between neurons that form microcircuits, and
report cellular activity states in behaving animals. Viral vectors exploiting the beneficial features of the Adeno-
Associated Virus (AAV) backbone have proven invaluable for delivering genetically encoded tools to specific cell
types and circuits in the nervous system, and are critical tools used by the addiction neuroscience community at
the University of Minnesota (UMN). With the recent investments made in hiring to grow addiction-related research
at UMN, the need for high-quality and efficient AAV vector production will increase substantially over the next
decade. The Viral Innovation Core (VIC) seeks to meet the AAV vector needs of the UMN addiction research
community, providing Center Investigators and Affiliates with access to advanced and experimental AAV
production services, as well as a rigorous set of quality control and product evaluation processes that will inform
the optimal design of future AAV-based investigations. The mission of the VIC is encapsulated in two Specific
Aims: 1) Generation and advanced characterization of AAV vectors. The VIC will support the generation of AAV
vectors â including custom vectors â for the UMN addiction research community. The VIC will employ a stringent
process of product evaluation and quality control that, in aggregate, will represent a comprehensive profile of
virus quality that can be used to help optimize vector production and purification approaches. This effort,
combined with application-specific feedback, will help the VIC best advise investigators on the design, use, and
storage of these tools. Providing this labor-intensive service through a centralized entity with skilled staff
represents a critical efficiency for the VIC user base, and will facilitate the centralized examination, evaluation,
and interpretation of data from a large and broad array of vector tools. 2) Engineering tropism of AAV. The VIC
will also direct a research and development (Special Projects) program with the goal of developing new
methodologies to improve the delivery of AAV vectors, oriented around the specific needs of the UMN addiction
research community. The VIC will investigate whether âarmingâ tropism-null AAV vectors with antibodies or other
non-immunoglobulin scaffolds can redefine their tropism in a user-specified manner. Engineered tropism, which
will enable viral gene delivery based on one or more surface receptors or markers, would represent a powerful
approach to achieving precise manipulation of neural circuits relevant to addiction. Summary/impact. Tools
generated by the VIC will promote engagement with the Structural Circuits Core and Imaging Cells during
Behavior Core, fueling insights that will be consolidated within the Addiction Connectome Core. The efforts of
the VIC will also yield synergies that expand the scope of supported projects and increase the impact of UMN
research in the area of addiction. Furthermore, new multi-modal AAV targeting paradigms will represent a
substantial benefit to the broader internal and external neuroscience research communities."
10848234,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Imaging Cells during Behavior Core
Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder due to perturbations in neural circuits. To better understand the
underlying pathophysiological processes occurring in addiction and the actions of new therapies, there are
pressing needs to monitor neural activity and structure during addiction and relapse. Visualization of nervous
system function and structure in the intact, behaving animal is a powerful approach to meet these needs. Recent
advances in genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators and imaging instruments have greatly expanded the
opportunities for imaging the nervous system at work. Concurrently, there is a revolution in the use of high-speed
video cameras combined with sophisticated computational tools to monitor and quantify behavior.
Many labs at the University of Minnesota (UMN) lack the equipment and expertise to perform neural imaging
during behavior. Nor is it possible for most investigators to keep up with the rapid changes in optical tools, either
in the engineering or application domains. The Imaging Cells during Behavior Core (ICBC) is designed to allow
addiction researchers and the wider neuroscience community access to modern techniques to image brain
function and structure during behavior. Providing up-to-date imaging techniques, engineering and manufacturing
support, as well as computational tools, will not only reduce the time and costs needed to set up experiments
and process data, but also lower the entry barriers for both new and established investigators. The ICBCâs
engineering, experimental, and analytical expertise will allow labs to be at the forefront of imaging technology.
Aim 1 is to provide resources, expertise and training in three in vivo imaging technologies used in behaving
animals: 1) head-mounted miniaturized microscopes for cellular level imaging at the surface and in deeper brain
structures; 2) wide field-of-view (FOV) imaging of the cerebral cortex at both the mesoscopic and cellular levels;
and 3) fiber photometry to monitor the activity of genetically defined elements in neural circuits. UMN
investigators deemed these technologies critical to understanding how neural circuits change in addiction. The
ICBC will provide sophisticated hardware and software to monitor and analyze behavior in head-fixed and freely
moving animals and the engineering and analytical expertise to build and use these in vivo imaging technologies.
Aim 2 extends and adds new imaging capabilities. Many UMN addiction researchers use rats, but most neural
imaging techniques were developed for mice. Therefore, we will extend our imaging tools to the rat. In addition,
Aim 2 will combine fiber photometry with wide FOV cortical imaging, enhance wide FOV imaging to access
deeper cortical structures, and make wide FOV imaging compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. ICBC
personnel will work closely with investigators to employ these improvements to advance their research programs.
In summary, the ICBC will provide the research infrastructure, expertise and training to allow neuroscientists to
image neuronal activity and neural circuitry during behavior. Providing these tools will enhance the productivity,
quality, and impact of addiction-related and neuroscience research in general at the UMN."
10916523,"The Development and Maintenance of Human and Animal Food Rapid Response Teams
 Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA): RFA-FD-23-019
Arizona Rapid Response Team Development
 Project Summary
There are 8 different objectives outlined in the FOA: RFA-FD-23-019 that the AZDA will focus
on achieving throughout the next 3 years. Key milestones are indicated for each objective. Each
year the AZDA intends to achieve target goals to bring us closer to the overarching mission of
developing a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary team that will operate utilizing Incident Command
System (ICS) and National Incident Management System (NIMS) principles and a Unified
Command structure to respond to HAF emergencies. We expect to effectively minimize the time
between agency notification of HAF incident and implementation of effective control measures.
During the next three years, the AZDA plans to develop a successful Rapid Response Team
(RRT) by identifying current capabilities, identifying RRT partners, developing relationships,
creating a structure, tracking progress and updates as well as developing improvement plans.
We will perform a capability assessment of our jurisdiction to help begin the development
process in addition to creating a sustainability plan. Both will be reviewed and updated annually
to ensure the objectives of the grant are met. In addition, the AZDA will provide the FDA with
annual reports documenting progress, updates and improvement plans. Standard Operating
Procedures will be created and act as living documents, reviewed and edited annually or more
frequently when necessary. These procedures will help lay the framework for Arizona's RRT.
Document maintenance is important to ensure the objectives of the FOA are being met by
identifying gaps and allowing the RRT partners to close those gaps.
The AZDA intends to quickly identify RRT partners to develop a strong structure. The AZDA
intends to develop a plan which will provide detailed information about the RRT development
process, key accomplishments and performance measures. During the next three-year period
there will be an emphasis on the development of a food emergency management plan based on
the RRT Best Practices Manual. In order to ensure uniformity and consistency throughout the
nation, it is important to ensure there is appropriate training and mentorship from other states
who have a fully developed Rapid Response Team. This will also help with the development of
our own food emergency management plan. Our goal is to ensure that our RRT partners are
fully trained and to plan for succession by ensuring that new members will be able to pick up
exactly where the last person left off flawlessly. Necessary training will be identified for each
partner. The structure will be built to help identify responsibilities of each position and agency. It
will be a top priority to build and maintain interagency relationships and set up quarterly
meetings. We are aware that we need to coordinate with other agencies and often rely on these
relationships to execute the goals of the FOA. It is highly important to maintain these
relationships and build working relationships within Arizona as well as with other state and
federal agencies.
The overarching goal is to protect public health by minimizing the time between agency
notification of incidents and improving incident response by implementing effective control
measures. The development of a sustainable Rapid Response Team (RRT) will allow the AZDA
to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies within the state of Arizona. Minimizing the
risks of pathogen contamination is key to preventing HAF emergencies but it is also important to
prepare to respond to emergencies effectively when they occur. As we strive to meet the goals
in each of the 8 objectives, we are confident that we will achieve the overarching goal to
successfully develop a working Rapid Response Team in Arizona. We will continue to leverage
existing expertise, knowledge and resources in our state to create a sustainable structure and
program."
10830269,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cerebral ischemia causes a rapid impairment of synaptic activity that cause neurological deficits. More
specifically, the ischemic injury induces the mobilization of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid receptors (AMPARs) from the postsynaptic density (PSD) to extrasynaptic sites, leading to the conversion
of active synapses [with AMPARs and N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs)] into silent synapses (with
only NMDARs), with the resultant loss of synaptic function. This deleterious effect is reversible in the early
phases of the ischemic injury, but at later stages causes irreversible synaptic failure that leads to the
development of permanent neurological deficits. Scaling up is a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity whereby
silent synapses (with only NMDARs) recruit AMPARs to the PSD by a sequence of events mediated by the
postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). This process is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)
by its ability to regulate the expression of PSD-95 in the PSD. Cdk5 is activated by its binding in the membrane
to its specific activator, p35. Ischemic stroke induces the release of the serine proteinase tissue-type
plasminogen activator (tPA) from endothelial cells into the intravascular space, where it has a fibrinolytic effect
mediated by its ability to cleave plasminogen into plasmin; and from neurons into the synaptic cleft, where its
role is less well understood. Based on its thrombolytic properties, intravenous (IV) administration of recombinant
tPA (rtPA) is used to treat acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. However, following its IV administration rtPA
also crosses through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reaches the synapses in the ischemic tissue.
Significantly, data from our laboratory indicate that tPA protects the synapse that has suffered an ischemic injury.
In this application we will test the novel hypothesis that tPA, either released from the presynaptic terminal in
response to the ischemic insult, or intravenously administered (rtPA), improves neurological outcome after an
ischemic stroke by promoting Cdk5-mediated reactivation of synapses silenced by the ischemic injury. We
propose that this effect does not require plasmin generation, and thus is devoid of hemorrhagic complications.
We will test our hypothesis in three Specific Aims. In the first Aim we will investigate the mechanism whereby
tPA increases the abundance of p35 (Cdk5 activator) in the synapse. In the second we will study whether the
increase in p35 abundance induced by tPA leads to Cdk5 activation. In the third Aim we will use an animal
model of cerebral ischemia, and a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroradiological techniques, to test the
hypothesis that treatment with proteolytically inactive tPA improves neurological outcome after an ischemic
stroke by triggering the reactivation of synapses silenced by an ischemic injury. We postulate that this effect of
tPA is not associated with the development of plasmin-induced hemorrhagic complications."
10830449,"Dendritic simplification and synaptic loss represent major structural correlates of dementia in Alzheimerâs
disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau are a
major cause of FTD and increase the risk of developing AD. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP)
have also been linked to familial FTD. In the prior project period, we discovered that dendritic calcium
dyshomeostasis, dysregulated mitophagy and altered protein phosphorylation contribute to dendritic
shrinkage in several models of neurodegeneration. We also discovered a novel interaction between VCP and
the neuroprotective kinase PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1). VCP is a multifunctional protein implicated in
protein degradation, vesicular transport and Golgi remodeling, and these functions are mediated by distinct
VCP cofactors. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that PINK1 interacts with VCP to prevent tau-
mediated dendritic shrinkage. We will utilize primary rodent cortical neurons and human iPSC-derived
neurons to study quality control mechanisms that contribute to neuroprotection against tau-mediated
degeneration of dendritic arbors and spines. We will also assess the neuroprotective potential of upregulating
PINK1 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Completion of these studies will reveal how proteins implicated in different
neurodegenerative diseases function together to protect against tau-mediated neurodegeneration."
10831086,"Sensitization to allergens early in life is a risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma. For
sensitized individuals, severity in asthma symptoms also correlates with the level of exposure to allergens.
Although the downstream adaptive immune responses resulting from allergen exposure as well as the
relationship of these responses to asthmatic symptoms are well understood, knowledge of the mechanisms by
which allergens are initially sensed or recognized in the airway and how such early events shape the resulting
disease course are still lacking. The long-term objective of this project is to characterize and understand the
function of the protein LMAN1 in serving as a receptor for mannosylated aeroallergens.
 LMAN1 (Lectin, Mannose Binding 1) was identified as a candidate receptor for house dust mite using an
unbiased receptor capture approach. Subsequent in vitro biochemical analysis indicates that this lectin can bind
other unrelated allergens as well. LMAN1 is a mannose binding lectin which is primarily recognized to act as a
cargo transporter between the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi compartments. Our preliminary data indicates that LMAN1
can also exist on the surface of cells and is expressed on both dendritic cells (DCs) and airway epithelial cells
(AECs) in the lung. We additionally have evidence to suggest that LMAN1 downregulates the immune response
against allergens, potentially through modulation of NF-kB activity. In this proposal, we seek to determine
whether recognition of mannosylated aeroallergens for downregulation of allergic responses is a general function
of LMAN1 through the use of biochemical and cellular binding assays and by subjecting WT and LMAN1 KO
mice to models of allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we aim to determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying the ability of LMAN1 to regulate allergic responses. We will use WT or LMAN1 KO DCs and AECs to
investigate the signaling events induced through four pathways potentially utilized by LMAN1 to modulate NF-
kB activity.
 Understanding whether LMAN1 can serve as a general sensor and negative regulator of allergic
responses and the molecular mechanisms by which this receptor carries out its regulatory function will provide
the basis for consideration of LMAN1 as a potential molecular drug target. If successful, this will, in turn, lead to
future studies identifying and testing the efficacy of LMAN1-targeted therapies for modulation of allergic airway
inflammation."

Older women are disproportionately impacted by a range of chronic diseases and conditions, such as
cognitive impairments, that can be alleviated by regular physical activity (PA), including walking; yet they
are the most inactive segment of the US population. While the majority of older women use smartphones,
few remotely delivered PA interventions have been developed specifically to address this age + gender PA
disparity, and few such interventions leverage built and social environmental factors that can increase daily
PA. Using a dynamically based socio-ecological model of health behavior change, this studyâs primary aim
is to enhance the efficacy of a âlight-touchâ, remotely delivered PA educational intervention for older women
by testing the added impacts of an innovative, remotely delivered citizen science program to identify and
address local environmental barriers to walking and other PA (called Our Voice TM [OV]). The âlight-touchâ
PA educational program has been delivered since 2015 to >23,000 women >70 years that have been
participating in the U.S.-wide Womenâs Health Initiative Strong and Healthy (WHISH) pragmatic PA trial
(U01HL122280-03). WHISH, which used a pragmatic, âopt-outâ consent enrollment process, includes the
broadest range of PA, physical function levels, and geographic regions found in PA intervention studies to
date. The original WHISH educational program has resulted in significant but generally modest PA increas-
es in the overall WHISH population, and surveys indicate that many WHISH participants could benefit
strongly from further intervention. An enriched version of the original remote program (called enCore) will
serve as the enCore Alone arm in the proposed trial. To address local built and social environmental PA
barriers that many WHISH women describe, the mobile app plus web based OV program will be added to
enCore (enCore+OV arm). We will randomize a total of 300 WHISH intervention women (mean age=85
yrs.) with smartphones who are insufficiently active to the two arms. We hypothesize that women receiving
enCore+ OV will show higher pedometer-measured 12-month PA levels than women receiving enCore
Alone. Additional questions include changes in cognitive function and sedentary behavior; exploring a theo-
retically derived multi-level set of putative mediators (e.g., social cohesion, rated neighborhood walkability,
community wayfinding) and baseline moderators of program success (e.g., race/ethnicity, family support,
geographic region); and exploring the relative costs of the two programs for PA change. The study will add
important information on the benefits and trade-offs of combining these remotely delivered, practical, and
potentially scalable behavioral health delivery approaches for this fast-expanding demographic group."
10839893,"Project Summary
Numerous comorbidities have been identified as relatively common among children and adolescents with
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) including sleep disturbances,
hypertension, abnormal eating behaviors, altered growth patterns, and comorbid depression and anxiety. In
addition, emerging data suggest that several adult diseases of developmental origin, such as diabetes,
atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders are over-represented and have earlier age at onset
in adults with FASDs. It is imperative to better understand the prevalence and co-occurrence of these disorders
as early as possible in the life course of children and adolescents with PAE, ideally at the sub-clinical stage, in
order to intervene in clinically meaningful ways. Building on the existing Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) longitudinal cohort study in Ukraine, we aim to fill this critical gap in knowledge in
two ways. First, we will compare the prevalence and characteristics of subclinical and clinical signs/symptoms
of current and developing metabolic and other chronic diseases and contributing factors in 180
children/adolescents with PAE age-matched to 120 children/adolescents with no/minimal PAE. This includes
comparing prevalence of premorbid or comorbid hypertension, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose
tolerance/insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease and also comparing growth parameters, physical
activity, dietary intake, adverse childhood experiences, sleep disturbances, and measures of anxiety and
depression. Second, we will compare findings on a panel of experimental measures of structure or function that
can help illuminate mechanisms of PAE-related comorbidities across the lifespan in the same cohort of 300
children and adolescents. Experimental measures include capillary microvasculature, telomere length, and
patterns of miRNA expression. Findings that are actionable will translate on the individual level to clinical
guidance provided to the participant and caregiver. Furthermore, in keeping with one of the primary goals of
CIFASD5, findings of this study will directly inform future intervention targets in children and adolescents to help
remediate, ameliorate or prevent progression of pre-clinical or clinical conditions identified in the study
evaluations. We will also work collaboratively with other investigators in the CIFASD Consortium to interactively
address the overall goals of the Consortium in improving diagnosis and treatment of FASD."
10839899,"Health research is undergoing dramatic change fueled by groundbreaking technological innovations, the
increasing availability of big data, growing prominence of cross-disciplinary team science and constraints on
health research funding. This new world demands that successful researchers have a dynamic and evolving
mastery of a broad set of disciplines and must be avid collaborators and lifelong learners. At the Boston
University CTSI we have crafted an innovative career development program that addresses these needs and
we request funding to support this innovative and integrated program. Our vision encompasses two specific
aims as follows: 1. Build a system that provides continuous comprehensive mentoring and career
development support for scholars from postdoctoral training through early faculty years 2. Anticipate
the skills that scholars will need for future success in research and provide these in an ongoing fashion
in the curriculum.
At BU and its affiliates there is an extensive breadth of research, a wealth and diversity of existing training
programs, a comprehensive curriculum, an abundance of accomplished and invested mentors, and close
collaborations between basic scientists and clinicians and clinical scientists. Among special institutional strengths
that foster the development of junior faculty are a vibrant faculty development program, pilot award program, and
commitment to core resources and cutting-edge technologies.
The program is targeted to our K community of investigators. It includes all junior faculty who are in K programs:
KL2 scholars, NIH K grant recipients and junior faculty with other career development awards (including awards
provided by institutional funds). It also includes postdoctoral fellows. A major goal of our career development
program is to provide support to scholars across the continuum of their careers. For junior faculty with
career development support including those beginning KL2 support, we have developed the PRIME Program
(Pathway to Research Independence and Mentoring Excellence) program. This program provides mentoring,
interactive instruction, reviews of works in progress and mock grant reviews to support these scholars during
their early career development through submission of their first scientific grants. Our ultimate goal is to create
a cadre of well-educated translational researchers who have the skills and passion to contribute to improving the
health of the communities we serve."
10839900,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Medical decisions for many chronic diseases such as diabetes are becoming more
complex as the number of available therapies expand and as we learn how risk factor targets and treatments
may need to be individualized based on a patient's clinical characteristics, genetic profiles, treatment
preferences, and social circumstances. To strengthen training and research in medical decision making in the
study of chronic diseases of older adults, Dr. Elbert Huang, Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago,
is submitting this K24 renewal proposal. The University of Chicago is an ideal environment for this program
because of its well-established clinical research programs, history of interdisciplinary collaboration, and
significant strengths in the social sciences. The overall goal of the program is to support young investigators
who are studying medical decision making in older adults living with individual or multiple chronic diseases.
Trainees of the program will have access to cohort studies of older adults (Kaiser Permanente Northern
California Diabetes Registry, the National Social Life Health and Aging Project, national Medicaid and
Medicare Claims), support for the construction and evaluation of simulation models of chronic diseases,
guidance for developing decision support interventions, and facilitated access to the UChicago Practice-Based
Research Network. In his own research in geriatric diabetes, Dr. Huang will pursue the following aims: 1)
advance the study of variation in diabetes onset, complications and treatment response in observational
studies; 2) advance the development of simulation models of diabetes complications; and 3) advance the
development of diabetes decision support for personalizing care for older adults. In two ongoing observational
studies (R01 AG060756, R01 AG063391), Dr. Huang will explore population-level variation in the onset of
diabetes and its complications as well as variation in response to achieved glucose targets and treatments. As
part of Aim 2, Dr. Huang is part of an investigative team led by his mentee, Dr. Neda Laiteerapong (R01
MD013420) developing a new simulation model of diabetes complications using multi-ethnic data from the
Kaiser Registry. This model will be comprised of a series of individual outcome prediction models
(cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia, dementia, mortality) that interwoven together. Under Aim 3, Dr. Huang
will first complete evaluation of a trial of a decision support tool (My Diabetes GOAL) created during his initial
K24. The tool, embedded within the electronic medical record, is designed to engage patients in personalized
goal setting and disease management with the support of a nurse. He will also develop an updated
stakeholder-informed diabetes decision support intervention for personalized care for older adults, addressing
both goal setting and treatment selection. This K24 award will allow Dr. Huang to strengthen his mentorship
program in medical decision making in chronic diseases and expand his research portfolio in new directions
that will guide individualization of care for diverse populations of patients living with diabetes."
10849318,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide and substantial
residual CVD risk persists despite effective LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. In this context, we propose an
investigation of mechanisms of plaque stabilization and destabilization focused on novel functions of
macrophages (MÏ) and vascular stromal cells, and their crosstalk, in mouse models and human CVD. Our
overarching hypothesis, pursued through three highly integrated Projects and two Scientific Cores is that
inflammation and the efferocytosis-resolution cycle in macrophages regulate plaque stability through crosstalk
with other macrophages and stromal cells and that detailed examination of the cell and molecular mechanisms
may provide opportunities for novel CVD treatments, including in patients with clonal hematopoiesis, an
emerging CVD risk factor. To address this hypothesis, Aim 1 will assess novel genes and pathways regulating
macrophage efferocytosis in atherosclerosis and mechanistically based therapeutic approaches to improve
efferocytosis and stabilize plaques. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of inflammatory cross-talk from MÏs to
stromal cells on plaque fibrous cap formation. Aim 3 will pursue translational relevance by examining the
relationship of clonal hematopoiesis mutations and efferocytosis genes to features of plaque stability using
human carotid plaque samples from the Munich Vascular Biobank. We will pursue these overall aims in three
highly integrated Projects, and two Scientific Cores coordinated by our Administrative Core. Our program will
use mouse models of disease and human atherosclerotic plaques to assess multiple genetic and therapeutic
interventions designed to stabilize plaques and reduce CVD risk. The projects will extensively leverage the
Scientific Cores to apply harmonized bioinformatic methods to single cell -omics data (Core B: Bioinformatics
and Biostatistics) and atherosclerosis phenotyping of mouse and human lesions(Core C: Mouse and Human
Atherosclerosis Tissue Core). Cross-cutting biological and technical innovations include mice that accurately
model clonal hematopoiesis, cell lineage tracing mouse models, advanced bioinformatics for sc and spatial data,
and new spatial transcriptomics approaches in human carotid plaques. Collaboration permeates the entire PPG
as a result of three years of preparatory work and preliminary studies. Each project addresses complementary
questions that together provide opportunities to understand new clinically relevant paradigms of atherosclerosis
stability and instability with the expectation to provide opportunities for novel mechanism-based targeted
therapeutic intervention to reduce CVD beyond LDL-C lowering. Thus, our proposed PPG is mechanistically,
clinically and translationally significant and relevant to public health."
10851755,"Abstract
Ascending neuromodulation associated with cognitive functions, such as arousal, attention, learning, memory,
decision making, evaluation of reward, are active in any conscious human subject participating in a Blood
Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. And yet, our
understanding of how these systems affect the BOLD signal remains rudimentary. In fact, our current
knowledge of neurovascular and neurometaboic mechanisms that underlie the BOLD signal has been derived
almost exclusively from studies in anesthetized animals where the state of neuromodulation was uncertain.
Recently, we have developed optical reporters for dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and acetylcholine
(ACh) applicable for high-resolution imaging of brain function in awake behaving mice. In the proposed project,
we will combine these reporters with an integrated suite of the BRAIN Initiative tools, developed by us
and others, to investigate the microscopic makeup of âbrain statesâ and their reflection in
macroscopic BOLD fMRI signals. These tools (except fMRI) are only applicable to model organisms.
Therefore, all experiments will be performed in awake behaving mice.
Our Central Hypothesis is that ascending projections from one or more neuromodulatory systems
contribute critically to generation of spontaneous (âresting-stateâ) hemodynamic fluctuations as well
as task-induced hemodynamic responses. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the relationship
between neuronal, vascular and metabolic activity as a function of (i) intrinsic brain states (Aims 1-2), and (ii)
exposure to cocaine â a common drug of abuse that acts by affecting neuromodulation (Aim 3). Brain states
will be operationally defined based on the readout of DA, NE, and ACh reporters referenced to
electrophysiological/imaging measures of local cortical dynamics. These studies will be performed in the
context of resting-state hemodynamic fluctuations as well as task-induced hemodynamic responses in the
primary somatosensory and frontal cortices.
The proposed project will (i) provide a stronger physiological foundation for resting-state and task-induced fMRI
in healthy individuals; (ii) place the relationship between the state of neuromodulation and energy expenditure
(cerebral metabolic rate of O2, CMRO2) on a quantitative footing; and (iii) examine the effects of cocaine on
neuronal and hemodynamic brain activity. This study will also generate further hypotheses about the ways in
which substance exposure may affect fMRI readouts."

This is the renewal application for a multidisciplinary training program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine
(PCCM) at the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM) at UCLA. The training program will continue to
provide training in basic science and clinical research relevant to the study of PCCM-related diseases. The
program proposes to continue to support a total of six postdoctoral trainees (M.D.s, Ph.D.s and M.D./Ph.D.s) for
a two year experience in a highly structured environment under the close supervision of faculty mentors. The
trainees will take advantage of experienced faculty mentors whose research encompasses themes of the
following: 1) Infection/Inflammation/Transplantation, 2) Lung Carcinogenesis, 3) Health Services Research and
Prevention, 4) Biomedical Informatics, Systems Biology and Data Science and 5) Vascular Biology and Rare
Diseases. The program will continue to utilize faculty mentors from several Departments in the DGSOM, the
Fielding School of Public Health and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA.
The faculty mentors have extensive research experience in diverse, yet overlapping areas of molecular and
cellular biology, immunology, psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences, internal medicine and health sciences,
health policy and management, biomedical, biostatistics and bioinformatics, cancer signaling and metabolism,
computer science, vascular biology and clinical study design. The faculty mentors have previously trained
postdoctoral trainees, who have subsequently gone on to independent and productive careers in academia or
industry. The environment at UCLA together with the faculty mentors will continue to offer an outstanding
experience for trainees in research disciplines relevant to PCCM-related diseases. The program will continue to
provide a structured curriculum that contains appropriate coursework, exposure to relevant lecture series and
an intensive basic science or clinical research experience. The training program has been highly successful in
developing new investigators with the majority of trainees continuing in research careers in academia or industry."
10851814,"SUMMARY
Vibrio cholerae causes the disease cholera and is a natural inhabitant of aquatic environments. Seasonal cholera
outbreaks occur where the disease is endemic and can spread worldwide. V. choleraeâs ability to form biofilms,
extracellular matrix-enclosed, surface-associated microbial communities, is crucial for its survival in aquatic
habitats between epidemics and is advantageous for host-to-host transmission during epidemics. The objective
of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation and biofilm-mediated
hyperinfectivity. In Aim 1, we will focus on understanding the mechanisms of V. cholerae biofilm matrix
biogenesis. We recently characterized the V. cholerae biofilm matrix proteome and will determine the role of a
prioritized set of the newly identified proteins in matrix biogenesis and function. We will also specifically analyze
how biofilm biogenesis is impacted by bacterial outer membrane vesicles, which we found to be associated with
the biofilm matrix, and identify the molecular determinants and the consequences of interactions between the
identified exopolysaccharides, proteins, and lipid constituents of the biofilm matrix. In Aim 2, we will determine
the impact of environmental and host surfaces on biofilm formation and biofilm hyperinfectivity. Specifically, we
will determine how newly identified V. cholerae adhesins impact biofilm formation on chitinous surfaces, and
identify the molecular determinants of biofilm formation on chitinous surfaces. To gain insight into biofilm
hyperinfectivity, we will analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying V. cholerae interaction with intestinal
mucin, determine the spatial and temporal colonization dynamics of planktonic versus biofilm-grown cells, and
evaluate the impact of biofilm matrix components on the colonization of the small intestine. A better
understanding of the molecular principles of matrix biogenesis and biofilm hyperinfectivity will allow us to identify
targets for the development of inhibitors of V. cholerae infection and transmission."
10849380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Quantitative research, when appropriately planned and executed, yields results that are objective, unbiased, and
replicable across experimental systems and labs. This is particularly important in neuroscience, where
quantitative tools and methodologies are critical to extract biological meaning from complex and often noisy data
sets that arise from manipulating the brain and nervous system. To provide the next generation of neuroscientists
the skillsets necessary to tackle daunting challenges in the field, this proposal requests support for a new
postdoctoral training program at the Salk Institute in âQuantitative Neuroscience Spanning Molecules, Cells,
Circuits, and Behavior.â Salk has been home to pioneering neuroscience research since its founding over 50
years ago, and under the leadership of co-Directors, Drs. Samuel Pfaff and Edward Callaway, program faculty
have devised a comprehensive training program that will provide early-stage postdoctoral fellows foundational
training in quantitative neuroscience, focusing on the tools and methodologies necessary for BIG DATA
approaches. The 30 program faculty include experts in molecular and cellular neuroscience, neural circuits of
perception and behavior, BIG DATA and computational neuroscience, and tool development, who together seek
to understand the circuit mechanisms by which animals integrate external stimuli and internal states to generate
complex behaviors. Importantly, there are currently ~120 postdoctoral trainees in program faculty labs,
representing a robust and highly qualified applicant pool. The training program has four overall goals. (1) To
provide technical training in quantitative neuroscience via mentored lab research and program elements that
include a Course on BIG DATA, a quantitative literacy roundtable (journal club and research presentations),
Emerging Technologies Tutorials, and a Bio-Computation and Theory Seminar Series. These efforts will be
augmented by a T32 statistician who will ensure that experimental design and statistical methodologies are
stressed throughout. Focusing on postdocs with existing competencies in statistics will allow the program to
teach advanced statistical methodologies relevant to BIG DATA approaches. (2) To foster collaborative
interdisciplinary research by organizing program-wide meetings that encourage cross-fertilization of ideas across
disciplines. (3) To provide Fellows a wealth of career development opportunities such as grant writing workshops,
chalk talk tutorials, career panels, and chances to mentor high school or undergraduate students. This will ensure
Fellows acquire the skills necessary to establish careers in academia, industry, or other career paths of their
choice. (4) To increase diversity of the neuroscience workforce by actively recruiting graduate students from
underrepresented backgrounds into the training program and by cultivating an institutional environment that
prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion. The proposed training program will support six early-stage postdoctoral
trainees annually for up to two years each, equipping them with the scientific and career skills necessary to
establish themselves as successful, independent neuroscience researchers."
10849397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cadmium (Cd) is an important contaminant that threatens human health, as well as agricultural productivity
and biodiversity. In the United States, the largest source of Cd exposure in non-smoking adults and children is
through the diet. Although adverse effects on kidneys, bones and as a carcinogen are well documented, there
is emerging evidence that Cd has significant neurotoxicological effects at low doses especially in pediatric
population. Several studies have found most grain containing baby foods have an abundance of cadmium. Although
decreasing cadmium in grains will lower dietary exposure the problem is exacerbated by attempts to increase
iron and zinc micronutrients. Efforts aimed to address population-level micronutrient deficiency inadvertently
cause elevated toxic metals such as cadmium. A simple solution to avoid metal toxicity is to breed plants with
selective uptake of beneficial micronutrients without the concomitant uptake of toxic heavy metals. Since little
is known about the grain loading processes of cadmium, it is imperative to understand the dynamics of
cadmium movement to grains, and how cadmium uptake interacts or interferes with zinc distribution within
plants. Dietary exposure to cadmium depends not only on the concentration of cadmium in the food but also on
the bioavailable fraction of cadmium from the food. Previous studies have only examined bioavailability of
cadmium in foods, without assessing how micronutrients affect cadmium bioavailability. Therefore, our long-
term goal is to achieve biofortification of essential micronutrients such as zinc without the commensurate
increase in the concentration of contaminants such as cadmium. Our overall goal for this study is to determine
how zinc alters cadmium transport, accumulation and bioavailability in wheat. The specific aims proposed to
attain our overall goal are 1) To define translocation and accumulation of cadmium from root to shoot to seed
in wheat and 2) To determine the mechanism by which addition of zinc to the soil alters cadmium
bioavailability. We will determine the relationship between cadmium accumulation and bioaccessibility in
response to zinc treatment, for which data do not exist. This new knowledge will include genes that can be
studied in greater detail to characterize the localization and complexation of cadmium and zinc in the grains.
The proposed research will have a strong positive impact because we will generate knowledge needed
to enhance the nutritional quality of major cereal crops while limiting bioavailability of toxic metals
such as cadmium that threatens human health especially children."

Non-invasive detection of gamma oscillations in infants will inform a broad range of studies examining neuro-
developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. As the highest frequency of the named neural oscillations,
they are also lowest in magnitude, making them difficult to detect. In the proposed work, the gamma oscilla-
tions of infants (6-months) will be measured using a non-invasive functional neuroimaging device with high
spatiotemporal resolution (~1 mm/10 ms) suitable for infants. These specifications suggest magnetoenceph-
alography (MEG) as the modality and optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) as the magnetic sensor of
choice. OPM-MEG systems allow individual positional adjustment of each sensor, maximizing detected signal
power. Current state-of-the-art OPMs do not have sufficient sensitivity and bandwidth to recover gamma oscil-
lations with high fidelity. In collaboration with our industry partner, QuSpin, Inc., we will develop a pulsed OPM
with a sensitivity of 2 fT/rt-Hz and a bandwidth of 220 Hz, making it capable of measuring the high frequency
gamma oscillations near the surface of the subjectâs scalp. The proposed sensor measures three orthogonal
vector components of the magnetic field using the same sensing volume, a unique feature that is essential for
the effectiveness of interference rejection algorithms. Furthermore, the triaxial mode allows for triaxial closed-
loop operation, an integral feature for suppressing systematic error sources in OPMs. The overall objective of
this project is to develop an OPM-MEG system with unprecedented sensitivity, bandwidth, and accuracy. Fur-
thermore, the MEG system will be validated in a study of gamma oscillations and brain synchronicity in infants
with a comparison between our hybrid OPM array and a commercial SQUID system. Aim 1 will deliver the core
component of the proposed MEG system: a novel pulsed-OPM sensor. The proposed sensor features 1) ex-
ceptional gradiometrically inferred sensitivity (2 ft/rt-Hz), 2) wide bandwidth (220 Hz), and 3) triaxial signal de-
tection using a single sensing volume, and 4) closed-loop operation on all three axes. Aim 2 will deliver a hy-
brid OPM-MEG system by incorporating 10 of our triaxial pulsed-OPM gradiometers (two triaxial OPMs sepa-
rated by 20 mm) and 20 triaxial commercial OPMs into a hybrid MEG sensor array installed in a magnetically
shielded room. Supporting tasks include control electronics, laser system, and novel signal processing algo-
rithms development for noise rejection using the full magnetic field vector. Aim 3: the robustness and effective-
ness of the pulsed OPM-MEG will be put to test by employing it to study gamma oscillations in 30 infants
through visual, auditory, and resting-state testing paradigms. The unique features of the proposed MEG sys-
tem stem from its novel pulsed sensor, which will provide the most sensitive OPM for non-invasive measure-
ment of brainâs magnetic field. Through the industry partnership, we will design for manufacturability to deliver
a prototype that is near product ready and has been validated against a commercial SQUID MEG system while
future research will seek further sensor miniaturization and improved sensitivity."
10849843,"Individualized brain biomarkers of late life depression: contributions to heterogeneity and resilience
Project Summary/ Abstract
Approximately 10% of people aged 60+ suffer from depression. Such late-life depression (LLD) is linked
to broader adverse health outcomes such as stroke and dementia. Many brain correlates of LLD have
been reported, but each explains only a small amount of interindividual variance in LLD symptoms, likely
due to a many-to-one mechanistic mapping in which multiple neural mechanisms contribute to similar
symptoms. Heterogeneity in clinical presentation arises from between-patient differences in acute severity,
symptoms, chronicity, and age of onset. Few patients are matched in all clinical domains and therefore
heterogeneity in conventional research samples is often unavoidable. Over and above clinical
heterogeneity, additional risk/resilience factors may alter the experience of LLD at the individual level.
Population data from the UK Biobank offers an unprecedented opportunity to fully disentangle clinical
heterogeneity by curating clinically homogeneous subject groups. We will distinguish brain profiles,
longitudinal changes, and resilience/vulnerability factors that are uniquely linked to LLD clinical domains
of: acute severity, mood symptoms, somatic symptoms, chronicity, and late onset LLD. Sixty brain
measures associated with LLD, including cortical thickness, gray matter volume, fractional anisotropy,
white matter hyperintensities, and resting state connectivity will be used for all aims. In Aim 1, we will curate
five homogeneous groups of UKB subjects with shared clinical presentation, focusing on: late onset LLD,
acute severity, lifetime chronicity, mood symptoms, and somatic symptoms. Using normative models
trained on never-depressed UKB subjects, we will distinguish normative brain deviation profiles associated
with these different domains of clinical heterogeneity. In Aim 2, we will curate new groups of UKB subjects
with shared longitudinal changes in acute severity, chronicity, mood symptoms, or somatic symptoms to
test whether changes over time in brain measures are linked to longitudinal changes in clinical
presentation. This aim therefore offers an independent validation of aim 1 and differentiates between state
and trait markers of LLD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that cumulative environmental and
psychological stressors alter the experience of LLD at the individual level. We will obtain individual-specific
statistical estimates of resilience/vulnerability based on the difference between predicted and actual
depression scores (âbrain depression gapâ). The brain depression gap will be linked to stressors separately
in each homogeneous subject group (same as aim 1) to determine factors that promote LLD resilience or
vulnerability.
Public health significance: this proposal is expected to move the field closer to a full understanding of
LLD heterogeneity by combining theory-driven subject groups with data-driven population prediction
models. Gaining a better understanding of LLD heterogeneity may inform improved strategies for treatment
and prevention of LLD, which could positively influence broader health outcomes in older age."
10849917,"Abstract
 The transplantation field has witnessed many major breakthroughs, including the development of
immunoregulatory molecules (IRMs), which have been key to the success of organ transplantation. However,
the use of IRMs is hindered by lack of efficiency and toxicity, and it is implicated in the pathogenesis of organ
failure and accelerated cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in transplant recipients.
Therefore, a substantial unmet medical need exists to develop novel strategies to increase the efficacy and
reduce the toxicity of IRMs. The existing drugs are often adequately potent when directed specifically to their
intended sites, so methods of targeted drug delivery could potentiate their safety and efficacy profiles
significantly, while reducing the need for creating new drugs, a process that can be extremely expensive, labor-
intensive, and time-consuming. Although targeted drug delivery using nanotechnology represents a highly
promising and innovative strategy for site-specific drug delivery, its application to transplantation remains to be
developed.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a targeted drug delivery system for IRMs in transplantation,
with the ultimate goal of increasing their efficacy and diminishing their toxicity. In transplantation, presentation of
donor allo-antigens to recipient T cells in the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) is fundamental to the generation of
alloreactive T cells that traffic to the allografts and cause allograft rejection. The overall hypothesis of this
proposal is that targeted delivery of IRMs to the DLN would not only increase their efficacy, but also decrease
their toxicity by significantly reducing systemic dosage.
 In Aim 1, we plan to devise a clinically applicable active targeted method of delivering IRMs to the DLNs
to promote heart allograft acceptance. We will focus primarily on murine heart allograft survival by devising a
combinatorial therapeutic strategy with our targeted delivery platform to address the immediate unmet need for
safer and more efficacious therapies in transplantation. In Aim 2, we plan to evaluate the mechanism of
prolongation of heart allograft survival by our active targeted delivery platform to DLNs. Mechanistic studies will
also permit improvement of the design of our targeted delivery method. These experiments will employ murine
heart transplant models, established functional assays, and sophisticated imaging studies to understand better
the biodistribution of IRMs and their nanocarriers. In Aim 3, we plan to pursue our preliminary data to generate
proof-of-concept data in devising a method of targeting IRMs to DLNs in non-human primates. This
multidisciplinary, collaborative approach sets forth a novel targeted delivery platform that could potentially shift
the paradigm of the approach to immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation."

Recruitment is among the top challenges that investigators report and are one of the most common reasons
why research studies and clinical trials fail. Poor external validity is also a significant limitation of much of the
available clinical research and contributes to both the difficulties replicating research findings across settings
and the persistently wide gap between research and practice. Moreover, racial/ethnic minority individuals have
been historically underrepresented in research on both substance use and chronic disease, despite being
overrepresented in these conditions. As a result, pertinent findings drawn from the available literature may not
be relevant for these groups, resulting in greater health disparities, increased healthcare costs for minority
individuals and the broader system, and increased medical mistrust among minority groups and the greater
public. Addressing each of these challenges requires deliberate, explicit efforts and the assistance of
experienced, culturally-competent staff to reach and engage more diverse and representative participants
more efficiently. It also requires investigators to incorporate more diverse and modern recruitment methods
that meet participants where they are, including both in-person relationship-building and online marketing.
However, effectively using these strategies is often beyond the skillsets of early stage investigators (ESI) and
basic research staff. To help ESI access this expertise and address these challenges, we propose the creation
of a new Recruitment, Engagement, and Community Health (REACH) Research Core in Phase II. The overall
goal of the REACH Core will be to provide inclusive, end-to-end support for both in-person and online
recruitment that helps CADRE and affiliated investigators meet their enrollment and inclusion milestones. For
each investigator requesting services, REACH personnel will engage in a discovery process to understand
individual study needs and develop a detailed strategy and budget. The Coreâs Community Outreach
Coordinator will lead elements of proposed strategies that incorporate in-person outreach, and the Digital
Marketing Services Coordinator will lead those involving online outreach. Once a strategy is devised, Core
personnel will implement the proposed strategy, monitor its performance over time, and work with investigators
to ensure it is effectively meeting enrollment and inclusion goals. To build further capacity for community
engaged research, the Core will also: develop and manage a community advisory board (CAB) relevant to
substance use and chronic disease that will be available to CADRE ESIs, develop resources to accelerate new
partnerships with community organizations and clinics, and conduct active outreach with community
organizations to build a registry of prospective participants in Rhode Island from underserved groups.
Together, we believe these steps will contribute real value for ESI, the science they produce, and the
interventions ultimately developed from this science. Such steps will also aid in transitioning the Core to
financial sustainability in Phase III."

I am an Assistant Professor in the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies in the Department of Behavioral
and Social Sciences at Brown University and a licensed Clinical Psychologist. My expertise is in the etiology
and behavioral pharmacology of alcohol and cannabis use (CU) and problems using multi-method (laboratory
and field-based) approaches. The proposed project will expand this expertise to include the study of substance
use and mental health symptoms in perinatal samples. Utilizing support from an expert mentorship team and
the CADRE Cores, the proposed research project will examine how CU and social determinants of health
impact depression and anxiety symptoms in the moment and longitudinally across the perinatal period (i.e.,
pregnancy and postpartum). Maternal mortality is a crisis in the U.S., particularly among Black/African
American women, and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and
mortality. Moreover, racial disparities in prevalence of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders in the U.S. are
striking, as rates are estimated to be twice as high among Black women and three times as high among
Hispanic/Latinx women relative to non-Hispanic White women. Further, there are strong links between
CU/Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and mood and anxiety symptoms. However, no studies have examined
trajectories of CU with symptoms of depression and anxiety across the perinatal period, nor how important
social determinants of health (e.g., racial discrimination) may impact these trajectories. The proposed study will
build on my current investigative skills in the study of momentary processes using ecological momentary
assessment and draw on expertise from a multidisciplinary team in conducting longitudinal substance use
research in a racially diverse clinical perinatal cannabis using sample. I will be well-poised to collect data that
provides initial understanding of how CU and important social determinants of mental health predict
momentary symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as symptom trajectories over time. This work will
provide essential preliminary data to launch an independent line of work that will utilize mixed-methods
approaches to comprehensively study between- and within-person processes, including substance use, of
critical perinatal mental health outcomes. In addition to supporting this expansion of my own career trajectory,
these aims reflect the CADRE mission to investigate biopsychosocial mechanisms (e.g., perceived
discrimination, health disparities) by which substance use (i.e., cannabis) exacerbates chronic disease (i.e.,
mood and anxiety disorders) in vulnerable populations (e.g., pregnant people of color). This project will utilize
the support of the REACH core for remote recruitment of a racially-diverse sample, the Clinical Laboratory
Core for supplies, equipment, and technical capabilities, and the Administrative Core for scientific leadership
and administrative support to successfully carry out the proposed aims and ensure my transition to full
scientific independence."
10849633,"Abstract: Real-Time Tracking of Gene Therapy by Bioactivated MR contrast Probes
 With mean survival rate of 5 years (and most cases are fatal) lysomal storage diseases (LSD) are among
the most dismal of prognosis in all of medicine. LSD's represent a large number of monogenetic diseases and
while rare the prevalence is to hemophilia. As monogenetic diseases with clearly defined genotype-phenotype
relations, lysosomal storage diseases are excellent candidates for gene therapy. The transformative results
documented in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy clinical trial in infants affected by spinal
muscular atrophy demonstrated unequivocally the potential of in vivo gene transfer to treat monogenic
neurological disorder.
 However, to date, there is a lack of non-invasive ways to determine biodistribution or activity levels of these
AAV therapies in patients. This is a significant hinderance, leaving investigators guessing which organs or
structures are effectively treated and, due to the lag time associated with clinical disease progression, this
limitation ultimately impacts the evolution of treatment modalities.
 In order to overcome these limitations, we propose the development of a new magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)-based technology to track enzymatic activity in any organ, peripheral nervous system (PNS), or central
nervous system (CNS) over time and thus have the potential to be applicable to any LSD caused by an
enzymatic deficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging is an ideal technique for the study of neurological
disorders. This technique is has become a gold standard in diagnostic radiology as a result of the absence of
ionizing radiation and is capable of true 3D imaging and has been in use for several decades . Detailed
structural information can be obtained in minutes, and single slices in seconds. However, the need to
differentiate regions of tissues or organs that are magnetically similar but histologically distinct has been a
major impetus for the development of contrast enhancement agents. Greater than 40% of all MR procedures
employ contrast agents with more than 450,000 million doses to date have been administered to patients and
Gd(III) based contrast agents are among the safest clinical probes in use.
 We pioneered the development of bio-responsive (i.e., conditionally activated) MR contrast agents and
since that time a library of this class of probes has expanded from enzyme activated agents to pH sensitive,
the detection of ions such as Zn(II) and Ca(II), and redox activated. Here, we describe the development of a
platform where the substrate (that prevents access of water to a Gd(III) ion) is removed by an enzyme which
can be substituted to accommodate a number of gene therapy targets."
10847682,"Prevention and control programs, guided by a rigorous evidence base, can accelerate progress toward
reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. The number of individuals affected by cancer
continues to grow as the U.S. population ages, and disparities in cancer incidence and mortality persist by
race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and geography. Reducing the impact of cancer requires increasingly
complex, transdisciplinary, and team science approaches that consider the role of social and structural
determinants of health. Accordingly, we need to grow a diverse cancer prevention and control research
workforce who are adept at transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary team science. Our ongoing Transdisciplinary
Training Program in Cancer Prevention and Control T32 aims to train postdoctoral scholars and expand
pipeline of prevention and control investigators. Housed in the Division of Public Health Sciences in the
Washington University School of Medicine, and Siteman Cancer Center, we are intentional in creating a
community of trainees from different public health disciplines, including behavioral sciences and epidemiology.
Our Program Mentors have robust research programs in cancer prevention and control, and represent multiple
schools and departments across the university. Our training program includes structured elements such as
individual development plans, mentored research, and required training in cancer prevention/control and health
disparities. Trainees customize their other didactic training to meet individual needs and goals. Our innovative
approach includes a transdisciplinary journal club and career development seminars. Over the course of our
first two cycles of funding, we have demonstrated success in recruiting, retaining, and training a diverse group
of successful researchers. Of 18 completed trainees, 15 remain in research related positions, 2 are in further
training, and 1 is delivering clinical cancer care. More than half of trainees are women, and half come from
backgrounds under-represented in medicine. Several trainees now have K awards (1 K99-R00, 3 K01s) and
other early career or pilot awards. They are well on their way to R01 funding. Our process includes evaluation
and adaptation of the program based on internal and external advisors and the ever-changing field of cancer
prevention and control. With this renewal, we will enhance training in rigor and reproducibility, team science,
and create pathways to early leadership for our trainees. We have formalized requirements for mentor training
for mentors and trainees. We will continue to leverage institutional resources, ongoing NIH-funded research,
and a close collaboration with the NCI-designated Siteman Cancer Center to sustain and improve our training
and impact. Washington University School of Medicine and Siteman Cancer Center offer a rich environment for
trainees, and our transdisciplinary training in cancer prevention and control is a unique resource to the
university environment. This renewal (Years 11-15) allows us to continue to train PhD and MD scientists to
conduct transdisciplinary research and lead the next generation of cancer prevention and control researchers."
10847972,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objectives of this proposal are to define fundamental mechanisms that drive radiation-induced esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). There is compelling evidence linking an increased risk of developing ESCC
with a history of therapeutic radiation exposure. Elucidating the machinery that drives tumor susceptibility, is of
major import to NCI, as ESCC is the deadliest of all human squamous cell carcinomas. Abnormalities in stress
signaling, in proteins such as ATF2 are strongly implicated in cancers. Additionally, a central role of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the promotion of cancer has gained prominence. Knowledge of pathways that
translate radiation-induced aberrant signaling to changes in the microenvironment is lacking and essential to
assess cancer risk post radiation exposure. This is a major gap in the field, which the current project proposes
to bridge. Our preliminary studies suggest a strong association between persistent pATF2ser 490/98 signaling and
EMT, both events regulated by transforming growth factor ï¢ (TGFï¢). Our main objectives are to understand the
role of TGFÎ²-mediated pATF2 signaling and its relationship to EMT, to provide insight into how changes in the
microenvironment allow radiation-induced tumor initiation and progression and identify biomarkers for ESCC
radiation-induced carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that TGFï¢ driven persistent pATF2 signaling triggers EMT
post radiation exposure, and this signaling network creates a tumor permissive microenvironment. To test this
hypothesis, we will use well-characterized normal and transformed cells containing genetic alterations commonly
occurring in esophageal cancer, and 3D cell culture systems, closely mimicking the in vivo physiological
environment of the esophagus. High and low dose fractionated radiation will be used to simulate the exposure
to the esophagus from radiotherapeutic cancer treatments. CRISPR technology will be used to mutate the ATF2
phospho-sites to define dependency of this signaling. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and RNA
seq will be used to address the specific aims and gain a mechanistic understanding of these events. We will (1)
test our hypothesis that EMT induction is a consequence of fractionated radiation-induced aberrant pATF2
signaling, and (2) investigate the effect of pATF2 signaling on tissue architecture, promotion of a tumor
phenotype, and transcriptomics post radiation exposure. Our contribution is expected to provide an innovative
approach to understand how radiation, through its influence on intercellular communication and interactions with
the microenvironment affects levels of biological organization and promotes cancer. This proposal addresses
relevant scientific areas of emerging importance such as the contribution of persistent stress signaling, and
microenvironment changes in promoting carcinogenesis. These studies are especially significant, as elucidating
the underlying mechanisms that promote radiation-induced carcinogenesis could aid in predicting patients at an
increased risk of developing ESCC and give mechanistic insights into the radiation-related carcinogenesis of
other tumor types including esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)."
10850348,"The mission of the National Resource for Aplysia at the University of Miami (the Resource) is to produce and
distribute consistently high-quality cultured sea hares, Aplysia californica, for biomedical research and
education and to improve the usefulness of this model system by applied research. Aplysia has played a vital
role in fundamental discoveries of how cellular and molecular changes in the nervous system underlie basic
behaviors, learning, and memory, due to unique characteristics of the simple nervous system that provide an
ideal model system for such studies. The 3 aims of the proposed continuation of this Resource program are:
 1. Animal Culture, Distribution and Health Monitoring â The Resource will continue to culture A.
californica and make all life stages, from eggs to large adults, available to researchers at a reasonable cost.
We anticipate sales will continue at a level of 8,000-10,000 animals per year. We will also accommodate
requests by users for separately reared cohorts, specialized diets, or harvesting of specific tissues for RNA or
DNA. We will monitor naturally occurring Aplysia abyssovirus (AAbV) in cohorts to better understand the
potential impacts of this virus and to provide information about virus levels to users. In addition, we will make
available additional specialized animals as developed in our Applied Research programs.
 2. Curation and Informatics â An improved system for management of stocks from egg laying throughout
the lifespan will be created and made publicly available through a web interface. The established website will
be enhanced to include additional content on uses of the Aplysia model system for human health research and
teaching. Our online ordering system will be improved. Training opportunities for graduate students,
undergraduate teaching labs, and public outreach activities using Aplysia will be expanded and enhanced.
 3. Applied Research â We will conduct two applied research projects that will expand the usefulness of this
model system. 3.1 Developing Aplysia as a model of enhanced susceptibility of the aged to cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) â Aplysia is hypoxia-resistant, and likely has adaptations to resist IRI. Markers
of IRI, such as variations in mitochondrial function, will be studied in abdominal ganglia exposed to ischemia
and ischemia plus reperfusion. We will also examine the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI.
Developing this model may allow users to investigate the impacts of IRI on neural excitability and may lead to
novel avenues of research and innovation in therapies. 3.2 Developing Aplysia as a model to study enhanced
susceptibility of the aged to myocardial IRI â Impacts of IRI on cardiac function as well as other IRI markers will
be studied. As above, the impact of age and pre-exposure to hypoxia on IRI will be investigated. This aim will
begin to pinpoint what adaptations Aplysia heart employs to mitigate hypoxic damage, and if those adaptations
persist as an organism ages. Developing Aplysia as a cardiac model will potentially expand this model
organism to uses beyond the nervous system."
10891743,"Resilience to brain aging and Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is a phenomenon whereby cognitive functioning is better than predicted based on chronological age, genetic risk and/or advanced neuropathology, likely because of the presence of as yet unidentified protective factors. These factors, once identified, are expected to provide key targets for treatment and prevention of AD. However, significant barriers limit discovery of the genetic mechanisms of resilience using human genetic methods alone, including: difficulties in identifying large numbers of individuals with asymptomatic AD, extracting age and interacting genetic effects from complex human genomes, controlling environmental factors, and obtaining brain tissue from asymptomatic AD cases. Moreover, it is well known that transcript abundance is not sufficient to infer protein abundance, as they differ spatially, temporally, and in response to learning tasks. Yet, our ability to discern how proteomes change across aging and AD progression is limited by the impossibility of longitudinal molecular analyses on human brain tissues, as well as the technology needed to profile cell type-specific proteomes associated with susceptibility versus resilience to AD. To fill these significant technological and knowledge gaps, here we will develop a robust pipeline using the most translationally relevant mouse models of human brain aging and AD (i.e., the AD-BXDs and their non-transgenic Ntg-BXDs controls) to obtain a longitudinal knowledge base of proteomes in specific cell types that we have found to exhibit robust changes in gene expression associated with highly susceptible and highly resilient phenotypes. We will focus on the hippocampus as it is required for spatial memory formation and recall in mice and humans, and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits are common in AD. Indeed, our work and preliminary data suggest that mouse strain differences in the age at onset and progression of cognitive deficits in the AD-BXDs (from extremely susceptible to resilient) result from cell type-specific differences in gene expression in the hippocampus. We will integrate these mouse data with clinical and omics data from NIA-sponsored AMP-AD and Resilience-AD Consortia to identify molecular drivers of cognitive resilience. In Aim 1, we will identify cell type-specific changes in neuron and microglia protein expression associated with resilience to AD using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in AD-BXDs. In Aim 2, we will translate drivers and molecular networks underlying cognitive resilience to human AD cohorts. In Aim 3, we will leverage the unmatched genetic engineering resources at The Jackson Laboratory to functionally validate âin-handâ resilience candidates by determining their effects on memory, hippocampal neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity in CRISPRed AD-BXDs. Using this pipeline, we will thereby discover novel and translationally relevant proteins and complexes for consideration under AMP-AD/TREAT-AD drug discovery pipelines to delay or prevent cognitive symptoms in susceptible AD mice, and ultimately AD patients."

This Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is designed to promote the development of Dr. KayLoni
Olson as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing interventions to address factors that
contribute to individual variability and poor outcomes in behavioral weight management. Overweight and obesity
remain a major threat to public health and contribute significantly to health care costs in the United States.
Standard behavioral weight management (SBT) facilitates clinically significant weight loss for many individuals
but there is variability in treatment outcome. High weight and shape concern (WSC) is associated with less
weight loss among women in behavioral weight management. One potential explanation for this relationship is
that individuals with High WSC have more frequent negative thoughts about weight/shape which lead to
overeating episodes. We therefore propose to use the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials guidelines
to refine an empirically-supported WSC treatment (the Body Project: BP) to increase suitability for adult women
with overweight or obesity and enhance treatment effects. The protocol will be iteratively refined using
exploratory sequential mixed methodology to more powerfully target WSC among women with overweight or
obesity and to ensure acceptability to the target sample (Aim 1). The revised protocol will be tested in a
randomized pilot trial to evaluate effects when combined with SBT (Aim 2). For the pilot trial, 60 women with
overweight or obesity who report High WSC and want to lose weight will be recruited. They will be randomized
to either a four-week WSC intervention (modified-BP) or a four-week, education-only control condition. All
participants will then receive 24-week SBT. WSC and body weight will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and
after 24 weeks of weight loss. EMA will be utilized to evaluate treatment effects on negative weight/shape-related
thoughts and overeating episodes throughout treatment. To conduct this project the applicant will complete a
rigorous, targeted training program to acquire key skills necessary for the success of the project and to prepare
the applicant for independence as an obesity researcher. Key areas for growth including 1) behavioral
intervention development, 2) obesity stigma as a contributor to WSC, 3) ecological momentary assessment, 4)
advanced quantitative methods to assess treatment outcomes, moderating and mediating factors, and 5)
professional development. This training will be conducted under the primary mentorship of Dr. Rena Wing, with
co-mentors Drs. Rani Elwy, Rebecca Puhl, Graham Thomas, Shira Dunsiger, and contributor Dr. Meghan Butryn.
The skills acquired map directly onto elements of the proposed project but also position the applicant to expand
her program of research in innovative directions. This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure
and resources available through The Miriam Hospital and the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center,
represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicantâs training goals, foster professional development
and establish the applicantâs autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher."
10832015,"Severe maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. disproportionately affect African-American (AA)
women. Inequities occur at many levels, including community, provider/practice, and health system levels. This
proposal will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to address AA maternal
morbidity and mortality in two Michigan counties: Genesee County (which includes Flint) and Kent County (which
includes Grand Rapids). Interventions were developed or co-developed by our partners in these counties, who
include AA women residents, enhanced prenatal and postnatal care (EPC) staff (including race-matched
community health workers), and physician/health system staff and providers.
 Community level intervention. We will expand access to EPC services (i.e., home visiting programs,
Healthy Start programs) using telehealth and flexible scheduling. Despite being designed for minority women,
about 60% of eligible AA women in Michigan do not enroll in EPC services. Pilot work indicates that 50% of
minority women who declined EPC services would participate if a telehealth option was available. We will provide
this option. Provider/practice level intervention. We will address provider and health system implicit and
explicit bias and corresponding structures and practices and make this learning actionable using daylong
experiential trainings. Training will include didactics, reflection, discussion, windshield tours, and brainstorming
ways to tailor participantsâ practices and settings to better meet the needs of perinatal AA women. Training will
include everyone from physicians to front desk staff. System level intervention. We will implement community
care patient safety bundles targeting maternal health disparities throughout the intervention counties.
 We will test the effects of the multilevel intervention using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference
with propensity scores approach to compare pre (2016-2019) to post (2021-2024) changes in outcomes among
Medicaid women in the two intervention counties with similar women in other Michigan counties. The sample
will include all Medicaid insured women observed during pregnancy, at birth, and/or up to 1 year postpartum,
who delivered in Michigan from 2016 â 2024 (approximately 540,000 births, including ~162,000 births to AA
women). Measures will be taken from a pre-existing linked dataset that includes Medicaid claims, death records,
birth records, and EPC program data. The specific aims are to: (1) Assess the effectiveness of the multilevel
intervention on AA severe maternal morbidity and mortality; (2) Test improved service utilization and non-severe
maternal morbidity as mechanisms of the effect of the multilevel intervention on severe maternal morbidity, and
(3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the multilevel intervention. This project will be among the first to evaluate
a multilevel intervention to reduce AA maternal morbidity and mortality at the population level. The trial tests
whether the intervention engages the mechanisms presumed to underlie intervention effects and provides
cost-effectiveness data that systems need to make informed decisions about adoption, speeding implementation."

 Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a classical T-cell mediated autoimmune disease and substantial data implicates
insulin as a dominant autoantigen in T1D disease. In the NOD mouse model of T1D, notable studies have shown
that mice lacking native insulin expression, but with an altered insulin sequence to maintain blood glucose levels,
are completely protected from insulitis and diabetes. Growing evidence also indicates that insulin peptide binding
and orientation within MHC Class II (peptide register) is important in determining the strength of interaction and
recognition by autoreactive T cells. In collaboration with the Kappler lab, we have uncovered an unusual peptide
binding characteristic of the dominant insulin epitope InsB:9-23. The majority of InsB:9-23-specific CD4+ T cells
in the periphery recognize insulin bound in this unusual register 3, and by knocking in a single amino acid
variation (R to E) into just one copy of the insulin gene in NOD mice (Ins2EE/+), the mice are completely protected
against diabetes.
 The development of a âsuper agonistâ version of the insulin dominant epitopes allows us to address several
key questions surrounding the biochemical pathways of peptide generation, presentation by MHC molecules,
and recognitions by auto-reactive pathogenic T cells. Do mutations of the major epitope in the insulin gene allow
CD4+ T effectors or Treg cells specific for these alternative epitopes to develop? Are mimotopes of these
pathogenic epitopes capable of dramatically altering disease outcomes? Are we able to fine tune these epitopes
to alter tolerance mechanisms to shift from deletion to Treg induction? Recent work in our lab has focused on
the identification of the insulin-specific repertoire on key mouse backgrounds, and we plan to utilize these tools
and well-characterized mouse models to examine the effects of altering insulin expression, thymically and
extrathymically. These tools as well as our experience with the generation of numerous TCR-transgenic mouse
lines will allow us to address these questions in the context of T1D.
 Thus, we hypothesize that alterations to epitope presentation and TCR affinity drive the tunning of
the TCR repertoire towards tolerance and away from self-reactivity. Using Insulin as a model antigen, we
propose to test our hypothesis through the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Define the role of central tolerance upon the deletion of insulin-reactive clones
 Aim 2: Characterize the effects of peripheral tolerance on insulin-reactive T cells
 Aim 3: Explore mechanisms of dominate tolerance to understand the potential for translation into
 therapeutic treatments for T1D
 Through these experiments, we hope to gain a nuanced understanding of how changes in insulin epitopes and
antigenicity drive the pathogenesis of diabetes and identify targets for future immune modulation and
 therapeutic intervention for T1D treatment and prevention."

The Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology (Formerly: Scripps
Research Institute-Florida) is requesting funds for the purchase of replacement BioRaptr dispensers to
support its operations in High Throughput Screening at its UF Scripps HTS center for drug discovery.
These plate dispensers are direct replacements of the first-generation Beckman Coulter BioRaptr
instruments that are integrated into our workflow architecture for the preparation of bioassays using 384-
well and 1536-well micro-well plate technology. Although the current BioRaptr dispensers have provided
outstanding service, they are now obsolete having been used for ~17-years (first installed: 2006) and
reached End of Support from the OEM (Beckman Coulter: ~2016); having been maintained by our
internal engineering staff since. However sourcing parts, software upgrades and the obsolete operating
system (Microsoft XP: end of support 2014) are no longer sustainable and compliant with UF IT
informatics security and servicing needs. The UF Scripps HTS center seeks funds to purchase the three
BioRaptr dispenser replacements needed to continue providing full HTS support to our UF Scripps
faculty and the broader NIH research community as a whole. In addition, to provide extended support
for antiviral and infectious disease drug screening (1U19AI171954), a miniaturized version of the
BioRaptr known as the Precise Dropâ¢ II Micro-Dispensing System, which is compatible with biosafety
laminar flow-hood usage, is requested. Plate dispensers are a critical component of HTS screening
campaigns having the task of preparing bioassay titer plates for parallel workflow processing employed
in our HTS screening operations. These units are capable of dispensing a variety of biologicals including
buffers, proteins, detection agents, wash reagents and living cells with high precision and broad 50nL
to 100uL range. Their loss of function would essentially impede the execution of parallel HTS screening
operations needed to meet time-dependent workflow obligations. No other dispensers with 1536w
capabilities are available at the Herbert Wertheim UF Scripps Institute. The UF Scripps HTS center
served as one of four comprehensive HTS centers commissioned by the NIH during the MLPCN
program (2005-2013). In this MLPCN era, we had performed over 280 HTS campaigns using these plate
dispensers. To date well over 400 HTS drug discovery campaigns have been supported through the use
of these dispensers. It is crucial that these devices be replaced in a timely fashion to avoid crippling
ongoing NIH-funded activities and hindering research programs aimed at advancing basic and
translational research. Instrument support from the NIH will help ensure that the UF Scripps HTS
`services can meet its current and future obligations in a timely fashion without interruption to NIH-funded
HTS activities."

Aggregation and propagation of misfolded proteins in the form of abnormal inclusions is a common feature of
numerous neurodegenerative diseases. A majority of brains with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are
characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of transactivation response element DNA binding protein-43
(TDP-43) into insoluble inclusions. Given that TDP-43 is among the most recently identified pathologic
precipitates, the goal of Cycle 1 of this project was to explore the relationship between TDP-43 inclusions,
cellular alterations, cortical atrophy and disease phenotype in FTLD and in a conditionally transgenic mouse
model expressing wild-type human (h) TDP-43 in the forebrain. We observed that density of TDP-43
inclusions, neuronal shrinkage, and density of activated microglia in cortical gray and white matter are
concordant with patterns of cortical atrophy and disease phenotype and that TDP-43 inclusions may spread
trans-synaptically. In TDP-43 transgenic mice, we confirmed regionally selective cortical atrophy, and
progressive TDP-43 accumulation and inclusion formation, gliosis, apoptosis and behavioral alterations
consistent with the pathologic and behavioral alterations in FTLD. Importantly, the density of activated
microglia displayed the closest and most consistent relationship with cortical atrophy and disease phenotype in
FTLD. Cycle 2 of this project builds upon the observations during Cycle 1 and will focus on the role of microglia
/ immune activation, including synaptic pruning as disease spreads. We will conduct a comprehensive survey
of microglia / immune gene and protein expression changes in brains of FTLD and hTDP transgenic mice, will
explore alterations in synapses and synaptic proteins in FTLD and potential role of microglia mediated pruning
in synaptic loss, and will investigate the role of microglia generated exosomes in spread of TDP-43 pathology
in the mouse model. We propose to base this investigation on rigorous quantitative methods, including
unbiased stereological quantification and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in a unique set of autopsy specimens
with extensive clinical and pathological information and in a mouse model which recapitulates features of
human disease. The specific aims of the proposed research will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1. FTLD-
TDP and hTDP-43 transgenic mouse brains will display regionally selective alterations in microglia
transcriptome and associated immune proteins. Aim 2. FTLD-TDP and hTDP-43 transgenic mice will display
substantial, early and regionally specific loss of synapses that is due in part to abnormal synaptic pruning by
microglia. Aim 3. hTDP-43 transgenic mice will display trans-synaptic spread of TDP-43 pathology over time in
the hippocampus and microglia derived exosomes facilitate this spread in the hippocampus and across cortex.
The proposed research will generate a great deal of information on the status of synapses and potential trans-
synaptic spread of TDP pathology as well as the role of microglia in these processes and in immune
alterations. The findings have the potential to illuminate pathways that can serve as therapeutic targets."

Age-related loss in muscle mass, sarcopenia, is a major medical problem facing the elderly and correlates with
loss of metabolic function, disabilities, morbidity, and mortality. In addition, prolonged culture times are required
to obtain the large numbers of cells necessary for regenerative medicine. As a result, the quality of the cells that
are used to engineer tissues for cell therapies may be compromised by replicative senescence.
 In the past few years, our laboratory discovered that expression of a pluripotency-associated embryonic
transcription factor, NANOG, could reverse senescence and completely restore the differentiation potential of
senescent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and cells from progeria (accelerated aging disease) patients into
functional smooth muscle cells. We also discovered that NANOG could reverse the impaired ability of senescent
stem cells to produce collagen type III and elastin, which are severely affected by aging and affect the mechanical
properties of tissues such as skin, arteries and skeletal muscle. Most recently we discovered that NANOG
reversed the hallmarks of cellular senescence and restored the metabolic program of senescent skeletal
myoblasts, ultimately restoring their ability form contractile myotubes and regenerate in response to
injury.
 In this proposal we seek to better understand the mechanisms that mediate the effect of NANOG in vitro and
in vivo through the following aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the effects of NANOG on myoblast senescence in
traditional cultures as well as using bioengineered 3D skeletal muscle tissues. NANOG is expressed after cells
reach senescence, thereby enabling us to measure the reversal of the aging phenotype using a plethora of
cellular, molecular and functional assays. In Aim 2, we will study the effects of NANOG on restoring the metabolic
function of aged myoblasts. We propose to study in detail the NANOG-induced metabolic reprogramming of
aged cells and investigate potential signaling pathways that may mediate these effects. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
develop a very innovative mouse model to investigate the effects of NANOG on animal physiology, skeletal
muscle metabolism and regeneration.
 Impact: This is a very innovative proposal that seeks to investigate the potential of an embryonic
transcription factor to ameliorate the effects of aging and enhance the regenerative ability of aged skeletal muscle
(SkM). Understanding the mechanism(s) that mediate the effects of NANOG on metabolic reprogramming of
aged SkM may enable identification of novel druggable targets and design of innovative strategies to restore the
function of aged tissues. Given the surge in the aging population in the US and the world, the debilitating
effects of aging on skeletal muscle and the resulting frailty condition affecting the elderly, successful attainment
of this work may have significant impact in regenerative medicine and the quality of life of elderly patients."
10862648,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The presence of lipid-rich deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a pathologic feature of
early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Drusen development has been associated with RPE lipid
metabolism, redox biology and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Mutations in a gene affecting ECM
degradation, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3), results in a rare inherited retinal degeneration with
similar clinical features to AMD, called Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy (SFD). The mechanism by which abnormal
ECM turnover influences lipid metabolism and RPE redox resulting in the formation of sub-RPE deposits
remains unknown.
The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that ECM degradation overloads the RPE with ECM-derived
metabolites, resulting in the reprogramming of RPE towards lipid synthesis and mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism. This in turn results in the deposition of excess lipids and reduced antioxidative capacity of the
RPE. The proposed specific aims are:
Aim 1. Determine the influence of ECM degradation on lipid metabolism. Our preliminary results show
that increased ECM degradation in SFD RPE activates lipid synthesis and oxidation of branch-chain amino
acids (BCAAs). BCAAs are ketogenic and abundant in the ECM. The goal of Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis
that ECM degradation of protein-rich components reprograms RPE metabolism towards enhanced BCAA
oxidation for lipid synthesis and lipid deposition. We will use quantitative proteomics, quantitative
metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis, perifusion assays, CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, and single cell nuclear
RNA-Seq of patient-derived iPSC RPE to comprehensively investigate the metabolic pathways in ECM
remodeling and lipid deposition.
Aim 2. Determine the influence of ECM degradation on redox metabolism. Our preliminary data show that
both NADPH and glutathione are depleted in SFD RPE, and ECM-derived metabolites interfere with NADPH
and glutathione metabolism. The goal of Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that increased ECM turnover results in
impaired NADPH and glutathione metabolism. We will quantify the metabolic flux of ECM degradation,
determine the roles of ECM-related metabolites in NADPH production and glutathione synthesis, and restore
cellular redox with different approaches to enhance antioxidative capacity.
The proposed research will define the biochemical impacts of ECM turnover on RPE metabolism, including
changes in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, and identify the relationship between nutrient metabolism,
protein synthesis and degradation, and redox biology in normal and disease-relevant RPE."
10862650,"Title: A âSTICKâ theranostic nanoplatform for image-guided drug delivery to brain malignancies
Project Summary/Abstract
Our long-term goal is to engineer a new and generalizable drug delivery platform to improve the delivery of various
payloads to a series of brain malignancies and neurological disorders. The payloads can be imaging agents,
chemotherapeutics, molecularly targeted drugs and immunotherapeutics. We identified the following major barriers for
successful treatment of brain malignancies: 1) the blood-brain barrier/blood-brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB), 2)
severe destabilizing effect in blood circulation that leads to a poor central nervous system (CNS) pharmacokinetics
(PK) and 3) inability for agents to penetrate tumor tissue, and 4) lack of specificity for tumor cell delivery; resulting in
poor treatment efficacy and off-target toxicity. To this end, we propose an integrated approach to mitigate these
physiological barriers and mediate drug delivery to ensure disease targeting specificity. The goal of this revised
R01 renewal application is to develop a new Sequential Targeting In CrosslinKing (STICK) nano-delivery
platform to improve the drug delivery to brain malignancies. The characteristics of the proposed STICK
nanoparticle (STICK NP) allow it to overcome the multiple barriers to penetrate deeply in brain malignancies. In
Aim1, we will engineer new STICK NPs by designing new types of boronate crosslinkages to improve their
CNS PK to maximize the time window to enhance the glucose transporter (GLUT1)-mediated transcytosis
across the BBB/BBTB. The new crosslinkages also enhance the pH-responsive size transformation for
improved tumor tissue penetration and sialic acid-targeting selectivity for enhanced tumor cell specificity. Our
previous R01 grant focused on low grade brain tumors and as a logical but distinctive extension in this
research topic, the target of our current project is diffuse midline glioma (DMG, previously called Diffuse Intrinsic
Pontine Glioma (DIPG)), a high grade and the most aggressive form of pediatric glioma. DMG is the second
most common type of primary, high grade brain tumor occurring in children with a median survival <1 year from
diagnosis and the five-year survival rate of DMG is only around 2%. Discovery of the characteristic Histone 3-Lysine-
27-Methionine (H3K27M) mutation offers opportunity for development of targeted epigenetic therapies for this deadly
disease. In Aim2, we will quantitatively determine the spatiotemporal distribution of the newly engineered
STICK NPs in orthotopic DMG patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and elucidate their delivery
mechanisms by optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-
MS), and a series of biophysical approaches. In Aim3, two promising epigenetic drugs (panobinostat and
ONC201) will be specifically delivered to DMG by encapsulations within selected STICK NPs for epigenetic
therapy. The efficacy, toxicity, and molecular responses in tumor microenvironment will be investigated in
orthotopic PDX models and genetically engineered murine (GEM) DMG models. This project has the great
potential to significantly improve the clinical outcomes of DMG treatment. This concept can also be applied to
improve the treatment of many other brain malignancies such as glioblastoma and brain metastases."

 The extensive family of the Coronins plays an important role in regulating the actin
networks that drive cell migration, polarity, cell shape and intracellular trafficking, and
thereby contribute to essential biological processes ranging from innate immunity to
neuronal signaling. However, these functions and activities have been characterized for
the canonical Coronins. In stark contrast, we know next to nothing about the cellular
roles and actin cytoskeleton regulation of the structurally distinct class of the tandem
Coronins, which comprises Coronin 7 (Coro7), POD-1, and CorB. Our preliminary data
show that mammalian Coro7 can control Arp2/3-mediated nucleation, although the
mechanism underlying this activity remains elusive. In addition, we show that this actin-
regulatory activity can regulate NPF-induced actin networks that drive intracellular
membrane transport, including autophagy, a process used by cells to dispose of
unwanted organelles, misfolded proteins and toxic aggregates. Using a multidisciplinary
approach comprising state-of-the-art biochemical, biophysical, genetic and live-imaging
techniques we propose here to elucidate 1) how Coro7 structurally interacts with Arp2/3,
2) how Coro7 mechanistically inhibits Arp2/3-mediated nucleation by nucleation
promoting factors, and 3) by other Arp2/3 regulators, and 4) how these actin-regulatory
activities of Coro7 regulate the turnover of the branched actin networks that drive
autophagy."

 The Integrative Training in the Neurobiology of Addictive Behaviors Program at The University of Chicago
offers training for both pre- and postdoctoral trainees in drug abuse-related research. Our core faculty trainers
are productive researchers with successful training credentials. Their expertise ranges from molecular biology,
electrophysiology, pharmacology and animal models of drug addiction, to the social, behavioral and
psychopharmacological aspects of human drug use, including etiology, treatment and drug policy. Quantitative
approaches and reproducibility are emphasized. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of scientists to
investigate the etiology, prevention and treatment of drug abuse with integrative approaches.
 We propose a program for 3 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees. Trainees will be supported by the
Training Program for 1-3 years (usually 2 years). Trainees obtain specialized intensive training in their âhomeâ
laboratories, but they are also exposed to the full breadth of addictions research outside their own area. To
ensure that there is substantial interaction among the trainees, and between trainees and trainers, we
schedule bi-weekly meetings consisting of journal club presentations and seminars by invited speakers.
Didactic courses range from molecular cellular neuroscience to systems and behavioral neuroscience, from
statistics to computational neuroscience and bioinformatics, from genetics and epidemiology to treatment and
policy. One other mechanism by which our T32 has enhanced training experience is the âexternshipâ program,
in which our trainees receive mentored experiences in laboratories or settings removed from their own. The
organizational structure includes an Executive Committee making overall training decisions, a Selection
Committee to ensure a good flow and balance of trainees, a Program and Review Committee to monitor
traineesâ progress, and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert outside consultation.
 The University of Chicago provides a unique environment with both a long history of interdisciplinary
collaboration and recently a significant commitment to neuroscience research. This provides a rich intellectual
context for trainees in drug abuse related research. In addition to the trainees supported by the T32, we have
added Associate Members so that any trainee who is interested in addiction research can participate in any of
the T32 sponsored activities. This allows us to bring together other trainees and faculty from across campus to
raise consciousness about addiction research and its relevance to other disciplines. It brings in new expertise
to the group and significantly enriches training opportunities. We will devote resources to recruiting
underrepresented minorities and we will provide comprehensive training in ethical conduct of research."

 Despite many advances in the field, the pathogenesis of autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases
(AIMDs) remains incompletely understood but appears to be multifactorial; genetic and environmental factors
are implicated in the aberrant inflammatory responses in many AIMDs, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
psoriatic spectrum diseases (PSD) and Sjogrenâs syndrome (SS). Among potential triggers for these disorders
is the human microbiome, the communities of microorganisms that inhabit most body sites and surfaces.
Perturbations in the the skin, oral and gut microbiome are known to induce host immune cell activation,
downstream inflammation, and persistent tissue damage, contributing to the development of various AIMDs.
 The last three decades have also witnessed fundamental advances in AIMD therapeutics. For example,
the use of methotrexate and subsequent incorporation of biologic treatments has led to substantial improvements
in RA and PSD clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients. However, despite this
progress a significant question remains unanswered: why do over 50% of patients with moderate to severe
disease fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics â an emerging field of study that
investigates the effects of variations of the human gut microbiome on drugs â promises to overcome these
barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in AIMDs. Further, studying the microbiome in the
context of the AMP-AIM Networkâs goal of disease reconstruction through high dimensional analytics of
tissue biopsies and samples will create a unique opportunity to incorporate potential triggers of immune activation
and predictors of drug response.
 With a multidisciplinary team composed of computational biologists, rheumatologists, geneticists, and
microbiome researchers, we propose the creation of Micro-TeACH (Microbiome Technology and Analytic
Center Hub), a formal expansion of a longstanding NYC-based collaboration between Drs. Scher, Heguy (NYU
Grossman School of Medicine) and Clemente (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) that will integrate expertise in
AIMDs (RA, PSD and inflammatory bowel disease), extensive and well-phenotyped biosamples, and state-of-
the-art microbiomics methods to AMP AIM with the ultimate goals of: 1) identifying microbes and microbial
pathways as potential determinants of disease pathogenesis; 2) interrogating host-microbe spatial
interactions in affected tissues; and 3) discovering microbiome-based precision medicine approaches.
 To achieve these goals, we will utilize the unique resources available to our groups and integrate our
software pipelines, microbiomics expertise, and data/metadata with biosamples and data accrued by all AMP
AIM Disease Teams, Technology and Analytic Cores, System Biology Cores and Knowledge Portal. This
approach should elevate the overarching aim of the AMP AIM Program, which seeks to gain a comprehensive
understanding of molecular and cellular disease pathways and to identify novel targets for intervention."
10834183,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
African Americans are disproportionality burdened by tobacco in the United States. African American smokers
experience the highest rates of tobacco-attributable disease, cancer incidence and mortality. Striking health
disparities exist despite the fact that African Americans have similar smoking prevalence as Whites, yet smoke
fewer cigarettes per day (cpd). To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers,
effective treatment for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Further, because smoking
cessation rates tend to be lower for African American smokers, it is necessary to find methods of increasing
response to pharmacotherapy to better promote abstinence in this high-risk group. Extended treatment has
been demonstrated to increase abstinence in White smokers but has never been examined in African
American smokers, who might benefit from extended medication support for quitting and for reducing relapse.
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate extended use of varenicline, the leading FDA-approved
medication for tobacco treatment, with the goal of enhancing abstinence in African American daily smokers,
including the full spectrum of light, moderate, and heavy smokers. Our specific aims are to 1) evaluate the
efficacy of extended varenicline treatment to promote smoking cessation at end of treatment (Month 6) and at
long-term follow-up (Months 9 and 12), 2) examine medication adherence over the course of treatment and its
impact on treatment outcomes, 3) evaluate change in negative affect, withdrawal, and craving across treatment
conditions and their impact on treatment outcomes, 4) identify individual factors predicting smoking abstinence,
and 5) characterize patterns of tobacco use and abstinence over the course of standard and extended
treatment. These aims will be accomplished using a two-arm, randomized design to evaluate the efficacy of
extended (6 months) varenicline treatment compared to standard (12 weeks) varenicline treatment. Baseline
randomization stratified by gender will assign participants (N=500) to receive extended treatment (EXT; 26
weeks of varenicline, n=250) or standard treatment (ST; 12 weeks of varenicline, n=250). All participants will
receive culturally-relevant, individualized smoking cessation counseling, including support for medication
adherence, and will be followed through Month 12. This study is the first to examine the efficacy of extended
varenicline treatment to increase abstinence among African American smokers, including the full spectrum of
daily smoking level. It is the first to examine extended varenicline for all smokers, not only confirmed quitters,
and among the first to examine patterns of quitting, lapse, and relapse among African American smokers.
Findings will enrich our understanding of the interrelationship of key biological factors to smoking factors and
treatment response. Success in increasing long-term abstinence rates would significantly impact clinical
practice for treatment of this high-risk group. Increased treatment efficacy will have major impact on reducing
tobacco-related disparities, morbidity, and mortality."

Heterochromatin, a gene repressive nuclear structure, patterns the genome into active and inactive regions. This
patterning is necessary to preserve the structural integrity of the genome and to drive and maintain
developmental fates. Heterochromatin is seeded by DNA-sequences, but heterochromatin assembly can
continue distal to those seeding sites via a process called âspreadingâ. In spreading, âwriterâ enzymes propagate
key chemical histone marks along chromatin that attract the gene repressive machinery required for the normal
function of heterochromatin. Spreading is responsible for tha majority of heterochromatin assembly. The parent
grant set out to investigate three major questions about heterochromatin spreading: 1. What are the biochemical
mechanisms underlying it? 2. How can heterochromatin spread over loci of vastly different chemical, structural,
and stability regimes? And 3. How is the reaction tuned to expand or contract during development to stabilize
cell fate switches? In this supplement application, we will train a Junior Specialist, Nathan Ho to develop methods
relevant to the 1st question above, concerning the biochemical mechanisms of the âwriterâ-mediated spreading
process. Specially, Nathan will continue to develop a simple and robust, but powerful, single molecule approach
we have devised together with the Mullins lab at UCSF. In this approach, chromatin templates are deposited
onto patterns on coverslips. These patterns, which can be of any shape and, crucially, density, are formed by a
micropatterning system that removes passivating agents in a UV light-dependent process. Molecules on the
coverslip are visualized via Total Internal Reflection microscopy. Using this micropatterning system we want to
ask 1. How âwriterâ enzymes engage with different chromatin substrates and 2. how different forms of the âwriterâ
enzymes behave on chromatin. Finally, we want to 3. reconstitute part of the spreading process on this platform.
Importantly, the basics of the approach have been worked out by a prior research technician, setting up Nathan
for a productive time in the laboratory. The supplement application is further focused on Nathanâs mentoring,
training, and career development. We have designed an integrative research experience plan that is motivated
by Nathanâs Individual Development Plan. The plan focusses on the following three main areas: 1. In-lab training
and development of data analysis and experimental design skills, 2. Development of science communication
skills, and 3. Preparation for successful application to graduate school for the fall of 2025, the central goal of
Nathanâs IDP. We believe the scientific, mentoring and career development aims are well balanced to enable
substantial new insight into âwriterâ enzyme activity on chromatin and development of Nathan as an independent,
critically thinking young scientist."

The candidate is an accomplished neurogastroenterologist with formal training in epidemiological methods and
a commitment to a career in clinical and translational research in the study of functional GI disease. The
candidateâs long-term career goal is to become an independently-funded physician investigator, maintaining a
clinical research program in functional GI diseases. The candidateâs short-term career goals are to: 1) develop
large analytic datasets based upon established cohorts; 2) design and interpret metagenomic data, including
application of microbiota-environment interaction methodology; 3) acquire skills in the analysis and interpretation
of gut metabolomics data; 4) evolve clinical trial skills into multimodal models with potential for mechanistic and
causative analyses; 5) establish and maintain a longitudinal cohort with detailed dietary, lifestyle, and physiologic
measurements of subjects with FI; 6) produce the data and publications necessary to transition into a successful
R01 application. This application outlines the institutional commitment, research plan, career development
activities, and key mentors involved to ensure the candidate accomplishes these goals. In prior work, the
candidate has demonstrated that dietary fiber is associated with a lower risk of incident fecal incontinence (FI)
among elderly women, suggesting a preventative role for fiber in the development of FI. Nonetheless, data on
the influence of fiber in other populations and potential biological mechanisms underlying associations with FI
are lacking. In this proposal, the candidate seeks to fill this knowledge gap through a comprehensive examination
of the complex interaction between fiber and alterations in the intestinal microbial environment in the etiology
and severity of FI. The specific goals of this study are to 1) estimate the relative benefit of increased dietary fiber
in the development and progression of FI using large well-characterized cohorts; 2) determine specific
metagenomic profiles associated with prevalent FI and determine the mediating effect of dietary fiber on risk of
FI; 3) examine the effects of fiber supplementation on symptom severity, anorectal physiology, and the gut
microbiome in women with IBS-D and FI. As an integral part of this proposal, the candidateâs career development
will be complemented by participation in advanced coursework to develop expertise in nutritional epidemiology,
clinical trial design and conduct, and bioinformatics including the approach to metagenomic and metabolomic
data. A formal mentorship committee, consisting of multidisciplinary experts in nutritional epidemiology, the
microbiome, and GI motility will provide supervision, guidance, and assistance for the candidate to achieve his
goals. The research environment, which includes the Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, the Channing
Laboratory, and the Harvard School of Public Health will provide a rich, collaborative, and intellectually
stimulating atmosphere to ensure the candidateâs success. Through this award, the candidate will emerge as an
independent clinical investigator by contributing to our understanding of the role of fiber in the etiopathogenesis
of FI through a series of studies that bridge epidemiologic correlation and disease causation."

The principal goal of this proposal is to combine multiscale mathematical modeling with novel computational
model-driven quantitative experimental platforms to develop a comprehensive and predictive 3D computational
framework. Bladder cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the United States and in its advanced
stages the 5-year survival rates are below 35%. Given the poor outcomes with chemotherapy in advanced cases,
immunotherapy has emerged as an exciting domain for exploration. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-
1/PD-L1 âimmune checkpointâ pathway have resulted in favorable outcomes in advanced bladder cancer, and 5
drugs targeting this pathway have been approved in the past two years. Unfortunately, the objective response
rates of current FDA approved immunotherapy drugs remain less than 25%. An alternative treatment strategy
for bladder cancer is small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3), and early
clinical studies using these molecular-targeted agents have shown promise. Recently published data supporting
the co-acting combination of potent immune checkpoint inhibitors and specific FGFR3 inhibitors potentially offer
an advance in targeted therapeutics for cancer. A powerful and practical way to optimize novel drug combinations
for clinical cancer treatment is to use sophisticated, data-driven computational models. Our proposed agent-
based model platform will both aid in the characterization of tumor-immune dynamics and also suggest the best
strategies for administering therapeutic combinations of immune-checkpoint and receptor kinase inhibitors. The
model will be parameterized at the molecular and cellular scales by an innovative high-throughput image
quantification pipeline that allows T-cell or cancer cell behaviors and interactions to be observed, tracked, and
quantified. Importantly, this model system pipeline can measure the antigen burden on tumor cells and the
proportion of the two types of T-cell cytotoxicity (Fas-ligand vs. granule-based). Our experimentally-driven
multiscale approach is posed to (1) significantly enhance the current understanding of the impact of differential
cell-kill mechanisms on tumor-immune outcomes; (2) optimize the administration of combination therapy and
maximize tumor response; and (3) to improve the ability to select the most promising drugs for the clinical trials.
While based on tumors of the bladder, the platform that we are developing is easily adaptable for the study of
any therapy targeted to immune checkpoint proteins and receptor kinases in any tumor type. The true
significance of our work lies in its translational value: our experimental and theoretical studies will be able to test
clinically relevant hypotheses regarding the prospect of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune
checkpoint inhibitors to impact the mechanism of tumor cell kill by immune cells in distinct ways. Cancer is one
of the leading causes of death for Americans and at present the overall effectiveness of therapeutic treatments
is only approximately 50%. The development treatment optimization tools could have enormous and immediate
impact on the lives of millions of people diagnosed with cancer."

Older persons with HIV (PWH) experience high rates of non-infectious, aging-related
comorbidities including frailty, diabetes (DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the
general population. Geroscience approaches focus on therapeutically targeting fundamental
aging processes to delay onset of or alleviate aging-related comorbidities. Cellular senescence is
a fundamental aging process for which targeted compounds have recently been identified. This
process is characterized by stable growth arrest and chronic inflammation, measurable markers
of which are known as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Senescent cell
burden and SASP-related factors have been associated with frailty, diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease in persons without HIV. Compared to tissue markers of cellular senescence, soluble
SASP biomarkers are easier to obtain, allowing their application more diverse clinical settings
However, associations between soluble SASP biomarkers and frailty, DM, and CVD have not
been well-characterized among PWH. The proposed study will examine the longitudinal
associations between levels of soluble SASP biomarkers and frailty, CM, and CVD in older PWH
in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5322/ HIV Infection, Aging, and Immune Function Long-
term Observational Study (HAILO). This study will extend the work of our currently funded cross-
sectional analysis of SASP biomarkers and frailty, DM, and CVD among HAILO participants and
be the first to characterize the longitudinal associations between SASP biomarkers and these
conditions of interest among PWH. The findings from this study will provide pilot data for potential
biomarkers to be targeted in future interventional trials using senotherapeutic agents to prevent
or alleviate frailty, DM, or CVD among older PWH."

A general principle of brain function is the ability to store information about the past to better predict and prepare for the
future. Working memory and timing are two computational features that evolved to allow the brain to use recent
information about the past to accomplish short-term goals. Working memory refers to the ability to transiently store
information in a flexible manner, while timing refers to the ability to generate well timed motor responses, modulate
attention in time, and predict when external events will occur. To date working memory and timing have primarily been
treated as independent processes. Here we propose that because the brain seeks to use information about the past to
predict the future, that working memory and timing are often multiplexed. Specifically, that the neural patterns of activity
recorded during the delay period of many working memory tasks encodes both retrospective information about the
past, as well as prospective predictions about the future. To test this hypothesis, we have developed novel variant of
the delayed- nonmatch-to-sample task, in which the first cue predicts the duration of the delay, that is, how long an item
must be held in working memory. This task will allow us to determine if network level population responses encode both
retrospective information about the past and prospective information about delay duration. Preliminary results from a
supervised recurrent neural network model predict that the temporal structure of the neural patterns of activity elicited
by both cues will be different. This prediction will be tested using large scale Ca2+-imaging to characterize the
spatiotemporal patterns of activity in brain areas associated with working memory and timing. Additionally, optogenetic
perturbation experiments and longitudinal characterization of the emergence of neural patterns of activity will be
performed. These experiments, will in turn, be used to ground computational studies aimed at understanding the
neuronal and circuit level learning rules that underlie the emergence of patterns that encode working memory and time."

10832666,"The overall goal of the project is to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that link dysfunction of the
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to degeneration of the choriocapillaris (CC). Choroidal atrophy is an early
pathological change in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in elderly
people. The RPE produces a number of trophic factors that support the structural integrity of the choroidal
vasculature. Aging and age-related degeneration can interfere with the functional interactions between the
RPE and CC. The underlying disease mechanisms are largely unclear. We found that the mouse model of
RPE-specific overactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) recapitulated many
of the clinical features of CC dropout. RPE cells with high mTORC1 activity had increased release of
angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2), a vascular destabilizing factor that is usually produced by endothelial cells (ECs)
and exerts autocrine effects on its receptor TIE2. We further identified that the secretion of ANGPT2 from RPE
was likely mediated by the upregulation and activation of a phosphoprotein DARPP-32. Based on these novel
findings, we hypothesize that ANGPT2 production and secretion from the RPE contribute to the degeneration
of choroid under pathological conditions that involve dysregulated mTORC1 signaling. The hypothesis will be
tested in three specific aims. Aim 1 is to determine whether mTORC1 activation in the RPE will stimulate
ANGPT2 secretion via DARPP-32-dependent mechanisms. Aim 2 is to examine whether ANGPT2 can
regulate the function of choroidal ECs via TIE2-dependent or independent pathways. Aim 3 is to determine
whether genetic knockout of ANGPT2 in the RPE, or AAV-mediated overexpression of ANGPT2 will influence
the CC atrophy in the mouse model of mTORC1 hyperactivation. The results from these studies will provide
insights on how the AMD-related signaling events in the RPE impact its support to the CC. The newly identified
ANGPT2-TIE2 axis between the RPE and choroidal ECs can be a molecular pathway for the therapeutic
intervention of choroidal atrophy."

Pregnant women are universally screened for gestational diabetes (GDM) at 24-28 weeks gestation because
of the well-established link between hyperglycemia and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the past decade,
hemoglobin A1c (A1C), which measures the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs), has
transformed the diagnosis of diabetes outside of pregnancy. While A1C has modernized diabetes diagnosis in
non-pregnant individuals, pregnant women continue to be diagnosed with GDM using cumbersome oral
glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), which require fasting and multiple timed blood draws, and have problems
with intra-individual reproducibility. Despite its potential advantages, A1C has not been adopted to screen for
GDM because it is affected by pregnancy-related changes in RBC kinetics, rendering simple A1C-based
inferences of glycemia during gestation unreliable. We and others have demonstrated how pregnancy disrupts
the strong relationship between A1C and glycemia due to pregnancy-related changes in RBC kinetics. In
previous work, we have also successfully used mechanistic modeling to adjust A1Cs for non-glycemic variation
outside of pregnancy. The goal of this proposal, Glycemic Observation Using A1C for Gestational Diabetes
Diagnosis (GO A1C GDM), is to optimize A1Câs ability to detect hyperglycemia in pregnancy by adjusting for
gestational changes in RBC kinetics that affect A1Câs relationship with glycemia. We will leverage accurate
longitudinal glycemic measurements from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and rigorous ascertainment of
hyperglycemia-associated adverse outcomes in 2150 pregnant women participating in the Glycemic
Observation and Metabolic Outcomes in Mothers and Offspring study (GO MOMs) to accomplish this goal. In
GO MOMs, participants will have A1Cs measured and undergo serial 10-day periods of CGM monitoring at 4
time points across pregnancy. Our proposal, GO A1C GDM, adds serial hematologic measurements (CBCs,
reticulocyte counts, and ferritin) across gestation and employs mechanistic modeling to improve A1C-based
glycemia estimation during pregnancy. In Aim 1, we will adjust A1C for typical gestational changes in RBC
kinetics (GA-adjusted A1C). In Aim 2, we will personalize A1C adjustments, using hematologic measurements
to capture gestational changes in RBC kinetics specific to individuals (CBC-adjusted A1C). In Aim 3, we will
test the ability of A1Cs adjusted for RBC kinetics to predict hyperglycemia-associated adverse outcomes. We
will compare this predictive ability to that of traditional OGTT-based GDM diagnosis. The proposed
investigations have potential to greatly simplify the method by which we diagnose GDM, delivering advances in
precision diabetes screening to the entire obstetric population."

Radiological markers or clips are an essential diagnostic and surgical tool. Radiological clips made of titanium
or gold are widely used, compatible with MRI and have proven safe for use in human patients. These clips come
in many shapes and sizes and are visible with both X-ray and ultrasound. The clips provide large ultrasonic
scattering signals because they are made of gold or titanium, which have large impedance mismatch with tissue.
For example, patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy have
clips placed in the tumors so that surgeons can locate and excise, with accuracy, residual cancer tissue.
 Over the last fifteen years, we have been developing quantitative ultrasound (QUS) imaging techniques for
a number of applications including monitoring of therapy response. We have demonstrated that QUS techniques
can detect the response of tumors to therapy because QUS is sensitive to the presence of cell death. Recently,
we were able to implement this approach in a small clinical study, where we demonstrated the ability of QUS to
definitively detect and predict the response of LABC patients to chemotherapy between one and four weeks from
therapy onset. We verified that QUS could identify LABC therapy responders and nonresponders.
 However, we hypothesize that accuracies of QUS estimates in humans can be dramatically improved by
incorporating a novel calibration procedure that utilizes appropriate radiological clips as an in situ calibration
target. Clinically, these clips are already being placed in tumors for various diagnostic tasks. By inserting an
appropriate type of clip, the clip can be used as an in situ calibration providing a reference signal for QUS
estimates. The in situ reference will automatically correct for attenuation and transmission losses from overlying
tissue layers. Current reference phantom techniques are incomplete in providing corrections for attenuation and
transmission losses. Therefore, the use of appropriate radiological clips as calibration targets will provides
superior bias and variance of QUS estimates resulting in improved accuracy for identifying LABC response.
 The scientific premise of the proposed research is that radiological markers used for X-ray and conventional
ultrasound can also be used as an in situ calibration target for improving QUS estimates in vivo. Novel calibration
procedures will be tested and refined in phantom studies, in animals models of cancer and finally validated in
human breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy using QUS to identify early responders to
therapy. To verify this scientific premise we propose three specific aims. 1) Develop and refine an in situ
calibration approach in phantom studies that accounts for layering effects on QUS estimates thereby improving
QUS estimate accuracy. 2) Validate the in situ calibration approach in animal models of cancer and quantify
calibration properties in a longitudinal study. 3) Collect longitudinal QUS patient data at early time points during
the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a novel in situ calibration procedure and quantify the
improvements of QUS classifier accuracy with the in situ calibration approach."

Driver mutations in genes encoding the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are present in >80%
of lower-grade gliomas and the high-grade tumors that arise from them. To identify new therapeutic targets for
this incurable disease, our laboratory recently conducted an unbiased drug screen and discovered that IDH
oncogenes confer dependence on the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway for glioma cell survival.
Despite our identification of this vulnerability, the molecular mechanism linking IDH mutations and dependence
on de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis is unknown. Therefore, I developed a platform to comprehensively
profile nitrogen metabolism in patient-derived IDH mutant glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) treated with either
vehicle or an inhibitor of mutant IDH, identifying the contribution of glutamine to pyrimidine nucleotides as among
the most differentially regulated metabolic networks between these conditions. I subsequently found evidence of
disjunction between the two main routes for pyrimidine nucleotide production: de novo synthesis and salvage
pathways. Both pathways contribute to synthesis of uridine monophosphate (UMP), the metabolite from which
all other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived. My research revealed that although IDH mutant GSCs use both
pathways to produce UMP, these cells preferentially use UMP derived from the de novo pathway to synthesize
pyrimidine nucleotides downstream of UMP. This phenotype was not observed in human astrocytes, suggesting
that it may be tumor specific. I hypothesize that IDH mutant glioma cells are dependent on de novo pyrimidine
synthesis because they harbor a novel metabolic enzyme complex that channels UMP from the de novo
synthesis pathway to downstream pyrimidines. I will test this hypothesis through three studies. First, I will
evaluate whether this pyrimidine synthesis partitioning phenotype is unique to IDH mutant GSCs by performing
stable isotope tracing studies across a panel of IDH mutant and IDH wild-type patient-derived GSCs. Second, I
will test whether pyrimidine biosynthesis enzymes form a complex in IDH mutant GSCs but not in human
astrocytes using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation with Western blotting. Third, I will
test the relevance of pyrimidine synthesis pathway disjunction for de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor therapy
with in vivo stable isotope tracing. I will perform these experiments in conjunction with treatment with a de novo
pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft model of IDH mutant glioma. The
proposed research has the potential to uncover new modes of regulation of nucleotide metabolism and answer
vital mechanistic questions surrounding a new synthetic lethality-based treatment strategy that is poised to enter
clinical testing in patients with IDH mutant glioma."

Compelling evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early feature in susceptible
neurons in the brains of patients with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and plays a critical role in
pathogenesis, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of cAMP
and cGMP, second messengers that regulate important cellular functions. Interestingly, recent studies
demonstrated that cAMP/cGMP-PKA/PKG signaling is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial
dynamics and expression/assembly of key enzymes in the electron transport chain (ETC) and
mitochondrial respiration. Among the many PDEs, PDE2A is the most highly expressed PDE in the
hippocampus and frontal/temporal cortex, brain regions vulnerable to AD. Our preliminary studies
found increased PDE2A expression in the brains of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice (an AD model),
accompanied by decreased cAMP and cGMP in both cytosol and mitochondria matrix, implicating the
potential involvement of an aberrant PDE2A-cAMP/cGMP signaling in the pathogenesis of AD.
Multiple studies, including ours, demonstrated cognitive enhancing effect of PDE2A inhibitors,
although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this regard, our preliminary studies revealed
that PDE2A overexpression impaired mitochondrial function accompanied by extensive mitochondrial
fragmentation. Importantly, AÎ²-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and respiratory deficits could be
rescued by a PDE2A inhibitor, suggesting mitochondrial dynamics and function could be mechanism
of action for PDE2A to influence cognition. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that aberrant
PDE2A signaling caused mitochondrial dysfunction which adversely impacted neuronal/synaptic
function and caused pathological/cognitive deficits in AD. Novel animal models with PDE2A
conditional knockout in the forebrain will be crossed with different AD transgenic mouse models and
carefully characterized. The role of PDE2A2, the PDE2A isoform uniquely localized to mitochondria,
in brain function and behavior in AD mouse models will also be determined. Finally, based on the
literature and our preliminary study, we propose to explore the mechanism underlying the effects of
aberrant PDE2A expression on mitochondrial dysfunction with a focus on mitochondrial dynamics and
the expression/assembly of mitochondrial ETC complexes. Our proposed studies will provide
mechanistic insights into molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and
deepen our understanding of PDE2A in the regulation of cognition in the brain. The successful
completion of this study will likely pave the way for future drug development of PDE2A inhibitors,
specifically for the mitochondrial PDE2A2 isoform, as a promising treatment for AD."
10832585,"Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a major human pathogen that can cause life threatening systemic infections. In
fact, S. aureus is the most common cause of nosocomial bacteremia with a prevalence of 26%. Despite
improvements in clinical care, SA bloodstream infection (BSI) continues to pose a major challenge due to high
rate of treatment failure and mortality. Infections that are caused by methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA) strains are
becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, leading to treatment failures and poor patient outcomes. If host-
directed therapies such an effective SA vaccine can provide an alternative to antibiotics, a greater understanding
of immune mechanisms that promote protection is essential. This is especially important since all SA vaccination
attempts over the past two decades have failed in human trials. Notably, in a recent trial, a vaccine targeting SA
iron surface determinant B (IsdB) against SA infections following cardiothoracic surgery had the opposite effect
and patients who were vaccinated and suffered a SA infection had a 2-fold higher rate of multiorgan failure and
a 5-fold higher mortality than placebo controls. While reasons for this catastrophic outcome are still unknown, a
post-hoc study suggested that absent or low serum T cell cytokine levels (IL-2 and IL-17) at the time of
vaccination predisposed them for treatment failure. There is therefore an urgent need to understand the
underlying immunological mechanisms that lead to these deleterious outcomes. Our preliminary findings in mice
recapitulate deleterious immune responses triggered by immunizing mice with a lethally irradiated whole cell
vaccine or by intradermal exposure to SA that led to exacerbated disease and mortality upon SA BSI challenge.
This phenotype was associated with a CD4 T cell mediated, IFNÎ³-dependent immunopathology and likely an
imbalance of Th1/Th17 responses. The goal of this proposal is to test the overarching hypothesis that prior
exposure to SA antigens and virulence factors or cutaneous SA infection impact natural- and vaccine-elicited
CD4 T cell responses during a subsequent SA BSI. To this end, using mice we will fully characterize the T cell
responses to two vaccine platforms and will evaluate how the initial response to SA surface antigens or to a
toxoid vaccine differentially regulate the CD4 T cell response, and consequently the vaccine-elicited immunity
against subsequent SA BSI and if these responses can be influenced by different vaccine adjuvants (Aim 1).
Using WT mice and human HLA-DR4 transgenic mice as well as several WT and isogenic mutant SA strains we
will investigate how pore forming toxins and superantigens modulate CD4 T cell responses that affect natural
and vaccine induced immunity against SA BSI (Aim 2). We will also establish and use a novel nonhuman primate
model of SA BSI and evaluate the impact of pre-exposure on vaccine immunogenicity, with a focus on CD4 T
cell responses, and efficacy of our multivalent toxoid vaccine (Aim 3). The ultimate goal of this proposal is to
understand protective vaccine-induced immunity against SA BSI in complementary pre-clinical models to deepen
our understanding of immunity to SA BSI to help guide more effective vaccines to prevent disastrous outcomes
in future clinical trials."

The peptide neurotensin (NTS) is known to be a potent modulator of dopamine neuron activity, and NTS
signaling has been linked to various modalities of behavioral reinforcement and reward, as well as to the
behavioral response to drugs of abuse and the motivation for drug taking. Pharmacological studies have found
that in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), NTS binding to its receptors depolarizes dopamine neurons through a
variety of second messenger cascades, resulting in increased dopamine neuron firing and downstream
dopamine release. However, much less is known about the physiological release of NTS from endogenous
brain circuits and what role these circuits may play in regulating motivated behavior. Using retrograde mapping
we identified 23 brain regions that send NTS input to the VTA; however, few of these inputs are well-studied for
their role in NTS signaling, and little is known about what stimuli or behavioral actions may activate NTS
neurons. Furthermore, though peptidergic neurons typically co-release a fast neurotransmitter, such as
glutamate or GABA, current methods for circuit-specific activation fail to distinguish between downstream
effects triggered by peptides versus those evoked by fast transmitters. We hypothesize that different NTS
projections to the VTA may play distinct roles in modulating motivated behavior, and that NTS acts
synergistically with co-released fast transmitters to govern the dynamics of downstream dopamine neuron
activation. Here we propose to determine the neurotransmitter co-expression of select NTS inputs to the VTA
and map their synaptic connectivity to dopamine and non-dopamine neurons. We also propose to use viral
CRISPR gene mutagenesis techniques in combination with optogenetics to isolate the peptide and fast
transmitter components of NTS inputs to the VTA. We will dissect the role of these components in regulating
different modalities of behavioral reinforcement and will measure the response of dopamine neurons in vivo to
stimulation of specific inputs. Finally, we will use fiber photometry to measure the activity profiles of NTS
neurons during learning and performance of a cued reinstatement food reward task. Together, these
experiments will add unprecedented circuit-specific precision to our understanding of how these critical
peptidergic inputs influence the activity state of dopamine neurons and govern reward and reinforcement
learning."

 Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary cause of blindness, affecting over 1.5 million
people worldwide. RP has an extraordinarily variable etiology, with over 5,000 distinct mutations in more than
300 genes implicated in its pathogenesis, which suggests that the most productive therapeutic interventions
would employ gene-independent strategies to target the cellular pathology shared across many mutations and
patient groups. Our lab has demonstrated that one such common pathology is the impairment of cellular
proteostasis. This condition arises from the insufficient capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to process
large amounts of misfolded or mistargeted mutant proteins. Reducing this stress by enhancing ubiquitin-
independent protein degradation causes a major delay in the degeneration of photoreceptors bearing the P23H
rhodopsin mutation, a commonly encountered cause of human RP. We propose to expand the mechanistic
investigation of proteostatic imbalance in mouse models of photoreceptor degeneration and plan to further
explore practical approaches for restoration of proteostatic equilibrium. Our overarching goal is to identify
optimal therapeutic strategies and drug targets that could be used to ameliorate these devastating blinding
conditions.
 We will investigate whether enhancement of proteasomal activity achieved by directly targeting the 20S
proteasome core can alleviate retinal degeneration in mouse RP models. Progression of photoreceptor
degeneration in mouse models of RP can be considerably delayed by overexpressing the 11S regulatory cap,
which facilitates the accessibility of protein substrates to the proteolytic sites located inside the 20S core. We
propose to address whether a similar therapeutic effect could be achieved through direct manipulation of the
20S core by two complementary approaches â genetic and pharmacologic. The therapeutic effects of these
strategies will be assessed in two mouse models of RP of dissimilar etiology â rhodopsin P23H mutation and
the BBS4 knockout â and will include retinal histological analysis, electroretinography, and optomotor
responses.
 The results of these experiments will demonstrate whether direct activation of 20S proteasomes can serve
as a therapeutic strategy to treat inherited blindness. These data will encourage further investigations of
proteasome activity enhancers and ultimately advancement to clinical trials for RP. Furthermore, promising
results in RP models will encourage the evaluation of these drugs in models of other retinal degenerations and
potentially neurodegenerative diseases, all of which exhibit proteostatic stress as a pathophysiological feature."

Because research into both animal and human reproductive biology has such widespread implications for human health,
we established the Reproductive and Developmental Sciences Training Program (RDSTP) at Michigan State University.
Housed within a large group of accomplished investigators and supported by substantial institutional commitments, the
RDSTP trains young scientists to pursue research in High Priority Program Topic Areas identified by the NICHD/Fertility
and Infertility (FI) Branch and the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch. To provide training related to these NICHD
target areas, the RDSTP trainees select from among four Areas of Specialization: Gonad and Gamete biology, Early
Development, Reproductive Tract Biology and Gynecological Pathologies, and Environmental Factors impacting
Reproduction. Each area contains multiple faculty trainers offering outstanding research opportunities and training
environments in each of their specific areas of expertise. The Reproductive and Developmental Sciences program at
Michigan State University has expanded extensively in the past five years with substantial institutional commitment, and
is continuing to expand which provides a dynamic and rich environment for training young scientists. The RDSTP will
pursue the objectives of providing competence in emerging, cutting-edge, NICHD-recognized areas of high research
interest, and providing essential skills for long-term career and professional development, with qualifications to
participate in the broader roles of scientists in our community. The latter will include developing laboratory skills,
rigorous, responsible and reproducible approaches to research, verbal and written communication skills, management and
mentoring skills, diverse other professional skills, teaching skills, and other expertise that will be essential for future
success in both academics as well as alternate career opportunities. A research mentoring optimization program aimed at
both trainee and trainers, education about career path diversity, and coordination with numerous programs at MSU that
enhance diversity collectively elevate the program to the highest of standards for training and professional development.
The training program is designed to ensure that trainees are fully equipped to meet the challenges required to succeed in

Project Summary
Malaria is a deadly parasitic disease. The major symptom for malaria is fever, which is associated with bursting
of red blood cells (RBCs) upon completion of the cell cycle of the parasite. The parasite population
coordinately ruptures the RBCs, reinvades new ones and replicates until their cycle is completed, and then a
new burst of RBCs occurs. The result is a paroxysmal fever that recurs with the same periodicity as the
parasite cell cycle: 48h or 72h for human-specific Plasmodium species and 24h for rodent-specific Plasmodium
species. The mechanism for parasite synchronicity, which is central to this phenomenon, remains unknown.
Despite the duration of cell cycle varying among Plasmodium species, it has a duration multiple of 24h, which
led us to hypothesize that the mechanism for fever periodicity is an endogenous circadian clock of the parasite.
Our preliminary data suggest that host nutritional status is the strongest signal for synchronizing the timing of
bursting of red blood cells. But what mechanism leads to its 24h duration? Although rhythmic bursting of red
blood cells is due to the parasite cell cycle, there seems to exist a circadian timekeeping mechanism that is
independent of cell cycle, since my preliminary data suggest that even quiescent parasite-stages have 24h
rhythms of gene expression. Circadian clocks regulate multiple physiological functions, from gene expression
to behavior. Having circadian clocks that anticipate rhythmic changes in the environment is an evolutionary
advantage for organisms. From bacteria to humans, mutations in clock components or desynchrony between
the clock and the environment (chronic jet-lag) leads to reduced fitness, metabolic disruption and shorter
lifespan. It has also been shown that a mismatch between the host and the parasite rhythms is detrimental for
malaria parasite infection success, benefiting the host.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism for Plasmodium synchronicity. To address this
fundamental question, I will systematically dissect the contribution of the parasite cell cycle and systemic host
signals to this phenomenon. With next-generation sequencing I aim to determine the rhythmic gene expression
of the parasite when 1) diving into mammalian blood; 2) in a quiescent-stage; and 3) in the absence of
systemic host signals in vitro. The latter will allow me to test whether these malaria rhythms are temperature
compensated: a key feature of endogenous circadian rhythms. By decreasing temperature of cultured
mammalian cells, their cell cycle duration slows down but their circadian clock remains with 24h.
These studies will generate a comprehensive framework to resolve a long-standing question in the malaria
field. More broadly, by dissecting whether the periodicity of fevers is driven by host signals or an internal
circadian clock of the parasite, these studies will guide strategies to disrupt the synchronicity of the parasite
and to the development of alternative approaches to tackle this deadly disease.

Despite recent gains in overall life expectancy in the US, racial/ethnic health disparities in older adults (age
â¥65) persist and are widening. This includes disparities in health status, chronic disease burden, disability, and
life expectancy for Black and Hispanic older adults compared with whites. Our previous work has identified
mid-life (age 50-64) as a critical period when health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities are set and may
potentially be intervened upon. The Affordable Care Act coverage expansions of 2014 have shown promise for
reducing disparities in access and health, but the impact on middle-aged and older adults has been largely
understudied.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine whether exposure to ACA coverage (Medicaid and
Marketplace plans) and access to care for middle-aged adults (age 50-64) may affect downstream health
disparities in older adults (age â¥65). We will use two modeling approaches in all aims: a) interrupted time
series analysis to assess the impact of the entire ACA coverage expansion on racial/ethnic disparities before
vs. after 2014; and b) difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and event study models comparing Medicaid
expansion vs. non-expansion states estimated for each racial/ethnic group (Black, Hispanic, white) to assess
the specific impact of Medicaid on disparities. In all analyses, we will also examine heterogeneity of treatment
effects by individual-level intersecting identities (race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status) and area-level
structural racism.
With this approach, we will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Assess how racial/ethnic disparities in
middle-aged adultsâ health insurance coverage has changed before vs. after the ACA coverage expansions,
using the American Community Survey; 2) Estimate racial/ethnic disparities in middle-aged adultsâ health care
access and out-of-pocket costs before and after the ACA coverage expansions, using the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) and the Current Population Survey; and 3) Investigate racial/ethnic disparities in
middle-aged and older adultsâ health, and older adultsâ health care utilization and costs before and after the
ACA, using the HRS-linked Medicare data.
The proposed work is significant because, in a time of economic distress and worsening health disparities, it
will directly inform US health insurance policies to improve health equity for vulnerable populations. The
methods are innovative in using the natural experiment of the ACA and an explicit focus on structural racism to
understand whether the upstream policy intervention of the ACA that affected coverage of middle-aged adults
may impact trajectories of health and health care disparities of middle-aged and older adults as they age."

quality of mental health outcomes and reduce disability. The proposed renewal tests whether an enhanced
PMSB intervention is acceptable in community-based organizations and community clinics, and allows
effectiveness to be strengthened through added maintenance components. We identified areas to strengthen
the intervention, to facilitate easier adoption at the organizational level, to increase mental health symptom

implementation readiness of the E-PMSB, to ensure that its package of interventions is feasible and can be
easily adopted, with reduced barriers to its sustainability. Informed by the Consolidated Framework for

community consisting of community-based organizations (CBOs), clinical sites and academic partners will
share elements that have contributed to initial success and can strengthen the collaboration. For Aim 3, we will

appropriate evidence-based messaging, packaging, and an overview of the implementation process and
financing. This dynamic toolkit will be designed for use by community organizations, community health workers

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is amongst the most common monogenetic
disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 12.5 million people worldwide. Unfortunately, >50% of
ADPKD patients develop end-stage renal failure and treatment options are still limited. Recent

This revelation opens the door to an exciting possibility that reversing PKD1 decline may arrest
ADPKD in these individuals. However, despite the transformative potential, no PKD1-targeting drugs
are under clinical investigation. Our goal in this application is to provide a scientific roadmap for
developing a novel PKD1-boosting therapeutic approach. We propose a novel idea that along with
the germline mutation, inefficient translation of mRNAs produced by the non-inactivated PKD1 allele

UTR is sufficient to improve mRNA translation and to raise PC1 levels. In turn, this approach
ameliorates cyst growth in mice and in vitro human ADPKD models. Based on these promising
observations, we propose: (1) using genetic proof-of-principle approaches to study the impact of
PKD1 derepression in ADPKD mouse and human models, and (2) test the feasibility of
oligonucleotides that outcompete and prevent miR-17 from binding to PKD1 as novel therapeutics to
raise PC1 levels."
10837467,"South Africa has made progress towards their 95-95-95 goals, yet a substantial proportion of the population
do not test regularly. In South Africa, people of low socioeconomic status, men, people in rural areas, and those
who distrust the health system have higher rates of HIV stigma and are less likely to receive an HIV test. These
individuals are also more likely to see a traditional healer for their health care needs, making healers an ideal
group to bridge the health care utilization divide.
 To reach people who otherwise may avoid testing, our team trained 15 traditional healers to conduct HIV
counseling and testing in their own indumbas â a hut or room by their home where they provide care to their
patients (R34MH122259-01, PI Audet). Over six-months, with no advertisement or community events, healers
offered HIV counseling and testing to 463 individuals who visited them for unrelated services. Fifty-four (11.7%)
self-reported a positive HIV status. Of the 409 eligible participants, 316 (77%) agreed to test, and 20 (6.3%)
tested positive- 95% were linked to HIV care and treatment services.
 In collaboration with the Department of Health and Kukula, the local healerâs organization, we propose to build
on our successful pilot to test an expanded Healer-Initiated HIV Testing and Linkage to Care intervention with
the following testing and linkage to care components. Healers will provide three testing services: (1) Advertise
the availability of free healer-initiated counseling and testing for their clients; (2) Offer partner-based testing
services at their facilities or client homes; and (3) Provide monthly community-based testing outreach activities
at local events (e.g., sporting events, fairs). In addition to testing, healers will support linkage to care and
treatment adherence, offering clients accompaniment to their first clinical appointment, ongoing adherence
support/counseling in person or via WhatsApp, and a nurse/CHW/healer WhatsApp group to facilitate more
technical support if needed. We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial (comparing standard of care (SOC)
testing options vs. SOC + enhanced testing with support of traditional healers) at 42 clinical catchment areas to
evaluate the impact this intervention.
 The Specific Aims of this study are to: (1) Compare rates of HIV testing in healer-initiated HIV counseling
and testing communities vs. control communities via a cluster randomized controlled trial in rural South Africa;
(2) Assess adoption, implementation fidelity and maintenance of healer-initiated HIV testing; and (3) Evaluate
the cost-effectiveness of healer-initiated HIV counseling and testing compared to standard of care. Our team has
a proven record of engaging traditional healers to improve patient outcomes, conducting research to evaluate
and address mistrust in the health system, HIV stigma, and developing interventions to increase HIV testing
uptake. We believe that traditional healers are an untapped resource with the potential to reach those who
historically avoid HIV testing and they have the potential to help South Africa reach their 95% testing targets."

This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will facilitate my transition to an independent scientist who
conducts innovative research on the development of face processing abilities in infancy. The apparently
effortless ability to recognize faces belies the complexity of this task. The activities described in this proposal
are aimed at addressing the structure-function coupling underlying the distributed network of face-sensitive
areas by characterizing the white matter (WM) fiber tracts connecting functionally activated regions during
the processing of faces. Such an approach has been previously implemented with adults investigating the
pattern of fMRI activation in response to faces. Source analysis of highâdensity scalp electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings is an optimal means to examine brain activity in infancy. Therefore, I propose to investigate
the structure-function relationship between source cortical activity of the early lowâlevel stage of holistic face
perception and structural encoding of faces in adults and 12-month-old infants. To better understand the WM
connectivity profile within this network, I will define macro- and micro-structural properties (i.e., total volume
of fiber bundles, fractional anisotropy â FA, axial and radial diffusivity, and fiber density) of the WM tracts
using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Further, I will extend this investigation to younger infants
to track the developmental changes in face-processing during the first year of life. As a secondary aim, I will
explore structural-functional relations in infants at high familial risk for autism. I propose training and research
during the mentored phase (K99) to extend my knowledge and skills in: (1) source localization of EEG activity
using advanced source analysis methods and accurate head models; (2) DTI data acquisition and fiber tract
reconstruction; and (3) learning tools for conducting research with high-risk infants. The knowledge and skills
gained in the mentored phase, as well as the results of the mentored research, will be instrumental to
achieving the aims of the independent phase (R00). These specific aims are: (1) track the development of
structural brain changes and functional responses to faces in the first year of life to better understand typical
and atypical trajectories of the face network; and (2) extend the investigation to other important aspects of
face-processing, such as the discrimination of facial identities. I will track structural and functional changes
in the processing of faces in infants at 6, 9, and 12 months. This approach will allow us to shed light on the
sensitive periods in face perception occurring during the second half of the first year of life. Further, the
multimodal approach to define structural-functional development will be implemented to investigate the
dynamics of the adaptation effect to individual face perception in infants. My mentorship team is uniquely
poised to assist and promote my training and research goals, and to ensure a successful transition to my
independent research program."

INSTITUTIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT
Project Summary/Abstract
The Southern California Clinical Translational Institute's Individual Career Development (ICD) Program
operates within the University of Southern California and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. We operate in the
heart of Los Angeles, where 85% of residents are from underrepresented minority groups, 20% live below the
federal poverty level, 30% are under 18 years old, and 57% of adults do not complete high school. The disease
burden is high and amplified by health disparities linked to poverty, crime, language barriers, and cultural
beliefs. Thus, we aim to: 1) develop leaders who conduct rigorous and reproducible clinical translational
research (CTR) that identifies and overcomes translational barriers to improve the health of diverse
populations, 2) empower Scholars to sustain CTR careers, and 3) increase Scholar diversity to more effectively
address our diverse communities' health needs. Based on these aims, we expand the ICD Institutional
Ecosystem with state-of-the-art Education and Mentor Resource Centers and Advisory and Faculty Boards
with strong educational CTR expertise and broader URM representation. We propose to train 4 new Scholars
per year for three years each through NIH, institutional, and departmental funds. The ICD Program builds on a
successful three-course series emphasizing CTR research methodology, rigor and reproducibility, team
science, communication skills, and research in diverse populations, combined with a comprehensive career
development program. Scholars enroll in a Master's or Certificate program in Clinical, Biomedical, and
Translational Investigations. New ICD training opportunities include healthcare delivery science, health data
science, precision medicine, and Quality by Design. A robust distance education platform is in place for
recording, archiving, and disseminating educational materials; it also supports Scholars in developing oral
communication skills and disseminating their research. Experiential opportunities include interactions with SC
CTSI core experts in, e.g., digital recruitment, community engagement, regulatory knowledge, community
mentors, and visiting scholar research presentations at other CTSA institutions. Scholars-Mentor teams use
Individual Development Plans to guide career progression throughout the program. Barriers to career
progression are identified and addressed through a novel Barriers Mitigation Board which informs scholars'
resilience for long-term career success. We have created robust tracking and evaluation processes that inform
and advance the program. Data show transformative and widespread institutional change due to ICD Scholars
and alumni transitioning to independent research careers with robust research funding, academic productivity,
and advancement. More broadly, we have contributed regionally and nationally to training and career
development in CTR by sharing tools and best practices and leadership in CTSA committees and working
groups. We look forward to expanding this success in the next funding cycle."
10839994,"ABSTRACT
Regulated progression through the cell division cycle is critical for cells to faithfully grow and divide. When cell
cycle control is disrupted, cells can acquire mutations or proliferate uncontrollably, and this can lead to the
development of diseases such as cancer. To ensure that cells replicate and divide accurately, multiple
overlapping mechanisms function to coordinate and order cell cycle events. The focus of my laboratory is to
understand how cell cycle-regulated transcription, phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation
are integrated to generate a robust cell cycle-regulatory network. To accomplish this we take advantage of
high-throughput genetic approaches in budding yeast to uncover the systems-level consequences of
perturbing cell cycle-regulatory genes. In this proposal we will focus on three key unanswered questions. First,
how does phosphorylation of cell cycle-regulatory transcription factors (TFs) contribute to cell cycle control?
We will utilize genetic interaction screens with phosphodeficient TF alleles to elucidate the importance of
phosphorylation and test the hypothesis that TF phosphorylation is important to coordinate growth and energy
production with the cell cycle. Second, how do stress response pathways cooperate to regulate the cell cycle in
response to environmental stress? We will dissect the mechanism of crosstalk between conserved stress
response pathways and investigate the importance of this crosstalk for cell cycle arrest and survival in
response to distinct environmental stressors. Third, how do deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulate the
stabilities of cell cycle-regulatory proteins? We will utilize an approach that we developed for identifying DUB
substrates to investigate the in vivo functions of these enzymes and the mechanisms by which they control the
cell cycle. By answering these questions, we will develop a network-level view of how transcription and
proteolysis coordinate cell cycle events to ensure faithful cell division. Given the strong conservation between
the cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms in yeast and human cells, we anticipate this work will provide insight into
how disruptions in the cell cycle control network contribute to disease."
10839995,"ABSTRACT: There are nearly 7,000 diseases that have a prevalence of only one in 2,000 individuals or less.
Yet, such rare diseases are estimated to collectively affect over 300 million people worldwide, representing a
significant healthcare concern. Although rare diseases have predominantly genetic origins, nearly half of them
do not manifest symptoms until adulthood and frequently confound discovery and diagnosis. Even in the case
of early onset disorders, the sheer number of possible diagnoses can often overwhelm clinicians. As a result,
rare diseases are often diagnosed with delay, misdiagnosed or even remain undiagnosed, not only disrupting
patient lives but also hindering progress on our understanding of such diseases. Data science methods that
mine large-scale retrospective health record data for phenotypic information will aid in timely and accurate
diagnoses of rare diseases, especially when combined with additional data types, thus, having significant real-
world impact. This proposal will integrate electronic health record (EHR) data sets with publicly available
vocabularies and ontologies, and genomic data for the improved identification and characterization of patients
with rare diseases, using approaches from machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and basic
bioinformatics. The work has three specific aims and will be carried out in two phases. During the mentored
phase, the principal investigator (PI) will develop data-driven methods to extract standardized concepts related
to rare diseases from clinical notes and infer the occurrence of each disease (Aim 1). He will also develop data
science approaches to compare and contrast longitudinal patterns associated with patients' journeys through
the healthcare system when seeking a diagnosis for a rare disease, and aid in clinical decision-making by
leveraging these patterns (Aim 2). During the independent phase (Aim 3), computational methods will be
developed for the integrated modeling and analysis of genotypic (from Aim 3) and phenotypic information (from
Aims 1 and 2). Cohorts to be sequenced will cover diseases for which causal genes or disease definitions are
unclear (discovery), as well as those for which these are well known (validation). This work will be carried out
under the mentorship of four faculty members with complementary expertise in biomedical informatics, data
science, NLP, and rare disease genomics at the University of Washington, the largest medical system in the
Pacific Northwest (four million EHRs), world-renowned researchers in medical genetics, and a robust data
science environment. In addition, under the direction of the mentoring team, the PI will complete advanced
coursework, receive training in translational bioinformatics and clinical research informatics, submit
manuscripts, and seek an independent research position. This proposal will yield preliminary results for
subsequent studies on data-driven phenotyping and enable the realization of the PI's career goals by providing
him with the necessary training to build on his machine learning and basic bioinformatics expertise to transition
into an independent investigator in biomedical data science."
10839998,"Project Summary
Noradrenergic (NA) input to hippocampus from locus coeruleus (LC), the sole supplier of NA innervation to
forebrain, is required for acquisition and consolidation of spatial learning and memory and contextual fear
behavior. The dentate gyrus (DG) contains the highest NA content, greatest NA fiber density, and largest
expression of Î²1-and Î²2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the hippocampal formation, consistent with DG being a
key region of modulatory control by LC. There is a rich literature dating back to the mid 1980âs showing a critical
role for Î²-ARs in facilitating induction of both LTP and LTD at DG synapses depending upon the saliency of the
experience. This heightened plasticity occurs simultaneous with heightened learning and memory, and both are
prevented by loss of NA innervation or pharmacological blockade of Î²-ARs. Importantly, the LC in females has
a larger volume, LC neurons have greater dendritic arbors, and at proestrus, when plasma estradiol levels are
the highest, NA neuronal activity is decreased.
 The LC is the first brain region damaged in Alzheimerâs disease (AD), due to accumulation of hyper-
phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The consequence of this pathology is greatly under-appreciated since transgenic AD
mouse models do not recapitulate this feature of human disease. Fortunately, the novel TgF344-AD rat model
has significant p-tau accumulation in LC and NA axon loss in hippocampus, permitting detailed studies of LC
and NA system dysfunction on hippocampal synaptic transmission and learning and memory. Clearly, identifying
strategies to prevent p-tau accumulation and LC damage is critical. The post-translational modification, O-
GlcNAcylation, has been shown to do just this through competition with phosphorylation at key serine residues
on p-tau that cause its accumulation. Using brain slice electrophysiology, we reported pathologically heightened
LTP at medial perforant path synapses in dentate gyrus prior to CA1 synapses in both sexes. In recent data, we
find heightened potentiation at medial perforant path synapses following pharmacological activation of Î²-ARs.
This upregulation of Î²-AR function in the context NA fiber loss likely drives the heightened LTP and masks
deficits in learning and memory early in the disease. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that
hippocampal noradrenergic function in AD is impaired via aberrant excitability of LC-NA cells caused by
progressive p-tau accumulation and through NA denervation, both of which will be worse in ovariectomized
females and protected by O-GlcNAcylation. We will use a combination of electrophysiology in hippocampus and
locus coeruleus, hippocampus-dependent behavior, pharmacology, biochemistry, and O-GlcNAc biology to test
this innovative hypothesis. Outcomes will shed new light on the role of LC damage in AD, and will lay the ground
work for therapeutic strategies targeting the LC and perhaps O-GlcNAcylation."

In the US, 4.5 million adults have liver disease, and liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for
those with cirrhosis; transplant centers are charged with determining recipients for a life-saving organ.
Disparities exist for patients listed for LT: Black patients are under-represented on 81% of US transplant center
waitlists, and 62% under-represent Hispanic patients. LT centers assess each patientâs appropriateness for
transplant, culminating in a decision to list for transplant or decline. If listed, patients are prioritized based on
disease severity and will either receive a liver or be de-listed for a variety of reasons, such as death. While
prior disparities research has targeted factors affecting post-listing outcomes (e.g., waitlist dropout, post-LT
survival), an upstream focus on pre-listing patient-level barriers, structural/institutional racism, and
interpersonal racism has not been well studied despite having high impact on equity for LT patients. LT listing
decision-making is variable. Objective clinical measures are utilized, but social determinants of health (SDOH,
e.g., racism, socioeconomic position) and subjectivity permeate data gathering, clinical observations, and
psychosocial assessments. A data-driven approach to LT listing has yet to be described. Predictive analytics
(supervised machine learning) can be harnessed to strengthen objectivity and minimize bias of complex
decision-making. Preliminary data from my qualitative work are the first to comprehensively outline potential
pathways resulting in the listing disparities and reveal that transplant center providers are cautiously optimistic
for machine learning-based clinical decision support tools in LT evaluation. The hypothesis is that timely
access to summarized, objective data can improve provider decision-making and listing disparities. Using a
multi-disciplinary approach to apply data science techniques from an equity perspective, Dr. Strauss will
leverage her strong relationships with experts from Johns Hopkins Medical Center: experienced transplant
team, transplant research lab, Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, School of Public Health social
epidemiologists, and the Berman Institute of Bioethics. The overarching project goal is to improve equity in LT
decision-making using a data-driven and team-based intervention; the overarching training goal is to gain skills
in machine learning, health equity interventions, and implementation science. AIM 1: Develop and internally
validate a machine learning-based model to assist LT listing decision-making. AIM 2: Create a data-driven,
equity-focused intervention for team decision-making in LT evaluation. AIM 3: Design a multicenter pilot
implementation trial of a data-driven, equity-focused intervention for LT evaluation. Impact: Through this
project, Dr. Strauss will develop a data-driven and equity-focused intervention that will address disparities in LT
listing. This mentored award will develop Dr. Strauss into an R01-funded, independent physician-scientist with
advanced skills in machine learning, health equity research, and implementation science."

Maintaining internal environment constancy is essential for life. The circumventricular organs (CVOâs) of the
brain including organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical organ (SFO) lack a
blood-brain-barrier, function as central sensors to provide feedback regulation for maintaining osmotic
equilibrium. Neurons in CVOâs detect changes in osmolality and transduce the signals into action potentials
(APâs) travelling down the axon projecting to magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic
nuclei (SON). Upon activation by APâs, magnocellular neurons synthesize antidiuretic hormones (ADH), which is
transported via axon process to the posterior pituitary gland and released into blood circulation herein. ADH acts
on kidney to effect free water reabsorption. While hyperosmolality also stimulates thirst and drinking, separate
neuronal networks are involved. Together, renal free water reclamation and drinking restore serum osmolality in
response to water deprivation. The molecular identity of the osmolality sensor(s) in the OVLT/SFO neurons
remains elusive. With-no-lysine [K] kinases WNK1-4 are protein kinases in which gain-of-function mutations of
WNK1 and 4 in humans cause familial hypertensive and hyperkalemic disease called pseudohypoaldosteronism
type II (PHA2). Our preliminary results strongly support the central hypothesis that WNK1 functions as a central
osmosensor for osmolality regulation of ADH release. Mice with neuronal conditional knockout (cKO) of Wnk1
exhibit phenotypes of partial central diabetes insipidus (DI). WNK1 activate downstream oxidative-stress
responsive-1 kinase (OSR1) and related SPAK (Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase). WNK1-OSR1/SPAK
kinase cascade regulates many ion channels and transporters. To support the hypothesis, Specific Aim-1 will
test the hypothesis that OSR1 and/or SPAK acts downstream of WNK1 to regulate osmolality-induced ADH
release. Control and mice with genetically altered WNK1 kinase cascade will be studied in metabolic cage under
free water access and water restriction. Urine volume, urine and serum electrolyte, osmolality, ADH and copeptin
levels will be measured. Specific Aim-2 will test the hypothesis that activation of Kv3.1b voltage-gated K+
channels by WNK1 increases AP firing in OVLT/SFO neurons leading to stimulation of ADH release by
hyperosmolality. Electrophysiological recording of freshly isolated individual OVLT/SFO neurons, native neurons
in situ in acute brain slice, and HEK cells expressing recombinant channels and WNK1 cascades will be
performed. The proposed studies will reveal novel findings that an intracellular protein functions as a sensor for
extracellular osmolality and provide fresh insights into how body maintains osmotic equilibrium in health and into
disease processes that affect total body water homeostasis."

the Dobbs decision reversing Roe, spikes in teen suicide and other threats to youth well-being, and the global
increase of displaced persons are just four of the many pressing social issues heightening the critical
importance of demography and population perspectives. Our training program benefits from an outstanding
interdisciplinary faculty with scientific expertise in four key areas of Reproductive Health, Population Health,
Family Demography, and Work, Education and Inequality, along with new depth in Biosocial methods. The
PRC provides the infrastructure, training opportunities, and research environment necessary to train the next
generation of population scientists and is supported by a strong extramural funding trajectory. PRC predoctoral
and postdoctoral fellows are supported by state-of-the-art administrative, computing, scientific, and program
development resources; expert faculty collaborators and mentors; topical working groups and a seminar series
that provide an intellectual idea exchange and access to well-known scholars from across the country and
world. We request training funds for 5 predoctoral fellows and 2 postdoctoral fellows per year for the 2024-
2029 grant period to maintain the size of the program. The center provides an outstanding training environment
with notable accomplishments including predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowsâ high research productivity in

10849269,"Tissue resident macrophages are derived from embryonic yolk sac progenitors, develop prior to birth, are long-
lived and radioresistant, and have critical functions in maintaining tissue homeostasis and in the pathogenesis
of many human diseases that are of broad interest to NIH. This proposal is to build cutting-edge humanized
mouse resources that support the efficient development of human tissue resident macrophages in disease
relevant models and is in response to RFA-22-013: âResource-Related Research Projects for Development of
Animal Models and Related Materialsâ. The rationale for our approach is based on the paucity of translational
animal models that are readily available to the research community to study human tissue resident
macrophages in vivo and evaluate their role in human diseases. While several humanized platforms
expressing human cytokines have been reported to improve development of human macrophage populations,
many of these models are not available to basic research programs. Moreover, these models are often focused
on engraftment of single macrophage populations and thus lack components of the adaptive immune system
and other innate immune cells. An additional limitation for humanized models is that the mouse resident
macrophage populations occupy the ânichesâ available for tissue specific macrophages and resist replacement
with human HSC-derived macrophages. We recently knocked out the fms-intronic regulatory element (FIRE)
enhancer in the CSF1 receptor gene in immunodeficient NSG mice (NSG-Fire) that impairs the development of
mouse tissue resident macrophages, and we are crossing NSG-(Fire) mice with cytokine transgenic NSG mice
to promote the development of human myeloid cells. Our overall hypothesis is that genetic modification of NSG
mice to express species-specific, myeloid promoting cytokines and to reduce mouse tissue resident
macrophage populations will enhance the development of functional human tissue resident macrophages and
provide a robust small animal model for the study of inflammatory immune responses mediated by human
macrophage populations. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Aim 1) Generation of novel NSG-
(Fire) mouse stocks that are deficient in mouse tissue resident macrophages and express human cytokines for
development of human myeloid cells. Aim 2) Engraftment of novel NSG-(Fire) mouse stocks with CD34+ UCB-
HSC and evaluation of human tissue resident macrophage development. Aim 3) Testing NSG-(Fire) strains as
a model for tissue resident macrophages acting as a reservoir for HIV during latency and for microglia in
Alzheimerâs Disease-relevant neurodegeneration. These new mouse models will allow for the in vivo
investigation of human tissue resident macrophages in multiple diseases and accelerate the development of
human specific therapies."
10849693,"Screening for hereditary DNA repair mutations in cancer has accelerated as Homologous Recombination Repair
(HRR) deficient tumors respond well to DNA damaging agents and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors
(PARPi). The most common HRD mutations include BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2. Such mutations convey
a 40-80% lifetime breast cancer risk across all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and pose elevated risks for
ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer. While less toxic, responses to PARP inhibitors are still often short,
despite a high initial response rate. Efficacy of PARP inhibitors in ATM and CHEK2 is mechanistically expected,
but not yet established. Overlapping toxicities have significantly challenged the ability to combine PARPi with
chemotherapy, and immunotherapy combinations remain of limited benefit in most breast cancer subtypes.
 In a quest to enhance PARPi efficacy, we studied strategies to increase DNA trapping and inhibition of DNA
repair. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) directly modulate the DNA repair pathway and work in complex with
PARP to repair single strand DNA breaks. As such, we hypothesize that DNMT inhibition would significantly
improve the therapeutic benefit of PARP inhibition in HRD cancer. We found enhanced PARP trapping and
promising synergistic efficacy with very low doses of the DNMT inhibitor, decitabine, and PARPi in preliminary
in vitro and in vivo studies which was significantly enhanced in genetically engineered HRR mutated cancer cell
lines and PDX models. Responsiveness to the combination varied by tumor (sub) tissue context and select HRD
gene mutation. Preliminary data form our work has led to the approval of a dose finding phase I trial sponsored
by the Alliance Network (A092003). In this application, we will explore biomarkers and mechanisms of sensitivity
and resistance to combination PARP and DNMT treatment to provide deeper mechanistic insights and guide
patient selection in the provisionally-approved large randomized ComboMatch trial (EAY191 A4) in three aims.
 Aim 1: Determine the mechanism of synergy and comparative effects of combined PARP and DNMT
inhibition in isogenic cell lines bearing targeted mutation of 4 different HRR pathway genes, in vitro, in xenografts,
and in comparison to established PDX with similar HRR mutations but different genetic backgrounds.
 Aim 2: Use pre- and posttreatment tumor biopsy and serial blood samples from patients in the Phase I
Alliance Network (A092003) trial to generate a detailed understanding of patientâs HRR mutation, accompanying
genomic landscape, and functional status of the HRR pathway. Establish Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) from
biopsy specimens for work in Aim 3 regarding resistance mechanisms. Assess circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
for predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response.
Aim 3: Translating from the clinic back to the bench, test the veracity of the therapeutic responses in PDX and
organoid models compared to the source patient responses, identify PARPi+DNMTi therapeutic resistance
mechanisms, test sensitivity to potential followup therapeutics."

Circadian rhythms depend on the molecular transcription/translation negative feedback loop (TTL) operating in
clock neurons, and on the network properties of these neurons. Among the properties that could be recruited
by the circadian clock are changes in the identity of pre/post synaptic partners and/or strength of the
connectivity between clock neurons, a property collectively termed as circadian structural plasticity. Our central
hypothesis is that circadian structural plasticity within the central circadian clocks of mammals and Drosophila
are part of the time-encoding mechanisms. We will employ mouse and fly genetics combined with state-of-the-
art quantitative 3D light and electron microscopy techniques to address the extent of structural plasticity within
specific neurons of the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the Drosophila circadian network.
Specific aim 1 will assess how widespread structural plasticity is in the Drosophila circadian network as well as
which are the functional consequences of those structural changes. We will explore the extent of circadian
neuronal remodeling of subsets of PDF and non-PDF pacemaker neurons using CM and SBEM (sub-aims 1A i
and ii). We will examine time-of-day dependent functional connectivity changes among clock neurons through
chemogenetic GCamP6-reporting (sub-aim 1B). Sub-aim 1C will examine the behavioral consequences of
impairing structural remodeling; sub-aim 1D will further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
circadian structural plasticity.
Specific aim 2 will examine the degree of circadian structural remodeling in SCN VIPergic neurons, which are
an essential component of the timekeeping mechanism, through virally mediated sparse-labeling (CM) (sub-
aim 2A), or serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) with a marker that enables the analysis of
dendritic ultrastructure (sub-aim 2C). Finally, we will assess if circadian oscillations in VIP neuronal processes
rely on the TTL by repeating experiments in 1A in VIP-specific Bmal1-/- mice (sub-aim 2B).
Specific aim 3 will explore if connectivity of VIPergic neurons changes throughout the 24-h cycle. Using GFP
reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP), we will investigate if these connections change with circadian
time through immunocytochemistry and CM analysis in fixed tissue (sub-aim 3A) as well as ex vivo in SCN
slices (sub- aim 3B). We will also determine whether GRASP-detected rhythms depend on the canonical TTL
by repeating experiments in 2A and 2B in VIP- or SCN astrocyte-specific Bmal1-/- mice (sub-aim 3C).
Our experiments test predictions of the hypothesis that circadian structural plasticity represents a defining
feature of central neuronal circadian pacemakers. Support for this hypothesis would provide a critical new
perspective to understand how these pacemakers encode time at the network level. Furthermore, the
experiments we propose represent a unique opportunity for research capacity building in Argentina, where the
foreign principal investigator is located, and where students and postdocs will be trained in techniques that are

Opsins are classical G-protein coupled receptors, which for more than a century have been thought to function
exclusively as light detectors. However, using Drosophila, we have uncovered multiple, light-independent roles
for opsins including detection of bitter tastants. This discovery raises exciting questions, which we propose to
address here. Do opsins only respond to bitter compounds, or do they function more broadly in taste
sensation? Of particular interest, do opsins serve as taste receptors in other animals, including the mosquito,
Aedes (Ae.) aegypti? This vector spreads viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever, and other diseases that
afflict millions of people each year. Both male and female Aedes use taste to identify nectar and avoid toxic
chemicals, while females use many senses to identify people for blood meals. However, the receptors required
for mosquito taste are largely unknown. Another fascinating question is whether opsins serve as taste
receptors in mammals. To address these questions, we propose to employ an extensive suite of approaches
including electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging, behavioral assays, cell biology, an in vitro receptor activation assay,
and state-of-the art molecular genetics. We will also bring to bear our expertise in Drosophila taste, opsins, and
our recent experience performing molecular genetics and behavior in Ae. aegypti and in the mouse. Aim 1 will
define the role of a Drosophila opsin in amino acid taste, which in flies is a poorly understood taste modality.
Attraction to amino acids increases if the flies are kept on an amino acid deficient diet. We outline experiments
to define the contribution of the opsin to this dynamic change in amino acid appeal. We will also test the
proposal that the opsin is activated directly by amino acids. Aim 2 will build on our preliminary data that two Ae.
aegypti opsins are expressed in the major taste organ, and are required for sensing a flavonoid. The goals of
this aim are to reveal the chemical specificity of these opsins in vitro and in vivo, determine whether they act
independently or together, and identify the gustatory receptor neurons in which these opsins function. Aim 3
will characterize the roles of opsins in mammalian taste. This aim is supported by preliminary data showing
that multiple mouse opsins are expressed in the mouse tongue, and are activated in vitro by bitter compounds,
including a flavonoid for which there is no known receptor. In addition, we present preliminary data that the
response to this flavonoid is impaired in the opsin mutant. We propose to test the hypothesis that this opsin
functions broadly in sensing flavonoids, identify the taste receptor cells that express this and the other
âgustatory opsins,â and perform behavioral tests with mutants to characterize the requirements for each opsin
for sensing bitter compounds. The results from this project would establish opsins as a new class of taste
receptor conserved from insects to mammals. We propose that defining opsins as the first bitter receptors in
mosquitoes offers the potential to harness this information to manipulate mosquito behavior and thereby
reduce their populations and thus insect-borne disease."

10847853,"The shortage of physician-scientists across the medical sciences, and particularly within psychiatry, is well
documented, as are their critical contributions to academic research. In response to this shortage, in 2012, the
Duke University Department of Psychiatry (Duke Psychiatry) began to offer highly promising residents the
opportunity to have protected research time (free of clinical responsibilities) during psychiatry residency. We
have since graduated 5 residents who benefitted from this protected research time and have been highly
successful in developing research careers-obtaining academic appointments and continuing to engage in
research, receiving independent funding, and publishing their work. Building on the success of this small âpilotâ
approach, we now aim to launch the Duke Psychiatry Physician Scientist Track Program (Duke-PPST) to
train world-class psychiatrist-scientists by providing coordinated and sustained mentoring and research
experiences with notable innovations and increased training capacity. With 10 PPST training slots, the Duke-
PPST will capitalize on the extensive expertise and research training infrastructure available through Duke
University and the Duke University School of Medicine. A key feature of the proposed Duke-PPST is early and
intensive engagement in research for PPST residents. For a typical 4-year residency, our PPST program will
offer 3 months of full-time research during each of the PGY-1 and PGY-2, while still ensuring that all ACGME
requirements are met and on time for graduation. The remaining 10-12 months of full-time research will span
PGY-3 and PGY-4. The Duke-PPST also will provide the opportunity for research training in child psychiatry, an
area where the shortage of physician scientists is particularly acute and an area of considerable strength at
Duke. We will partner with the Neuroscience R25 program (R25MH129791) at North Carolina Central University
(NCCU), one of the largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the US. Through shared Duke-NCCU
programming and faculty engagement, we will create a community of investigators committed to diversity in the
mental health sciences. In addition, the Duke-PPST program will add needed geographic diversity to NIMH R25-
supported research psychiatry residency programs. Currently, only two such programs are located in the South,
despite this region being home to nearly 40% of the US population. Duke Psychiatry is strongly committed to
training psychiatrists-scientists and to the success of the Duke-PPST. To build and sustain the Duke-PPST, the
Department will support or augment several aspects of the program including seed funds, salaried post-graduate
positions, financial support for PPST Residents, travel/conference expenses, and grant writing and biostatistical
support. In total, we estimate departmental support at over $350,000 per year. The overarching goal of the Duke-
PPST is to train the next generation of psychiatrist-scientists, increasing the diverse pipeline of investigators who
will lead the way in biomedical discovery with translational and clinical impact."

 A hexanucleotide (G4C2) repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), collectively referred to as c9ALS/FTD.
Mounting evidence indicates repeat-containing transcripts cause c9ALS/FTD through gain-of-function
mechanisms by producing toxic RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. Our central hypothesis in this
proposal is that each of these pathologies (RNA foci, DPR proteins) elicits both common and cell-specific
molecular cascades. To address this question, we will perform bulk and single-nucleus RNAseq (sn-RNAseq)
using our novel c9ALS/FTD mouse model and patient tissues to uncover the whole and single-cell landscape
of transcriptional changes that occur during c9ALS pathogenesis. Our single-nucleus approach will also allow
us to test how an individual neuron with RNA foci and/or DPR protein pathology is different than even a
neighboring neuron without apparent pathology. Moreover, we will treat our c9ALS/FTD mouse model with
antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting repeat-containing transcripts, which has been shown to reduce
RNA foci burden, DPR protein pathology and other anomalies in various c9ALS models. Treatment will be
initiated at early and late stages of disease to determine the optimal timing of ASO treatment for mitigating
neuropathology, behavioral deficits, and the single-cell landscape of transcriptional changes. Our studies will
identify and validate high value therapeutic targets to treat c9ALS/FTD."

Despite the efficacious application of immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) across a broad range of cancers, only a
subset of patients experience remarkable clinical responses and survival. The challenge facing clinicians and
researchers alike is how to deliver the most effective and timely immunotherapy to patients. From clinical trial
data it is becoming increasingly evident that a single biomarker is unlikely to capture the scope and breadth of
clinical responses to ICT. Rather, incorporation of multiple biomarker panels, including both pharmacodynamic
and predictive biomarkers, has become a necessity. However, the number of tests that can be performed with
baseline and on-treatment biopsies is limited by the amount of biopsy tissue, and has several shortcomings
including inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and sampling errors. Those problems are compounded in
patients with metastatic disease and difficult-to-access locations. Imaging methods such as positron emission
tomography (PET) enable repetitive evaluation of the whole body and facilitate real-time quantification of
pharmacodynamic effects. Also, in recent years on-demand kit formulations of radiopharmaceutical preparations
have enabled widespread and routine clinical use of PET in cancer care. However, PET is underutilized in guiding
ICT due to the limited access to molecularly targeted radiotracers that accurately report on the activity of the
immune infiltrate. Generator-produced Gallium-68-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, in kit formulation or otherwise,
are increasingly used in the US and across the globe as theranostic tools for cancer but have not been reported
with a focus on advancing ICT. Our project addresses the need for non-invasive biomarkers for guiding ICT with
an objective to develop, translate and disseminate a radiopharmaceutical for measuring programmed death
ligand 1 (PDL1). We will develop a peptide-based Gallium-68-labeled radiopharmaceutical for measuring PDL1
levels to guide ICT and conduct a first-in-human study in cancer patients. Moreover, we will create a single vial
kit formulation of that agent to enable convenient radiopharmaceutical preparation and dissemination. Our
radiotracer is peptide-derived and uniquely capable of measuring pharmacodynamic effects of any PD(L)-1
therapeutic in situ in 60 min. We expect that the proposed approach will be a valuable addition to ICT, especially
as a non-invasive biomarker. The results generated will enable a fundamental advance in clinical management
of patients undergoing ICT and carried out in close partnership with industry with an eye towards dissemination
and broad access."

Intentionally incorporating professional skills development into biomedical research training is essential to
national goals of developing a diverse and adaptable scientific workforce. However, advances in training have
been limited by a lack of central mechanisms and incentives to share effective practices, leading to
inefficiencies in implementation where institutions often ârecreate the wheelâ. There is strong demand for easier
access to, and training and mentorship to support implementation of, evidence-based educational models for
teaching essential professional skills.
This project will address the NIGMS goal to develop a stable and diverse biomedical research workforce by
training and mentoring faculty and staff seeking to enhance professional skills training at their institutions. We
propose an integrated framework that aims to (1) develop (a) curated collections of effective professional skills
development models with detailed annotation to support adoption and adaptation at institutions nationally and
(b) train-the-trainer workshops to teach faculty and staff how to implement the models, with ongoing training
and implementation support through mentoring communities, (2) incentivize and support faculty and staff in
disseminating their models, (3) provide centralized assessment protocols and training to enhance rigorous
educational evaluation.
This project is innovative in supporting adaptation and implementation of professional skills development
models across the training community, providing support and incentives for faculty and staff to disseminate
their work, highlighting inclusive practices, and providing training and tools for rigor and reproducibility in
educational evaluation. By developing faculty and staff expertise at dozens of institutions across the US, our
proposal expands reach exponentially to impact research trainees across the country, enhancing training to
meet the nation's workforce needs."

Variants in the ABCA4 gene are a fundamental cause of several inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs),
including Stargardt macular dystrophy, fundus flavimaculatus, and cone-rod dystrophy; these three ABCA4-
driven diseases cause blindness in 1.4 million people worldwide. As a result, genetic testing of ABCA4 is
increasingly common in clinical settings. Of the 1,485 identified missense variants in ABCA4, 50% are of
unknown pathogenicity (variants of unknown significance, VUS). This genetic uncertainty leads to three key
problems: (i) for IRD patients who have multiple unclassified ABCA4 mutations, it is impossible to predict
which variant will cause disease in relatives who have not yet developed the disease; (ii) development of
variant-specific therapies will remain limited; and (iii) these variants cannot be used to predict disease
prospectively, which facilitates important life-planning decisions for patients and which is critical to direct
patients to new clinical trials. Our proposed study aims to unravel the clinical significance of ABCA4 genetic
variants of unknown significance (VUS) using in silico and in vitro functional analyses in combination. In this
proposal, we have assembled a team of investigators with extensive expertise in complementary fields: protein
biochemistry, computational biology, bioimaging, and biostatistics to create a âsequence-structure-functionâ
workflow, whereby in silico 3D protein structural analysis of ABCA4 sequence variants will be used as a tool to
predict disease severity/clinical pathogenicity in combination with high throughput functional analysis. The
combined expertise of the investigators and our unique biochemical resources allow us to carry out this project.
Successful completion of this study will be a significant and critical step forward in understanding the biology
of ABCA4-mediated IRDs and the characterization of variants for pathogenicity risk prediction.
The proposal incorporates interrelated initiatives focused on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
Accessibility), which will include training opportunities for students at different stages of their careers,
interdisciplinary research training, fostering inclusive and collaborative team science, and engaging with
community stakeholders to raise awareness and generate interest in vision research. Together, these efforts will
contribute to the creation of a transformative framework that promotes diversity within the biomedical
research community while aligning with our scientific objectives."

The 2021 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, semaglutide (Wegovy), as an anti-obesity medication (AOM) is ushering in a radical shift in the treatment of obesity. Semaglutide is far more effective than prior rarely used AOMs and additional highly effective AOMs are expected in coming years. Considering that over 80 million Americans live with obesity (2020 prevalence of body mass index â¥30 kg/m2 among adults was 41.9%), obesity is a major health problem in the United States. AOMs are poised to become an important tool in population weight management but we have yet to understand how best to implement AOMs equitably and effectively in everyday practice.
By carefully examining clinics within health systems that demonstrate varying use of AOMs, we will gain greater understanding of the barriers and facilitators to AOM use at various levels, including patient, provider, health system, and payer. Armed with these insights, we will be better equipped to develop effective strategies
for optimizing the use of AOMs to maximize their population health benefits. We will engage a diverse array of stakeholders in a multi-site collaboration to detail the current state of AOM prescribing and implementation and
to design tailored interventions based on best practices to optimize AOM access across health care settings.
Our specific aims are to:
Aim 1: Use data from 2009-2023 from the multi-site STAR PCORnet Network to understand the demographic,
clinical and provider characteristics of eligible patients that are associated with AOM receipt.
Aim 2: Identify key factors influencing AOM use at the patient, provider, and system levels. In-depth qualitative interviews will complement Aim 1 insights and help inform the development of a typology of implementation contexts specific to AOMs using the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases framework.
Aim 2a: Identify how patient attitudes towards AOMs and the steps required for obtaining an AOM prescription
affect demand and access by conducting interviews with selected patients in multiple health systems.
Aim 2b: Determine how health care provider and leader attitudes towards AOMs and their understanding of the
obesity evaluation and treatment processes are barriers and facilitators to AOM use in three large health
systems.
Aim 2c: Determine how regional and national payersâ attitudes towards and understanding of the clinical and economic evidence for AOMs impact AOM coverage decisions.
Aim 3: Design a Roadmap for selecting and designing implementation strategies to optimize AOM use that can
be tailored to national, regional, and local barriers and facilitators; and then assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and appropriateness of this Roadmap."

Infertility and pregnancy loss are common health disorders affecting women. Our long-term research goal is to define
critical physiological and genetic pathways that regulate uterine development, function, and regeneration to diagnose,
treat, and prevent infertility and associated uterine disorders and disease. This application is specifically focused on
the glands of the uterus that are characteristic features of all uteri and critical for pregnancy. Pregnancy loss is the
most common complication of human gestation, and recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility are observed in uterine
gland knockout animal models. The pioneer transcription factor forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), exclusively expressed in
the glands of the mouse and human uterus, plays a pivotal role in uterine gland development and function, and is
implicated in a variety of uterine pathologies (infertility, adenomyosis, endometriosis, adenocarcinoma). However,
our understanding of uterine epithelial development, FOXA2 biology, and gland morphogenesis is very incomplete.
Central hypotheses of this application are that: (1) intrinsic genetic and epigenetic mechanisms govern epithelial
specification, bifurcation, differentiation, and morphogenesis in the neonatal mouse uterus; (2) glandular epithelium
lineage bifurcation requires Foxa2 gene activation via chromatin remodeling; and (3) FOXA2 activates gene
regulatory networks and cellular pathways critical for adenogenesis in the uterus. A team of exceptional investigators
with complementary and substantial expertise in developmental biology, functional genomics, and bioinformatics will
address that hypothesis by conducting a collaborative research project. Guided by strong published and preliminary
data, two specific aims are proposed: (1) understanding molecular mechanisms regulating epithelial specification and
Foxa2 expression in the developing uterus; and (2) FOXA2 regulation of adenogenesis in the developing uterus. The
proposed systems biology approach will integrate in vivo and in vitro studies utilizing mouse genetic models, single-
cell profiling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression (multiome), advanced bioinformatics and deep learning
techniques, as well as mechanistic studies of mouse and human endometrial organoids. This approach will decipher
essential conserved factors, gene regulatory networks, and cellular pathways governing epithelial development and
Foxa2 regulation and biological function. The proposed aims are conceptually and technically innovative and together
will have a broad impact on the field by filling a substantial gap in our fundamental knowledge of uterine development
and biology. This application specifically addresses early pregnancy loss and the genetic basis of idiopathic female
infertility, which aligns with the research priorities of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NICHD. Ultimately,
an increased understanding of uterine gland biology will facilitate diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of fertility and
pregnancy problems, as well as benefit the development of regenerative medicine therapies aimed at organ
replacement and treatments for infertility and disease in women."
10858301,"Serious mental illness (SMI; schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders) affects Veterans at high rates and is associated with major difficulties in psychosocial and physical function. The burden of SMI worsens over the lifespan, which makes older Veterans with SMI particularly at risk for functional decline. Existing behavioral treatments are effective at improving psychosocial function but do not increase physical function in older Veterans with SMI. The lack of targeted interventions for physical function in older Veterans with SMI is troubling given that compromised physical function is related to more falls, hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, as well as early mortality. Older Veterans with SMI have significantly lower physical function across mobility, endurance, and strength domains compared to both age- and sex-based population norms and to older Veterans without SMI, further highlighting the magnitude of functional decline. Exercise is an established intervention for increasing all domains of physical function (i.e., mobility, endurance, strength) in older Veterans. Despite a growing research base on exercise for adults with SMI, exercise trials for adults with SMI have been limited by largely focusing on endurance, excluding older persons, and having high dropout rates. Environmental difficulties (e.g., lack of transportation), low motivation, and medical issues affecting older Veterans with SMI contribute to low engagement rates and high dropout rates in facility-based exercise programs. Individualized home-based exercise programs, which are safe and effective for older Veterans with health challenges, could address the main barriers to exercise in older Veterans with SMI by promoting greater accessibility and individual tailoring. To this end, this Career Development Award (CDA-2) will take a systematic approach to develop, refine, and feasibility test a home-based exercise program aimed at improving function in older Veterans with SMI. The home-based exercise program will be modeled after VHAâs Home- based Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, a 12-week program comprised of individualized home-based exercise prescription and weekly telephone health coaching. Further, motivational strategies for exercise (e.g., goal- setting, tracking progress, problem-solving) will be integrated into Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation telephone health coaching calls. Guided by the successive cohort design, an initial exercise program manual will be developed based on Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation (with motivational strategies) and qualitative input from key stakeholders (older Veterans with SMI, clinical staff and leadership serving older Veterans with SMI). The initial manual will be tested in a small 12-week open trial of two successive cohorts of older Veterans with SMI (n=5 in each). Qualitative and quantitative feedback on the program and research procedures will be collected and analyzed after each cohort and used to refine the program manual. A 12-week open trial of 30 older Veterans with SMI will then be conducted to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the exercise program. Primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability with secondary outcomes including physical and psychosocial function, depression, motivation, exercise, and quality of life. During the CDA-2 award period, Dr. Browne will engage in didactic, participatory, and career development activities as well as receive expert mentorship in (1) qualitative methods and analysis, (2) intervention development, (3) home-based exercise prescription, (4) health coaching, and (5) clinical trial design. The training and research from this CDA-2 will lead to a VA Merit Award submission and support Dr. Browneâs career advancement. This CDA-2 is a critical step in Dr. Browneâs pursuit of an independent clinical research career committed to developing, evaluating, and disseminating health-promoting interventions to improve function in older Veterans with SMI."

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In the United States, stroke is the fifth leading cause of
death and a leading cause of serious, long-term disability. One quarter of strokes are recurrences. African
Americans have nearly two-fold greater risk of suffering a stroke, 60% higher risk of recurrent stroke, and are
twice as likely to die from stroke compared to European Americans. Recurrent strokes are more often fatal and
result in even greater disability than first strokes in survivors. To date, few studies have focused on the interplay
of social and structural determinants of health, epigenetic factors and genetic variants in stroke and recurrent
stroke risk. To address this knowledge gap, we will generate and evaluate DNA methylation data while leveraging
genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data and phenotypic data from individuals with
stroke, recurrent stroke, or no stroke from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) study as well as participants from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial.
Expanding our prior genetic and epigenetics studies, we hypothesize that we will identify DNA methylation sites
and genetic markers influencing susceptibility for recurrent stroke and identify key social and structural
determinants of health that mediate stroke and stroke recurrence risk.
We will test our hypothesis by performing epigenome-wide association analyses for stroke and recurrent stroke
risk including mediation analyses considering comorbidities, environmental factors, and biomarkers, generating
genetic and epigenetic risk scores, and performing convergent -omics approaches. This represents a powerful
and innovative technique to identify genetic and epigenetic contributors to stroke and recurrent stroke risk and
may allow improved personalization of risk assessment and targeted prevention of strokes as we work to
eliminate stroke disparities."
10857650,"Stroke is a major cause of motor disability in veterans; Greater than 50% of stroke survivors continue to
have motor deficits that limit independence. While a majority of past research has focused on how loss of
descending pathways leads to loss of function, precisely what drives the emergence of abnormal flexor
âsynergiesâ (gain of function with increased flexor tone) is not fully understood and there is also no
specific treatment. Synergies in this context refers to abnormal coordinated activation of upper-limb
muscles during reaching (i.e., flexor tone in shoulder & biceps and a closed hand).
Consistent with observations in stroke patients, our preliminary data in mice reveals that increased flexor
tone develops in a delayed manner and significantly alters reach-to-grasp. Using our model, we will test
the specific hypothesis that the emergence of a delayed imbalance between the contralesional and
ipsilesional corticoreticular pathways is associated with onset of flexor tone. We will use viral methods to
label cortical projection pathways (premotor to the pontomedullary reticular formation, PMRF) and then
track projection activity over recovery after experimental stroke.
Our proposed specific aims will test this hypothesis using long-term pathway specific tracking as well as
test two promising interventions to reduce flexor tone. The first aim is to determine if increased activity of
the contralesional corticoreticular pathway together with reduced ipsilesional corticoreticular activity
predicts delayed onset of increased flexor tone. In the second aim we will test if low frequency
ipsilesional motor thalamus stimulation in chronic stroke can reduce flexor tone and improve reach to
grasp function. This approach is based on our extensive data that low-frequency patterning is beneficial
for cortical-subcortical communication. Our third aim is to test whether a novel class of small molecules
that activate neurotrophin receptors can reduce flexor tone. Completion of these aims will provide critical
information for designing therapeutic approaches that specifically target abnormal flexor synergies after
stroke. Importantly, they will also provide important information about two promising therapeutic options
to improve function."

The neural crest is a migratory stem cell population that is essential for the development of various tissues and
organs during embryogenesis. Disruptions in neural crest development contribute to the pathogenesis of
craniofacial defects and other congenital malformations, imposing a significant burden on individuals and
society. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neural crest formation is crucial for proper
diagnosis of these conditions. While previous research has focused on protein-DNA interactions in activating
neural crest genes, the role of chromatin conformation changes in this process remains poorly understood.
Previous studies characterizing the architecture of the neural crest genome revealed that these cells display a
complex enhancer-promoter interactome characterized by a reliance on long-range interactions. This proposal
aims to investigate the contribution of architectural proteins, specifically CTCF and YY1, in establishing this
unique chromatin organization. We hypothesize that architectural proteins interact with pioneer transcription
factors to assemble the neural crest interactome and promote activation of gene regulatory circuits. We will test
this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will define the function of architectural proteins in neural crest
formation by identifying the chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and YY1 through chromatin conformation
capture. We will also target architectural proteins in loss-of-function studies to uncover their relative
contributions to the establishment of the neural crest enhancer interactome. Aim 2 seeks to determine how
tissue-specific enhancer-promoter loops are established during neural crest specification. To accomplish this,
we will investigate the functional and physical interactions between architectural proteins and the pioneer
transcription factors that define the neural crest lineage. Aim 3 will define how disease-linked mutations in
architectural proteins affect neural crest chromatin organization. We will employ genome engineering to
reproduce CTCF/YY1 mutations in embryonic stem cells and drive these cells into adopting a cranial neural
crest fate. By elucidating the function of architectural proteins in neural crest development and their role in the
genesis of craniofacial malformations, this research has the potential to pave the way for future therapeutic
strategies aimed at preventing or treating these debilitating conditions."

With the continued growth and aging of the Mexican American (MA) population in the United States, we will
see a tremendous expansion of Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in
this important group. Understanding and reducing the impact of AD/ADRD in MAs is an important priority for
public health and policy making. Currently, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the depth and
determinants of disparities in AD/ADRD over time, and potential ways to lessen the impact of these disorders
in MA communities. AD/ADRD affects not only the patient, but also family caregivers, who struggle with caring
for a loved one facing an uncertain future with many complex decisions about their health and safety. These
common yet difficult decisions such as driving cessation, nursing home placement, and use of life-sustaining
treatments can have tremendous impact on both patient and caregiver across the spectrum of disease through
the end of life. More data are needed on how the growing population of MAs approach these decisions and
integrate socioeconomics, culture, and family. This information is necessary to develop future interventions to
support these difficult decisions. MA culture also has strong values of family support that may have a positive
influence on these decisions and help mitigate some of the negative aspects of caregiving. Using the
population-based cohort of MAs and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) assembled from the highly successful
âCognitive impairment in Mexican Americans: a population-based study (R01 NS100687), we will extend the
cohort follow-up to allow for enhanced understanding of ethnic disparities in AD/ADRD over time. The
extended follow-up of this cohort will allow us to assess the longer-term trajectory of cognitive impairment
affecting MA patients and caregivers and understand the prevalence, determinants, and impact of ethnic
disparities in common decisions surrounding AD/ADRD. This project will address the following aims: 1) To
extend the long-term assessment of trajectory and ethnic-specific predictors of progression to AD/ADRD, as
well as the long-term life impact of AD/ADRD on families and caregivers, among a community-based cohort of
Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites in Nueces County, Texas; 2) To assess the determinants and
impact of decisions regarding two critical community transitions facing individuals with cognitive impairment:
cessation of driving and transition to long-term skilled nursing facilities; and 3) To examine ethnic disparities in
end-of-life treatment preferences among individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in a community-based
cohort. This proposal will elucidate the impact of ethnicity and socioeconomic factors on AD/ADRD and related
decision making across the aging spectrum and assist in the development of targeted decision support
interventions among diverse populations."

Excessive alcohol drinking modulates the innate and adaptive immune systems. It is associated with gut
dysbiosis and bacterial overgrowth. Consequently, it induces intestinal permeability and microbial translocation
to the liver which triggers inflammation aggravating alcohol-associated liver disease. The immune system
interacts, tolerates, and shapes the intestinal microbiota while monitoring for pathogens. The balance between
gut tolerance and immunity is critical in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis. A balanced intestinal
homeostasis is essential to prevent intestinal permeability and microbial translocation to the liver. Goblet cells
regulate the intestinal immune response by secreting mucin and presenting luminal antigens to lamina propria
dendritic cells (LP-DCs) through goblet-cell associated antigen passages (GAPs). LP-DCs adjacent to GAPs
have preferential tolerogenic properties. Chronic alcohol overuse decreases the pool of myeloid DCs and
modifies its properties. However, the effect of chronic ethanol overuse on the LP-immune response is not well
characterized.
The hypothesis is that chronic ethanol exposure alters goblet cell biology resulting in the dysfunction of
LP-DCs with tolerogenic properties adjacent to GAPs. Hence, a lack of antigen presentation to
tolerogenic LP-DCs would induce an imbalance of the intestinal homeostasis. Therefore, goblet cells
might have a central role in the onset of alcohol-related liver diseases.
To explore the proposed hypothesis, aim 1 will investigate the impact of chronic alcohol abuse on goblet cell
biology. It will assess goblet cell numbers, GAP formation, mucin secretion, and the consequent alterations in
the LP-immune system in mice and humans. Aim 2 will define the impact of GAPs and mucin from goblet cells
on ethanol-induced liver disease in ethanol-fed mice with both, loss and gain of function approaches. Finally,
aim 3 will explore a pharmacological approach to manipulate goblet cells to prevent ethanol-induced liver
disease in mice subjected to chronic ethanol feeding. This pharmacological intervention will induce LP-DCs
with tolerogenic properties by stimulating GAP formation to regulate the mucosal immune system.
The proposed study will characterize the role of goblet cells in preclinical models of ethanol-induced liver
disease and patients with alcohol use disorder using cutting edge microbiomics and state-of-the-art
technology. The proposed intervention will find innovative strategies to prevent alcohol-associated liver disease
in patients."

Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) rely on a broad array of health and social
services to address needs ranging from traditional medical care to supports for basic activities of daily living. A
critical set of services is those that allow individuals with ADRD to remain at home as opposed to residing in an
institutional setting. Referred to as home- and community-based services (HCBS), these services span from
clinical services (e.g., skilled home health, in-home palliative care) to services that focus on custodial and social
needs (e.g., home health aides, adult day, respite). Despite their widespread use, there is little data
characterizing the organizations that deliver HCBS, or how well they coordinate with traditional institutional
providers that also care for those with ADRD. Lack of accessible data precludes investigation into availability of
HCBS across different geographies, scope of services offered, organizational relationships, quality, efficiency,
and beyond. Addressing this gap is particularly essential for the ADRD population because they use HCBS at
such high levels.
Our proposal, submitted in response to NIA PAR-19-070, focuses on HCBS for those with dementia and offers
a multi-method approach to capture systematic data on HCBS organizations and how well they engage in care
coordination. Our approach leverages newly-available Medicaid claims/encounter data for HCBS to generate
the first publicly-available, national-level datasets that list and characterize the organizations delivering HCBS to
the ADRD population. Next, we will identify the organizational networks - including HCBS and institutional
organizations â based on which organizations care for the same individuals. Prior work has defined networks of
clinical providers that resulted in widely-used measures of healthcare markets (e.g., hospital referral regions).
However, the definitions do not include HCBS. Defining networks that include HCBS and serve a shared ADRD
population will allow us to characterize the features of the networks (e.g., size, density of ties) in addition to
evaluating outcomes (e.g., hospital readmissions, emergency department visits) for those cared for by these
networks. Finally, by measuring and comparing care coordination activities in networks with better and worse
outcomes (via a large-scale survey of HCBS organizations in those networks), we can identify actionable policy
and practice-based strategies that improve care for a vulnerable population. Taken together, our results will
inform policy and practice strategies to improve delivery of HCBS for the ADRD population that are currently not
well coordinated in relation to our complex and fragmented healthcare delivery system."

Growth plates are highly specialized cartilage structures that ensure skeletal growth and endochondral
ossification during fetal and postnatal development. They are formed and maintained by chondrocytes, as
these cells follow a spatially and temporally tightly controlled multi-step differentiation program. The present
project focuses on transcription factors that have pivotal roles in effecting this program, but whose modes of
actions remain incompletely deciphered. It will test the paradigm-shifting hypothesis that SOX9, its cofactors
SOX5 and SOX6, and RUNX2 and RUNX3 fulfill many of their main functions in a cooperative manner. This
hypothesis is based on a solid scientific premise that includes co-expression of the factors in growth plate
chondrocytes, the presence of RUNT-domain motifs in many chondrocyte-specific enhancers bound by SOX9,
and preliminary evidence that the SOX and RUNX proteins have synergistic activities in enhancer activation.
Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether SOX5/6, SOX9 and RUNX2/3 genetically interact during growth plate
formation in mouse fetuses and in the maintenance of active growth plates in juvenile mice. Specific Aim 2 is to
profile the whole genetic targetomes of SOX5/6, SOX9 and RUNX2/3 in growth plate chondrocytes, and to
assess and validate their overlap. Specific Aim 3 is to identify mechanisms underlying SOX5/6, SOX9 and
RUNX2/3 cooperativity. The proteins will be tested for roles in inducing chromatin accessibility and three-
dimensional connectivity, and for cooperativity in DNA binding and recruitment of functional partners. New
findings should have a significant impact on current understanding of fundamental mechanisms governing the
formation and maintenance of growth plates and other cartilage types. They should thereby help uncover the
molecular basis of many types of pathologies, including chondrodysplasias, tumors and joint degenerative
diseases, and also suggest novel, innovative and efficient treatments for these still unsatisfactorily treatable
diseases."

LMIC: South Africa
Institution: Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town
Scientific Area: Biostatistics for HIV/AIDS and TB research design and methodology
Africa Center for Biostatistical Excellence: expanding biostatistical leadership for HIV/AIDS and
TB research
This application is in response to the FOA âFogarty HIV Research Training Program for Low- and Middle-
Income Country Institutionsâ under the D43 grant mechanism (FOA PAR-19-283) and requests 5 years of
support to expand biostatistics leadership for HIV research design and methodology at Stellenbosch University
in South Africa.
HIV/AIDS and TB remain the highest contributors to the burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The
COVID-19 disease resulting from infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a threat to the fragile
healthcare system and infrastructure in SSA. In particular, COVID-19 effects on the delivery of care to people
living with HIV/AIDS is likely to reverse gains in care and treatment programs achieved over decades. Data
driven solutions and targeted research and evaluations demand complimentary teams of leaders, including
biostatisticians. There is a huge deficit of doctoral level biostatisticians in the region.
In 2017, we successfully implemented a mastersâ level training program in biostatistics for HIV/AIDS research.
Despite shortage in local biostatisticians with advanced training, we mobilized international collaborators to
assist with teaching and student supervision. For sustainability of our training program, the natural
progression is to train local future leaders in biostatistics who will continue the training initiatives and also
provide research leadership to address the myriad of health problems in SSA.
We propose to continue our efforts to bridge the gap in biostatistics capacity in SSA and develop research
leadership at Stellenbosch University and the region at large. The specific objectives of this renewal of the
training grant are to: (1) develop biostatistics leadership through a doctoral training program at Stellenbosch
University; (2) continue building biostatistics capacity through a Mastersâ level academic program and expand
our reach using e-learning platforms; (3) consolidate the ACBE as a leader in providing professional
development in biostatistics and data management to support HIV/AIDS research projects and programs
within the SSA region and lead HIV/AIDS and TB research activities."
10831967,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a potentially unlimited source of functional
cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) for use in disease modeling, drug development, and regenerative therapies. In
particular, use of hiPSC-CM-derived microtissues in microphysiological (âorgan-on-chipâ) systems holds
promise as the future mainstay of pharmaceutical research and a platform to improve our understanding of
genotype-phenotype relationships in mono- and polygenic diseases of the human heart. However, a major
obstacle to wide-spread use of hiPSC-CMs in these applications are their immature properties including small
cell size, lack of T-tubules, predominantly glycolytic metabolism, and reduced functional output, to name a few.
One important aspect of postnatal CM maturation - increased ploidy - has been largely understudied. Namely,
in vitro cultured hiPSC-CMs are predominantly mononuclear and diploid, while the adult human myocardium
consists of ~90% polyploid CMs. We thus propose to investigate potential roles of polyploidy in hiPSC-CM
maturation, and specifically, to explore if engineered polyploidy of hiPSC-CMs can endow human engineered
cardiac tissues (hECTs) with increased functionality and maturity compared to control tissues made from
primarily diploid CMs. Our preliminary results show that stable hiPSC-CM polyploidy induced genetically or
pharmacologically results in increased size and mitochondrial density of hiPSC-CMs, as well as contractile
strength and conduction velocity of hECTs. In the proposed studies, we will further examine roles of CM
polyploidization in structural, functional, and metabolic maturation of hECTs and investigate polyploidy-induced
transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, using a novel bioreactor with capacity to
dynamically control applied mechanical preload and afterload to hECTs, we will investigate the relationships
between developmentally-mimetic regimes of mechanical loading and CM polyploidy. We will also determine
if polyploidy sensitizes hiPSC-CMs to hypertrophic stimuli in vitro and protects hECTs from oxidative stress in
vitro and ischemic damage in vivo. Finally, we will apply CRISPR/Cas9 screening methodologies to identify
genetic inducers of terminal maturation in already polyploidy hiPSC-CMs and will perform additional screens
in both diploid and polyploid hiPSC-CMs to identify candidate mitogens that can promote CM cell cycle activity.
By successfully completing these studies, we expect to improve our understanding of physiological roles of
polyploidy in cardiac development and to establish the foundation for the future translational uses of engineered
cardiac tissues in disease modeling, drug development, and cardiac therapies."
10832052,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x
the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and
longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage
in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied
behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories
across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is
developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are
currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to
look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in
their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors
or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these
dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral
processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied
mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of
individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes.
We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed
intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis
and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment
of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable
self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting-
edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models
that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by
enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol
completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then
provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year.
In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related
to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the
framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use
trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts."

My goal is to pursue an independent career in computational psychiatry by leveraging cutting-edge neuroimaging
and data-driven analysis approaches to advance precision medicine in mental health. To build on my strong
neuroimaging and computational background, the training component of this award emphasizes coursework and
mentorship in the clinical and behavioral aspects of psychopathology. I will also receive mentorship to advance
my theoretical and applied understanding of deep learning in this burgeoning field. The overarching research
goal in this proposal is to develop computational strategies that account for the heterogeneity of mood disorders
to improve the identification of treatment-response biomarkers. Response to pharmaceutical and behavioral
antidepressant treatments is low, likely due to the symptomatic and etiological heterogeneity of depression
whereby certain treatments may confer differential benefits for patients having particular symptom constellations.
In the K99 phase, I will seek to improve prediction of individual antidepressant response using electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT), which elicits robust and rapid antidepressant effects, as the treatment model. I will use MRI and
clinical data from patients undergoing ECT collected for the large the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration
(GEMRIC). In Aim 1, I will use exploratory factor analysis to characterize latent symptom dimensions of the
GEMRIC cohort before, during, and after ECT. The accuracy of predicting clinical outcomes along the recovered
symptom dimensions will be compared to traditional means of evaluating response using the total score of the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Pursuit of this aim will expand my understanding of clinical psychiatry
and lay foundational knowledge for the independent aims. Aim 2 will expand my deep learning and multimodal
neuroimaging skillsets as I develop novel deep learning architectures to fuse multimodal imaging features of
GEMRIC participants to further improve predictions of treatment response and cognitive impairment following
ECT. Rather than simply concatenating multimodal features together, deep network architectures will discover
latent feature representations. The R00 phase will be a logical progression of the skill sets I develop in the
mentored phase and expand on these lines of research. Aim 3 will draw from a collection of large-scale MRI
datasets from patients with more broadly defined mood disorders to identify multimodal imaging markers
associated with transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 4 uses treatment groups from aim 3, including patients
undergoing ketamine, sleep deprivation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmaceuticals, to explore the extent
to which biomarkers of therapeutic response, defined along the transdiagnostic symptom dimensions identified
in Aim 3, are shared across treatment groups. I anticipate that discrete categorizations of mood disorders
artificially obscures discovery of treatment-response biomarkers. Fulfillment of these aims will simultaneously
propel me to independence and yield important insight into the treatment of heterogeneous mood disorders."
10832542,"Cell migration in 3D tissue space is of fundamental importance for human biology. However, predicting and
programming 3D cell motility remain as major challenges despite of a firm picture of the molecular machineries
involved. To fill the knowledge gap between the overwhelming subcellular details such as protein-protein
interactions, and the fascinating dynamic patterns exhibited by different cell types in tissue spaces, I will focus
on the mesoscale cellular dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions of cells in 3D extracellular matrix
(ECM). My lab has developed deep-learning based image postprocessing to track the migration modes of cells.
We also developed techniques to manipulate and measure the micromechanics of ECM at cellular scale. Based
on these preliminary results, I will systematically study the intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms of 3D cell
migration mode transitions in collagen ECM. The results will pave the way for my long-term goals to understand
the organizing principle that lead molecules to life, and to program cell motility for applications in tissue
engineering and cancer treatment. To this end, I will dedicate my lab to the following research thrusts. Thrust 1
aims to determine how cell migration mode transitions are regulated by external cues, as well as intrinsic states
of cells during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). I will test three hypotheses that elucidate the roles
of ECM micromechanical stiffness, anisotropy, plasticity, synergy of mechanical and chemical guidance, as well
as EMT stage in modulating the cell migration mode transitions. I will employ sophisticated ECM engineering
and characterization techniques developed in my lab. I will also use genetically engineered cells whose EMT
transcription factors are fluorescent labeled and can be specifically activated. Completion of thrust 1 will establish
3D cell migration as a hidden Markov process where the mesoscale dynamics, namely the migration mode
transitions, provides a unifying framework to explain diverse dynamic patterns of 3D cell migration observed in
vivo. Thrust 2 aims to devise strategies to program cell migration via nonstationary mechanical cues. In
subproject 1, I will employ techniques developed in my lab to control 3D contact guidance cues in space and in
real time. By measuring the migration mode transitions under step-increasing contact guidance, I will obtain the
energy barriers that separate different modes. Then under periodic mechanical stimuli I will measure and
computationally model the nonequilibrium mode transition flux, a statistical physics quantity that inform the
efficiency and energy dissipation of cell motility responses. These mesoscale quantities shed light to the
underlying molecular organizing principles. In subproject 2 I will develop collagen ECM which exhibits digital
response to stresses using DNA-grafted nanoparticles as crosslinkers. I will design the DNA sequence to control
the yield strength of crosslinkers, thereby programing cell migration mode both for single cell and for collective
organoid migration. Completion of thrust 2 will expands the design space of engineered ECM, laying a foundation
for the mechanical programing of 3D cell motility."

(3) To perform non-compartmental, compartmental, and population PK analyses and report the results to study
teams and CTEP in a timely manner. Our approach will be to use our technical and scientific expertise to lead
all PK-related activities and integrate these PK investigations with the other clinical and correlative studies
performed during the drug development process. We will develop, validate, and implement accurate, precise,
and sensitive assays for study drugs and metabolites in plasma, tissues and other biological samples, and
analyze clinical samples from the ETCTN LOAs. Lastly, we will derive PK parameters to characterize the
ADME of agents in ETCTN trials, integrate these results with pharmacodynamic measures of drug response
and report to CTEP and the clinical team to optimally inform ongoing and future development of CTEP agents
and their combinations."

 Substance use disorders represent a major public health problem, and improved therapies are needed.
To-date, pre-clinical models of addiction have not translated well into improved therapy options. An improved
understanding of the clinical neurobiology of addictions can help refine preclinical neurocircuit models of
addiction which may help inform the development of future therapies. One tool that can help improve the
understanding of the neurobiology of substance use disorders is resting state brain functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI measurements taken at rest allow for the assessment of functional
connectivity, or correlations in activity patterns between spatially distinct brain regions. Dynamic Causal
Modeling-estimated effective (directional) connectivity further estimates the direction of connectivity between
brain regions. As opposed to preclinical models focused on specific brain regions acting as independent
modules, human research has emphasized the analysis of the brain as functional networks of brain regions
(Bressler & Menon, 2010). Functional and effective connectivity can provide insight into how the brain is
organized into networks and how those networks may be altered in substance use disorders. The study of how
brain networks interact opens a new avenue of research on the neurobiology of substance use disorders and
other related brain disorders. However, published studies assessing functional or effective connectivity
between whole brain networks in substance use disorders compared to healthy controls are lacking. In
particular, there has been a relative lack of studies assessing functional or effective connectivity of the
executive control network, despite well documented executive control deficits in substance use disorders.
Robust and replicable within- and between-network connectivity differences in substance use disorders could
help refine preclinical models of addiction helping to inform future pharmacotherapy development. The present
study aims to assess between-network brain functional connectivity and effective connectivity among three key
brain networks (Salience Network, Default Mode Network, and Executive Control Network) in opioid and
cocaine use disorder subjects compared to non-drug using controls. The completion of this project will
determine the extent to which functional and effective connectivity among the Default Mode Network, Salience
Network, and Executive Control Network differs in opioid and cocaine use disorders compared to non-drug
using controls, providing neurocircuit targets for preclinical and clinical models of substance use disorders."
10833607,"Metastases are responsible for ~90% of human cancer-related deaths, yet our understanding of the stages of
metastasis and the regulating features that drive secondary, tertiary etc. tumors is sorely lacking. In particular,
the early niche surrounding disseminated cells appears critical for survival, dormancy, and/or successful
development of progressing micrometastases. Indeed, not infrequently, breast cancer patients succumb to
recurrent or metastatic disease years to decades after treatment that had rendered the disease undetectable.
In fact, greater than 67% of breast cancer deaths occur beyond the 5-year survival window and some patients
present with recurrence after more than a decade of being âdisease-freeâ. Yet, our understanding of the
intrinsic and environmental factors that initiate and maintain programs of dormancy versus metastatic
progression remains extremely limited. Here, we seek to elucidate fundamental physical and molecular
mechanisms that govern cell fate in ectopic sites. To date, numerous technical hurdles have impeded our
ability to study the genetic and microenvironmental drivers of dormancy and recurrence, particularly in vivo
where these events are rare and not easily controlled. Indeed, in vitro platforms that permit control of the cell
microenvironment and permit cell isolation based on cell state (i.e. dormant vs. progressing) are required to
identify and characterize molecular mechanisms governing these behaviors that can be validated and targeted
in vivo. To address these significant challenges, this proposal leverages expertise in cancer biology and cancer
bioengineering through numerous innovative technologies (e.g. microfluidic generation of metastatic niches,
advanced optical imaging, cutting edge cell engineering with CRISPR technologies etc.) that uniquely enable
us to drastically improve our understanding of how dormancy is regulated in vivo. Here, we hypothesize that
dormancy or colony proliferation in metastatic niches is dictated by lock-and-key behavior between cancer cells
with specific genetic and epigenetic signaling and the initial and evolving properties of the ectopic
microenvironment. Our hypotheses will be tested in the following Specific Aims: (1) Define specific
extracellular matrix compositions that drive survival, dormancy, or colonization using high-throughput micro-
engineering metastatic environments (MEME) technology; (2) Dissect the molecular mechanisms governing
survival, dormancy, or colonization in defined metastatic niche microenvironments; (3) Define the specific
influence of bone marrow-derived and tissue-specific resident macrophages in carcinoma cell survival,
dormancy, or colonization. Through these efforts we will dissect the mechanistic drivers of disseminated tumor
cell dormancy or proliferation, which will elucidate therapeutic targets to prevent dormant tumor cells from
evading therapy. Additionally, these studies will reveal therapeutic targets to kill dormant cells directly or
prevent their escape from dormancy to proliferation in order to prevent recurrence."

Rayhan A. Lal, MD is an Instructor in the Divisions of Adult and Pediatric Endocrinology at Stanford University.
As an electrical engineer and computer scientist with type 1 diabetes, his primary research interest is the
design, development and testing of new diabetes technologies. This K23 proposal will provide a structured
clinical research training experience with formal mentorship that will enable Dr. Lal to become an independent
clinical researcher with expertise in automated insulin delivery.
Subcutaneous âhybridâ closed-loop systems modulate insulin delivery based on continuous glucose data but
require users to announce meals. Despite promising randomized controlled trials, our published real-world
experience with the first commercial subcutaneous system shows that 46% of users presenting to clinic entirely
discontinue âAuto Modeâ within 1 year. While some barriers may be overcome, the optimal technological
solution requires high user satisfaction and optimal glycemic control with minimal user intervention.
In this application, Dr. Lal proposes several studies to understand and optimize the intraperitoneal delivery of
insulin for a future autonomous implantable system. Intraperitoneal insulin delivery acts faster than
subcutaneous. The âtailâ of insulin action is also shorter, making it easier to upregulate and downregulate
insulin levels with fewer time delays which is essential for automated insulin delivery. Intraperitoneal insulin
delivery also partially restores glucagon response to hypoglycemia and exercise, even in long-standing type 1
diabetes. The improved kinetics and safety from restored glucagon secretion make this system ideal for fully
automated insulin delivery. There is also a significant positive experience among users of implanted
intraperitoneal insulin therapy.
The specific aims of Dr. Lalâs study are to: (1) evaluate BMI, body composition, bone health and human factors
associated with intraperitoneal insulin among worldwide users, centered in Montpellier, and compare them to
matched controls with type 1 diabetes using subcutaneous insulin, (2) assess the speed and glucagon counter-
regulatory response to intraperitoneal faster acting insulin apart (Fiasp), and (3) use the available data to
perform in silico modeling and determine a control strategy that keeps glycemic control in range (70-180mg/dL)
over a variety of simulated conditions. His mentors include Drs. Buckingham, Maahs, Hood and Renard
worldwide leaders in diabetes technology.
In addition to coursework in epidemiology, statistics, study design, human protection and ethics, Dr. Lal will
also pursue a Biodesign faculty fellowship, offered at Stanford to promote the development of new health
technology. Dr. Lalâs long-term research objective is to collaborate with a diabetes device manufacturer,
PhysioLogic Devices (see letter of support from Peter Lord), to develop and test an implanted fully closed-loop
intraperitoneal insulin delivery system, optimizing time in range and eliminating the daily burdens of diabetes."

10833522,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Retinal leukostasis and vascular leakage play important pathogenic roles in diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Accumulating evidence suggests that DR is not an isolated retinal disease. Although circulating monocytes are
the major leukocyte subset responsible for leukostasis, the underlying regulation for monocyte activation in DR
has not been well investigated, which represents a knowledge gap. Two independent and prospective clinical
studies reported that fenofibrate, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±), has
robust therapeutic effects on DR. Our preliminary studies showed that PPARÎ± levels are down-regulated in
circulating monocytes of diabetic patients and diabetic animal models. PPARÎ± ablation alone induces monocyte
activation, including increased adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis, while fenofibrate attenuates monocyte
activation in diabetic mice. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
pathway plays a crucial role in inflammation. We showed that cGAS and STING are up-regulated in monocytes
in a diabetic model and in PPARÎ±-/- mice, and inhibition of STING attenuates monocyte activation and alleviates
retinal leukostasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that PPARÎ± suppresses cGAS-STING signaling to alleviate
monocyte activation and retinal leukostasis in DR, and that this effect is mediated in part by the mitoprotective
function of PPARÎ± in diabetic monocytes. To address this hypothesis, we will first investigate if PPARÎ±
suppresses monocyte activation in diabetes to alleviate retinal inflammation and vascular leakage in DR. Using
monocyte-specific PPARÎ± conditional KO (PPARÎ±MCKO) mice and monocyte-specific PPARÎ± transgenic
(PPARÎ±MCTg) mice, we will determine if ablation of PPARÎ± will exacerbate, while PPARÎ± over-expression will
alleviate diabetes-induced monocyte activation (adhesion, migration, phagocytosis), retinal leukostasis, vascular
leakage, and acellular capillary formation. Toward the mechanism for the monocyte-regulating function of
PPARÎ±, we will investigate if the anti-inflammatory effect of PPARÎ± is through inhibition of cGAS-STING
signaling in monocytes in diabetes. We will compare cGAS-STING activation in monocytes of diabetic
PPARÎ±MCKO, PPARÎ±MCTg, and WT mice. Furthermore, we will investigate if PPARÎ± ablation promotes cGAS-
STING activation in monocytes by exacerbating mitochondrial damage and cytosolic mtDNA release in DR. We
also propose to study if the cGAS-STING pathway activation in monocytes plays a causative role in retinal
inflammation and vascular leakage in DR. We will determine if a STING inhibitor or ablation of cGAS or STING
will ameliorate monocyte activation, retinal leukostasis and vascular leakage in diabetic mice. The proposed
studies will identify a novel interaction between PPARÎ± and the cGAS-STING pathway in the regulation of
immunometabolism and retinal inflammation in DR. These studies will also elucidate a new mechanism
responsible for the therapeutic effects of fenofibrate on DR."

This R01 application follows a successfully completed R34 project and addresses our overarching goal of
optimizing methadone dosing as a method for managing comorbid chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD)
among persons receiving methadone for the treatment of OUD. Up to 62% of persons maintained on
methadone for OUD experience clinically significant pain, versus 31% in the general population. Pain in MMP
is associated with poor OUD treatment outcomes and severe distress. No effective treatment for comorbid pain
and OUD currently exists; though preclinical and human data suggest divided methadone dosing may be a
more optimal strategy for managing pain than once daily dosing, this has never been empirically examined.
This study will evaluate an intervention for comorbid chronic pain among MMP using a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of ONCE versus TWICE daily methadone dosing. This project is
strongly supported by our recent successful completion of an R34, which demonstrated strong feasibility and
acceptability of an electronic, autonomous, cellular-enabled commercially available pillbox (MedMinder) to
manage methadone take-home dosing. Participants in that study indicated they would use the pillbox again
(86%) and recommend it to others (95%), local clinics adopted the MedMinder box into their routine take-home
management operations, and preliminary within-person data showed clear and orderly pain reductions during
the TWICE vs. ONCE dosing periods. Patients from two methadone clinics will be enrolled into a Phase II
between-group study and randomized to ONCE versus TWICE-daily methadone dosing for 12-weeks.
Methadone will be dispensed via the same electronic pillbox used in the R34. Primary outcomes are weekly
assessments of pain and OUD outcomes, ecological momentary assessment of pain before and after dosing,
and point-prevalence measures of laboratory-induced pain to explore mechanism of effects. We will assess the
following aims: (Primary 1) Determine impact of methadone dose interval (ONCE vs. TWICE) on pain severity,
(Primary 2) Determine impact of methadone dose interval (ONCE vs. TWICE) on pain-related function,
(Primary 3) Determine impact of methadone dose interval (ONCE vs. TWICE) on OUD-related metrics, and
(Secondary 1) Determine impact of methadone dosing interval on response to laboratory-induced pain using
quantitative sensory testing. We expect participants assigned to TWICE daily dosing will show decreases in
pain severity, improved pain-related function, and no change or improvements in OUD-related outcomes
relative to persons receiving standard-of-care ONCE daily dosing. If effective, this approach could transform
the care of MMP with pain because it would be feasible to implement within the operational structure of a
methadone clinic and would impose low provider burden. Results could provide a high magnitude treatment for
the substantial number of MMP who experience daily pain with no reliable form of treatment."

Dr. Rusconi has a long-standing interest in host microbial interactions. Her work has focused on infants born
preterm, who are exceptionally prone to life-threatening gut-associated pathology, most notably necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC). The absence of preventive strategies for NEC and its abysmal outcomes, compelled Dr.
Rusconi to perform a broad range metabolomics analysis of pre-event NEC specimens to better understand its
pathophysiology. A unique sphingolipid profile emerged, which was confirmed in a larger cohort by targeted
mass spectrometry. Sphingolipids perform diverse functions in the human body. Sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P), a sphingolipid metabolite, is an important signaling molecule that promotes lymphocyte migration. The
sensing of S1P by S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) is antagonized in vivo by multiple S1P1 agonists, such as SEW2871,
through the internalization and degradation of the receptor. By treating neonatal mice with SEW2871 she
observed the predicted systemic lymphopenia and and increase in dendritic and T cells in the small intestine
lamina propria. The accumulation of these cells in the lamina propria was not observed in adult mice. Aim 1 will
focus on identifying age-specific functional responses of the small intestinal lamina propria upon S1P
antagonism. Dr. Rusconi will complement pharmacological data with cell-type specific S1P1 KO mice to address
cell-specific requirements. The sphingolipid signature and dysbiosis appear in the same pre-NEC interval. Aim
2 focuses on determining their relationship. Germ-free mice will be colonized with dysbiotic or control preterm
microbiota to assess impact on sphingolipids. Fecal content from animals used in Aim 1 will be used to determine
the impact of S1P antagonism on the microbiota. Finally, in Aim 3, Dr. Rusconi will combine S1P1 antagonism
and dysbiotic preterm microbiota with the NEC-like injury model. She will dissect the role of accumulating
lymphocyte populations and altered microbiota on exacerbating NEC-like lesions. Completion of this proposal
will provide much needed information on the role of S1P signaling in mucosal immunity establishment and its
interplay with the microbiota in the maturing intestine, an interval of life during which NEC occurs. Specifically,
this K01 award will allow Dr. Rusconi to improve her ability to plan and conduct animal experiments, refine her
immunology skills, and provide her with didactic and practical training in grant writing and manuscript preparation,
in a highly mentored environment. Dr. Rusconiâs Institution is supporting her effort with a junior faculty
appointment, space, and protected time to perform this work. Her advisory committee consists of her primary
mentor Dr. Phillip Tarr, co-mentors Drs. Rodney Newberry and Gautam Dantas, who are investigators with
complementary expertise in mucosal immunity, microbe-host interactions, animal models of intestinal disease,
and human microbiota modeling. Dr. Rusconiâs Career Development Plan adds to her training in biochemistry,
molecular biology, microbiology, and bioinformatics. In summary, this K01 grant will provide Dr. Rusconi the
skills to launch an independent research career, amalgamating bioinformatics and experimental biology."

10833637,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RELEVANCE: Approximately 1 in 4 U.S. adults suffers from multimorbidity, or two or more concurrent
chronic diseases. People with multimorbidity experience more disability and higher mortality risk and have
higher medical costs than people with 1 chronic condition. Our understanding of the onset and progression of
multimorbidity is limited. OBJECTIVES: To develop clinical practice guidelines and interventions, it is
necessary to have accurate information about the progression of multimorbidity, the age and timing of onset,
and differences in these across population groups. AIMS: 1) Harmonize and bridge national longitudinal data
to track the incidence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity in the U.S. starting at age 30. We will combine 7
premier national cohort datasets of adult health (Add Health, NLSY79, NLSY97, PSID, REGARDS, H-EPESE,
HRS) to create a synthetic nationally representative cohort of adults starting at age 30 years, compiling over 1.7
million person-years of follow-up and include sizeable number of racial/ethnic minorities. 2) Estimate the
progression to multimorbidity starting at age 30 years. We will identify the age-specific progression rate of
common chronic disease clusters and the sentinel conditions associated with higher risks of progression to
additional diseases. 3) Develop measures of age-specific risk of multimorbidity for the US adult population and
calculate the lifetime risk of developing multimorbidity and years spent with multimorbidity. 4) For major
race-ethnic, sex, economic, and geographic groups, identify the sentinel conditions, age-specific progression,
and lifetime risk of multimorbidity. We will estimate differences across groups and quantify the implications of
reducing these disparities on disease-free life expectancy, with the additional innovation of adjusting for biases
due to differential mortality and institutionalization. DESIGN: Bridging and reweighting procedures will be
applied to develop a new data infrastructure with nationally representative longitudinal birth cohorts and
synthetic cohorts. We will use Poisson regression to model the ages at which disparities in multi-morbidity
emerge. To capture the sequencing and pacing of multimorbidity, we will estimate the probability of
experiencing an additional (k+1th) condition for those with k prior chronic conditions. We will estimate
cumulative probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities. Disparities will be quantified using
Greenwoodâs estimator. IMPACT: This project will advance understanding of the nature, onset, and
progression of multimorbidity. To inform clinical practice and healthcare guidelines, we will identify
conditional risks of transitioning to additional diseases given age of onset and sentinel disease. With particular
relevance to policy, we will model the years of disease-free life expectancy that would be gained by
interventions that delay or avert the onset of sentinel diseases. The data infrastructure generated from this
project will be made available to the research community and will be useful for a variety of aging-related
research questions."
10833999,"Targeting Posttranslational Modifications in Breast Cancer
Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have a poor prognosis and are not amenable to endocrine- or HER2-
targeted therapies. While the newly approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as olaparib and talazoparib provide
a glint of hope to the approximately 15-20% of TNBC patients with BRCA1-deficiency, the need for a novel
strategy that could benefit the remaining 80-85% BRCA1-proficient TNBC patients is urgent and significant. The
goal of this project is to determine the impact of interplay between KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and poly-ADP-
ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) in breast tumor progression and metastasis, and further develop a small molecule
inhibitor of KLF4 that synergizes with PARPi for anti-TNBC treatment. This proposal is based on our original
discovery that KLF4 acts as a critical signaling node in mediating DNA damage response (DDR)/DNA repair,
wherein the Poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of KLF4 by PARP1 dictates the chromatin recruitment for KLF4
that, in turn, governs KLF4 transcriptional function with respect to the maintenance of genome stability, tumor
progression/metastasis and drug sensitivity in breast cancer. These findings led to our central hypothesis that
dysregulation of KLF4 by PARP1 results in genome instability and tumor promotes progression/metastasis, and
blockade of KLF4 by newly developed KLF4 inhibitor synergizes PARPi for efficient killing of TNBC cells. Three
specific aims are proposed to elucidate the importance and mechanisms regulating KLF4 by PARP1: (1) To
determine the mechanism by which PARP1 regulates KLF4-mediated genome stability and carcinogenesis
through orchestrating the recruitment of KLF4 to chromatin; (2) To determine the physiological and clinical
relevance of KLF4 PARylation in breast tumor progression/metastasis; and (3) To validate the therapeutic
intervention of KLF4 inhibitor in synergizing with olaparib/talazoparib in anti-TNBC treatment using human breast
tumor organoid and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).

10894313,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women and men are at different risks for disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan from
development through aging and have critical implications for therapeutic efficacy. However, many of the
mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still unclear. The mission of
our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as leaders in the field of women's
health and sex differences who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical
disorders and those specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks to continue to support an
integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational approach to understanding
differential incidences of disorders important for the health of women and how it differs from men. The program
is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal development,
puberty, adulthood, and aging, including the child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an underlying
assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes will provide
the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Division of Women's Health
at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the Women, Heart and Brain Global Initiative at Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) Research Institute, are the home sites for this endeavor, in the broader context of a
Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in
women's health and sex differences with mentors across Harvard institutions: BWH, MGH, Beth Israel-
Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital,
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each
BIRCWH scholar is assigned a team of mentors to operationalize translational thinking. Primary Mentors are in
clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or
clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help to guide thinking, coursework and readings,
depending on the scholar's interests. Career Mentors advise scholars in the relevant departmental and
academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health Disparities expose scholars to thinking about
how the roles of hormones and genes in affected morbidity are influenced by socioenvironmental factors. The
Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on disorders with higher incidence and/or differential expression in women
than men including: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine & Neuroendocrine Disorders;
Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By capitalizing on the vast
resources and faculty at Harvard and our 14-year successful BIRCWH history, Harvard is an ideal site for
continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will continue to train the
next generation of leaders in women's health and sex differences in medicine."
10839359,"Current treatment planning for brachytherapy of cervical cancer is performed with manual techniques that are
both time-consuming and subjective. Manual treatment planning takes 95 minutes on average and occurs
while patients are sedated, and the quality of the treatments is highly dependent on the expertise of the
physician. Unfortunately, the resource intensiveness and need for specialized expertise are barriers to
implementation of brachytherapy, and as a result many centers are not offering this essential treatment for
cervical cancer. Alarmingly, this rapid decline in brachytherapy utilization has been linked to 12% reductions in
patient survival. To overcome the barriers to delivering highly effective brachytherapy, there is a critical need
for tools that improve the efficiency and reduce the complexity of treatment planning for each patient. My long-
term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on automating brachytherapy cancer treatment
with machine learning, producing button-click solutions that will significantly upgrade the quality of
brachytherapy and combat declining utilization. I have significant experience in modeling, image processing
and computer programming and I want to build on this skillset with a training program that will prepare me for
independence. I have assembled an exceptional mentorship team, which includes expertise in machine
learning, clinical trials, implementation science and statistics. We formed a training plan to gain expertise in (1)
deep learning, (2) advanced statistical analysis, (3) design of clinical trials and implementation of technology
and (4) research career development. The research goal of this proposal is to develop a tool for fully
automated cervical brachytherapy treatment planning, which uses machine learning models to make
predictions for new patients. The central hypothesis is that automated planning using machine learning will
generate non-inferior or even superior plans in significantly reduced treatment planning time. This hypothesis
will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) Develop machine learning models, which use labelled patient
images to predict radiation dose; (2) Develop and evaluate efficacy of a pipeline for automated brachytherapy
planning; and (3) Prospectively measure the efficiency and clinical impact of automated brachytherapy
planning. For Aim 1, convolutional neural networks will be developed to predict 3D radiation dose from
imaging. Aim 2 will convert predicted doses into deliverable treatment plans using gradient-descent
optimization to determine optimal treatment parameters. Aim 3 will provide an end-to-end validation of the
automated planning by testing it in real-time clinical workflow. This work is innovative because it presents the
first clinical validation of an automated treatment planning system for brachytherapy of cervical cancer. The
proposed research is significant because it will revolutionize the current brachytherapy paradigm by applying
machine learning to automate and standardize time-consuming, manual processes. This work is a key step
towards my future R01 submission on multi-institutional implementation of automated cervical brachytherapy."

provide scientific and technical expertise for incorporation of appropriate, integrated
quality Assurance (QA) and image data management for both imaging and radiotherapy
(RT) in applicable trials conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)
Program and other NCI funded clinical trial groups (NCORP and ETCTN). The physical
IROC QA Centers are distributed in 4 main locations and are administratively organized
through the American College of Radiology (ACR). The QA Centers include IROC
Houston, IROC Ohio, IROC Rhode Island, and IROC Philadelphia. The Advanced
Technology QA Center (ATC) located at Washington University, St. Louis will provide
their expertise and consultation services to IROC as needed. IROC capitalizes on
existing infrastructure and expertise at QA centers currently providing services to the
NCIâs clinical trial programs. Work flows, processes and information systems have been
enhanced taking into account the best practices and standards in an integrated vision
across NCIâs clinical trials. The interdependencies between imaging and RT are
synergized eliminating duplication of services and optimizing efficient and effective
workflows. A major strength of IROC is the development of consistent standard
operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN, NCORP and ETCTN
(NCI Groups) and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets
across the networks. IROCâs organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array
of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support;
Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post-treatment Case Review); and Case
Review. An information technology infrastructure is used that harmonizes IROC
services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCI Groupsâ clinical
trials. IROC implements programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT
planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members collaborate with
the NCI, NCI Groups, and disease/modality committees within each Network Group to
provide an optimum and effective imaging and RT core service. The IROC Group will
analyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively and the correlation it might have
with clinical trial outcomes to better determine and prioritize appropriate QA activities

Over the past five years, my lab has made significant strides in the development of genetic systems capable of
driving the rapid mutation and evolution of user-selected genes of interest in vivo. These systems have allowed
us and others to quickly and scalably evolve enzymes, proteins, and antibodies to address a range of problems
spanning from studying drug resistance to creating affinity reagents on demand. These systems have also
begun to allow us to use rapid mutational accumulation as a method for tracing cell lineage in developing
animals. One of our key accomplishments has been the invention of an orthogonal DNA replication system
(OrthoRep). In OrthoRep, an error-prone orthogonal DNA polymerase (DNAP) exclusively replicates a special
cytosolic plasmid encoding only genes of interest (GOIs), driving their continuous evolution fully in vivo. This
MIRA will integrate our labâs work on OrthoRep and support its further development and application in the next
five years. In particular, we will grow the core OrthoRep technology in order to accelerate GOI evolution in
yeast even more than we currently have, attempt to establish OrthoRep in mammalian cells in order to extend
the range of problems OrthoRep can directly address, apply OrthoRep to the engineering of bespoke Cas9s to
extend the range and efficacy of targeting, apply OrthoRep to improve the capabilities of a lineage tracing tool
developed by my lab, and apply OrthoRep to the generation of mutually orthogonal collections of aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs to support genetic code expansion efforts also ongoing in my lab.
We
hope the set of activities proposed for this MIRA will solidify OrthoRep as an exceptionally powerful genetic
system for evolving enzymes and proteins capable of solving high-reward problems in the chemical, biological,
and biomedical sciences."
10839476,"Disrupted sleep, a major public health issue, independently increases risk for cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Blacks have increased rates of sleep deficiency, which are likely under-reported. Importantly, these
data relate primarily to those of West African ancestry. Our current knowledge of sleep disruption in Blacks,
already severely limited in scope, cannot be readily applied to Somali Americans. The majority of Somali
immigrants have settled in Minnesota, placing our Minnesota-based research team in a unique position to
comprehensively study the mechanisms and consequences of disrupted sleep as a mediator of cardiovascular
health disparities in this population. Our preliminary data suggest that Somali Americans have a high likelihood
of disrupted sleep, which may put them at increased risk for hypertension and other CVD. Underlying
sociocultural, behavioral, environmental and biological factors likely contribute to an increased risk for sleep
deficiencies. We therefore propose an inter-disciplinary approach using a socioecological model
informed by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research
Framework to determine the types and severity of undiagnosed sleep deficiencies in otherwise healthy
Somali Americans, identify mechanisms contributing to their disrupted sleep, and examine the role of
sleep deficiencies in raising blood pressure (BP). Our central hypothesis is that Somali Americans will
have a high likelihood of sleep deficiencies attributable in part to unique multilevel individual, psychosocial,
contextual and behavioral factors, which exert deleterious biological effects. We propose the following aims:
 Aim 1: Determine the types and severity of previously undiagnosed sleep deficiencies in otherwise
 healthy Somali Americans. Hypothesis 1: Somali Americans have a high (>50%) likelihood of previously
 undiagnosed sleep deficiencies (short sleep (<6 hours), insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea).
 Aim 2: Apply the NIMHD Research Framework to define psychosocial, behavioral, environmental and
 biological mechanisms mediating sleep deficiencies in Somali Americans. Hypothesis 2: Unique
 multilevel individual, cultural and environmental risk and protective factors play a mechanistic role in
 mediating an increased likelihood of disrupted sleep in Somali Americans.
 Aim 3: Examine the relationship between sleep deficiencies and increased BP in Somali Americans.
 Hypothesis 3: BP during wakefulness and/or sleep will be increased in those subjects with disrupted sleep,
 commensurate with type and severity of sleep deficiency, and moderated by factors such as sex and age.
The expected outcome of this proposal will be a mechanistic pathway incorporating the NIMHD Research
Framework to identify psychosocial, behavioral, contextual and biological factors mediating sleep deficiencies
and related increases in BP, and consequently hypertension risk, thus addressing important knowledge
gaps in understanding sleep-related health disparities and their consequences in Somali Americans."
10839378,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Bacteria and humans have a complex relationship: our abundant commensal organisms
provide numerous benefits, whereas pathogenic bacteria impose a large burden of morbidity and
mortality. The immune system restricts bacterial growth through nutritional immunity, antimicrobial
peptides, lytic enzymes, and phagocytic cells. Potential pathogens respond to these threats by the
activation of specific adaptive responses, many of which are critical for virulence. We study stress
responses in Bacillus subtilis, a model Gram positive bacterium. One project addresses responses to
the changing availability of the essential nutrient metal ions zinc, iron, and manganese. The immune
system restricts the growth of pathogens by metal sequestration, both in tissues (e.g. by calprotectin)
and after phagocytosis. In addition, phagocytic cells kill cells by metal intoxication. We have
demonstrated that metal ion homeostasis relies on specific metal-sensing transcription factors that
respond to limitation and excess of iron (Fur and PerR), manganese (MntR), and zinc (Zur and CzrA).
We will characterize the genes regulated by these transcription factors, their roles in metal
homeostasis, and identify the physiological effects that result from both metal ion limitation and
intoxication. This work will build upon our recent identification of the major efflux systems for both iron
and manganese. The insights from these studies will be directly relevant to the similar stress
responses present in human pathogens. The immune system also restricts the growth of pathogens
by production of antibacterial peptides and lytic enzymes, both of which affect the integrity of the cell
envelope. The cell envelope is also a target for many of our most important antibiotics. In a second
project, we have defined several distinct cell envelope stress responses in B. subtilis, with a focus on
those regulated by alternative sigma factors. We have identified an array of mutants with alterations in
stress response pathways and in key central metabolic pathways that have elevated sensitivity to cell
wall antibiotics, including the critically important beta-lactams. In addition, we explore newly
discovered antibiotic synergies with possible implications for clinical approaches. Selection of
antibiotic resistant suppressors provides a powerful approach for delineating the basis of antibiotic
synergies, and the roles of specific stress response pathways. These pathways are central to cell
envelope homeostasis generally, in addition to their role in sensing and responding to antibiotic-
induced stress, and are implicated in the emergence of antibiotic tolerance and resistance in
pathogens."
10840407,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) develops in both systemic infection as well as
sterile lung injury. This neuro-inflammation mirrors systemic inflammation and affects the neural control of
respiration. We have published that peripheral inflammation evokes neuro-inflammation, decreases synaptic
efficacy of vagal sensory feedback and increases the predictability of ventilatory pattern variability (VPV). Thus,
we have an overall perspective of the effects of systemic inflammation on respiratory control at molecular and
functional levels, but the effects at the level of the respiratory network activity remain obscure. Our hypothesis
is that brainstem neuro-inflammation alters synaptic strengths in the respiratory network which
suppresses reflex modulation of the respiratory pattern to decrease ventilatory pattern variability. During
systemic inflammation, respiratory rate and predictability of the ventilatory pattern increase. These maladaptive
changes persist in the absence of peripheral sensory inputs in in situ brainstem preparations derived from rats
with either sterile lung injury or systemic infection, indicating alterations in respiratory network activity. Further,
respiratory rate increases in healthy rats following IL-1Î² microinjections in the nTS. Thus, our data indicate that
neuro-inflammation of the brainstem respiratory network drives changes in VPV in these disease processes.
 We test our hypothesis in the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine anatomic and functional maps of
the ponto-medullary respiratory circuits in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated rats; 2) to determine if the etiology
of the inflammatory process affects neuro-inflammation, maladaptation of respiratory network activity and VPV;
3) to assess the causal relationships between neuro-inflammation, respiratory network activity and VPV and
whether anti-neuro-inflammatory therapies will attenuate the increases in respiratory frequency and predictability
of VPV and restore healthy respiratory network activity.
 We will apply recent advances in multi-electrode array technology and analysis to map respiratory local
field potentials throughout the ponto-medullary respiratory network to investigate where and how peripheral
inflammation maladapts central- and sensory-modulated respiratory pattern formation. We will also generate
immuno-histochemical maps of the distribution of key early pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brainstem. Electro-
physiologic and anatomic atlases will be co-registered to the Waxholm MRI atlas of the rat brain to enable
analysis of their relationships. In total, we will use this innovative approach to quantitatively investigate the impact
of systemic and neuro-inflammation on the function of an intact neural network.

10840408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade has elicited unprecedented clinical responses in patients with metastatic
melanoma and other cancers. A promising new checkpoint under investigation in cancer therapeutic trials is T-
cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3). Tim-3 blockade reverses T-cell impairment, thereby
reinvigorating antitumor T-cell immunity. However, we found that Tim-3 inhibitors, including those in clinical
trials, not only target T-cell-Tim-3, but also have varying affinity for Tim-3 on dendritic cells (DCs),
macrophages (MÎ¦s), NK and melanoma cells. Clinical benefit might thus not exclusively rely on antagonism of
T-cell-Tim-3, but also on inhibition of these additional Tim-3-expressing cell types. In support, blockade of T-
cell-Tim-3 suppressed, while melanoma-directed Tim-3 inhibition enhanced tumor growth in murine melanoma
models, thereby counteracting desired efficacy of Tim-3 therapy. Consistently, enforced expression of Tim-3 on
melanoma cells suppressed tumorigenesis, metastasis formation, and proliferative pathway activity. Our
preliminary studies thus identify melanoma cell-intrinsic, DC-, MÎ¦-, and NK-cell-Tim-3 as unexpected variables
and/or potential confounders of treatment outcome. They further highlight the need to define therapeutic
consequences of Tim-3 antibody (Ab) responses at the level of specific cell types. The Tim-3 protein bears
multiple N- and O-glycostructures that differ dramatically in composition, size, and charge between cell
lineages and which might explain the marked variations in Tim-3 Ab clone reactivity we found between cell
types. For example, the clinical Tim-3 trial candidate, TSR-022, avidly bound T-cell- and melanoma-, but not
NK-, DC-, or MÎ¦-Tim-3, while other Tim-3 Abs showed high affinity for Tim-3 on T-cells, MÎ¦s, DCs, and/or NK,
but not melanoma cells. Notably, glycan-modifying regimens shifted inhibitor binding towards desired T-cell-
Tim-3 recognition and reduced melanoma-Tim-3 reactivity. Our preliminary data highlights the critical need for
dissecting immune- vs. melanoma cell-Tim-3 glyco-epitopes, Ab affinity, signaling, and immunobiology. Results
will help optimize Tim-3 therapeutic efficacy by validating regimens that preferentially target immune cell-Tim-3
glycans, while avoiding unwanted blockade of melanoma cell-Tim-3. Our aims are to 1) define cell type-
associated Tim-3 glycan moieties, ligands, Ab affinities, and signaling networks, 2) examine immune cell- vs.
melanoma-intrinsic effects of existing Tim-3 antagonists and their relevance to interpreting therapeutic benefit,
and 3) identify new Tim-3 targeting strategies that accentuate immune cell-Tim-3 inhibition. We will use state-
of-the-art gain and loss of Tim-3 function and glycan-modifying strategies, Tim-3 inhibitors with variable tissue-
associated affinities, and immune and melanoma model systems to define cell type-specific Tim-3 functions
and glycomolecular targets. Our initiative also implements clinical tumor biospecimens from patients receiving
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Together, these studies will pave the way for next generation biomarkers and
treatment modalities that discriminate immune- from cancer cell-Tim-3 for optimized immunotherapy outcomes."

Collective cell movements termed convergent extension (CE) drive the elongation of tissues and organs in
essentially all animals. In vertebrates, CE is controlled by the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling system, and
defects in PCP-dependent convergent extension are associated with human neural tube defects and skeletal

11095690,"Abstract
Collective cell movements termed convergent extension (CE) drive the elongation of tissues and organs in
essentially all animals. In vertebrates, CE is controlled by the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling system, and
defects in PCP-dependent convergent extension are associated with human neural tube defects and skeletal
dysplasias. We feel that the profound lack of information regarding the basic cell biology of CE as it occurs in
vertebrate animals in vivo represents the key challenge in the field at this time. Building on our recent
successes in advanced imaging and proteomics, this proposal takes a ""cell biological"" approach, focusing on
fundamental cellular machines of cadherin adhesion, actin assembly, and the septin cytoskeleton and how
they are deployed to drive PCP-mediated CE."
10830274,"URISE at PVAMU PI/PD: Regisford
 The increasing need for a well-trained STEM workforce, made more poignant during this COVID-19 pandemic,
also requires a diverse population to meet the future needs and challenges in the biomedical sciences. An
Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) program will reach a large racial
and ethnic underrepresented (UR) population with disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and first-generation
college students at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU), a historically black university. Moreover, PVAMU's
promotion of undergraduate engagement in research, and its established collaborations with surrounding research-
intensive universities, provide a robust learning environment that will strongly support a U-RISE program.
Although student enrollment in biomedical science disciplines such as Biology and Chemistry are relatively high,
less than 10% declare an interest in graduate school; a conundrum that may be due to lack of exposure and
preparation for the rigors of graduate school. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposed U-RISE program
is to enhance student participation and preparation in the biomedical sciences for matriculation into highly
competitive PhD programs and ultimately, a biomedical science research career. This goal will be
accomplished by the following specific objectives: (1) Provide an enriched interdisciplinary research culture that
exposes all U-RISE trainees to hands-on research for three consecutive years; (2) Enhance the academic
curriculum that fosters advancement of 80% of U-RISE at PVAMU trainees to a biomedical science graduate
program and (3) Create a nurturing learning community by engaging U-RISE at PVAMU trainees in a
multidimensional mentoring program, that will lead to improved retention (90% of U-RISE trainees) and
graduation rate (90% of U-RISE trainees). Program elements will include professional skills development of all U-
RISE trainees to enhance their competitiveness. We have built a multidisciplinary team of faculty, research
professors/scientists, and external collaborators to create a nurturing and stimulating culture that will evoke
evidence-based student support and motivation practices. Each year, four sophomores will be selected to join the
U-RISE at PVAMU program. Selection of U-RISE trainees will be based on the following criteria: the students'
academic record, member of a racial and ethnic UR population, a declared major in a biomedical science discipline,
and a desire to attend graduate school in the biomedical sciences. The expected outcomes are (1) an increase in the
number of students who become engaged in biomedical science research; (2) an extensive academic preparation of
U-RISE at PVAMU trainees for matriculation into a competitive graduate program within one year after graduation;
and (3) the creation of a replicable, transportable, evidence-based model that promotes preparation of
undergraduates from UR populations for biomedical science research careers. Ultimately, the U-RISE at PVAMU
program will contribute to increased diversity in the biomedical sciences workforce."
10830278,"High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and deadliest form of ovarian cancer.
Emerging evidence indicates that these tumors arise in the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), and thus their
presence in the ovary represents the primary metastasis. Our preliminary data identified that xenografting in
close proximity to the ovary contributes to the aggressiveness of the disease. After ovarian colonization, tumor
cells invade the peritoneal organs, primarily the omentum. We hypothesize that the biological problem of
primary and secondary HGSC metastasis is partially mediated by chemical communication between
the cancer cells and the metastatic organ. Our proposal seeks to define metabolites and biomolecules that
drive the metastasis of fallopian tube derived high grade serous cancers to the ovary and the omentum. To this
end, our teams optimized a 3D co-culture of the ovary and fallopian tube derived tumor models and adapted
this to imaging mass spectrometry technology to identify the metabolomics-driven communication that occurs
during primary colonization of the ovary and during secondary metastasis to the omentum. Using this emerging
technology, we identified several metabolites that enhanced high grade serous tumor migration, invasion, and
adhesion to the ovary. The focus of Aim 1 is to uncover the mechanisms allowing FTE tumorigenic cells to
hijack NE produced by the ovary to increase their ability to invade and adhere to the ovary during primary
metastasis. Aim 1 will define the signaling pathways mediated by NE during invasion and adhesion to the
ovary and then confirm the importance of NE in vivo using both murine and human cell models derived from
FTE. The key adrenergic receptor will be deleted using CRISPR to confirm the importance of this pathway in
metastasis. Tumor bearing models will be treated with beta adrenergic receptor antagonists in an attempt to
translate these findings for a new strategy to block ovarian colonization. The focus of Aim 2 is on the
identification and characterization of a newly identified protein that is secreted from tumorigenic fallopian tube
cells and is responsible for the production of ovarian norepinephrine driving tumor cell invasion and adhesion.
We will use proteomics to confirm the identity of the secreted protein, followed by genetic deletion of the
protein from FTE models to study the role in ovarian colonization. Aim 3 will build upon our existing technology
of 3D organ and tumor cell communication models and expand into secondary metastasis. We have now
optimized our technology for co-culture of the omentum together with tumor cell models and have an inventory
of metabolites, which are unique and did not include norepinephrine. Instead a novel metabolite found to be
produced in significantly more abundance when tumor cells were grown with the omentum corresponded to
folate, the ligand for the folic acid receptor that is overexpressed in the tumor cells. Taken together, our
innovative experimental approach will yield new pathways and targets to mitigate primary metastasis of high
grade serous cancer to the ovary."

The goal of this R25 proposal is to continue and expand our state-of-the-art, interdisciplinary training program
to enhance the methodological skills of early-career scientists conducting integrative health research. Health
and health inequities are a function of social, behavioral, biological, and environmental factors. However,
scientific training on these various factors is often siloed across disciplines and professions (e.g., clinical vs.
social/behavioral sciences). This lack of integration results in inefficiencies in the growth of scientific
knowledge, limits cross-pollination in interdisciplinary teams, and fosters a piecemeal approach to clinical care
and health services that fails to meet the needs of individuals with complex health conditions, particularly those
from disadvantaged or minority communities. In 2020, with support from NCCIH/OBSSR, we launched the first
NIH-funded training program focused on building methodological expertise in integrative health, with a focus on
minority health and health inequities. The proposed continuation of the Michigan Integrative Well-Being and
Inequalities (MIWI) Training Program will develop the research skills of multidisciplinary cohorts of early-career
scientists on the intersections between social, behavioral, biological, and environmental aspects of health, with
attention to how these intersections contribute to minority health and health disparities. MIWI uses case-based,
applied learning to help trainees explicitly link theoretical models that inform empirical research to the study
designs and analytic tools appropriate for addressing novel questions about health and health inequities in an
integrative manner. MIWI is a hybrid training program, consisting of a 3-day residential summer institute which
is paired with 9-months of ongoing virtual mentoring and networking building with senior scholars and peer
alumni, and additional didactic training via webinars. Trainees propose and workshop a research project over
this period, where they directly apply the knowledge and skills they gain through the program. MIWI is
designed to attract three types of trainees: (i) Behavioral/social scientists who are interested in learning how to
incorporate and analyze biomedical measures; (ii) Clinical/health services researchers interested in assessing
psychosocial and environmental aspects of health; and (iii) Minority health researchers who want to employ a
more comprehensive approach in their work. The continued success of MIWI will be evaluated by assessing
trainee skills development, research performance, and sustainable capacity building. The MIWI Leadership
Core (Mezuk, Gonzalez, Taylor, and Hudson) has an established track record of training junior investigators,
particularly under-represented minority scientists, through their leadership of several Center-based education
programs. MIWI will apply the lessons-learned from our decades of training experience, our strong Institutional
Resource Partners, our established national network of Senior Mentors, and our growing network of Peer
Alumni Mentors, in a focused program centered on building the scientific skills necessary to expand the field of
interdisciplinary, integrative health science."
10837985,"ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects 300 million people and is the third leading cause of
death globally, with >80% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs,
particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, are also home to over two thirds of the global population of people
with HIV (PWH). HIV increases the risk of COPD and COPD-associated mortality, but the mechanisms
underlying this risk are incompletely understood. Elucidating mechanisms that lead to COPD in PWH in LMICs
is particularly important, as an estimated one third of COPD cases in LMICs are not attributable to known
COPD risk factors. Systemic inflammation is associated with disease severity in COPD and impaired lung
function in PWH. Similarly, the oral microbiome is altered in patients with COPD, and data from the US
identified a link between oral microbiome composition and COPD in PWH. However, no studies of the oral
microbiome and systemic inflammation have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, where PWH are exposed
to distinct environmental, occupational, and behavioral factors that affect their risk of COPD and alter their oral
microbiomes. This career development award will directly address this knowledge gap. The overall objectives
of the current application are to 1) identify associations between the oral microbiome, systemic inflammation,
and COPD among PWH in Botswana and 2) develop the skillset needed to pursue an independent career in
respiratory microbiome research. To accomplish our objectives, we will recruit 500 adults with chronic
respiratory symptoms (250 PWH, 250 HIV-uninfected) from public clinics in Botswana and conduct serial
pulmonary function testing and oral specimen collection on a stratified random sample of 200 adults every six
months for 24 months. We hypothesize that alterations of the oral microbiome will associate with lung function
decline, inflammation, and COPD in PWH. I am uniquely qualified to lead this project given my clinical training
in pulmonary medicine, formalized training in research methods via a Master of Science in Global Health, and
commitment to research spanning nearly two decades. Furthermore, I am integrated into the clinical and
research infrastructure in Botswana and have gathered valuable preliminary microbiome and spirometry data
to prepare for this award. To achieve my long-term goal of leveraging host-microbiome interactions to reduce
the development and progression of COPD in highly affected populations like PWH, I am seeking further skill
development in microbiome science and the conduct of longitudinal clinical research. In addition to preparing
me for a career as an independent clinician scientist, this proposal will address multiple National Institutes of
Health HIV/AIDS research priorities, including increasing our understanding of HIV-related comorbidities.
Lastly, our findings could be used to validate microbiome-based biomarkers for COPD and will contribute to the
equitable development of novel COPD therapies by generating data from a population overrepresented in
global COPD mortality but underrepresented in current COPD and microbiome research."

The intestinal epithelium is vital to maintain the barrier between the body and the outside world, and membrane
trafficking is essential for both the development and maintenance of this barrier. Abnormal membrane
trafficking can result compromised barrier leading to intestinal disease, including inflammatory bowel disease.
Autophagy is a specialized membrane trafficking process that allows cells to respond to changes in
metabolism. In addition, autophagy is important for maintenance of the epithelial barrier and the innate immune
response, mediating the isolation and degradation of intracellular pathogens. Furthermore, LC3-associated
phagocytosis (LAP) is important for uptake and degradation of pathogens, and dysfunction of this pathway is
associated with hyperinflammation. Importantly, variants of proteins in the autophagic and LAP pathways have
been linked to increased susceptibility to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and particularly Crohnâs disease,
although the molecular mechanisms that underlie this connection remain incompletely understood. MAMDC4 is
an integral membrane protein that localizes to endosomes of the intestinal epithelium. Deletion of MAMDC4
compromises intestinal enterocyte morphology, and RNAseq studies have indicated that MAMDC4 is down-
regulated in IBD. In previous work, we found that MAMDC4 interacts with the small GTPase Rab14. In
professional phagocytes, Rab14 is recruited to phagosomes and prevents phagosome-lysosome fusion but its
role in the intestinal epithelium is unknown. In our preliminary data, we show that Rab 14 is present on
autophagosomes and both Rab14 and MAMDC4 are present on membranes containing invading bacteria.
Furthermore, deletion of MAMDC4 results in accumulation of autophagy and lysosomal markers on tubular
membranes. These results suggest that MAMDC4 and Rab14 act in a molecular network to maintain mucosal
immunity through control of autophagy or LAP. In this proposal we will use intestinal epithelial cells in culture,
organoid culture, and patient-derived organoids to define the role of autophagy and/or LAP in intestinal
homeostasis."
10851768,"Chronic pain experienced by children has the potential to persist into adulthood and drive drug
addiction, mental health problems and suicidal behavior. The level of pain reported by children
who experience headache is immense and likely poorly estimated based on lowered ability of
children to articulate symptoms, potential malingering or underreporting of pain symptoms, and
extensive variability in physical growth and brain development. Headache is a frequently reported
and poorly understood primary and secondary disorder in pediatric subjects. The diverse
presentation of headache underscores the potential for distinct mechanisms of headache
presentation, thus placing emphasis on tailored treatment options. There is clear need to better
define childhood headache in terms of the clinical presentation and underlying pain physiology.
Our hypothesis is that each clinical headache disorder can be defined by unique biobehavioral
characteristics. In the proposed research program, we (Aim 1) evaluate the clinical and behavioral
elements of each headache disorder and pain modulation, (Aim 2) the biobehavioral signature of
treatment refractory headache, and (Aim 3) develop machine learning classifiers to understand
the features that differentiate headache subtype and treatment resistance. This study is likely to
yield highly relevant information that will contribute towards identifying and treating headache
disorders in children, identifying unique characteristics of headache and pain processing, and (3)
outline biobehavioral targets for different headache disorders. Data from this investigation is likely
to contribute greatly towards the treatment of pediatric pain disorders."
10851779,"The proposed MARC at the University of Nevada, Reno (MARC at UNR) will support diverse cohorts of
trainees drawn from the five College of Science programs that train the majority of UNR undergraduates in
biomedical research: Biology, Chemistry, Microbiology & Immunology, Neuroscience, and Psychology. We are
requesting support for five trainees in the first year of the program and ten trainees per year in subsequent
years. Each trainee will be supported through their junior and senior baccalaureate years. The diversity of the
MARC at UNR will be supported by the racial/ethnic diversity of institution-wide undergraduate enrollment at
UNR (22% Hispanic/Latinx, 3% Black/African American) and College of Science enrollment of over 50%
underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral research. Currently, training support for these students is
limited. The College of Science graduates 180 underrepresented students annually who have access to fewer
than 16 training positions supported by the UNR McNair program and an NINDS R25. The research training of
the trainees will be supported by extramural research awards held by our 30 Participating Faculty: $12 M in
research funding from the NIH, NSF, and other agencies (mean=$403 K, median=$293 K per Trainer/Mentor).
The MARC at UNR will complete the following objectives: 1) We will partner with UNR Advising and other
diversity-enhancing programs to encourage students underrepresented in research to form an interest
group/club that will serve as a âpoint of contactâ through which our programs will inform underrepresented
freshman and sophomores about opportunities for predoctoral graduate training, provide direction and access
to mentoring and research opportunities, and support applications to our programs. 2) We will implement an
Enrichment Program that will prepare the trainees to apply to, enter, and succeed in predoctoral studies in
research-intensive institutions through hands-on training in laboratory safety, weekly seminar/discussion
classes providing peer support in the preparation of applications for summer research, for the NSF Graduate
Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), and for predoctoral graduate training. The Enrichment Program also
includes regular and repeated exposure to concepts in the Responsible Conduct of Research and in Methods
to Enhance Reproducibility in both didactic and discussion courses. 3) We will provide two years of formal,
sustained mentoring support for our trainees using a Matrix Mentoring Model that includes trained faculty
Trainer/Mentors, graduate student near-peer mentors, peer MARC trainees, self-mentoring, and staff
mentoring. 4) We will provide mentored biomedical and behavioral research experiences to support
applications to graduate programs in biomedical or behavioral research at research-intensive (T32) institutions.
In addition, we will increase transparency by making information on program policies and recruitment activities,
admissions, and post-training career outcomes of the graduates from the training program publicly available."
10851780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer induces a fibrous microenvironment, desmoplasia, which spans most of the tumor mass and
contains cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs sustain a cancer homeostatic equilibrium by producing
extracellular matrices (ECMs) and secreting inflammatory factors. The ECM produced by CAFs prompts normal
fibroblasts to undergo activation and transition into CAFs, thereby propagating desmoplastic expansion in a
positive feedback loop. While the normal microenvironment suppresses tumor onset, desmoplasia can either
support or avert pancreatic cancer. A better understanding of desmoplastic expansion and the ECM factors that
control it could enable us to favor its anti-cancer functions. In fact, several clinical trials including some conducted
at Fox Chase, aim at ânormalizing desmoplasiaâ with the goal of harnessing CAFâs anti-tumor effects.
Of note, we have defined a signaling axis that depends on CAF-ECM and includes its main receptors, integrins,
and some actin bundling, particular endocytic regulatory proteins, and an extracellularly tethered presynaptic
protein known as NetrinG1. Of note, NetrinG1 necessities co-receptors in cis and in trans to signal and we
revealed that in response to ECM NetrinG1 drives pro-tumor CAF function. We also reported that ECM induced
pro-tumor CAF activation includes the endocytic localization of the active conformation of an important ECM
receptor, activated Î±5Î²1-integrin (a-Î±5), which we posit regulates the production of two unique extracellular
vesicles. Finally, we saw that the trans co-receptor of NetrinG1 is expressed in CAFs and needed for effective
formation of tumors when pancreatic cancer cells are injected into the pancreata of immune system-intact mice.
Our central premise proposes that CAF pro-to-anti tumor function transition can be attained via blockage
of the ECM-dependent NetrinG1 signaling axis, which is needed to achieve the functional âdesmoplastic
normalizationâ that can be detected in blood.
We plan to test this hypothesis in three specific aims:
1- Ask how CAF-ECM regulates NetrinG1 expression and endocytic a-Î±5 regulation as well as what are the
 specific ECM components that are responsible for NetrinG1 expression and CAFâs pro-tumor function.
2- Investigate if the unique extracellular vesicles generated by NetrinG1 expressing CAFs could be traced
 systemically in patientsâ blood (including archived samples and samples from the ongoing trial) and ask if these
 are indicative of the tumor associated desmoplastic pro vs anti-pancreatic cancer statuses.
3- Inquire if NetrinG1âs trans receptor, expressed in pro-tumoral functioning CAFs, could serve as a new target.
The studyâs ultimate goal is to capitalize on the natural tumor suppressive function and features of CAFs and
block the tumor promoting ones as well as to systemically induce and detect a pro-to-anti pancreatic cancer CAF
transition, which could be indicative of local desmoplastic status, for potential future clinical uses."

The Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Training Program (Endocrinology T32) at Duke University
Medical Center seeks to identify, recruit, and train the next generation of biomedical scientists so that
they can continue growing as part of the national research workforce. The program centers on
investigators in the Duke Division of Endocrinology, its affiliated research centers, and other collaborating
Divisions and Departments at Duke. The topical focus of this program is research related to diabetes,
obesity, and metabolic diseases. Postdoctoral participants in this program will be either board-eligible or
board-certified physicians with training in Internal Medicine, Surgery, or Pediatrics, or PhD scientists
pursuing careers in diabetes and metabolic investigation.
The Duke Endocrinology T32 has a long track record of training successful investigators in diabetes,
metabolic bone disease, and other areas of related research. A substantial majority (80% of trainees
over the past two cycles of the grant) remain in academic positions at major medical centers across
the US and abroad. Most are in positions with substantial research components, supported by federal,
foundation, or industry grants, and the remainder have significant teaching responsibilities.
The program provides world-class research training opportunities across four domains (basic,
translational, clinical, and health services/implementation research) and three cross-cutting areas
(diversity, equity, and inclusion; community engagement; inter-center collaboration). Our T32 mentors
maintain funded research programs in basic science (e.g., islet biology, mitochondrial function and
energetics, metabolic flux, transcriptional regulation of metabolism), preclinical physiology using mouse
genetic models, clinical physiology in humans (e.g., insulin secretion, incretin action, exercise and
metabolism, bariatric surgery), clinical outcomes research (e.g., clinical trials and epidemiology), and
health services and implementation research (e.g., care delivery innovations in diabetes and weight
management). Trainees choose primary mentors and mentoring teams, but also have access to the full
breadth of our T32 faculty cohort through collaborations, didactic teaching and seminars. Training
focuses on identifying important research questions, formulating incisive hypotheses, and designing
straightforward but dispositive experiments; technical and analytic proficiency will also be stressed.
Importantly, trainees will be challenged to develop their communication skills, both for oral and written
communication, with an emphasis on grant writing. Individuals completing the program will be well-
positioned to obtain career development awards to support their continued growth as independent
investigators, and will be able to translate their research into significant clinical advances."

This is an application for the competitive renewal of a T32 Institutional National Research Service
Award for a successful postdoctoral training program in medical rehabilitation research that
focuses on brain injury and neurological disability. We propose to train 4 postdoctoral level trainees
per year, each for a total duration of 2-3 years. The training program is based in the Kennedy
Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R)
and in Baltimore. Kennedy Krieger is a major center for clinical care and research on neurological
disabilities in children and young adults on the Johns Hopkins University medical campus.
Trainees can work with any of the 29 faculty advisors from the Kennedy Krieger Institute, the
Department of PM&R, Neurology, Neuroscience, Pediatrics, Radiology, Biomedical Engineering
and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins. The mission of our program is to educate a diverse group of
postdoctoral researchers in the science of neurorehabilitation with the goal of improving outcomes
for children and adults with neurologically based disabilities We do so via an equitable training
environment that focuses on collaboration in research and clinical practice. Our vision is to
harness scientific discoveries from fields such as neuroscience, biomedical engineering,
neurology, and psychology and apply them to populations with damage to the nervous system. In
this way, our program fulfills a national need to transfer science and technology more quickly to
the bedside. The goals of the program are to 1) train clinicians and basic scientists who will go on
to make important contributions that advance the rehabilitation of patients with brain and spinal
cord injuries and other neurological disabilities; 2) equip these trainees with the skills needed to
become independent grant-funded investigators. The focus of the training program is on a
mentored period of hypothesis-driven translational clinical and/or laboratory based research.
Faculty have expertise in one or more of three major rehabilitation themes: 1) recovery mechanisms
in neurorehabilitation; 2) pediatric brain injury rehabilitation; 3) stroke rehabilitation. A training
program executive committee provides specific goals for progress of trainees to achieve core
research competencies, and they monitor progress closely. The program provides a strong
curriculum of weekly conferences, journal clubs and didactic lectures that reflect the research and
scholarly environment at Johns Hopkins. The program has trained more than 50 researchers since
its inception, many of which now have highly productive rehabilitation research programs."
10849639,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most frequent causes of bacterial infections in the U.S. and is
responsible for diverse types of infections ranging in severity from mild to fatal in both hospital and community
settings. In the community, S. aureus typically causes skin-and-soft-tissue infections with an estimated 12 â
13 million outpatient visits per-year (in the U.S.) but can also cause severe manifestations including necrotizing
fasciitis and sepsis in individuals with no underlying risk. One of the most clinically significant aspects of S.
aureus infections is the high prevalence of drug resistance and the innate ability for S. aureus to develop
resistance to antibiotics making it very difficult to develop therapeutics that will have potential for long-term
efficacy on S. aureus. The research proposed in this application will broaden our understanding of host-
pathogen interactions, providing the foundation for future studies aimed at the intelligent design of novel
vaccines and therapies to treat bacterial infection. To that end, this project will study how S. aureus uses the
SaeR/S two-component gene regulatory system to evade innate immunity. The SaeR/S system is essential for
evasion of neutrophil killing; however, exact mechanisms dependent on SaeR/S resulting in neutrophil
dysfunction are not defined. Three specific Aims will test the hypothesis that the SaeR/S-mediated up-
regulation of S. aureus virulence genes undermines an effective neutrophil response that would normally clear
infection. In Aim One, host pathogen RNA expression via RNA-seq will be used to determine the direct
influence of SaeR/S-regulated bacterial genes on human neutrophil gene expression as well as resolve the
individual contribution of SaeR/S components on neutrophil and pathogen gene expression simultaneously. In
Aim Two, we will determine how SaeR/S-dependent changes in neutrophil human myeloperoxidase (MPO)
activity and the production reactive oxygen species (ROS) alters neutrophil apoptosis and neutrophil
extracellular trap (NET) formation. In Aim Three, we will utilize a novel ex vivo model of neutrophil priming by
stimulated PBMCs to determine the role of initial SaeR/S-mediated immune cell interactions on subsequent
neutrophil function. These ex vivo primary human cell studies will be complemented with murine models of
infection to thoroughly evaluate these immune responses. Findings from experiments outlined in this proposal
will improve our overall understanding of host-pathogen interactions by specifically characterizing novel
SaeR/S-mediated mechanisms used by S. aureus to overcome an effective neutrophil response. Collectively
this research will address our long-term objective to characterize reciprocal response pathways between host
and pathogen that will highlight key factors needed for both the pathogen to cause infection and for the host to
resolve disease. Results will provide valuable information for vaccine and immunotherapeutic development."

 Defects in many known regulators of lumenal Ca2+ in lysosomes lead to distinct neurological disorders
by disrupting lysosomal Ca2+ levels. Lysosomal Ca2+ can be dysregulated by defects in either Ca2+ release
channels or transporters. While there are several examples of lysosomal Ca2+ release channels, there is
only one example of a protein that facilitates lysosomal Ca2+ import. This solitary example was identified by
my lab to be catp-6 in C. elegans. Its human homolog, ATP13A2, is one of the major risk genes for
Parkinson's disease (PD). Given that the only example of a protein that drives lysosomal Ca2+ import is a
risk gene for PD, an understanding of its function, as well as identifying more regulators of lysosomal Ca2+
entry is of high significance.
 Catp-6 was identified as a potential lysosomal Ca2+ importer only because of a new fluorescent reporter
called CalipHluor, with which one could quantitatively image lysosomal Ca2+. Here we propose to identify
and catalog proteins that drive lysosomal Ca2+ import by screening nematodes that are engineered to show
phenotypes at the whole worm, sub-cellular and lysosomal Ca2+ level. We have developed a system where,
the deletion of a lysosomal Ca2+ importer will concurrently rescue lethality caused by the deletion of a
lysosomal Ca2+ release channel, restore lysosome size and restore lysosomal Ca2+ - the latter revealed by
Ca2+ mapping with CalipHluor.
 Since our methodology can map defects in lysosomal Ca2+ uptake, we propose to investigate two new
molecular mechanisms that drive lysosomal Ca2+ import. The first is a gene we denote LCAX-1, that we
identified from a preliminary screen in nematodes, that has putative Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CAX)-like function.
While CAX genes have been described in diverse organisms, lysosomal CAX genes have eluded discovery
in humans. We propose experiments that will test whether LCAX-1 behaves like a CAX at the lysosome
and if so, it would constitute the first example of a human lysosomal CAX.
 The second corresponds to the Parkinson's risk gene ATP13A2 that has been previously described
as an importer of various heavy metal ions. Yet our data suggest that it imports Ca2+. We propose
experiments that will distinguish between these two possibilities and by mutational analysis we will identify
the residues in ATP13A2 responsible for Ca2+ binding.
 Success in our aims will offer knowledge of new lysosomal Ca2+ import mechanisms, identify the elusive
human lysosomal CAX gene, and provide structural insight into the functionality of a risk gene for
Parkinson's disease e.g., identify the Ca2+ binding site in ATP13A2."
10849799,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Recent epidemiological reports indicate that cocaine use increased by 45% from
2013 to 2018. Cocaine-induced increase in striatal dopamine levels is linked to its rewarding effects. However,
the striatal neural circuits driving cocaine abuse are not clearly defined. Thus, there is a critical need to delin-
eate how the striatal circuits downstream of cocaine-induced dopamine release control cocaine seeking and
taking. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which cocaine affects GABA
transmission between the two principal neurons of the striatum, the D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs, to ultimately
regulate drug seeking and taking. Our central hypothesis is that cocaine-enhances levels of the opioid peptide
enkephalin, which acts via mu-opioid receptors (MOR) expressed in axon collaterals of D1- and D2-MSNs to
facilitate cocaine seeking and taking. We will test this in two specific aims:
 Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms for how cocaine affects plasticity of intra-striatal GABA trans-
mission. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that a history of cocaine increases enkephalin re-
lease from D2-MSNs, which induces MOR-dependent long-term depression of intra-striatal GABA transmis-
sion onto D1-MSNs. We will test this by performing whole cell electrophysiology in MSN-selective MOR and
enkephalin knockouts with a history of cocaine or saline exposure, and record GABA transmission between
MSNs and MSN excitability. Pharmacology will be used to infer heightened enkephalin tone in electrophysi-
ology recordings, and this will be confirmed by RNAscope, immunohistochemistry, Western blot and our MSN-
selective enkephalin knockout.
 Aim 2: Determine how opioid regulation of intra-striatal circuits drive cocaine seeking and taking.
Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that enkephalin released from D2-MSNs acts on MORs in
axon collaterals of D1- and D2-MSNs to suppress intra-striatal GABA and facilitate cocaine reward. We will
test this using operant cocaine self-administration procedures in MSN-selective MOR and enkephalin knock-
out mice. We will determine how intra-striatal GABA transmission from MSNs contributes to cocaine seeking
by selectively inhibiting D1-MSN or D2-MSN striatal axon collaterals using a novel Gi-coupled opsin during a
cued cocaine seeking task.
 Successful completion of the proposed research will elucidate how endogenous opioids regulate intra-
striatal GABA transmission, and how cocaine impinges upon this mechanism to affect circuit activity. Moreo-
ver, this research will provide novel insights on the mechanisms of cocaine abuse by establishing a link be-
tween opioid-mediated regulation of intra-striatal GABA transmission and cocaine seeking and taking. This
research will also lay the groundwork for our long-term goal of determining the circuit mechanisms driving
synergistic reward when opiates and cocaine are co-abused."

This proposal is a competitive renewal application for five years of support to continue the 44-year old post-
doctoral Training Program In Investigative Gastroenterology. The goal of the training program is to provide
clinical, translational, and basic science training to MD and MD-PhD physicians as well as recent PhD
graduates that will prepare them for careers as independent investigators who study clinical and basic science
topics in gastroenterology. Though most trainees will come from the Yale Digestive Diseases Fellowship, those
doing clinical training in other clinical disciplines such as pediatric gastroenterology and surgery are eligible if
they have strong research interests. Many candidates now come from the Yale Internal Medicine Short-track
Physician Scientist Program and spend a minimum of 3 years doing research. PhD scientist, especially those
from programs such as Yale Immunobiology and Microbial Pathogenesis are encouraged to apply. The
Programâs preceptors pursue research related to gastrointestinal health and disease and related fields and
come primarily from the Section of Digestive Diseases, Section of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology,
as well as other allied clinical basic science departments. The preceptors have strong funding for their scientific
studies and outstanding records of mentorship. During the most recent two cycles, the majority of graduates
have entered and remain in full-time academic positions. The program will continue to train four postdoctoral
fellows each year; individual trainees will be supported for two to three years. There will also be support and
encouragement to develop and submit transitional funding (K08, K23, K01). Candidates will be selected based
on a strong prior history of research, interests that parallel by our preceptor faculty, a commitment to research
related to gastrointestinal health and/or disease. The major programmatic gastrointestinal research themes,
reflected by our preceptorsâ interests include: 1) Immunology, inflammation, injury, 2) Ion transport, 3) Cell
biology/cell signaling 4) Microbiome host interactions and 5) Clinical and translational investigation. The
training environment is enriched by a generous allotment of space at Yale and the affiliated Veterans Hospital
and well equipped laboratories. Yale also supports a wide range of science resources (basic and clinical
cores) that include both instrumentation and educational services. A large and diverse patient population is
also available. Trainees often enroll in advanced course work. The clinically oriented Master in Health Science
and Investigative Medicine Program (for either clinical or basic science PhDs) are popular; tuition is supported
by this T32. Fellows participate in weekly journal clubs, present their research in sectional research seminars,
and are monitored by individualized Academic Advisory committees and review of their IDPs."

The Yale Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM) residency training program, based
in the Department of Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, is one of the oldest, most
productive, stable and highly regarded occupational medicine residency training programs in the
United States, training 66 OEM physicians over the past almost thirty-five years. There is an
urgent need for OEM and public health / preventive medicine (PM) trained physicians in multiple
settings across the U.S., further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Yale OEM residency is an integrated two-year NIOSH-funded PM / OEM residency training
program that is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME), and leads to board eligibility for certification in PM and OEM by the American Board
of Preventive Medicine as well as a Master of Public Health (MPH) Degree from the Yale School
of Public Health. The program is currently approved for a total of four positions, two per year.
Trainees admitted to the program are expected to have completed an initial ACGME accredited
residency in an appropriate clinical specialty, typically Internal Medicine or Family Medicine.
This NIOSH TPG 5-year renewal proposal describes the Yale OEM residency program.
Highlighted are: 1) our success to date in training physicians for OEM careers, 2) our current
OEM training program, which is continually evolving to meet changing needs, and 3) our plans
for training future OEM physician leaders able to address the substantial challenges U.S.
workers and employers will face in the future. The goal of Yale OEM Residency training
program is to train physicians to be proficient in all aspects of the practice of occupational and
environmental medicine, based on a sound fundamental knowledge of epidemiology, industrial
hygiene, biostatistics, toxicology, human and organization behavior, clinical medicine, and
evidence-based critical analysis. We train future physician leaders to serve in a range of OEM
academic, clinical and public health roles, with a particular focus on developing skills as
educators and scientific investigators, in preparation for successful academic careers."
10849729,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
 Deficits in social interaction are characteristic of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The cellular, molecular, and circuit mechanisms of social deficits in ASD are largely
unknown and warrants further research. One of the most consistent etiological findings in ASD is a complete
deletion of the SHANK3 gene, which encodes a postsynaptic scaffold protein in neurons. Our lab developed the
first Shank3 complete knockout model by deleting exons 4-22 (Shank3âe4-22). Shank3âe4-22 mice show decreased
social and reward-seeking behavior and blunted response of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) to social cues.
 The NAc is a well-established regulator of social behavior. Yet, the characteristics of neurons in the NAc
that are active during social behavior, or social ensembles, are not well defined. ~95% of neurons in the NAc are
medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) that express either dopamine receptor D1 (D1+), which encode reward
reinforcement, or D2 (D2+), which encode aversive responses. NAc MSNs express high levels of SHANK3, and
Shank3 deletion induces profound changes in D2+ MSN function. Taken together, this indicates a potential
mechanism of action for social behavior deficits in Shank3âe4-22 mice.
 SHANK3 scaffolds HOMER1b/c and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) to the postsynaptic
density (PSD). HOMER1b/c and mGluR5 function in the NAc is crucial for regulating social and reward-seeking
behaviors in WT mice. To study the role of SHANK3-HOMER1b/c interaction, our lab generated the first
SHANK3-HOMER1b/c mutant mouse, Shank3PL. Since joining the Jiang lab, I have collected pilot data showing
that Shank3PL mice have significantly decreased social and reward-seeking behavior. Pilot data also indicate
Shank3PL mice have decreased HOMER1b/c expression in the PSD of the NAc.
 The specific objective of this proposal is to delineate how SHANK3 deficiency causes cellular and
molecular malfunctions that underlie abnormal circuit and social behavior using our two novel mouse models:
Shank3âe4-22 and Shank3PL. First, I hypothesize that NAc social ensembles in Shank3âe4-22 mice are primarily
composed of D2+ MSNs and encode aversion and negative sociability; in contrast, I predict WT social
ensembles are predominantly D1+ MSNs and encode reinforcement and positive social behavior. Second, I
hypothesize that SHANK3-HOMER1b/c scaffolds are crucial for social and reward behavior. We will test these
hypotheses using comprehensive methodologies.
 This study will be the first to characterize social ensembles in a well-validated genetic ASD model and
the first to investigate the role of SHANK3-HOMER1b/c scaffolds on behaviors and NAc activity. Importantly,
these studies may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treating social and reward deficits in
ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders."

I am a Professor of Medicine trained in infectious diseases (ID) and HIV epidemiology, who has developed a
nationally recognized clinical translational research program focused on understanding the associations of
HIV and HCV infection with adipose tissue changes, and metabolic and inflammatory perturbations, and their
effects on long-term organ injury (liver, bone, and vascular). My current supported research includes: 1) a R01
that establishes a longitudinal multisite cohort of ~1500 women with HIV and/or HCV infection, and those
with neither infection to determine the effects of HIV, HCV, and gonadal aging on liver steatosis and fibrosis
progression using FibroScanÂ®; 2) a second R01 and a Merck investigator-initiated award that examines the
effects of HCV cure and: a) latent HIV reservoirs, immune activation, and liver fibrosis and b) novel
biomarkers of kidney injury in persons treated with direct acting antiviral agents; 3) a second Merck award
that examines the association of plasma levels of integrase strand inhibitors (INSTIs) with body composition
changes; and 4) a U01 whose core goal is to study the long-term progression of HIV in U.S. men and women
from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Womenâs Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). My
research grants leverage the infrastructure of the WIHS, which in 2019 became the MACS-WIHS Combined
Cohort Study (MWCCS). For the new research to be supported by the K24 renewal, I will augment our current
sample of women with ~3000 MWCCS men who will undergo FibroScanÂ® beginning in 2020 to: 1) examine
how health-related disparities (socioeconomic, behavioral and mental health conditions, i.e. income, education,
region/neighborhood of residence, healthcare access, food security, and depression), biologic sex including
gonadal aging, and ancestry informative markers influence steatosis and fibrosis progression; 2) investigate
the biologic and immune pathways associated with steatosis and fibrosis progression using objective
measurement of visceral adiposity, sex hormone levels, gut and oral microbiome analysis, plasma and hair
INSTI levels obtained in the MWCCS; 3) determine how steatosis and fibrosis affects extrahepatic outcomes
(cardiac, neurocognition, bone). The proposed studies will expand my research portfolio and extend the depth
of my mentoring program to include mentees from an array of new disciplines (e.g. socio-behavioral sciences,
endocrinology, pharmacology, and microbiology, in addition to mentees in ID, hepatology, and cardiology),
and mentees from underrepresented minority (URM) groups who can effectively contribute to the HIV
communities most at risk today. The MWCCS provides mentees with ready access to a rich research platform
to build their careers in patient-oriented research. I plan additional training in professional and diversity
leadership and how to build a structured and sustainable mentoring program in order to develop early and
mid-career investigators (especially URM investigators) in HIV research, and to ensure that they will
ultimately become skilled mentors themselves."

 Hypertension is the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years worldwide. Despite current
therapies blood pressure remains uncontrolled in approximately 50% of individuals with hypertension, and even
with adequate control of BP an elevated risk of cardiovascular events remains. Hence, there is a major unmet
need for new therapeutic options for hypertension. Emerging evidence suggests an important role for the immune
system in the pathogenesis of hypertension. An immune cell subset termed regulatory T cells (Tregs) is an
attractive therapeutic target as it plays a suppressive role to limit inflammation. However, recent evidence
suggests that Tregs can play pathogenic roles in heart failure and lung fibrosis through inhibiting angiogenesis
and promoting fibrosis. Novel evidence provided with this application suggests that a subpopulation of Tregs
expressing C-C motif chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10) is selectively decreased in the circulation of hypertensive
humans and mice and is increased in the skin of mice with hypertension. Given recent evidence for an important
role for skin microvascular rarefaction (defined as loss of microvessels) in hypertension, these results suggest a
novel link between CCR10+ Tregs, skin microvessels, and hypertension development. To understand a
mechanism for these effects, we evaluated the effects of increased endothelial cell stretch, as occurs with
elevated blood pressure, on immune cells and found that CCR10+ Tregs are selectively increased with enhanced
endothelial stretch. Thus, studies in this application will test the hypothesis that increased endothelial cell stretch
augments CCR10 expression in Tregs and promotes CCR10+ Treg recruitment to the skin to enhance
microvascular rarefaction and hypertension development. This hypothesis will be tested with the following
specific aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that increased EC stretch enhances CCR10 expression in Tregs via tumor
necrosis factor alpha and to determine whether resultant CCR10+ Tregs transmigrate and inhibit angiogenesis
in response to CCR10 agonism by C-C motif chemokine ligand 27 (CCL27) in vitro, 2) to determine whether
CCR10+ Tregs promote skin microvascular rarefaction leading to elevated blood pressure in salt and angiotensin
II-induced hypertensive mouse models in vivo, and 3) to test whether CCR10 and its skin-specific ligand CCL27
promote hypertension in humans using a genetic approach of Mendelian randomization. Execution of the
outlined experiments will provide a platform for the applicant to gain further understanding and skills related to
the study of regulatory T cells and skin microvasculature as well as human genetic approaches such as
Mendelian randomization. This work will be performed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center which has
outstanding resources and mentorship to enable successful attainment of the career goals of the applicant,
namely to become an independent physician scientist caring for patients with hypertension and studying the role
of regulatory T cells in development of this disease to help develop new therapeutic options for treatment."
10849862,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The interaction between microbes and the immune system plays a key role in human health. Microbes can help
train and develop major components of the hostâs innate and adaptive immunity, while the immune system
orchestrates the host-microbe symbiosis. Many studies use animal models, population level 16S rRNA gene and
metagenomic sequencing to gain evidence on microbe-immune correlation, however, the underlying mechanism
is relatively undefined due to the complexity of this ecosystem and the limitations of the available tools. The
overarching goal of my research program is to understand how the biological functions of the microbial and cells
of the innate immune system co-evolve. Dissecting the crosstalk between the microbial and immune cells is
challenging and requires more sophisticated methods. My overall goal is to develop tools to understand, for
example, how can microbial cells influence the innate immune system even if their number is few? How do the
microbes and the immune system co-evolve according to the constantly changing strategies of the other? To
probe these questions, I propose to use a bottom-up approach that starts a single microbial and immune cell
and builds up complexity. Over the past 5 years, I developed a microfluidic platform and methods for single cell
whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, suitable for the sequencing of both bacterial and human cells.
This platform led to the discovery of preferential genetic alterations in microbes that adapted to extreme living
conditions, and that the gene expression profile in individual microbial cells is distinct. During the next 5 years, I
plan to modify and optimize this platform to investigate the bi-directional relationship between the microbial and
immune cells. This work will be centered on dendritic cells and Staphylococcus aureus as an exemplary study,
and then incorporate other cell types and environmental factors. Briefly, I plan to study how a single microbial
cell can be perceived as a group to regulate the signaling pathways of a single immune cell through analyzing
their transcriptional profiles. Central to this work is to integrate additional components into the platform to enable
the co-culture of a single microbial and immune cell, activate and monitoring their signaling, and investigate the
signaling pathways through whole transcriptome sequencing. This work will ultimately help map different immune
cell phenotypes and their responses to various microbes, which will lead to the better understanding of the
heterogenous and dynamic immune responses. In the long run, this research program will accelerate the study
of how microbiome and the immune system are cross-regulated in more complex settings. Besides, these
fundamental processes involve general biology principles at single cell transcriptional levels and are applicable
to diverse host cells, lending broader significance to the proposed work."

 The Katies for Aging Research and Equity (KARE) program at St. Catherine University is
uniquely situated within a women-centered, minority-serving institution in St. Paul, Minnesota.
As the only funded ADAR program in the upper midwest, the KARE program has established a
successful track record of supporting MSTEM persistence among underrepresented women and
gender diverse scholars from their first year at the University through graduation. To date, 100%
of KARE graduates are on track toward careers in research along PhD, MD, MD/PhD or
Masters degree pathways. Our innovative blend of holistic mentorship, interdisciplinary
coursework, and two aging-related research experiences position each KARE Scholar to
become a successful leader in the complementary fields of Geroscience and Gerojustice.
Herein, the renewal request for the KARE program addresses the following specific aims: (1)
optimize our supportive community for KARE Scholars, (2) increase the reach and rigor of
Geroscience education, and (3) cultivate mentored Geroscience research through intramural
and extramural research opportunities.
 Specifically, KARE Scholars are recruited in their first or second year in college and
receive holistic support through community building activities, journal club opportunities, career
development programming, academic and research mentorship, and networking events within
the larger regional and national aging research community. In addition to their major program of
study, scholars take courses within a cross-disciplinary Longevity and Aging minor to
complement and contextualize their disciplinary studies with an aging lens. In alignment with the
NIAâs Health Disparities Research Framework, KARE Scholarsâ coursework focuses on the
environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors that underlie age-related health
disparities among diverse populations of older adults. Importantly, each KARE Scholar is
engaged in aging-related research through multiple intramural and extramural research
opportunities. Extramural research opportunities will be primarily cultivated within KARE partner
locations including Mayo Clinic, HealthPartners Neuroscience Center, University of Minnesota-
Twin Cities, and the Midwest Aging Consortium. Through these partnerships and mentored
research with faculty experts within St. Catherine University, KARE Scholars have the
opportunity to focus on biomedical, behavioral, or clinical projects within the field of
Geroscience. Informed by the success and lessons learned in our first five years of funding, we
are confident the renewed KARE program will train diverse scholars for successful research
careers in aging."

There are more than 6 million cases of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) reported in the US, of which 10% live in Florida,
making Florida the second leading state with the highest prevalence of AD. This number will rapidly grow,
creating an urgent need to address this AD/ADRD public health crisis. This crisis is further exacerbated by a
massive shortage of trained physicians and scientists caring for this vulnerable population. The proposed T32
program: Cross-disciplinary Research Opportunity for Training in AD/ADRD Science (CrossROADS) is a
2-year program at the University of Miami (UM), leveraging our experience implementing academic training
programs over the past 20 years. The overall goal is to increase the number of diverse AD/ADRD investigators-
leaders in cross-disciplinary clinical and translational research, who can rapidly translate, implement and
disseminate discoveries to practice and community. CrossROADS graduates will be capable to address the
special health challenges and health disparities of the diverse AD/ADRD patients and caregivers we serve
through team science and collaborations in partnerships with AD/ADRD community partners and stakeholders.
CrossROADS is designed to select outstanding diverse, clinical, biomedical, and psychosocial science
postdoctoral trainees, and provide a high-quality, research and leadership training program for the next
generation of diverse AD/ADRD scientists. The Objectives are to: (1) Develop and administer a 2-year cross-
disciplinary research training program in AD/ADRD for 12 postdoctoral candidates with overrepresentation
of minority scientists from diverse backgrounds; (2) Provide an evidence-informed mentorship through
collaborative and individually tailored cross-disciplinary mentorship. Each trainee will be assigned to a
mentorship team comprised of an experienced Primary Mentor, Peer Mentor, and as required, additional clinical
or career development mentors from diverse backgrounds to facilitate traineesâ socialization and integration in
the academic cross-disciplinary research environment; and (3) Create opportunities to transition to career
independence through career advising, coaching and sponsorshi, strategies to enhance career visibility and
competitiveness, and professional development with leadership training. We will integrate our trainees in our
successful institutional training programs and collaborative, diverse, inclusive, and safe environment fostering
team science and diversity equity, and inclusion (DEI). We will also include DEI principles and a culture of
belonging and value in all aspects and at levels of the CrossROADS program. The Leadership Team will
rigorously evaluate the impact of the CrossROADS program on training of independent cross-disciplinary and
diverse scientists-leaders, their mastery of core competencies, and their impact in AD/ADRD communities."
10847721,"Summary/Abstract
Chorioamnionitis - inflammation of the fetal membranes (FM) - is characterized by neutrophil infiltration and is
a major risk factor for preterm birth. Even in the absence of prematurity, chorioamnionitis can be detrimental to
the fetus. Despite a strong association between bacterial infection, chorioamnionitis, and preterm birth, the
mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Through expression of the innate immune pattern recognition
receptors (PRR), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs), FMs have strategies to evade and
protect against infection. However, depending upon the nature of signaling and regulation, these protective
immune mechanisms may create an inflammatory milieu that can contribute to pathology. In particular, IL-8 is a
major neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammasome-mediated IL-1b is a major inducer of tissue injury and
mediator of preterm birth. We have found that the chorionic compartment is the primary site of FM IL-8 and IL-
1b production in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PDG), and muramyl dipeptide
(MDP) which activate TLR4, TLR2, and Nod2, respectively. While TLRs and NLRs can directly activate
signaling pathways leading to inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, there is the potential for far more
complex modulation, regulation, and fine-tuning of these processes and the type of responses generated,
particularly for IL-1b. This grant focusses on the requirement of two or more PRRs to be activated sequentially
in FMs exposed to bacterial triggers via novel intermediates. A non-classical family of microRNAs (miRs)
activate the ssRNA sensors, TLR7 and TLR8, to elicit an inflammatory response. These miRs can also be
carried in exosomes and delivered to TLR7 or TLR8 in target cells. Our preliminary data supports the concept
that TLR8-activating miR-146a-3p may acts as a novel intermediate signal that drives FM chemotactic and
inflammatory responses to bacterial TLR and NLR agonists. We also have preliminary data demonstrating that
FM-derived exosomes containing TLR8-activating miRs trigger neutrophil activation and release of neutrophil
extracellular traps. Finally, we found that FM tissue and circulating exosomal TLR8-activating miR-146a-3p is
elevated in women with preterm birth. Based on this, our central hypothesis is that TLR8-activating miRs
mediate FM chemotactic IL-8 and inflammasome-mediated inflammatory IL-1b in response to bacterial
triggers, and through their release and delivery via exosomes active maternal neutrophils. This leads
to inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface, increasing the risk for chorioamnionitis. To test this, our
specific aims are to determine if:
Aim 1. TLR8-activating miRs mediate a FM chemotactic IL-8 response after exposure to bacterial triggers.
Aim 2. TLR8-activating miRs contribute to FM inflammasome activation and inflammatory IL-1b production.
Aim 3. FM exosomes containing TLR8-activating miRs induce neutrophil activation."

The purpose of the training program outlined in this renewal application is to provide short-term intensive research
experiences to professional veterinary medical students. The short-term goal is to stimulate an interest in the pursuit
of hypothesis-based research that examines mechanisms, treatment, and prevention of disease. The long-term
goal is to increase the number of veterinary students who embrace research as part of their career, with a focus
that ranges from basic science/discovery to translational and epidemiological studies. These individuals fill a unique
niche in the biomedical community, combining a comparative medical education with investigatory skills which are
essential to advancing human and animal health. The program is based upon a research-intensive summer
experience that is part of a larger Summer Research Program. First- and second-year veterinary students select
mentors from graduate faculty with primary appointments in Ohio Stateâs Colleges of Veterinary Medicine,
Medicine, Public Health, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. Projects are developed in
collaboration between student and mentor, assuring that the project reflects student interests and ideas.
Development of the proposal and preliminary training activities occur prior to summer, and presentation and
publication of research results are emphasized in the period following summer. The latter includes an end-of-
summer research symposium, where students make oral presentations of research results, and poster/platform
presentations at the CVM Research Day the following spring. The most meritorious projects are selected by an
Executive Steering Committee based upon proposals submitted to and ranked by the CVM Council for Research.
This approach maximizes quality of students and projects, with an average of 25 applications for 10 T35 positions.
The faculty mentor: student ratio is 3.3:1, providing many training options that ensures a fit with student interests.
Summer seminars emphasize science communication, commercialization and intellectual property, and career
development. We have implemented a journal club that will now be led by a T35 co-director to reinforce concepts
in scientific rigor and reproducibility. Topics reflect the breadth of summer projects and individual sessions will
include moderation of student presentations by a faculty subject matter expert. Program success is reflected in
significant increases in the number of former T35 trainees in research-oriented careers relative to national
employment data for veterinarians, representing a greater than two-fold increase in academic, government and
industry employment. This reflects leading indicators that include graduate program enrollment (36%) and
publications emanating from research projects over the life of the program; 40% of T35-supported students publish,
and 31% of the publications are 1st authored by the student. To build upon this trajectory, the program will now
establish a formal relationship with the Career Areas of Emphasis component of the 3rd and 4th year veterinary
medical curriculum, developing a certificate program in Comparative Biomedical Research, emphasizing research
career experiences and opportunities under the guidance of an external advisory committee."

and relative to other ages -- both in the US and in much of the world. These demographic changes offer both
challenges and opportunities for new generations of researchers to explicate the contribution of aging to
mental illness and to reduce the personal and societal burden of mental illness in older adults. The number of
investigators focused on mental health and aging is small relative the size of the scientific and public health
challenges. ARI will provide early-career faculty a mentored, educational program to foster their transition to:
Aim 1 (Independent Investigators) measured by obtaining NIH R01-level (or equivalent) funding and,
secondarily, research funding through other NIH mechanisms or federal grant programs, and Aim 2 (Scientific
Leaders) as evidenced by research mentoring, retention as active researchers, publications, academic
promotion, participation in team science, and scientific service (e.g., NIH Study sections. The ARI national
Mentoring Network is a multi-disciplinary team of senior and mid-career scientists with complementary skills
which span the translational spectrum of brain, interventions and implementation science. The ARI
Educational Program supports 16 early-career faculty (called Scholars) annually with each Scholarâs
participating for two years. Key elements include: sustained mentoring focused on grant-writing and career
development, consultation with biostatisticians, and professional development. The program includes an
annual in-person Spring Retreat, structured long-distance follow-up, and web-based career development
seminars. ARI also supports an innovative a mentored Biostatistical Fellows Program that provides the ARI
scholars with multiple opportunities for biostatistical consultation and support. ARI sponsors a mentoring
program (CIMA and ARI Mentoring Program, CAMP) at the annual Geriatric Psychiatry meeting (AAGP). This
is particularly helpful in enriching diverse recruitment as AAGP draws from a wide group of potential scholars.
In this renewal, we propose 3 innovations to strengthen the programâs impact a. (New Science) Engage with
recent advances in computational science and community engagement, b. (JEDI to Science) Bringing Justice,
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) lens to the entire translational spectrum, and c. (Workforce itself)
Enhanced efforts to build a diverse research pipeline.
Public Health Impact: The unmet mental health needs of older adults is a significant public health problem
that affects not only those who suffer from mental disorders but their families, care providers, communities, and
institutions that deliver and pay for care. ARI meets this challenge by enhancing the pipeline of scientific
leaders."
10847874,"Genetic counseling is increasingly recommended as a key component of genomic medicine across specialties.
Genetic counselors are clinically effective with acumen identifying and interpreting genetic tests, facilitating
cascade genetic testing, and promoting patient empowerment. Many have extensive disease-specific subject
matter expertise and deep clinical insights that are valued by patients and colleagues alike. Despite these
strengths, genetic counselors' research engagement has been limited due to: 1) insufficient practical research
experience, 2) limited didactic research design and methods training, and 3) a narrow professional research
networks all leading to lack of research confidence, particularly in younger genetic counselors. The
consequences are that research questions vital to advancing genomic medicine and ELSI research in which
genetic counselors hold key expertise have been underfunded and under-researched. PROMOTE-GC is a
tailored 18-24 month part-time (12 person-month) research training program for early-mid career genetic
counselors who wish to develop skills to conduct independent genomic medicine or ELSI research that is
designed to overcome these barriers. Recruitment of genetic counselors from communities underrepresented in
genetics and genomics, including those from the disability community, will be prioritized. PROMOTE-GC
leverages the breadth of genomics expertise across Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and collaborates with both
the JHU/NIH Genetic Counseling Training Program and an active NHGRI-funded R25 training program for
undergraduates âEnhancing Diversity among Future ELSI Researchersâ to achieve three aims. 1) We will guide
participants in mentored intensive practical research experiences. These include longitudinal engagement with
a research mentoring team, embedding in a funded genomics medicine or ELSI research team to complete a
small research project, draft a grant, and experience mentored supervision of a NIH/GCTP genetic counseling
thesis project or undergraduate ELSI program research experience. 2) We will engage the many resources at
JHU to provide tailored didactic training in research methodology. We plan a Fundamentals of Genetic
Counseling Research course developed specifically for PROMOTE-GC participants and also will guide
participants to enroll in highly-rated research methods courses to meet their interests and professional goals.
We also provide opportunities to attend in-depth offsite research training courses. 3) Finally, we will facilitate
participants in creating a durable, multidisciplinary professional research community to support their future
careers through supporting genetics professional society engagement, assisting in outreach to methods experts
and mentors, and providing deliberative opportunities to engage a diverse community of experts in evaluating
new research and its future implications. The long-term over-arching goal of PROMOTE-GC isto benefit not only
the individual genetic counselors who participate, but also the genetic counseling and genomic medicine
enterprise by enhancing the research capacity of these vital members of the genomic medicine workforce."
10848071,"Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Arizona has a long-standing reputation for excellence in
training Ph.D. and postdoctoral scientists, as evidenced by the fact that many of our graduates are leaders in
academia, industry, and government. To this end, our graduate program has evolved from a systems-based
toxicology experience to a curriculum in which students are trained to apply state-of-the art techniques to solve
mechanisms of environmental toxicity affecting human diseases in various organ systems. Training of nine
predoc and three postdoc students in the cutting-edge research programs of 29 Training Grant Faculty members
are augmented by innovative technologies developed at the University of Arizona in association with the
Southwest Environmental Health Sciences and BIO5 Centers. Additionally, translational approaches undertaken
by our NIEHS Superfund Program, One Health Research Initiative, and the EPA Environmental Justice Thriving
Communities Technical Assistance Center provide an exceptionally stimulating environment for the training of
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Our track record of diversity is indicative of the Universityâs
designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution and the top-rated university for AI/AN PhDs. The interactive
research of our Training Grant Faculty and our state-of-the-art Facility Cores extend the training environment
from a single laboratory-oriented domain to a multidisciplinary experience strongly supportive of collaborative
research. Current trainees are now selected through a University-wide competition and the UA Graduate College
provides financial support for all first year Ph.D. students through an umbrella recruitment program, providing a
large pool of highly qualified candidates for competitive selection of predoctoral trainees. Predoctoral training is
achieved through a combination of coursework, laboratory research, and supplemental enrichment activities.
Postdoctoral trainees participate in innovative research programs and are guided to develop professional skills
in oral and written communication and leadership. Over the past five years, our curricular changes have
paralleled the evolving expertise of the Training Grant Faculty. We have recruited six senior full Professors, two
Associate Professors, and five junior Assistant Professors into the Training Grant, which significantly enhanced
our core strengths in mechanistic-based molecular toxicology training. The request for continuation of NIEHS
support is justified by the highly successful nature of our program, clear demand for our graduates, strong
emphasis we place on leadership skills for our trainees and postdoctoral fellows, increasing number of students
interested in toxicology and environmental health, substantial institutional commitment, strong and well-funded
research programs of our faculty, and the excellence of the training environment."
10846941,"This request is for funds to purchase a JEOL JSM-IT700HRLA Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with
EDS. The instrument will be housed within the Center for Biologic Imaging (CBI) a large, centralized imaging facility
serving the needs of NIH supported researchers across our campus and at other local institutions. The mandate of
this core facility is to provide access to and training for a full range of light and electron microscopy platforms, image
analysis, and morphometric technologies to research groups within the school of medicine and elsewhere across
campus.
 SEM is an essential service provided by the center. The current microscope within the facility is a 22-year-
old JEOL 6335F SEM. This microscope has been in constant service since it was purchased in 2001, using funds
provided by the S10 mechanism (1S10RR015738-01). During its life cycle it has been used between 1000-2000
hours each year for NIH supported research and has been kept under service contract throughout this entire time.
 The primary reason for submitting this proposal is to replace this microscope because the manufacturer
(JEOL) will no longer support or service the system (letter included) due to a lack of available parts or expertise in
the field service team to service the device. All service support will end in April 2024.
 A second reason for this application for a new instrument is to improve and expand the SEM capabilities of
the core to meet the needs of our current NIH funded biomedical researchers. SEM technology has advanced
significantly over what was available 22 years ago, and the current system lacks the resolution, speed, and sensitivity
of a current instrument partly because of technologic advances but also general decreases in performance due to
age (even with continuous maintenance). To put this in context, the system was originally supplied with a polaroid
camera back, and the most recent update possible for the computer system (from Windows XP to Windows 7) was
a decade ago.
 Finally, as is described throughout the proposal, the analytic capabilities of SEM (using EDS) are completely
absent from our current system. We have a significant and growing group of NIH funded users who have truly
fundamental needs for this analytic functionality and have made a compelling case to bring this technology to the
center.
 Together we feel that these reasons present a very strong and compelling case to replace and upgrade our
current SEM with a contemporary device."

Manganese (Mn) is an established neurotoxicant that affects the same motor and cognitive brain pathways
affected in Parkinson disease (PD), notably the nigrostriatal system. A large body of research, largely from our
collaborative team, demonstrates that Mn-exposed workers have a clinical phenotype which overlaps
substantially with PD, including Mn-dose-dependent progressive parkinsonism and nigrostriatal dysfunction on
positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. In the first five years of the present PET imaging project,
we used PET biomarkers of the dopaminergic system in the brain to establish that Mn-exposed workers had
lower caudate binding of the PET radioligand 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA), as compared to non-exposed
workers. These differences remained over five years of follow-up. We also found Mn-dose-dependent
upregulation of dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) binding, as measured by the radioligand [11C](N-
methyl)benperidol (NMB), in the substantia nigra, the same region of the brain most dramatically affected in
PD. In addition, we found an inverse Mn-dose-response association with thalamic (i.e., extrastriatal)
[11C]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) binding, as well as a decline in DTBZ binding in caudate, putamen, and
substantia nigra over time. More recently, our lab found evidence of Mn-induced neuroinflammation (microglial
activation) in the brains of deceased Mn miners providing a potential mechanism for the in vivo findings in our
welder cohort. This renewal builds on our previous studies by exploring the role of neuroinflammation in Mn-
induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Our hypothesis is that Mn-induced progressive parkinsonism is a
neurodegenerative disorder and is due to Mn-dose-dependent dopaminergic degeneration. We will perform
repeat DTBZ and NMB PET imaging in research participants from our longitudinal Mn-exposed worker cohort
who have already undergone baseline DTBZ and NMB scans to investigate the association between lifetime
cumulative Mn exposure, informed by state-of-the-art neutron activated bone Mn quantication, and annual rate
of change in DTBZ and NMB binding. We will also perform N-acetyl-N-(2-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-
pyridinamine [(11)C]PBR28 (PBR28) PET imaging in these workers to characterize patterns of microglial
activation in the same brain regions, and investigate the relationship between lifetime cumulative Mn exposure
and PBR28 binding as a marker of neuroinflammation. We then will explore the role of neuroinflammation as a
mediator of Mn-induced striatal degeneration. Finally, we enlarge our cohort to enrich for active workers and
will perform longitudinal PET imaging to characterize the relation between lifetime cumulative Mn exposure and
the annual rate of change in both striatal and extrastriatal binding/uptake of these radioligands between active
and retired Mn-exposed workers. Successful completion of these aims will provide a unique opportunity to
understand the mechanism of an important environmental nigrostriatal neurotoxicant and potentially inform the
understanding of the environmental pathogenesis of PD."
10860983,"Most psychiatric conditions have their highest incidence of onset in early life, and it is currently estimated that
one in five adolescents will develop such a condition that persists into adulthood. A major risk factor for such
disorders is the experience of childhood trauma. Among the brain regions most highly implicated in these
conditions is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which forms a synaptic network that plays important roles in
emotional regulation. During a developmental stage equivalent of human adolescence, rodents exhibit
heightened susceptibility to stress-induced behavioral phenotypes that resemble human conditions like anxiety
and depression, and that are accompanied by long-term changes in the structure and function of mPFC in
adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether unique mechanisms confer susceptibility to stress in immature
animals, or what processes immediately ensue upon exposure to stress in adults versus mice. The long-term
goal of this project is to reveal how trauma impacts directly on mPFC neurons, delineate substrates and
mechanisms in these effects, and understand the abnormal functional properties that result. In particular, our
preliminary data suggest that early adolescence is a sensitive period for noradrenaline-dependent suppression
of mPFC activity and excitability, and that engagement of this process during traumatic stress leads to a long-
lasting increase in threat avoidance, a potential correlate of human anxiety. We will make unprecedented use
of longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to measure these physiological effects as well as
changes in mPFC activity that signal abnormal avoidance behaviors. Cellular and synaptic mechanisms for
hypoexcitability will be elucidated by electrophysiological recordings. Finally, we will use temporally specific
optogenetic manipulations to test whether recovering mPFC activity within specific projection pathways is
sufficient to reverse trauma-related phenotypes. We hope that be establishing this comprehensive paradigm of
stress susceptibility, we can shed light on biological factors that potentially contribute to a high rate of
childhood onset for psychiatric disorders."
10860984,"Somatostatin (SST) is a major inhibitory hormone that is capable of attenuating both glucagon and insulin
secretion from alpha (Î±) and beta (Î²) cells respectively within the pancreatic islet of Langerhans. However, there
is a critical gap in our understanding of the basic signaling mechanisms downstream of Somatostatin Receptor
(SSTR) activation, and how these favor the inhibition of insulin secretion under some circumstances and the
inhibition of glucagon secretion under others. Through transcriptomic analysis of purified Î± and Î² cell populations
I have identified key differences and potential similarities between both which may begin to explain their cell
specific SST response. Central to these observations, the SSTR profile which provides the input signal between
either cell type is fundamentally different between Î± and Î² cells, with both cell types expressing SSTR3 on
primary cilia, while Î± cells additionally express SSTR2 on their cell surface. Somatostatin signaling is typically
suggested to lead to the inhibition of calcium and/or cAMP in the islet, but the relative importance of SSTâs effect
on these parallel signaling cascades is not understood. Furthermore, I have identified a novel SSTR mediated
effector mechanism that actively drives the remodeling of filamentous actin (F-actin) with implications for
secretory granule exocytosis. As such, my central hypothesis is that selective activation of SSTR3 on Î² cells
and SSTR2 or SSTR3 on Î± cells will attenuate insulin and glucagon secretion via distinct effects on the quality
and kinetics of Ca2+ and cAMP responses and downstream F-actin polymerization. I will pursue this hypothesis
through two separate aims anchored by high throughput functional imaging of intact islets. First, I will leverage
transgenic mouse lines in which fluorescent reporters of secondary messengers will be delivered to strictly Î± or
Î² cells. These islets will then be subjected to individual SSTR agonists and antagonists to understand the
individual contributions of identified cell specific SSTRs. Second, fluorescent reporters of F-actin dynamics will
be employed in live imaging experiments to functionally determine the contribution of SSTR activation on F-actin
polymerization and remodeling. These results will be coupled next generation sequencing data of purified
populations of Î± and Î² cells treated with SST and SSTR type specific antagonists. The results of this aim will
characterize an underlying F-actin response to SST contributing to overall hormone attenuation. These
approaches are innovative as they leverage the power of high throughput functional imaging of large populations
of cells to characterize both a novel mechanism and cell type specific response in high resolution. Collectively,
the results of these aims are significant as they will result in a more complete understanding of the mechanisms
by which SST succeeds in attenuating insulin and glucagon release under different metabolic conditions. This
understanding carries significant weight in developing cell specific SSTR agonists aimed at attenuating specific
cell populations, with implications in targeted treatment of type I and II diabetes affecting over 30 million
individuals in the United States of America."
10860985,"Descriptive Title: Advancing understanding of racism-related health disparities before birth
Project Summary/Abstract
Racial and ethnic injustice are prevalent and devastating causes of stress and subsequent health disparities.
Black and Latina women experience a higher burden of pregnancy complications, maternal mortality, and
preterm birth compared to White women. These disparities in birth outcomes are exacerbated by systems of
care that neglect or invalidate the experiences of pregnant women of color, contributing to high-risk deliveries,
unnecessary obstetric interventions, and death of women and infants. Yet, no studies have examined whether
experiences of racism prenatally affect fetal health and development through a process of âbiological
embeddingâ of racism measured daily during pregnancy. This study will address three major gaps in the literature
to date. First, experiences of racism and discrimination are often measured globally, missing the cumulative
nature of stress exposure on fetal physiological development. Second, it is unclear whether specific partner
behaviors (e.g., validation of racism-related experiences) and/or culturally-grounded coping strategies grounded
in the Radical Healing Framework (e.g., racial/ethnic identity, activism) can buffer effects of racism on maternal
physiology, fetal physiology, and birth outcomes. Third, given the novelty of this research program, it is important
to integrate qualitative methods that center the experiences of Black and Latina women during this transformative
and vulnerable life stage. The objective of this proposal is to advance understanding of racism-related
health disparities in pregnant women and infants by (1) enrolling Black and Latina women during the 2nd and
3rd trimester of pregnancy and assessing daily racism experiences through daily diary assessments (14
consecutive days trimester); (2) measuring maternal and fetal psychophysiology during the third trimester (e.g.,
heart rate, heart rate variability); (3) assessing newborn neurodevelopment within 48 hours of birth; and (4)
exploring culturally-grounded buffers and qualitative experiences of racism on women and infants. We will enroll
400 pregnant women from the Atlanta, GA and Salt Lake City, UT metro areas (n=200/site), using established
protocols for recruiting and retaining women during this developmental stage. Participating women will complete
questionnaires and a 2-week daily diary of stressors related to racism in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. In the 3rd
trimester, women will complete these measures, a qualitative interview, and two weeks of in-home maternal and
fetal physiological measures, which includes an innovative measure of fetal heart rate (HR) and HR variability
(HRV). Women will also complete a structured interaction task with their romantic partner or closest support
person; involving discussions of how each cope with racism-related stressors. Within 48 hours of birth, infants
will complete the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) to assess how prenatal exposure to racism may
affect newborn birth outcomes. This short-term longitudinal study lays the foundation for further follow-up of
infants and women into early childhood and a programmatic line of research devoted to understanding and
intervening with marginalized mothers and children to reduce the effects of racism on family health and wellbeing."
10860986,"ABSTRACT
This application aims to investigate the impact of HIV brain infection and prescription opioids on
ischemic stroke, a major co-morbidity in the infected population and opioid abusers. We recently
identified that brain infection by HIV increases susceptibility to ischemic stroke, leading to
reactivation of HIV. Importantly, this effect was associated with activation of the inflammasome.
While the impact of opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, on these events is unknown, we
have evidence that chronic exposure to opioids can enhance tissue damage in ischemic stroke
and activate the inflammasome. In line with these observations, the central hypothesis of the
current grant is that HIV and prescription opioids activate inflammasome in the CNS that
can worsen stroke outcome, including post-stroke HIV reactivation in the CNS and egress
into the periphery. In Aim 1 of the proposed work, we will evaluate the mechanisms of
inflammasome activation by HIV infection and prescription opioids. In Aim 2, we will
therapeutically target mitochondria for protection against HIV and opioid-induced inflammasome
activation, leading to improvement of stroke outcome and recovery. In Aim 3, we will study the
impact of opioid-induced inflammasome activation on HIV reactivation in the CNS and egress into
the periphery in ischemic stroke. Several conceptual, mechanistic, and technical aspects of this
application are highly innovative. For example, the focus on the impact of HIV and prescription
opioids on ischemic stroke outcome is an understudied area of research and constitutes a
conceptual innovation of the proposal. Our findings that the inflammasome can be involved in HIV
reactivation from brain reservoirs has never been reported before.
In concert, Aims 1 and 2 will provide critical insight into the role of inflammasome in stroke
development of HIV-infected patients who are opioid abusers. Aim 3 will provide important
information on the reactivation of HIV from the brain and seeding into the periphery as the result
of inflammasome activation in stroke. The proposed research is highly innovative because of its
focus on novel mechanisms underlying vascular comorbidities, such as ischemic stroke, in the
HIV-infected brain in the context of opioid abuse. These studies are also likely to identify new
opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

The mission of the UC Davis MARC program is to increase the diversity of students who complete their
baccalaureate degree, and subsequently pursue a PhD or MD/PhD in a biomedical research-focused STEM
field. To achieve this, we have developed an academic and research-focused training program for students
in underrepresented groups in biomedical sciences. To fulfill this mission, we propose to recruit 10 students,
annually, to participate in a two to three year MARC training program, which will include at least two summers
of full-time research and two academic years of part-time research. Our MARC program will promote student
retention and academic excellence through activities that facilitate social and academic integration and scientific
identity formation within a supportive peer group environment. It will engage students in research as well as in
discussions of biomedical research topics, integrity in research, and experimental design. It will also provide
them with experience in scientific presentations both oral and written, experience in proposal writing, guidance
in the graduate school application process, and career information. To achieve these goals, our MARC program
will have four main components: advising, research experience, professional development, and community
activities that enhance science identity formation and provide important sources of social support. This program
has the following measurable objectives. MARC students will: (1) learn the importance of conducting
biomedical research responsibly, ethically, and with integrity; (2) increase their scientific research expertise with
respect to understanding scientific reasoning, rigorous experimental design, data analysis, and interpretation;
(3) develop skills to communicate scientific research to a variety of audiences, including those at national
conferences; (4) develop a science identity, science community values, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging;
(5) develop a network of supportive mentors who are at a variety of career stages, including faculty research
mentors and graduate students; (6) engage in outreach and/or mentorship activities; (7) be extensively prepared
to create competitive graduate school applications; (8) maintain/enhance their commitment to careers in
biomedical research; (9) graduate at a rate of 90% with a GPA that is competitive for entrance into a PhD
program; and (10) enter PhD or MD/PhD programs in biomedical related disciplines within 3 years of graduation
at a rate of at least 60%."
10860988,"Enzalutamide and abiraterone are initially effective for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). However, resistance to both drugs occurs frequently through mechanisms which are incompletely
understood. Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis is well characterized as one of the important mechanisms of
castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Many enzymes are involved in androgen synthesis including
CYP17A1 and steroid sulfatase (STS). CYP17A1 can be inhibited by abiraterone (Abi) in clinical treatments.
However, androgen synthesis inhibition by abiraterone is incomplete, suggesting sustained steroidogenesis in
addition to CYP17A1 contributes to resistance. Dehydroepiandrosterone-SO4 (DHEAS) is present at plasma
concentrations up to 500 times higher than testosterone in prostate cancer patients and can potentially be
converted via STS into desulphated DHEA and then into androgens in prostate cancer cells. Conversion of
circulated DHEAS to DHEA by STS is believed to be an alternative source of androgen which cannot be
inhibited by abiraterone. Thus, STS may contribute to this sustained androgen production even in the presence
of abiraterone. Our preliminary data demonstrates that STS is overexpressed in CRPC cells. Overexpression
of STS increases cell growth and confers resistance to anti-androgens. In addition, we have identified several
novel small molecule inhibitors of STS, namely, SI. Targeting STS activity by the SI inhibits STS activity,
suppresses AR transcriptional activity, reduces the growth of resistant CRPC cells, and enhances
enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that STS plays a critical role in CRPC
progression and that targeting STS could be a viable strategy to treat advanced CRPC. The objectives of this
proposal are to determining the roles of STS and targeting this enzyme with novel inhibitors to improve anti-
androgen treatment response. In aim 1, we will determine the roles of STS in the development of resistance to
enzalutamide. In aim 2, we will characterize STS and its steroid metabolites in CRPC, and in aim 3 we will
determine the potential of targeting STS to overcome treatment resistance. This proposal will establish STS as
one of the important mechanisms of progression and resistance to next-generation anti-androgen therapy, and
develop novel STS inhibitors to target STS activity to potentially inhibit CRPC growth and reverse treatment

10853439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Melanoma is a devastating skin cancer that kills nearly 8,000 patients in the US annually. Patients with thicker
melanomas, invading deeper and closer to lymphatics and blood vessels, are more likely to have metastasis to
regional lymph nodes (LNs). For patients without clinically evident LN metastases, the presence of occult
metastases in the sentinel LN (SLN) or first tumor-draining LN (TDLN) is the most important prognostic factor.
However, why melanoma metastasizes to LNs in some patients and not in others remain poorly understood;
therefore, it is critical to determine the factors regulating metastasis to inform the development of novel
therapeutic approaches to prevent and target metastasis. We demonstrated that not only is the gut microbiome
a critical modulator of response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) but also that a favorable gut microbiome
can augment anti-tumor immunity at distant sites, including the skin. We have also identified differences in the
gut microbiome of melanoma patients with early-stage (0-II) compared to late-stage (III-IV) disease. The gap in
knowledge is the effect of the gut microbiome on the natural evolution of melanoma at the primary tumor and on
metastasis to regional LNs. Our hypothesis is that microbes in the gut of melanoma patients influence
primary tumor development and risk for LN metastasis, such that targeted modulation of the gut
microbiome can prevent melanoma LN metastases. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Identify gut microbial
and immunologic features associated with tumor progression and LN metastasis in melanoma patients.
We will compare gut microbiome profiles and paired tissue immune profiles using GeoMx digital spatial profiling
to characterize the immune microenvironment (IME) of the primary melanoma and SLN, and 16S gene amplicon
sequencing and/or whole metagenomic sequencing to analyze fecal samples of melanoma patients with: 1.1)
Low-risk vs High-risk primary tumors; 1.2) Negative vs Positive SLNs; and 1.3) Clinical Stage III melanoma
receiving neoadjuvant ICB. Statistical correlation analyses will be applied to identify gut microbial features
associated with immune modulation, melanoma progression and metastasis. 2) Delineate strategies to
modulate gut microbes to prevent melanoma progression and LN metastasis. We will investigate the
causal relationship between the gut microbiome, tumor progression, and LN metastasis using an inducible model
of murine melanoma (cKit:ERT2;BrafV600E;Ptenfl/fl) by assessing the: 2.1) Impact of FMT from responder and non-
responder patients on primary tumor progression and LN metastasis; 2.2) IME in both the primary tumor and
SLN to identify the microbiome-dependent immunological mechanisms of tumor progression; 2.3) Effect of
perturbation of the gut microbiota on the development of regional LN metastasis. The impact of this work will be
recognition of the gut microbiome as a critical determinant of melanoma progression at the primary and
metastasis to regional LNs, aiding the development of next generation approaches to prevent LN metastasis in
melanoma and other cancers."

Sinusoidal and lymphatic vessel regeneration are predicted to improve treatment of
hematopoietic diseases and lymphedema, but are presently limited by an incomplete
understanding of the molecular and genetic pathways that control growth of these
specialized vascular beds. Prior studies by us and others have demonstrated that
VEGFC is required for fetal liver hematopoiesis, but a clear mechanism for this
requirement has not been identified. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that loss of
VEGFC/VEGFR3 function or gain of CDH5 function confers identical defects in
sinusoidal and lymphatic vascular growth. Further, our genetic studies demonstrate that
partial loss of CDH5 rescues both the anemia and edema conferred by the loss
sinusoidal and lymphatic vascular growth, respectively, in VEGFR3-deficient animals.
We hypothesize that a reciprocal VEGFC/VEGFR3-CDH5 regulatory loop controls
sinusoidal and lymphatic vascular growth. This proposal will test this hypothesis in vivo
and in vitro, investigate the molecular mechanism of this co-regulatory axis, and
determine whether manipulation of CDH5 can be used to stimulate sinusoidal and
lymphatic regeneration in mature animals. These studies are predicted to provide
fundamental new insights into sinusoidal and lymphatic vessel growth that may be
leveraged to treat patients with hematopoietic and lymphatic vascular diseases."

Premenopausal females have blood pressure that is ~10mmHg lower than that of males. We previously
reported that an evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptor, OLFR558, is expressed in the kidney. We have
now found that sex differences in blood pressure are absent in Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice, primarily due to
increased blood pressure in females, along with a decreased diastolic pressure in males. In Aim 1, we will
determine which OLFR558-expressing cell types are primarily responsible for the blood pressure phenotype in
males and females. OLFR558 is expressed both in the vasculature and in the renal afferent arteriole (where
renin is stored and secreted from); thus, we will examine both renin levels and vascular responses in male and
female whole-animal KO mice. In addition, we will examine these same parameters, along with blood pressure
by telemetry, in mice with tissue-specific Olfr558 rescue only in the vasculature, or, only in renin-expressing
cells. In Aim 2, we will use gonadectomy in wild-type and KO mice to test the hypothesis that OLFR558 relies
on gonadal signals to mediate sex differences. In parallel experiments we will use the four core genotype
model, in which gonadal and chromosomal sex are separately inherited, to further interrogate this hypothesis.
Finally, it is well-established that males have a higher incidence of hypertension than premenopausal females;
this is true both in humans, and, in animal models of hypertension. In Aim 3, we will examine how OLFR558
influences sex differences in hypertension using two different hypertension models (Angiotensin II infusion,
and, DOCA/Salt). In sum, these studies will reveal key insights into the function of an evolutionarily conserved
OR which is required for sex differences in blood pressure."

 The neuromodulator dopamine is implicated in most neuropsychiatric disorders, and also several movement
disorders. A wealth of data has implicated dopamine release in the striatum -the input structure of the basal
ganglia- in both learning and motor control. Therefore, a major outstanding question for the field is understanding
how dopamine can satisfy these dual functions within the same brain area, using the same neural machinery.
For the most part, previous studies have either focused on movement or learning in separate experiments. The
proposed work has two main goals: (1) to relate dopamine release in the striatum to both learning and motor
control on single trials in the same animal, at task events occurring at distinct timepoints; (2) to test the hypothesis
that the neuromodulator acetylcholine dynamically gates whether dopamine in the striatum is used for learning
or moving on a moment-by-moment basis.
 This proposal will use a novel behavioral paradigm in rats; critically, the task involves several sequential
events on single trials that differentially elicit movements, or convey information about offered rewards, enabling
dissociation of motor and reward-related dynamics at distinct timepoints. High-throughput behavioral training will
generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel, accelerating the rate of research progress. We
will use optical dopamine sensors to measure release in the striatum at distinct timepoints, testing the hypothesis
that dopamine promotes learning versus moving at distinct timepoints (Aim 1). We will also perform
electrophysiological recordings in the striatum to identify neural correlates of learning (i.e., neural plasticity) at
certain timepoints but not others (Aim 1). We will next use optogenetics to manipulate dopamine release at
distinct timepoints, and evaluate the effects on learning versus moving (Aim 2). Finally, previous experiments
suggest that another neuromodulator in the striatum, acetylcholine, might influence the effect of dopamine on
neurons. We will use optical methods to measure and manipulate acetylcholine at specific trial events and
evaluate effects on trial-by-trial learning and movement (Aim 3).
 These experiments will test the hypothesis that acetylcholine gates whether striatal dopamine is used for
learning or moving. This will address a major outstanding question in the field: how can dopamine support
multiple distinct functions via the same circuit elements? Neuromodulatory systems including dopamine and
acetylcholine are implicated in myriad neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. A
greater understanding of the circuit mechanisms by which they coordinate different aspects of behavior holds
promise for revealing novel therapeutic targets for these disorders."

 Natural products are a mainstay of drug discovery, accounting for up to 50% of approved drugs either as
direct natural molecules or as inspiration for synthetic molecules. High-throughput screening of compound
libraries is a common starting point for drug development campaigns. The quality of these libraries is therefore
a key determinant of high-throughput screening campaign success. Natural product compound library design is
particularly challenging given redundancies in natural product production between isolates and greater costs of
compound production and isolation. Evidence-based and scientifically rigorous methods to optimize
natural product library design are therefore urgently required. In MPIsâ previous work, they demonstrated
using the example of the fungus Alternaria that liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS)-based analysis of fungal extracts could reveal the minimal number of extracts to include in a chemical
library, to achieve saturation of chemical diversity. Strikingly, this number could be as small as 39 isolate
extracts, depending on the Alternaria clade. It is now necessary to demonstrate the broader utility of this
bioanalytical approach, to the significant biological problem of high-throughput screening natural product
chemical library design. In addition, the high-throughput nature of our approach enables the systematic and
unbiased assessment of different natural product diversification approaches on elicited chemical diversity. Our
proposal builds on MPIâs extensive expertise in metabolomics and small molecule characterization and natural
product analysis. In addition, it is enabled by the MPIâs access to the large collection of fungal isolates from the
University of Oklahoma Citizen Science Soil Collection Program. This collection currently totals >78,000
isolates from 893 fungal genera. Our central hypothesis is that our untargeted metabolomics method can
be applied to generate specific rules of natural product library design and provide evidence to prove or
disprove current dogma governing natural product library design. We will focus on three common library
design approaches, in three independent aims. Aim 1 will focus on using our approach to demonstrate that
comparable chemical diversity can be obtained from focused, rationally-designed natural product libraries,
compared to random serendipitous discovery. Aim 2 will systematically assess the impact of co-culture on
elicited chemical diversity, comparing sympatric vs allopatric co-culture systems. Aim 3 will systematically
quantify the impact of environment-mimicking culture conditions such as soil or bacterial-derived signals, on
elicited chemical diversity. Overall, our results will lead to validation of a new approach for rational natural
product library design, with major implications for drug development."

Successful establishment of pregnancy requires the uterus to undergo several well-timed cellular changes to
allow the embryo to implant. Thus, even when the blastocyst develops normally, impaired uterine function can
lead to implantation failure or early embryo miscarriage. The uterine endometrium prepares for implantation in
two steps. First, the endometrial epithelium proliferates, loses polarity, and differentiates, allowing the embryo
to attach. Second, the underlying stromal cells proliferate and differentiate into decidual cells, allowing the
embryo to implant. These two processes are coordinated by cell-type specific responses to the steroid
hormones estrogen and progesterone. However, we lack a complete picture of the downstream responses to
these hormones, hampering our ability to develop new strategies to prevent early pregnancy loss. To address
this knowledge gap, this proposal focuses on a new area in endometrial physiology, alternative mRNA splicing.
Specifically, this proposal will test the central hypothesis that the splicing factor SF3B1 mediates progesterone-
driven alternative splicing that is essential for uterine receptivity and decidualization. This idea is founded on
the following pieces of preliminary data. First, a high-throughput siRNA screen revealed that SF3B1 was
required for human endometrial stromal cell decidualization. Second, knock down of SF3B1 impaired in vitro
decidualization more than knock down of eight other splicing factors. Third, treatment with the SF3B1-specific
inhibitor Pladienolide B inhibited human endometrial stromal cell decidualization in vitro and murine
endometrial decidualization in vivo. Fourth, treatment with Pladienolide B impaired embryo implantation and
decidualization in mice. Fifth, SF3B1 protein is elevated in endometrial stromal cells during peri-implantation in
mice. Finally, SF3B1 protein but not mRNA in stromal cells was elevated during artificial decidualization in
mice, and progesterone stabilized SF3B1 protein but not mRNA in primary human endometrial stromal cells.
The work proposed here will build on these strong preliminary data and test the hypothesis by pursuing the
following specific aims: (Aim 1) Define the functions of SF3B1 in uterine receptivity and decidualization; (Aim 2)
Identify progesterone-induced, SF3B1-dependent alternative splice variants in the endometrium; (Aim 3)
Determine the mechanism by which progesterone regulates SF3B1. At the level of basic science, this project
will identify the mechanisms that underlie SF3B1-driven mRNA splicing, which is crucial for progesterone-
driven endometrial decidualization. Of translational significance, this work will identify novel transcript variants
that may contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. In the long term, such knowledge can be used to develop new
strategies to diagnose or prevent early pregnancy loss. Together, this work will help advance Theme 2 of the
NICHD 2020 Strategic Plan, which aims to ""identify biological factors that can lead or contribute to early
pregnancy loss""."

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women in the US. When available, targeted
therapies have significantly improved the outcomes for breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, resistance to
therapies and relapses are common, especially among patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a
particularly aggressive disease for which limited target therapy options are available. It is becoming clear that
the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major obstacle to successfully treating aggressive
breast cancers. Tumor growth is associated with the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells in the TME,
causing cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and tumor escape. Furthermore, tumor cells activate escape mechanisms
such as triggering the expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1, which reduces CD8+ T cell killing. Indeed,
immunotherapeutic agents targeting PD-L1, and other immune checkpoint molecules, have shown remarkable
efficacy in metastatic tumors refractory to standard protocols. Unfortunately, only a small subset of patients
responds to these immunotherapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies.
Discovering new immunotherapeutic targets and innovative combinations with existing therapies are attractive
options for expanding the benefits of engaging the immune system against cancer. We discovered that during
breast tumorigenesis, the Hsp90 co-chaperone UNC45A becomes more nuclear and essential for cancer cell
division but remains dispensable for normal cell proliferation. Further, we found that suppressing UNC45A in
mouse syngeneic TNBC tumors triggers a drastic reprogramming of the immune-suppressive TME into a more
immune-responsive one. In addition, loss of UNC45A hampers the ability of cancer cells to repair ionizing
radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage and sensitizes in vivo TNBC models to radiation therapy. In this application,
we propose that UNC45A is a promising novel immunotherapeutic target and that its inhibition, in
combination with IR therapy, will reduce the TNBC burden. Our Specific Aims are 1. To characterize TME
reprogramming caused by loss of UNC45A in malignant cells; 2. To define the molecular mechanism by which
UNC45A promotes an immunosuppressive TME; 3. To determine the therapeutic potential of UNC45A inhibition
in combination with IR therapy."

Despite the nearly 4 decades of technology development for biomolecular structure analysis since the discovery
of the ribozyme, researchers still grapple with an inability to characterize important intermediates and other
aspects of functional nucleic acid structure. Although powerful approaches such as X-ray crystallography, NMR,
and Cryo-EM can provide atomic-level detail, they are essentially blind to structural transformations, co-existing
solution structures and conformational flexibility. Time-resolved NMR provides useful information about large
conformation changes on long timescales; however, it is not able to detail the conformational ensemble along
a folding pathway. Mass spectrometry (MS) including MS coupled with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) are
promising tools to provide additional structural detail but suffer from two disadvantages for studying functional
nucleic acids. The first is a relatively low signal intensity associated with the analysis of oligonucleotides in
negative ion mode. This potentially renders many important structures (e.g., low population) essentially invisible
to the analysis. The second is that the ions can undergo rapid structural transformation such as compaction in
the gas phase making the extraction of solution-relevant details very difficult. Overall, MS analysis requires
dramatically increased sensitivity and better means to extract solution structure information to characterize
important intermediates and conformational flexibility in structure establishment. Here we propose the
development of a paradigm-breaking, front-end technology platform for enhanced compound ionization and
improved structure resolution. The technology is built upon the new ionization technique capillary Vibrating
Sharp-edge Spray Ionization (cVSSI), which is shown to provide 10-to-100-fold ion signal enhancements over
state-of-the-art ESI sources in negative ion mode. This work will extend that advantage by another order of
magnitude to break through the sensitivity issues associated with the characterization of functional nucleic
acids. Additionally, the work will produce an integrated platform that utilizes new, rapid mixing strategies for
performing hydrogen-deuterium exchange labeling kinetics as well as oligonucleotide folding kinetics. The
microfluidics device will couple seamlessly with cVSSI to accomplish high sensitivity ionization as well as to
permit pulsed (in-droplet and on-line) and continuous (on-line) HDX labeling. With the device it will immediately
be possible to resolve co-existing structures, structural transformations, and conformer flexibility based on
differences in HDX reactivity. A novel HDX kinetics modeling methodology will also be developed to allow for
structure elucidation from even the shortest timescale measurements. The new technology platform will be
validated with gold standard functional nucleic acids including 10-23 DNAzyme, Hairpin Ribozyme, and Group
II Intron systems. The complete mapping of conformational heterogeneity and flexibilities and folding processes
of these systems will open the floodgates for further work on therapeutically-important functional nucleic acids."

A previous study titled Influenza Incidence, Diagnosis, Treatment Efficacy, Vaccine
Effectiveness (INFLUMI-Award: 1U01IP000791-01), which was conducted between 2013
and 2018 in Panama and El Salvador, observed the impact of respiratory virus, mainly
influenza on a cohort of women (N=2565) and their children (N=1586). Thus, requiring
robust epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory surveillance systems and research
infrastructure. As part of the children's evaluation, a Bayley's III test was conducted
(N=1088) to determine any cognitive, psychomotor, or language impairment. The present
project proposes to improve surveillance, reporting and epidemiological intelligence with
further follow-up of the children cohort up to eight (8) years of age. The overarching goal of
the proposed project is to further evaluate the prevalence of psychomotor, cognitive, and
behavioral development problems among children in the cohort. At start of the proposed
Project in November 2019, the children will be 3.5 years of age. We pretend to follow them
up for four years. This will be accomplished by building-on existing partnerships and previous
research; supporting the development, maintenance, and expansion of sentinel surveillance
sites in Panama and El Salvador and by evaluating the effect on neurocognitive development
of frequent and severe respiratory infections during pregnancy that might impact early
chilhood. Processes include contact of children and re-introduction into the system during the
first year. Subsequent years will include training and capacity building of influenza, influenza
preparedness, and other respiratory pathogen surveillance in the Americas."

Repetitive manual lifting is a significant occupational health and safety concern and is highly prevalent in
warehousing, distribution centers, package delivery, transportation, and lean manufacturing. These types of
tasks are the most challenging to analyze from an ergonomics perspective, particularly in multi-task situations
where lifting varied items occurs in numerous locations, involving variable body postures throughout the workday.
Manually measuring the parameters needed for analysis is challenging and resource intensive for industry
practitioners today. The overarching goal of this research is to create a computer vision risk model for lifting,
incorporate it into a prototype instrument, and field evaluate the instrument in comparison to conventional RNLE
methods. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure
assessment tool than conventional observational methods. Furthermore, it provides convenient quantification of
additional exposure variables, including lifting kinematics (i.e., speed and acceleration) individual differences,
and postures; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data
visualization synchronized with video for identifying interventions. This research translates already collected
videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from a landmark prospective study database for computer
vision lower back pain risk assessment. It leverages the vast database of videos and corresponding exposure
measures and health data for lifting and lowering activities (i.e., subtasks) performed by 772 workers across the
three cohort studies, collected by our study partners at NIOSH, the University of Utah, and the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee. They are part of a multi-institutional NIOSH funded consortium of U.S. laboratories that
recently studied workers in a wide variety of industries in a prospective epidemiology study on lower back pain.
The consortium videos will be analyzed by extracting the new video feature exposure measures, including lifting
postures, and torso and load kinematics. The video exposure assessment data will be combined with consortium
observational exposure measures and health outcome data. We will test the hypothesis that adding computer
vision exposure variables with consortium exposure variables can enhance performance of predicting lower back
pain. This project will refine and program video exposure assessment algorithms for posture classification, torso
angle and trunk and load kinematics into a prototype device. The new exposure algorithms will be tested in
selected industrial sites and compared against conventional observational methods for consistency and utility
(r2p). This translational research offers an unprecedented opportunity to exploit unique videos and associated
exposure and health outcome data already collected, in combination with new technology for quantifying
exposures. This research addresses the manufacturing, and the transportation, warehousing, and utilities NORA
sectors, as well as the musculoskeletal health cross sector agendas."
10834729,"The aging process is associated with a progressive decline in motor function that has a major impact on the
ability to maintain an independent lifestyle; contributing to the frailty and loss of mobility observed in older
adults. Aging is also associated with a reduced capacity to respond to growth cues derived from activities
such as resistance exercise and return to weight bearing following inactivity or injury. An inability to respond
to mechanical loading or to restore muscle size following extended periods of bed rest or inactivity
accelerates the progression of sarcopenia and contributes to the loss of functional mobility, independence
and the onset of frailty. The proposed research is of particular relevance to the Veteranâs Administration
since a significant number of patients within the system will suffer skeletal muscle atrophy as a
consequence of bed rest, immobilization, or neural trauma. Further, the effects of muscle atrophy are more
debilitating with age resulting in longer hospital stays, a decrease in mobility and independence, an increase
in falls, and long-term disability. Since the population of older veterans is rising, this issue represents a
growing medical and monetary concern for the VA. Thus, the long-term objective of the research outlined in
this proposal is to address an important unmet clinical need through the development of effective therapies
for the enhancement of muscle recovery following atrophy. Based on our recent findings, we hypothesize
that the lack of functional recovery following disuse-induced atrophy in aged animals is related, in part, to an
increase in neuromuscular junction impairment during disuse that worsens upon reloading. Recent studies
suggest that diet supplementation with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids has benefits to muscle mass and
force output, however, further study is needed. It is the objective of this proposal to test the ability of dietary
supplementation with fish oil to prevent the loss of muscle mass and function with age and enhance the
recovery of muscle mass and function following disuse-induced atrophy. These studies will use an animal
model that has outstanding translational application to humans: the Fischer Brown Norway F1 hybrid rat
(FBNF1). Completion of the specific aims outlined in this proposal will provide data on whether fish oil is a
potential treatment for sarcopenia and/or can enhance the recovery of muscle mass and function from
disuse atrophy. The studies will also provide information on the mechanisms involved in sarcopenia and
age-associated loss of growth capacity. In specific aim 1 we will test the ability of fish oil supplementation to
enhance the recovery of muscle from atrophy induced by hindlimb unloading in old male FBNF1 rats. Old
rats will receive an 8-week loading dose of dietary fish oil supplementation prior to hindlimb unloading,
which will continue throughout the 14 days of unloading and 14 days of reloading. In specific aim 2 we will
determine if 9 months of dietary fish oil supplementation can prevent or attenuate the loss of muscle mass
and strength in male and female rats. Dietary supplementation will begin at 22 months of age in males and
20 months of age in females; ages at which significant loss of hind limb muscle mass and function are not
measurable. Rats will be euthanized at multiple time points between 22 and 31 months in males (20 to 29
months in females) to monitor the loss of muscle mass and strength and to examine potential molecular and
cellular mechanisms of sarcopenia and potential mechanisms of action of the fish oil treatment."

Each year in the US, nearly a half million babies are born preterm ( <37 weeks of gestation). The
significance of preterm birth (PTB) extends far beyond this huge number and the neonatal period. PTB affects
~14% of Black babies, which is ~50% higher than for White babies. There is growing evidence that PTB puts a
child at significant risk for future cardiometabolic diseases, which are among the leading causes of death in the
US and disproportionately impact Black populations. While the mechanisms underlying PTB-cardiometabolic
risk remain largely unknown, we found that PTB was associated with differential maternal and cord circulating
metabolites, some of which have been implicated in cardiometabolic diseases in adults. This competing
renewal proposal aims to conduct a systematic investigation of the link between PTB and child long-term
cardiometabolic health and the underlying biological pathways. Such an undertaking is critically needed to
identify novel biomarkers for early risk assessment and targeted interventions to halt or reverse a PTB-induced
adverse cardiometabolic trajectory over the life course.
 Built on the scientific discoveries we have made during the current funding cycle, we will leverage the
rich resources of the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC), one of the largest and longest NIH-funded U.S. urban low-
income predominantly Black birth cohorts, with ~3,500 mother-child pairs who were enrolled at birth and
followed prospectively (at present, with a median follow-up of 13 years). This application will harness the
cutting-edge Olink technology for a precise and high-throughput assessment of >1500 circulating proteins in
BBC children at two time points (at birth and age 2 years). Our study design has been informed by a strong
scientific premise and compelling preliminary data, including a proteomics pilot study that demonstrated
feasibility, high quality of archived plasma samples and lab assays, and generated promising preliminary
results. Specifically, we aim to (1) Examine prospective associations of PTB with cardiometabolic outcomes
from birth to age 18 years using 3500 mother-infant pairs; (2) Identify differential plasma proteome profiles
between 500 preterm and 500 term children; (3) Assess joint associations of PTB and plasma proteome with
cardiometabolic outcomes of 1000 children; and (4) Integrate proteome with metabolome to gain a deeper
understanding of metabolic dysfunctions due to PTB and implications for subsequent cardiometabolic
outcomes using the same set of 1000 children. This proposal is strengthened by its prospective birth cohort
design and a life course framework; focus on an under-represented, under-studied, high-risk minority
population; and integration of proteomics with metabolomics data. By establishing PTB as an important early
life risk factor of future cardiometabolic risk and by identifying novel cord and early childhood predictive
biomarkers with long-term cardiometabolic implications, this study represents a unique opportunity to advance
the field and to address a root cause of cardiometabolic disparity in Black populations."

Management of cirrhosis is resource-intensive and disproportionately contributes a growing burden on
healthcare. Inpatient care is a sizeable portion of this burden where nearly 30% of admissions result in a
readmission within 30 days. Unfortunately, health system-based interventions successful in reducing
readmission rates face important barriers to dissemination. In order for successful health delivery redesign to
occur, it is important to target the right patient and deliver a tailored intervention. Precisely segmenting patient
populations to identify high utilizers is an important first step. Current readmission prediction models based on
traditional medical records data have weak performance in cirrhosis. Instead, our novel preliminary data correlate
patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) to future healthcare utilization (HCU). Further, the PIâs mentor has
shown that when healthcare systems combine real-time PRO tracking with evidence-based management
algorithms and patient-facing health tools, HCU burden can be reduced. Based on these data, this proposal will
first test the overarching hypothesis that a combination of EHR-based and non-EHR, patient-centered measures
will better identify high utilizers in cirrhosis. Taken a step further, this proposal will also test the hypothesis that
successful, scalable models of care can be translated to high-risk cirrhotics through adaptation of a health
technology tool. We will test these hypotheses via three aims and a robust training plan. Specific Aim #1 will
assess HCU prediction by existing risk models and then utilize a state-wide data source to further refine risk
prediction with liver disease-specific and population health data. Specific Aim #2 will further calibrate prediction
of future HCU using PROMs in a prospective cohort of hospitalized cirrhotics. With the ability to identify a
vulnerable group of cirrhotics from SA#s 1-2, Specific Aim #3 will build on the co-mentorâs (Dr. Boustani)
success in improving HCU in dementia populations by adapting Brain Care Notes, a mobile phone health
application designed to support real-time symptom tracking, care-giver support and engagement to reduce HCU
in those with cirrhosis. Further, while completing these aims, the PI will accomplish 3 interdisciplinary training
goals: 1) develop advanced biostatistical and big data management and analysis skills; 2) acquire experience
in methodologies needed for the study of PROMs; 3) gain expertise in healthcare implementation science
research all under the guidance of a robust mentorship team led by national experts in the proposed fields.
Successful completion of these aims will support the design of a future R01-level intervention that provides
innovative, scalable solutions for the chronic disease management in cirrhosis."

Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal of human cancers, with very few long-term survivors and no definitive
cures for this disease. Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells
to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells. Although immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade, have
revolutionized the treatment of several cancers, its benefit in GBM has been limited to small randomized trials in
the neoadjuvant setting, and limited benefit in Phase III trials in the adjuvant setting. Recently, we published a
surgical trial of neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody blockade, to address the immunologic effects of this agent in recurrent
glioblastoma. While it was a small, randomized clinical trial, the median overall survival of the neoadjuvant
treatment cohort was 417 d (13.7 months) from registration date, while that of the adjuvant treatment cohort was
228 d (7.5 months; hazard ratio 0.39). Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade was associated with upregulation of T cellâ
and interferon-Î³-related gene expression, but downregulation of cell-cycle-related gene expression within the
tumor, which was not seen in patients that received adjuvant therapy alone. These findings suggest that the
neoadjuvant administration of PD-1 blockade enhances both the local and systemic antitumor immune response
and may represent a more efficacious approach to the treatment of this uniformly lethal brain tumor than
traditional treatment in the adjuvant setting. While provocative, the benefit was restricted to patients whose T cell
infiltration and IFN-Î³ signature was elevated. Our hypothesis is that the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1
blockade in the neoadjuvant setting will significantly increase the tumor-specific T cell infiltration, allowing for
PD-1 blockade to be more effective. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize our unique access to samples and
patient data from an ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trial with PD-1 +/- CTLA-4 antibody blockade in the
neoadjuvant setting for patients with recurrent GBM. The Specific Aims of this project are:
â¢ Aim #1: To evaluate the immunogenicity, toxicity, and clinical benefit for the combination of neoadjuvant
 CTLA-4 + PD-1 antibody blockade in recurrent GBM patients.
â¢ Aim #2: To evaluate how PD-1 and CTLA-4 mAb blockade independently modify the tumor
 microenvironment and the expansion of tumor-specific T cells following neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade in
 recurrent GBM patients.
â¢ Aim #3: To develop non-invasive imaging biomarkers of response or adaptive resistance in recurrent GBM
 patients treated with combinations of neoadjuvant CTLA-4 +/- PD-1 antibody blockade.
This project could potentially be transformative, as a better understanding of how neoadjuvant immunotherapy
alters immune responses within the tumor could teach us important lessons about the critical requirements for
productive anti-tumor responses in glioblastoma and how adaptive resistance occurs in this disease."

 Cells respond to environmental stresses by regulating gene expression. Recent studies have
demonstrated that stress promotes changes in the levels of enzyme-modified nucleosides found in the anticodon
of many tRNAs, to regulate the translation of stress-response transcripts with specific codon usage patterns. In
bacteria the wobble U34 residue of tRNA can be enzymatically modified by writers to generate thiolation,
geranylation or selenation products at position 2, as well as distinct modifications to position 5, to produce 12
different modified uridines, with many predicted to play key roles in translation and stress responses. The Mnm
cluster enzymes can catalyze the formation of these modified uridines and due to their uniqueness to bacteria
and the importance of corresponding wobble uridines in the stress response, we propose that they can be
exploited to develop technology to tag modified RNA. We have used chemical biology and structural studies to
demonstrate that 2-thiouridine (s2U), geranyl-2-thiouridine (ges2U) and seleno-2-thiouridine (se2U) have different
base pairing specificity. In addition, using codon analytics of all E. coli genes, we have identified codon-biased
transcripts that could be translationally regulated by s2U, ges2U and se2U modifications. We have also shown
that cells deficient in the wobble U modifying enzymes MnmE and MnmH are sensitive to killing by
chloramphenicol (CAM) and have perturbed translation. We hypothesize that s2U, ges2U and se2U modification
levels change in response to environmental stress, to regulate the translation of response proteins. In this
application, we will synthesize and characterize 9 wobble modifications linked to MnmE and MnmH. Further, we
propose to characterize stress-induced changes in Mnm linked tRNA modifications and determine if translation
elongation of codon specific transcripts is linked to one of the 12 uridine tRNA modifications. In addition, we will
develop MnmH-based molecular tools to tag and visualize thiolated tRNAs in yeast and human cells. The
proposed studies are significant, as they will define a new form of translational regulation in bacteria, generate
new reagents and technologies for tagging epitranscriptomic marks and will provide a unified understanding of
the 12 different wobble uridines in bacterial tRNA."

Engineered proteins drive biotechnology and biology as therapeutics, diagnostics, and reagents. While
engineering the primary function â e.g. binding â has become relatively robust, identifying proteins that meet the
rigors of clinical and practical use remains highly problematic. Many proteins suffer from poor developability â
instability, insolubility, low expression, and non-specific binding â that ultimately limits utility. Protein sequence
space is immense, and sequence-function relationships are complex. Thus, more efficient methods are needed
to map the sequence-developability landscape and reduce the practical burden of identifying developable
sequences. Robust, quantitative knowledge of the landscape would [1] empower design of libraries constrained
to developable space, [2] enable design of mutants to rescue lead molecules with compelling primary function
but developability liabilities, and [3] enhance fundamental insight of factors that dictate protein
robustness. Efficient techniques could also [4] enable integrated, upstream library-scale selection for
developability. Sequence models are moderately predictive of select metrics but do not robustly quantify the
overall landscape. Current experimental approaches are inefficient. Thus, creation and implementation of a
platform for library-scale evaluation of protein developability would be transformative to accelerate and
streamline the protein discovery and engineering pipeline. We will pursue this objective via three specific aims.
Aim 1: Engineer a platform for library-scale evaluation of protein developability. We will develop a set of
cellular assays that couple [i] genotype-phenotype linkage, [ii] phenotypic stratification via flow cytometric sorting
or growth competition, and [iii] deep sequencing to efficiently quantify metrics of developability for millions of
protein variants thereby elevating developability characterization by orders of magnitude relative to current
methods. Aim 2: Elucidate sequence/developability landscapes for binder scaffolds. We will quantitatively
elucidate sequence-developability landscapes for three ligand scaffolds to [i] empower mutant design to rescue
lead molecules with compelling primary function but developability liabilities and [ii] to advance fundamental
understanding of the physicochemical principles that dictate protein robustness. Aim 3: Design constrained
libraries that yield significantly more developable binders. We will use this insight to design and test
constrained combinatorial libraries to yield significantly more developable binders than an unconstrained library.
We will test three hypotheses: [i] nested sampling enables the efficient traversal of the sequence/developability
landscape to identify an effective constrained library design; [ii] developable space is more evolvable than naÃ¯ve
space (provided library scale diversity is maintained); and [iii] the intersection of developability and evolvability
can be effectively identified via these methods."

biology to provide integrated support for each Project. The Genomics Core will support all aspects of the
generation, storage, and computational analysis of single-cell and other genomic data through the studies in
Projects 1-4. The Genomics Core has four specific aims in support of its role: 1) to establish and implement
best-practices for generation of high-quality genomic data, 2) to facilitate secure storage and transfer of
genomic data across all Projects, 3) to provide best-practice-grounded analysis of transcriptomic and multiomic
data generated in Projects 1-4, and 4) to facilitate sharing and dissemination of genomic data and analysis
code. Through these aims, the Genomics Core will establish Standard Operating Procedures for each data
modality that will be generated across the Projects, serve as the genomic data storage/transfer hub in support
of each project, establish and deploy best-practice-based pipelines for key functions, and optimize purpose-
built analytic strategies for the specific research questions in the Projects. In addition, the Core will fulfill our
commitment to rapid and transparent data sharing by using approved portals to disseminate genomic data to
the research community."
10846186,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although there has been substantial progress over the past decade in deciphering the pathobiology of
progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a large knowledge gap exists regarding the pre-clinical stages of the
disease. To address this need, we propose to leverage our ongoing cohort study of asymptomatic relatives of
patients with familial PF (FPF) in order to define critical mechanisms driving early disease progression and
develop better biomarkers of pre-clinical PF. In this At-Risk for FPF cohort study, 22% of subjects have
detectable interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) on high resolution CT scanning (HRCT) at study enrollment and
many of these individuals with ILA have evidence of progression during follow-up. In addition to extensive
genotype and phenotype information collected on subjects enrolled in this cohort, we recently performed
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 49 subjects in
this cohort and found that transcriptional profiles of several subsets of immune cells, including monocytes and
lymphocytes (T and B cell subsets), differ based on the presence or absence of ILA on HRCT. For example,
we identified a subset of CD14+ monocytes that was over-represented in subjects with ILA on HRCT and
demonstrated gene expression profile enrichment for growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways. We then
determined that PBMCs from subjects with clinical PF undergoing scRNA-seq contained a prominent CD14+
monocyte sub-cluster with a similar transcriptomic profile, thus supporting the potential biological relevance of
this approach. In addition, we measured DNA methylation patterns in PBMCs using the DNAge platform and
found that At-Risk subjects had increased DNAge compared to chronological age, which was highest in
individuals with ILA on HRCT. Overall, we are poised to transform our current understanding of pre-clinical PF
by continuing to study this unique cohort. Proposed studies will test the hypothesis that integration of
transcriptomic profiling, genetic/epigenetic phenotyping, and HRCT imaging will improve understanding of early
disease mechanisms and enable prediction of pre-clinical progression of PF. Specific aims are to: 1) detect
transcriptomic biomarkers of pre-clinical disease in a cohort of subjects at-risk for FPF, 2) identify cellular
signatures of pre-clinical disease in the lungs of subjects at-risk for FPF, and 3) integrate transcriptomic
profiling with measures of âepigenetic ageâ, genetic susceptibility, and telomere length to identify critical
features of early disease activity in subjects at-risk for FPF. By integrating data obtained in this Project with
information generated across the Program, we will determine mechanisms of pre-clinical FPF and optimize
biomarkers for predicting early disease progression."
10846187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we and others have demonstrated dramatic changes in
cellular identities, frequencies, and molecular programs that characterize late-stage pulmonary fibrosis (PF).
These advances have led to new questions regarding the timing, coordination, transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms, and impact of genetic variation on the evolution of the diverse cellular pathology seen in
advanced PF lungs. Utilizing transbronchial biopsy samples from subjects in our At-Risk for Familial PF (FPF)
cohort, we are now uniquely positioned to investigate these mechanisms through the critical phase of early
disease pathogenesis. Pilot studies in which we performed single-nucleus multiomic (RNA+ATAC)-sequencing
of archival flash frozen biopsies from At-Risk for FPF subjects suggest that changes in cell-type specific gene
expression (including alveolar niche factors) and chromatin accessibility (including key regulators of alveolar
epithelial cell fate/identity) are detectable and may develop prior to the appearance of interstitial lung
abnormalities or overt pulmonary fibrosis. Additional preliminary data reveal that a subset of genetic variants
that regulate gene expression (single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, sc-eQTL) exhibit significant
differences in effect size and/or direction in PF lungs compared to controls - we term these âdisease-interacting
sc-eQTL.â In the distal lung epithelium, disease-interacting sc-eQTL are specifically enriched within the binding
motifs for a set of stress-induced transcription factors which also regulate top differentially expressed genes in
KRT5-/KRT17+ basal-like cells in PF lungs. This remarkable convergence suggests that genetic variation at
cell-type specific loci modulating activity of a set of stress-induced transcription factors regulates alveolar
epithelial repair. We hypothesize that activation of injury-response transcriptional programs in the distal lung
epithelium unmasks disease-interacting expression-quantitative-trait loci (eQTLs) to mediate dysfunctional
epithelial repair and promote initiation and early progression of FPF. Our specific aims are: 1) To define the
single-cell molecular programs of early interstitial lung abnormalities, 2) To determine the cell-type-specific
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms through which genetic risk for FPF mediates early ILA development and
progression, and 3) To examine the mechanisms through which PF-associated genetic variation regulates
distal airway and alveolar epithelial repair. Integrating single-cell multiomics of pre-disease lung biopsy
samples linked to future PF progression outcomes, genetic variation and patient-derived organoid models, we
will investigate the mechanisms through which genetic variation interacts with injury-response transcriptional
regulation to drive the early pathogenesis of PF."
10846188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The advent of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) revolutionized our ability to study the molecular
mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Our group has leveraged this approach to identify novel cell
types and cell states, as well as to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression in advanced PF.
While this work has made significant impact, it has also raised important questions about the timing and
coordination of disease pathogenesis and pre-clinical progression. Combining advances in imagining based
spatial transcriptomics and a unique set of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded transbronchial biopsy samples
from subjects in our At-Risk for Familial PF (FPF) Cohort, we can now characerize and localize molecular and
cellular dysregulation during the earliest phases of disease. In preliminary studies, we performed spatial
transcriptomic analysis of FFPE tissue from a small subset of the At-Risk for FPF Cohort, as well as a larger
cohort of samples from declined donors and late-stage disease. Using these data we quantified cell type
composition across samples and found higher representation of cells that are often depleted in single cell
assays â e.g. AT1, endothelial, and fibroblast cells. Importantly, taking full advantage of the in situ nature of
these data we identified distinct molecular niches using both cell-cell and transcriptional neighborhoods.
Importantly, these approaches were able to distinguish between histologically similar regions with differing
underlying cellular and molecular profiles. Furthermore, we found gene expression differences between
healthy and dysregulated alveolar niches between controls and late stage disease were similar to expression
differences that preceded radiographic disease in the At-Risk for FPF cohort. We hypothesize that disruption of
specialized niche-specific regulatory programs in the distal lung results in a spatially coordinated activation of
multicellular disease amplification programs to mediate the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Our
Specific Aims are to: 1) develop a spatially-resolved molecular atlas of pre-clinical FPF, 2) define disease-
stage-specific regulatory mechanisms throughout the natural history of PF, and 3) identify niche-perturbations
which promote and ameliorate disease progression in ex vivo models. Together this study represents a
comprehensive analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PF. We anticipate the results of
these analyses will identify novel therapeutically relevant targets that have immense potential to impact
patients with PF."
10846189,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive lung disease that typically presents in older adults who have
moderately advanced disease and a limited life expectancy of 3-5 years after diagnosis. The current paradigm
of disease pathogenesis is one of recurrent, low-grade injury to the lung epithelium (e.g., by cigarette smoke)
with an abnormal repair process in a susceptible individual. The exposome is defined as the totality of
exposures experienced over a lifespan. Key stakeholders have called for integration across other âomics
platforms to understand how exposures impact health. A key gap in our current understanding of PF
pathobiology is a limited understanding of how environmental exposures contribute to disease development, as
few (if any) studies have integrated an assessment of environmental exposures with disease pathobiology. Our
group and others have demonstrated that clinical (symptomatic) PF develops after years when a more subtle
abnormality is present on lung imaging and/or tissue examination. Because family history is a major risk factor
for PF (up to 100-fold increased risk), we established the At-Risk for Familial PF Cohort to study the natural
history of pre-clinical PF among asymptomatic relatives of PF patients. This cohort of middle-aged adults is
enriched with individuals with pre-clinical PF; 22% had abnormal interstitial changes of the lung parenchyma,
termed interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), on the enrollment screening chest CT scan, and 30% experienced
pre-symptomatic progression of ILA or developed symptomatic PF during a longitudinal observation period of
~5 years. At-Risk Cohort participants self-report environmental exposures at cohort enrollment, and several of
these exposures (e.g., coal dust, welding, mold) were associated with ILA and its progression. In addition, At-
Risk Cohort participants with ILA have alterations in peripheral blood gene expression in pathways also
associated with environmental exposures. The objectives of this Project are to identify specific environmental
exposures and potential biological intermediaries that are associated with pre-clinical PF. The central
hypothesis is that environmental exposures contribute to the development of PF by causing direct injury and/or
altering the repair response, with exposure-associated biological alterations detectible before the onset of
clinical disease. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the chemical, metal, and respirable environmental
exposures associated with pre-clinical PF; and 2) Identify putative metabolic or transcriptomic intermediaries
between environmental exposures and pre-clinical PF. In a sub-study nested in the At-Risk Cohort, exposures
are measured via complementary modalities, including wearable devices, and biological intermediaries via
serum metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Pre-clinical PF-
associated features will be identified among age- and sex-matched pairs with or without ILA. The combined
result will be to gain understanding of the mechanisms through which environmental exposures lead to the
development of PF, and identify novel ways to intervene prior to the onset of symptomatic disease."

10832055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Wilsonâs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the copper-transporting P-
type ATPase, ATP7b, resulting in excessive copper accumulation primarily in the liver and brain. Elevation of
free copper leads to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, steatosis, fibrosis, and
cirrhosis. Treatments for Wilsonâs disease are limited to chelation or zinc therapies and often associated with
many side effects. Atp7b-/- mice exhibit hallmarks of the progressive liver pathology present in Wilsonâs disease
patients. By using specific nuclear receptors expressed in the liver and intestine, we will address transcriptomic
and metabolomic changes to understand how copper reprograms the metabolic and cellular signaling pathways
in the liver of Atp7b-/- mice. The lack of well-defined molecular mechanisms for therapeutic targeting represents
a critical gap in our scientific understanding of liver disease. Our preliminary data in Atp7b-/- mice revealed
decreased metabolic nuclear receptor activity and target gene expression that dynamic changes in hepatic
metabolic composition. We also discovered that hepatic nodule formation in older Atp7b-/- mice is exacerbated
by deletion of PXR in Atp7b-/- mice. These findings suggest that reprogrammed metabolism and cell cycle
regulation contribute to the hepatic phenotype of Atp7b-/- mice, and overlap other chronic hepatic disorders.
Rationale: definition of molecular targets of Cu++ toxicity will provide novel therapeutic targets for WD treatment.
Our proposed studies will test the central hypothesis: Cu++-compromises PXR activities and promotes liver
dysfunction in Wilsonâs disease."
10831968,"Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that alcohol abuse promotes the development of breast
cancer. There are two features of alcohol-induced tumor promotion: 1) alcohol consumption increases the risk
of breast cancer; 2) alcohol promotes cancer progression and is associated with more aggressive forms of
breast cancer. Therefore, alcohol exposure could affect both phases of mammary tumor development, namely,
tumorigenesis (cell transformation and onset of tumor) and cancer aggression (tumor growth, metastasis, and
drug resistance/recurrence). Adolescent alcohol drinking is a serious problem worldwide. The drinking age is
getting younger while the amount of alcohol uptake per occasion has increased. Adolescent
alcohol consumption is a risk factor for accidents, injuries, mental illnesses or some chronic diseases and
pathologies, as well as for the appearance of addictions, including alcoholism. Although the harmful effect of
adolescent alcohol exposure on the brain structures and behaviors, such as cognitive deficits and addiction
has been well studied, its effect on tumor risk has never explored. The molecular mechanisms underlying
alcohol tumor promotion, however, remain unclear. The adolescent is a critical period of mammary gland
development. Our study indicated that adolescent mice were more sensitive to alcohol tumor promoting effect
than adult mice. Our findings suggest that alcohol-induced tumorigenesis and progression/aggressiveness may
operate by different mechanisms. The p21 Activated Kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine threonine kinases;
PAK1 and PAK4 are particularly implicated in the carcinogenesis of mammary tumor. There are four members
of the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, namely, p38Î±, p38Î², p38ï§ and p38Î´.
Although some of their physiological functions may overlap, the role of these MAPKs is quite different.
p38ï§ï MAPK has been suggested to involve in the progression/aggressiveness of breast cancer. The central
hypothesis for this proposal is that alcohol-promoted mammary tumorigenesis and aggressiveness is mediated
by different mechanisms: alcohol-induced tumorigenesis is mainly mediated by PAK1/PDK4 and
estrogen/progestrone signaling pathway in the adolescents, while alcohol-induced aggressiveness mainly is
mediated by p38ï§ï MAPK signaling pathway. We also hypothesize that the enhanced sensitivity of adolescent
to alcohol is due to that the signaling pathways regulating the development of mammary glands are more
sensitive to alcohol exposure. This proposal will test the hypothesis using both in vitro and in vivo approaches.
This proposal will for the first time investigate the impact of adolescent alcohol exposure on the development of
mammary glands and tumorigenesis/progression. It will not only elucidate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying alcohol-mediated tumor promotion, but also help to develop therapeutic strategies for
treating alcohol promotion of breast cancer."
10831970,"SUMMARY
Acquired resistance to targeted therapies in cancer is a rising unmet clinical need. In prostate cancer (PCa), the
success of next-generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors have been hampered by the development
of drug resistance. This acquired resistance involves, in many cases, the reactivation of the AR axis through
several different mechanisms. However, it has become apparent that an alternative mechanism of resistance is
driven by the reprogramming of prostate cancer cells to undergo lineage plasticity to adopt an AR-independent
state and to acquire a neuroendocrine phenotype, that allow them to grow and survive and escape AR-therapy.
More potent and sustained AR targeting has driven an increased incidence of neuroendocrine prostate cancer
(NEPC), which is an extremely aggressive, highly proliferative and metastatic PCa variant. Therefore,
understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern NEPC differentiation is a pressing unmet clinical need.
Our preliminary data have identified protein kinase C (PKC)l/i as a novel tumor suppressor in NEPC. Our
recently published data demonstrate that the kinase PKCl/i is downregulated in human NEPC patients, and its
loss promotes a metabolic reprogramming that sustains increased proliferation, as well as epigenetic changes
needed by PCa cells to undergo cancer cell plasticity towards NEPC differentiation. The loss of PKCl/i results
in the upregulation of the serine and one-carbon pathway metabolism that leads to increased production of S-
adenosine methionine (SAM), which is the methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation. Our new unpublished
data demonstrate that PKCl/i, in addition to be critical to produce SAM, also directly regulates DNMT1 and
EZH2, key methyltransferases that utilize SAM, and are the ultimate chromatin modifiers. Therefore, our
overarching hypothesis is that PKCl/i by regulating not only SAM generation but also the epigenetic modifiers
of the PCa genome during NEPC differentiation creates new vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically.
Three key questions will be addressed in this proposal: (Aim 1) How does PKCl/i-mediated phosphorylation
control EZH2 and DNMT1 functions during NEPC differentiation? (Aim 2) How does DNMT1 and EZH2-
dependent epigenetic reprogramming downstream of PKCl/i contribute to the acquisition of the different NEPC
traits? (Aim 3) Is PHGDH (the limiting enzyme in serine biosynthesis) inhibition alone or in combination with
epigenetic inhibitors an effective therapeutic approach for treating NEPC tumors? The successful completion of
this proposal will allow us to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing lineage
plasticity during NEPC differentiation and help in the identification of new vulnerabilities that could lead to novel
therapies in this lethal PCa."

Women living in the developing world face an unacceptably high risk of disability and death, often from
preventable causes. Obstetrician-gynecologists (Ob-Gyns) are needed to reduce this disease burden
worldwide, but there are few established pathways to prepare investigators in global womenâs health research.
To address this gap, we launched the UNC Global Womenâs Health Fellowship in 2012. Our program is
research-focused, with the explicit goal of training the next generation of independent NIH investigators. We
offer an immersive training experience, through which fellows typically spend two years overseas, working at
established international research sites. Our trainees are intensively mentored by an experienced and highly
accomplished faculty representing diverse disciplines and backgrounds. Fellows take part in structured
enrichment activities to guide their scientific and professional development, including graduate-level
coursework, conferences and seminars, and professional networking. To date, our program has supported 13
postdoctoral trainees, including eight appointed to our current T32 award. UNC Global Womenâs Health fellows
have implemented cutting-edge research and published policy-relevant papers; most have transitioned to
academic positions after graduation. Importantly, all have learned how to design and implement studies in
developing world settings.
In this renewal application, we request another five years of support for our fellowship. Building upon the
foundation of our current program, we propose several key improvements. These changes have been informed
by a systematic evaluation of the fellowship, including structured feedback from mentors, trainees, and
advisors. First, we will reorganize our fellowship curriculum so that each new trainee chooses one of three
distinct research tracks (pregnancy outcomes, reproductive health, womenâs cancers) and one of three
methodological concentrations (clinical trials, epidemiology, implementation science). This framework will
permit a more individualized approach to assigned coursework, mentor pairing, and research projects, so that
fellows gain deeper topical and methodologic expertise as they complete the program. Second, we will expand
our program eligibility by introducing novel combined fellowships with the established Ob-Gyn subspecialties of
maternal fetal medicine, family planning, and gynecologic oncology. Third, we will extend our geographic
coverage beyond our current sites in Zambia (Lusaka) and Malawi (Lilongwe) to offer training placements in
South Africa (Johannesburg). By the end of the fellowship, graduates will obtain the necessary skills and
experience to become independently-funded NIH investigators in the field of global womenâs health."

Despite improvements in treatment regimens and technology, less than 20% of adults with type 1 diabetes
(T1D) achieve glycemic targets. Sleep is increasingly recognized as a potentially modifiable target for
improving glycemic control. Diabetes distress, poor self-management behaviors, and reduced quality of life
(QoL) have also been linked to sleep variability and insufficient sleep duration. The American Diabetes
Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes incorporated sleep as an important component of the
medical evaluation in persons with diabetes. However, no specific recommendation was given as to how to
improve sleep. A significant gap of knowledge exists regarding the effects of sleep optimization on glycemic
control in T1D. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a T1D-specific sleep optimization
intervention (Sleep-Opt) on the primary outcomes of sleep variability, sleep duration and glycemic control
(A1C); other glycemic parameters (glycemic variability, time in range), diabetes distress, self-management
behavior, QoL, and other patient reported outcomes in working-age adults with T1D and habitual increased
sleep variability or short sleep duration. To achieve these aims, we propose a randomized controlled trial in
120 working age adults (18 to 65 years) with T1D. Participants will be screened for habitual sleep variability (>
1 hour/week) or insufficient sleep duration (< 6.5 hours per night). Eligible subjects will be randomized to the
Sleep-Opt group or healthy living attention control group for twelve weeks. A one-week run-in period is
planned, with baseline measures of sleep by actigraphy (sleep variability and duration), glycemia (A1C and
related glycemic measures: glycemic variability and time in range using continuous glucose monitoring), and
other secondary outcomes: diabetes distress, self-management behaviors, quality of life and additional patient-
reported outcomes. Sleep-Opt is a technology-assisted behavioral sleep intervention that we recently
developed that leverages the rapidly increasing public interest in sleep tracking by consumers (+500% in 3
years). Our behavioral intervention employs four elements: a wearable sleep tracker, didactic content, an
interactive smartphone application, and brief telephone counseling. The attention control group will participate
in a healthy living information program. At midpoint (Week 6) completion (Week 12) and post-program (Week
24), baseline measures will be repeated to determine differences between the two groups and sustainability of
the intervention."

My research objectives are to study the impact of decoupling the EphB4/ephrinB2 axis in multiple myeloma
(MM), a cancer of antibody-secreting plasma cells, and the mechanisms through which outcomes of decoupling
occur. The Eph/ephrin family is the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Eph/ephrin interactions mediate
bidirectional signaling events in juxtaposed cells. Our preliminary studies suggest that Eph/ephrin interactions
between MM and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) are required for MM pathogenesis.
 MM is the most common primary bone marrow malignancy and although recent advances in treatment
have prolonged the life expectancy of patients suffering with this disease, it remains incurable and inexorably
fatal. Understanding of the biology of MM will reveal vulnerabilities that will lead to the development of targeted
therapies for malignant plasma cells. Additionally, our preliminary studies regarding Eph/ephrin signaling provide
important new insights into the pathological reciprocity of cancer cells and their microenvironmental neighbors.
Here, we will use new tools to decouple the partnership of the Eph receptor/ephrin interaction. Historically,
separating influences of such signaling events was less feasible. Now armed with advanced tools, we propose
to dissect the bidirectionality inherent in this signaling pathway and provide a new insight into the pathological
basis of MM.
 My primary short-term goals are to combine my scientific research and clinical care into a medically
relevant and scientifically rigorous endeavor, while expanding my scientific skillset and progressing toward an
independent research program. This award, training plan, and scientific aims are a critical step in the merger of
my clinical and research training. I plan to lead a laboratory program dedicated to furthering the understanding
of hematopoietic cancer pathology and discovering new therapeutic avenues. Long-term, I plan to become a
leader in hematopoietic malignancies and cellular therapy.
 My training outline, mentorship plan, and scientific strategy are constructed to best reach my goals. This
plan builds on my strong foundation in hematopoietic stem cell biology to transition into cancer biology. The
career development plan includes expanding my skillset to include 1) building relevant in vivo cancer models; 2)
didactic and hands-on training in developing an expanded knowledge base, scientific research tools, and
techniques relevant to cancer biology; 3) transition to independence, supported by the completion of the aims of
this award. This proposed track has already been initiated and the strong preliminary results, I believe, predict a
high likelihood of success."
10832557,"Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant (mt) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
initially has a high response rate to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), however, resistance is inevitable.
HGF-MET pathway activation and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor (TF) induced
mesenchymal phenotype are commonly observed mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance. We have identified the
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET-TWIST1 axis as a novel targetable signaling axis that may account for
both de novo and acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs including osimertinib. Our published data showed that the
EMT-TF, TWIST1 is required for EGFR mt tumorigenesis and can mediated EGFR TKI resistance in vitro and in
vivo through suppression of apoptosis. Targeting TWIST1, genetically or pharmacologically with our first-in-class
TWIST1 inhibitor, harmine resensitized EGFR mt NSCLC to EGFR TKIs. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
HGF increases TWIST1 expression and that TWIST inhibition can reverse HGF-MET mediated EGFR TKI
resistance in vitro. Therefore, TWIST1 maybe the critical targetable node that connects these pathways.
Central hypothesis: HGF-MET mediated induction of TWIST1 leads to the suppression of apoptosis and EGFR
TKI resistance in EGFR mt NSCLC, which can be overcome with TWIST1 inhibition. We will test this hypothesis
in the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine the mechanism and clinical significance of HGF-dependent TWIST1 induction in EGFR
mutant NSCLC. Hypothesis: HGF leads to increased TWIST1 expression and activity through phosphorylation
by ERK and/or AKT (Aim 1a). We further hypothesize that HGF-MET activation correlates with increased
TWIST1 expression and poor response to EGFR TKIs in the EGFR TKI de novo and acquired resistance setting
in patients (Aim 1b)
Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanism of HGF-TWIST1-mediated EGFR TKI resistance. Hypothesis: TWIST1
mediates HGF-MET dependent EGFR TKI resistance in both de novo and acquired resistance through
suppression of apoptosis in vitro (aim 2a) and in vivo (aim 2b-c).
Aim 3: Evaluate the efficacy of the TWIST1 inhibitor, harmine to overcome HGF-MET induced EGFR TKI
resistance. Hypothesis: Targeting TWIST1 with harmine in combination with osimertinib will overcome HGF-
induced resistance as well as MET driven resistance in the acquired resistance setting in vitro and in vivo.
Translational Impact: There are no FDA approved targeted therapies after progression on osimertinib. We
are uniquely positioned to identify TWIST1 as a mediator of HGF-MET-dependent EGFR TKI resistance and a
novel therapeutic target for the treatment of EGFR TKI resistance."

The goal of our PGDAC is to improve our understanding of the proteogenomic complexity of tumors. Towards
this goal, our First Aim is to apply multiomics and network based system learning to reveal causative
molecular regulatory relationships contributing to varieties of phenotypes in cancer using CPTAC
proteogenomic data. We will start with rigorous preprocessing and quality control using a pipeline tailored to
MS-based proteomics data to detect and correct batch effects, outliers, sample labeling errors, as well as to
impute missing values (Aim 1.1). We will then utilize novel statistical tools to jointly model â¥6 types of omics
data to systematically characterize functional impact of DNA alterations (such as DNA mutations, CNA, and
methylations) (Aim 1.2). Such cis-/trans-regulatory networks will help us to elucidate how protein or pathway
activities are shaped by genomic alterations in tumor cells. We will also construct protein/PTM co-expression
networks based on global-, phospho-, glyco- and other PTM-proteomics data (Aim 1.3). When constructing
these networks, we will use and create advanced computational tools to effectively borrow information from
literature, publicly available open databases, and transcriptome profiles. Moreover, we will study cell type
composition from bulk tissue using novel multi-omics deconvolution analyses, and identify immune subtypes
with distinct immune activation or evasion mechanisms (Aim 1.4). Furthermore, we will perform comprehensive
investigation of kinase and transcription factor activities by leveraging publicly available data extracted and
processed from many regulatory network databases (Aim 1.5). All Aims 1.2-1.5 will contribute to a large
collection of functionally related protein/PTM sets, co-expression network modules, immune signatures, as well
as kinase/TF activity scores. These features and feature-sets will then be tested for their associations with
disease phenotypes (Aim 1.6). For all analysis tasks in Aim 1, we will derive an integrated view of
commonalities and differences across multiple tumor types via Pan-Cancer analyses. Our Second Aim is to
further develop methods, software, and web-based tools to optimize the data analyses of our PGDAC. We will
develop novel statistical/computational tools; implement these methods as computationally efficient and user-
friendly software; and construct an integrated data analysis pipeline (Aim 2.1). We also plan to develop a set of
web-based services for querying, visualizing, and interpreting analysis results from CPTAC studies (Aim 2.2).
Our Third Aim is to nominate novel protein-based cancer biomarkers and drug targets for further investigation
by targeted proteomics assays. We will first apply machine-learning-based prediction models on features and
feature-sets from Aim 1 to identify protein biomarkers that predict disease outcome, treatment responses, and
therapeutically distinct disease subtypes (Aim 3.1). We will also query disease related gene, protein, and PTM
signatures against function perturbation databases, such as the LINCS L1000 database, to prioritize small
molecules and drugs that could be tested for attenuating tumor growth or treatment response (Aim 3.2)."
10832670,"Checkpoint therapy is remarkably effective against many malignancies that were previously devoid of effective
treatment options. Nevertheless, even for the types of cancer where it is effective, many patients do not respond,
or their cancers recur. The therapy is ineffective in many other types of cancer. Evidence has accumulated that
ineffective checkpoint therapy is often due to either the dearth of neoantigens in a given type or example of
cancer, or acquired resistance to therapy, which is frequently due to loss of MHC I antigen presentation or
neoantigen expression. Therapeutics that mobilize NK cells may dramatically complement T cell mediated anti-
tumor mechanisms, because NK cells do not depend on neoantigens, and are especially effective against MHC-
deficient tumors, which arise during checkpoint therapy. Preliminary data show that innate agonists, such as a
STING agonist, dramatically synergize with an IL-2 superkine called H9-MSA, leading to NK-dependent indefinite
long term tumor free survival in mice with established MHC I-deficient tumors, including the cold B16-B2m-/-
model and the MC-38-B2m-/- model, which were otherwise refractory to each therapy alone. Strikingly, this
therapy combination was also effective in âcuringâ mice of MHC I+ B16 tumors, mediated by CD8 T cells, and
primary methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcomas, a highly stringent autochthonous model of cancer that
was also refractory to checkpoint therapy, where both T cells and NK cells mediated antitumor effects. In the
latter model, the addition of checkpoint therapy led to long term remissions in ~half the animals. In clinical trials,
STING agonists alone have been disappointing in cancer patients, but our new evidence of great synergy of
STING agonists and IL-2 superkine suggests that the combination may have great potential for applications in
human cancer therapy. We will interrogate the mechanisms of synergistic efficacy of this combination, including
whether STING agonist, via IFN, protects NK cells from fratricide induced by the superkine, or cooperatively
prevents NK desensitization. We will further address the impact of checkpoint therapy on top of or preceding this
therapy combination, including understanding how T cells and NK cells cooperate. We will model the acquired
resistance of tumors to checkpoint therapy via selection of MHC-loss variants expression in a tumor transfer
model. Finally, we will employ the MCA sarcoma model undergoing therapy to test the roles of T cells in selecting
MHC I deficient or other NK sensitive variants, and of NK cells in potentially selecting T cell sensitive variants.
The culmination of these studies will provide a strong basis for understanding and applying this form of
combination therapy in human patients with cancer."

including TNF (Kuo et al. Sci Transl Med. 2019). This newly activated macrophage state then feedbacks to
activate fibroblast EGFR. Our central hypothesis posits that in RA synovial tissue, HBEGF+ macrophages are
polarized by fibroblasts and in turn stimulate fibroblast pathologic activity. A critical prediction is that inhibition of
mediators of this disease-associated crosstalk pathway will prevent tissue remodeling. We have developed an
experimental cell culture model system to study HBEGF+ macrophage differentiation and the pathologic impact
of their intercellular communication with synovial fibroblasts. We have also established a patient tissue ex vivo
drug response assay, which has proven effective in defining how medications function in the complex cellular
interactions of inflamed synovial tissue from clinically well-defined patients. Prior reports have established the
relevance of macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk as a powerful regulator of RA pathology, but these reports lacked
knowledge of the precise phenotypes of the synovial macrophages in RA (Rigor). With this new information and
all methods and materials in place, we can look to define which of the known pathologic tissue factors induce
this macrophage phenotype, specifically testing if IFNÎ³ from abundant CD8+ T cells in the RA synovium, in
combination with TNF and PGE2, induces the HBEGF+ macrophage phenotype (Aim 1). Furthermore, it is
feasible to define how these macrophages drive RA synovial pathogenesis, in particular whether HB-EGF and/or
epiregulin (EREG), a second EGF ligand expressed by HBEGF+ macrophages, drive both a hypoxic response
and invasiveness in synovial fibroblasts and define which subtype of human synovial fibroblasts exhibit
invasiveness in response to these EGF ligands (Aim 2). Finally, we are able to test the impact of potential
inhibitors on HBEGF+ macrophage generation and pathologic function, focusing on the ADAM17/iRhom2
complex, which controls both the release of HB-EGF and TNF from macrophages (Aim 3). Completion of these
aims will leverage our finding of human disease-associated macrophages, define mechanisms of a new pathway
driving crosstalk between synovial macrophages and fibroblasts (Innovation), and lay the founding for our long-
term objective of translating molecular findings to develop new therapies for the substantial number of RA
patients not responding currently to therapies (Significance)."
10832590,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and can occur in smokers
as well as non-smokers. Components of the Hippo tumor suppressive pathway are altered in NSCLC and recent
studies have shown that this pathway can be modulated by upstream signaling events from K-Ras and EGFR.
We had found that YAP1 could induce Sox2 and EMT markers, promoting the growth and metastasis of NSCLC.
We find that the non-canonical IkB kinase TBK1 (Tank Binding Kinase 1) could physically interact with YAP1
and phosphorylate it; further, depletion of TBK1 led to a marked elevation of YAP1 levels under normoxic
conditions, but only in K-Ras mutant, but not EGFR-mutant, lung adenocarcinoma cells. This was specific to
TBK1, since depletion of the closely related IKKe kinase did not elevate YAP1 levels. We find that the induction
of YAP1 occurs at the level of protein stability, brought about by the methylation of arginine residues of YAP1 by
CARM1 (PRMT4). CARM1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and high levels of CARM1 correlates with
poor survival in NSCLC patients. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the regulation of YAP1 by TBK1
and CARM1 is a novel mechanism which significantly promotes the growth and metastasis of non-small cell lung
cancer. Studies proposed in this application will characterize this regulation mechanistically using a variety of in
vitro and in vivo analysis, including co-culture studies and syngeneic transplantation models combined with
global analysis of gene regulation by arginine-methylated YAP1 protein. The physical interaction of YAP1 with
TBK1, PRMT5 and CARM1 will be assessed in three different human lung cancer TMAs from low grade and
high grade tumors that harbor various K-Ras mutations; such an analysis will shed light on whether the levels
and physical interaction of YAP1 with these regulatory molecules affect the growth and progression of these
tumors. ChiP-re-ChIP, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis will be conducted on primary tumor samples and
adjacent normal tissue to identify the downstream targets of arginine-methylated YAP1. YAP1 has been
demonstrated to have significant immunosuppressive effects; downregulating YAP1 through the inhibition of
CARM1 can be expected to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In depth studies will be
conducted on syngeneic mouse models to assess how CARM1 inhibitors alone or in combination, affects the
anti-tumor activity of T cells. Further, the fact that CARM1 inhibitors are in clinical trials for hematological
malignancies raise the possibility that their utility can eventually be extended to K-Ras mutant lung cancers. We
propose to test the anti-cancer efficacy of the CARM1 inhibitor EZM2302 alone or in combination with the TBK1
inhibitor Amlexanox, the K-Ras G12C inhibitor AGM510 or the MEK inhibitor Trametinib or the PLK1/K-Ras.
Given the established oncogenic role of CARM1 and YAP1 in various cancers including those of the pancreas
and the lung, an elucidation of these novel regulatory modes of YAP1 function would lead to the identification of
vulnerabilities that could potentially be targeted to combat K-Ras mutant lung adenocarcinomas."
10833615,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and often fatal stroke subtype. If the patient
survives the ictus, the resulting hematoma within brain parenchyma triggers a series of events leading to
secondary insults and severe neurological deficits. Although the hematoma in human gradually resolves within
several months, restoration of function is graded and usually incomplete. The neurological deficits in ICH
patients are permanent and disabling.
 For the past 20 years, I have been examining the hypothesis that the release of components (e.g.,
hemoglobin, iron and thrombin) from the hematoma contributes to ICH-induced brain injury. Our work on iron
(released from hemoglobin) has led to the current Phase II clinical trial of deferoxamine for ICH
(NCT02175225). This proposal continues to examine that underlying hypothesis. Specifically, it will address: 1)
the mechanisms of early erythrocyte lysis in the hematoma; 2) the role of CD163 in hemoglobin clearance after
ICH; 3) the mechanisms of endogenous hematoma removal; 4) the mechanisms of hydrocephalus
development after intraventricular hemorrhage; and 5) combination therapies for ICH.
 The purpose of our project is to determine mechanisms of brain damage after brain hemorrhage and to
develop effective therapies. The long-term goal of our studies is to limit hemorrhagic brain damage in patients."
10833639,"Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common birth defects, impacting ~1 in every 100 births. While
surgical outcomes have improved over time, morbidity and mortality remain high for certain lesions, and
significant variation exists across the ~120 U.S. congenital heart centers. This has heightened the scrutiny of
congenital heart programs, with several national high-profile reports leading to program closure and several
quality improvement initiatives to improve national outcomes. All such initiatives depend upon rigorous
measures of program quality, but how best to measure and report quality remains controversial and
understudied. Several features of CHD data and current analytic methods complicate quality assessments. 1)
CHD is a widely heterogeneous, sparse mix of different lesions. Current approaches combine all CHD
surgeries together for quality reporting and adjust for risk based only on operation type and few general
factors, despite the important influence of other routinely collected variables. Machine learning approaches are
better able to incorporate these high-dimensional clinical data but remain understudied, and current methods
rely upon outdated regression. 2) Preliminary studies suggest wide variability in the types of CHD treated
across hospitals, yet differences in hospital case-mix have not been quantified and are not used in quality
reporting. Approaches to assess hospital case-mix distributions could provide an improved understanding of
which hospitals treat comparable patients and which patient subsets are large enough to allow meaningful
quality assessments but have not been studied. 3) Current methods support only indirect assessments of CHD
program quality, prohibiting direct comparisons of interest and ignore important sources of uncertainty, leading
to inaccuracies in the quality estimates. A causal inference framework could support more direct and clinically
relevant quality comparisons across hospitals but has not been investigated. In response to NOT-HL-19-712,
we propose to apply contemporary statistical approaches to address these challenges. Aim 1 will optimize risk-
adjustment using machine learning approaches to characterize operative morbidity and mortality. Aim 2 will
identify overlapping and unique CHD patient subgroups across hospitals to improve characterization of hospital
case-mix and enable valid hospital comparisons. Aim 3 will develop robust hospital quality estimates that will
support direct and clinically relevant quality comparisons across hospitals using causal inference approaches,
focusing on areas of overlap, and including hospital random effects to account for currently ignored sources of
uncertainty. Our methods will be applied within the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database which captures
clinical information >90% of U.S. congenital heart hospitals and validated in an external source, the Pediatric
Cardiac Critical Care Consortium (PC4) Registry. These advancements will support national initiatives to
improve quality and outcomes for children and families impacted in CHD and will also provide a framework that
can be applied broadly to improve quality assessment across other fields."

The American Burn Association estimates that there are ~3,500 deaths each year from burn injuries. There are
multiple influences on morbidity and mortality in burn patients, with inhalation injury among the most significant
as it leads to increased susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infections and the associated morbidity and
mortality. A trifecta of clinical need is associated with this clinical problem: 1) we lack the ability to predict risk of
infection, 2) we do not understand the mechanism of infectious risk, and 3) we are unable to restore a patientâs
immune system to homeostasis after injury to enable adequate control of infectious agents. The overall objective
of this application is to delineate mechanisms responsible for the cycle of uncontrolled inflammation following
burn-injury to refine prediction models patient outcomes and to refine therapeutic approaches to restore immune
homeostasis, thus decreasing susceptibility to infection and preventing the associated morbidity and mortality.
We and others have demonstrated in human samples and mouse models that burn and burn + inhalation (B+I)
injury generates the local and systemic release of numerous Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs).
DAMPs promote interactions, via key immune regulators, such as mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) to
induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines which results in tissue damage
and immune cell recruitment. Immune homeostasis is normally restored at least in part by the transcription factor
Nuclear Factor-Erythroid-2-Related Factor (NRF2). Our preliminary data demonstrate that Nrf2-/- knockout mice
have profound mortality after B+I injury. However, our preliminary data also demonstrate that while pulmonary
immune cell NRF2 protein translation is rapidly increased after B+I in wildtype mice, it is not translocated to the
nucleus. Thus, we hypothesize that the NRF2-mediated homeostasis following burn and B+I injury is insufficient,
but that pharmacological activation of the NRF2 pathway has the potential to reduce acute immune dysfunction.
Using our pre-clinical models of burn and B+I injury, we will define NRF2-specific mechanisms of acute immune
dysfunction following burn or B+I injury and validate these findings in human cohorts within in our high-volume
burn center. In addition, we will utilize microparticle technology to develop and characterize NRF2-driven therapy
to improve post-injury immune dysfunction. As we appreciate that the response to burn and B+I is multifactorial,
we will leverage this technology to combine NRF2 activation with a second approach and inhibit mTOR to provide
a novel multimodal therapeutic approach. The efficacy of these approaches will be evaluated using our pre-
clinical models of burn and B+I. We are uniquely poised to successful complete this proposal which will allow
us to fill the existing knowledge gaps and improve long-term outcomes of burn and B+I patients."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have become a growing public health crisis and are one of
the major causes of disability among people over 65. Even though it was discovered over a century ago, its
driving mechanism remains poorly understood, which limiting intervention options. Scientists believe that ADRD
is caused by many genes through complex interactions with environmental factors. Over 70 genetic regions have
been identified to be associated with ADRD; however, how these genes contribute to disease penetrance and
progression remains elusive. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of gene regulations at single-cell
resolution is warranted to understand the molecular mechanism and discover therapeutic targets for ADRD.
Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies, especially the simultaneous measurement of gene
expression and chromatin accessibility for the same cell, along with the community efforts to share omics data
provide unprecedented opportunities to unravel the dynamic molecular mechanism of ADRD. To understand the
contribution of gene-environment (GxE) interactions and leverage single-cell genomics approaches and pathway
analysis, we propose to test the hypothesis that persistent neurotoxicity is due to exposures altering self-
perpetuating homeostatic processes that give the resiliency and perpetuity to the adverse toxicological processes
by either genetic and/or epigenetic means in the parent R01. More specifically, we propose to identify genetic
pathways associated with establishing a persistent neurotoxic state via single-cell genomics and bioinformatic
comparisons to population level data in Aim 2; and Aim 3 focuses on the validation of the genetic pathways of
GxE induction of persistent neurotoxicity with in vivo and in vitro models.
To augment the parent R01 and integrate single-cell human brain tissue data from healthy individuals available
through The BRAIN Initiative, the overarching goal of the supplement is to identify the network alterations of AD
patients by comparing them to those from healthy human brain tissues. This supplement is built upon our
proposed new machine learning tools for network construction by integrating snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq data
in the parent R01 and our recent successful demonstration of constructing a genome-wide gene regulatory
network using bulk RNA-seq and SNP data based on a two-stage penalized least square method. Specifically,
we will (1) Harmonize the single-cell RNA and ATAC data from the âNeMOâ and âSEA-ADâ studies, and (2)
Conduct transcriptome-wide causal inference on gene regulation for healthy and AD/ADRD cohorts. Results
from the single cell analysis of parent R01 and this supplement provides a comprehensive evaluation of genetic
and environmental factors and their complex interactions during the initiation and progression of ADRD, which
ultimately provide new insights into the altered gene regulation of ADRD that could provide a foundation for
developing new strategies to prevent, delay, or treat ADRD. Our integrative machine learning tools will be shared
through open-source programs, which can benefit single-cell-based research in the broader scientific community."

Role of the transcriptional corepressor TLE1 in the lung adenocarcinoma aggressiveness and
progression
Abstract
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which accounts for almost 40% of lung cancer, has a 5-year survival rate of
only 15% due to its aggressive behavior. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular
events underlying the development and progression of LUAD. This lab's prior R15 work has obtained evidence
that the transcriptional corepressor TLE1 exerts an anti-apoptotic- and EMT-promoting function in LUAD cells
and thereby potentiating their anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro as well as
tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, the dual survival- and EMT-promoting function of TLE1 is in part due to
its transcriptional silencing of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin gene via the transcription factor Zeb1 and
chromatin modifying enzyme Histone deacetylase (HDAC). Our recent bioinformatics analyses indicate that
TLE1 is upregulated and displays a poor prognostic value in LUAD. Based on these collective data, we
hypothesize that TLE1 regulates a survival- and EMT-promoting gene transcription program to drive the
aggressiveness and progression of LUAD. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be
addressed: 1) Evaluate the functional role of TLE1 in LUAD tumorigenesis and aggressiveness; 2) Molecularly
characterize the components of the TLE1-mediated transcriptional program that may drive LUAD progression;
and 3) Determine whether TLE1 nuclear function regulates tumorigenicity and metastasis in LUAD mouse
xenograft models. These proposed studies, which will be performed by undergraduate research students
together with the PI and a Research Assistant, will advance our understanding of the TLE1 transcriptional
network as a âdriverâ of LUAD oncogenesis and as a molecular therapeutic target to curtail LUAD
aggressiveness.

10834943,"Low back pain (LBP) is the #1 cause of disability worldwide and a leading cause among Veterans. LBP has a
recurrent course for most individuals, involving the periodic occurrence of new episodes that patients must
manage. New LBP episodes therefore are critical juncture points where interventions hold promise for
optimizing functional recovery, promoting return to work (RTW), and averting a cascade of downstream
consequences such as opioid use, mental health problems, and even the risk of suicide and death.
 The general advice to remain active during a new LBP episode is a key part of clinical practice guidelines.
However, existing guidelines provide no specific recommendations about the types of activity (e.g., lifting,
bending, etc.) that should be engaged in or avoided (âWhich?â) or the duration/intensity of such activities
should they be performed (âHow?â). The guidelines therefore do not address a major concern of patients with
LBP, which is that certain activities may have short-term effects on pain exacerbations or âflaresâ, or cause
sustained detrimental effects on pain or function. The distinctions between healthy, benign, and detrimental
activities are also important to clinicians, who are often called upon to complete âwork restriction formsâ as part
of the RTW process. An ideal set of work restrictions after a new LBP episode would limit only those activities
that are likely to cause flares of pain (short-term effects) or poor overall functional recovery in the longer term
(overall effects). However, there exist no empirically derived data concerning the short-term vs. overall
effects of specific activities during a new episode of LBP, with which to guide work restrictions.
Instead, in standard practice, cliniciansâ recommendations to engage in or avoid specific activities rely on their
personal practice style and may limit functional recovery if overly restrictive. The proposed research will use a
novel approach to distinguish the short-term effects of activities from the overall effects of such activities, by
conducting a longitudinal case-crossover study nested within a cohort study. This design accounts for
measured and unmeasured confounds by using each case as his/her own control, analogous to a crossover
experiment, capitalizing on modern mobile health and actigraphy technology.
 Aim 1: Estimate the short-term effects (ï£24 hours) of specific physical activities on pain flares in
Veterans with LBP. A longitudinal case-crossover study will be conducted to identify activities that trigger
flares among 550 Veterans of working age (18-65 yrs) seen for a new LBP episode in VA primary care. The
primary outcome is a validated flare definition characterized by pain and functional impact. Analyses will use a
biopsychosocial framework accounting for potential confounders and moderators, such as pain characteristics,
work-related factors, catastrophizing, fear of movement, depression, post-traumatic stress, and opioid use.
 Aim 2: Estimate the overall effects of specific physical activities among Veterans with LBP. A cohort
study approach to the Aim 1 study sample will examine associations between the frequency of specific
activities over the first 8 weeks of follow-up, and overall LBP-related functional recovery as defined by the
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at 12-month follow-up (primary outcome). Analyses will also use a
biopsychosocial framework accounting for a broad range of other factors, as done for Aim 1. Secondary
outcomes include average pain intensity, lost work productivity, quality of life, and opioid use at 12 months.
 These study aims will produce the first evidence-based estimates of the short-term and overall risks of
activities during LBP. These data will (1) support Veterans with LBP in navigating the complex process of
recovery, (2) assist VA clinicians in providing work restrictions, and (3) inform the development of a future
educational intervention for LBP that can be tested in a future RCT. Thus, this work responds directly to the
Rehabilitation Research and Development serviceâs call for activity-based interventions for chronic pain."
10839466,"Reproductive health is a window to overall health. Fifteen to 20% of couples have difficulty conceiving; failures
of the reproductive system thus affect a substantial population. Beyond fertility, sex steroids alter development
and function of many systems, for example, bone, the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system.
Episodic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is required for fertility in vertebrates of both
sexes, and shifts in frequency of these pulses are essential for female reproductive cycles. The goal of this
proposal is to increase our fundamental understanding of the generation of episodic release of GnRH as a
critical link to understanding and modulating fertility. The proposed work will define intrinsic properties of GnRH
neurons, local network interactions, and roles of glia and postulated driver neurons located in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus that coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B and dynorphin (KNDy neurons). Our
working hypothesis is that intrinsic and network mechanisms interact in local circuits to produce the final
episodic output of the GnRH neurosecretory system. We will study this system using state-of-the-art
electrophysiological, imaging and chemogenetic approaches combined with local measures of GnRH release
in transgenic mice in which specific neurons are identified by expression of fluorescent reporter proteins. We
will also extend our studies with mathematical modeling to generate hypotheses and return these hypotheses
to the lab for testing. We have two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine how autocrine and paracrine
factors from GnRH neurons and glia alter the relationship among action potentials, intracellular calcium and
GnRH release, as well as how steroid feedback in males and females modifies these relationships. We will
apply this knowledge to study how GnRH neurons are coordinated to produce pulses. We hypothesize factors
from these circuit elements (GnRH neurons, afferent neurons, and glia) are needed for pulse generation. We
will use pharmacologic and chemogenetic approaches to study the specific roles of these elements in
organizing the GnRH network. In Aim 2, we will characterize intrinsic properties and synaptic input to GnRH
neurons in intact vs. castrate mice of both sexes. We will use these data to move beyond independent
characterization of isolated parameters and directly study how synaptic transmission interacts with intrinsic
properties of GnRH neurons to alter action potential generation. Dynamic clamp is a method that allows these
interactions to be studied. This is accomplished by careful modeling of these conductances, which can then be
added to and/or subtracted from cells during recording. This occurs in real time through iterative interaction
with the cellâs membrane potential, so that voltage-dependent changes in conductance are precisely controlled,
and effects of the conductances on the membrane potential and firing of the cell are recorded. By examining
pulse generation from these two angles, an integrated picture will emerge that adds to our understanding of
this phenomenon. All necessary animal models and methods are in place to complete these studies."

Universal Test-and-Treat (UTT) could end the HIV epidemic if enough people start and stay on treatment. In
2016, South Africa eliminated CD4 eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and, in 2017, the country
moved to start patients on the same day as diagnosis. These policies were designed to increase ART
coverage and have been shown to be effective in clinical trials. However, the real-world effectiveness of these
UTT policies at scale is not known. Understanding the impact of UTT and at what stages of the UTT cascade
patients are lost will be critical to guide the next phase of South Africaâs HIV response.
In collaboration with the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), we previously developed a National HIV
Cohort by de-duplicating the complete laboratory records of South Africaâs public sector HIV program (>12
million patients at >4000 facilities since 2004). The unique patient identifier that we created and validated
enables longitudinal follow-up of all patients nationally from clinical presentation to viral suppression regardless
of where they seek care. The cohort is unique in its ability to follow patients who transfer to other facilities
without informing their prior clinic. However, it is limited in its ability to assess events that do not include a
laboratory test, such as medication pickups.
For this proposal, we will update the NHLS National HIV Cohort through the UTT era and link it with data from
South Africaâs facility-based ART monitoring and evaluation system. We will use this integrated cohort to
quantify losses at each stage of the UTT cascade and to assess systemwide retention and transfer in the UTT
era. We will then evaluate the impact of two UTT policies â eliminating CD4 criteria and implementing same-
day ART â on time from clinical presentation to ART uptake, retention, and viral suppression.
South Africa has the largest HIV treatment program in the world. Yet until recently, just half of HIV-infected
people in South Africa were virally-suppressed. UTT was South Africaâs largest HIV policy shift since the initial
ART rollout in 2004. Our study is innovative because it offers a unique national, longitudinal view of the HIV
care cascade in South Africa. Our study is significant because we will determine the extent to which UTT has
increased ART coverage and viral suppression and we will identify where in the UTT cascade patients leave
care, illuminating opportunities for intervention."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute manifestation of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), often with a
grave prognosis. Despite the positive effects of corticosteroid treatment on short-term survival,
this treatment is not ideal and approximately half of patients still die after a short time period. A
major unmet need in the study of acute AH is the lack of a reliable animal model that mimics the
entire spectrum of this disease in humans. Because translational research based on human
samples has a key role in the understanding of mechanisms of alcoholic hepatitis, the collection
of bio specimens from patients with severe AH could help substantially in the design of new
therapeutic strategies. The liver transplant (LT) program for acute AH at Johns Hopkins provided
a unique opportunity for us to create a clinical resource that now serves the alcohol research
community and facilitates access to otherwise unavailable specimens. With support from this
R24 grant, we have created a centralized facility for collecting human samples. The availability of
a large amount of liver tissues and different liver cell types from severe AH patients to the alcohol
research community has generated an innovative resource for translational research of acute AH.
In the last funding period, we have provided our resource to 50 investigators from over 30
institutions/universities resulting in 18 publications in prestigious journals. The goal of this R24
grant renewal is to continue developing clinical resources for severe AH investigations and to
continue meeting investigatorsâ current and increasing needs and liberally provide our resource
to the entire alcohol research community. Specifically, we need to make more human tissues
(explanted livers from patients with severe AH and other liver diseases) available to any
investigators requesting these. In addition, we will provide expertise at Johns Hopkins to generate
single-cell transcriptome and proteome databases from severe AH that may serve the alcohol
research community and beyond. Specific aims will include maintaining a centralized facility for
collecting human samples from patients with severe AH and other liver diseases and continually
providing our clinical resources to any investigators requesting them, generating single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets and proteomic and protein post-translational modifications
(PTM) datasets from diseased livers in patients with severe AH or alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) and
making them available to the alcohol research community for data mining/hypothesis generation.
We will continue to promote collaboration through sharing our unique clinical resource."

* This proposal describes new biodegradable, biocompatible pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) with
tunable adhesion strength for in vivo use. Thus, this innovative technology overcomes the limitation of current
PSAs which are only used topically and broadens the scope of applications of such biomaterials in patient care.
To highlight the utility of these new PSAs, we identified two significant and problematic clinical procedures in
thoracic surgery associated with increases in health care costs and high mortality rates: the repair of alveolar-
and broncho- pleural fistulae. Today, closure of such leaks is challenging due to use in a contained space and
to an inherent pressure gradient across the fistula. Survival is directly related to successful fistula closure and
prevention of pleural infection through the fistula. Specifically, we are evaluating novel poly(1,2-glyceric acid
carbonate)s and poly(1,2-glycerol carbonate)s (PGCs) which functionally mimic conventional polyacrylate PSAs
but possess biodegradable carbonate linkages and degrade into benign products â e.g., glycerol, CO2, ethanol.
These first-of-their-kind polymers provide an opportunity to create a new class of PSAs and shift the paradigm
around our ability to control and manage intrathoracic wounds. The proposed experiments will test the hy-
potheses that these PGC based pressure sensitive adhesives will: 1) exhibit compositionally dependent
adhesive strength which positively correlates with greater molecular weight, longer alkyl chains, and
stereoregularity; 2) display peel strengths which can be tuned over a wide range from Post-itÂ® note to
DuctÂ® Tape like performance; and, 3) enable securing a collagen buttress to a surgical stapler or an
electrospun polylactide mesh patch for sealing lung and bronchial injuries. Importantly, preliminary data
support these hypotheses, and well-characterized materials and rigorous experimental designs are established
in this proposal with essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise. The specific aims of this five-year
proposal are: Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize a series of PGC-based pressure sensitive adhesives; Aim 2.
Evaluate the compatibility of the PGC-adhesive collagen and PLA patch in vitro and in vivo, and inhibition of
bacteria migration in vitro; and, Aim 3. Evaluate the performance of the PGC-adhesive collagen and PLA patch
in an in vivo porcine model."

Whether its photons or fries eating is fundamental for life. From this basic principle, living organisms have
evolved innumerable strategies to capture energy and nutrients from their environment, leading, in turn, to the
incredible ecological diversity spanning the gamut from light eating photosynthetic autotrophs to predatory
heterotrophs. As part of the worldâs aquatic ecosystems, the expansive family of heterotrophic protozoan
predators play a critical role in environmental carbon and nutrient cycling as they consume 75% of primary
producing planktonic autotrophs daily. The vast majority of these flagellated phagotrophs use self-generated
currents to funnel their prokaryotic prey into an ancient and highly enigmatic feeding apparatus prior to
digestion. This feeding structure begins as a plasma membrane surface opening (cytostome), descends into
an internal tubular invagination (cytopharynx) and ends with prey being enveloped within budding vesicles
destined for lysosome fusion. Here we refer to this organelle as the cytostome/cytopharynx complex or SPC
and, despite its near ubiquitous presence in protozoans, next to nothing is known mechanistically about how
this structure is formed or functions. Intriguingly, a class of these phagotrophic predators known as the
kinetoplastids, gave rise to a lineage of parasitic protozoa that can infect a wide variety of organisms ranging
from plants to humans. Curiously, one species in particular, Trypanosoma cruzi, retained this ancestral
organelle much like its free-living relatives (e.g. bodonids) and continues to use it as its primary route of
endocytosis. Due to the fact that T. cruzi is easily culturable, genetically tractable and not reliant on SPC
mediated endocytosis for viability in vitro, we have been able to conduct the first ever in-dept molecular
analyses of this ubiquitous feeding organelle. Our initial published work on this structure described the first
known proteins targeted to the SPC and was followed by a report on the identification of a family of SPC
targeted myosin motors that we show contribute directly to the endocytic process. As a continuation of these
studies, this proposal seeks to generate a holistic understanding of how SPC mediated endocytosis
fundamentally functions. We will begin by dismantling the unified activity of endocytosis into its constituent
processes; cargo capture through surface receptors (Aim1), receptor signal transduction and activation of
endocytic machinery (Aim2) and finally active transport of phagocytosed cargo along the SPC for digestion
(Aim3). Each of these aims will address important basic aspects of protozoan biology that continue to remain
poorly understood. Critically, this proposal will combine both a broad approach to identify cytostomal surface
receptors and SPC specific signaling components with a focused analysis of the role of the Act2 isoform in the
endocytic process. By combining this model organism with a broad range of cutting-edge molecular tools and
methodologies, we will be able to elucidate the mechanistic basis of this ancient protozoal feeding apparatus
with the goal of providing insight into basic processes ranging from microbial food webs to parasitic diseases."

 Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of the majority of AIDS-
associated cancers. It is endemic in many areas of Africa where, due to the extraordinarily high HIV
burden, Kaposi sarcoma has emerged as one of the most common cancers on the continent. During AIDS-
induced immunosuppression, KSHV replication is no longer effectively controlled, and, together with a
large latently infected population of cells, contributes to disease progression. During lytic replication,
KSHV and the closely related model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 dramatically remodel the host
gene expression environment. Key to this remodeling is its virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)
specific endonuclease termed SOX, which accelerates degradation of a broad spectrum of mRNAs. SOX
activity plays diverse roles in the in vivo gammaherpesvirus lifecycle and immune evasion. However, the
mechanisms underlying the RNA target specificity of SOX remain largely unknown, despite their
prominent roles in shaping the mRNA abundance profile during infection. Our data show that SOX uses a
combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while preserving
selectivity. In Aim 1, we will probe how novel protein-protein interactions between SOX and components
of the RNA processing machinery influence the susceptibility of mRNAs to endonuclease targeting across
a range of cell types. We will then define the downstream consequences of mRNA targeting by SOX,
including how large scale changes to mRNA degradation cause profound âripple effectsâ to the gene
expression landscape. In Aim 2, we will mechanistically characterize a new pathway we discovered in
mammalian cells that functionally links the last stage of the mRNA lifecycle (degradation) to the first
stage (transcription). This mRNA decay-transcription âfeedbackâ pathway is activated by SOX and results
in a large-scale reduction of RNA polymerase II occupancy selectively across the mammalian but not the
viral genome. Findings derived from this proposal should have a sustained impact on the field of
gammaherpesvirus biology, and change current perceptions on how stress or virus-induced alterations to
mRNA stability influence seemingly distal components of the gene regulation circuitry."
10840478,"Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and Alzheimerâs Disease Related Dementia (ADRD) are highly heterogeneous in
pathology with mixed signatures on clinical biomarkers, making the early diagnosis challenging. Over the past
few decades, large cohorts of multi-modal data have been collected to identify the interactions between these
key pathologies. However, the utility of such cohorts has been compromised by the heterogeneity of the
data collected from multiple sites and scanners, creating technical variability that can introduce noise and
bias. Without comprehensive data harmonization and aggregation, these non-biological sources of variability
can systematically bias the results of data-driven efforts in biomarker development. Our long-term goal is to
identify specific AD and ADRD disease pathology markers and how they evolve. This project aims to improve the
early detection of AD and ADRD so that future disease-modifying therapy can be allocated more efficiently to
patients. To achieve this objective, we aim to harmonize trans-national cohorts of the Alzheimerâs Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to improve the diagnostic classification of AD and ADRD. The central
hypothesis of our study is that by harmonizing the multi-modal American ADNI (versions 1, 2, 3, and GO) and
Japanese ADNI datasets and building state of the art predictive models from each modality integrated into
comprehensive ensembles, we can identify novel classifiers and features for early AD diagnosis and
differentiation from ADRD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Harmonization of multi-modal ADNI data, 2) Development of a suite of effective classifiers from diverse,
harmonized ADNI data modalities, 3) Integration of multi-modal predictors into an ensemble model for
AD/ADRD/healthy control classification, validation of the model in international ADNI cohorts, and sharing of
the data and software products. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative computational approaches
that combine traditional machine learning and more recent deep learning methods for unstructured
neuroimaging and structured clinical data in ADNI. Moreover, we will leverage ensemble learning
techniques to effectively combine models built from these diverse data modalities to optimize for robust
classifiers of AD, ADRD, and the health status of patients. The results from this proposal will have a significant
impact on better understanding the spatial dynamics and other mechanisms of AD and ADRD pathogenesis.
Importantly, this project will create publicly available resources for multi-modal data harmonization and predictive
modeling that can be used to explore further AD, ADRD, and other neurological disorders in future studies."
10840479,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The high prevalence of knee pain in the general population has presented an immense challenge to public
health, with significant health care and economic burden to our society. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
the imaging modality of choice to evaluate patients with knee pain. Indeed, peripheral joints rank third as the
most frequent body parts imaged using MRI, with the knee being by far the most common joint evaluated. Given
the rise of the number of knee MRI examinations over the next decade with the increasing incidence of knee
injuries and the increasing prevalence of knee osteoarthritis, there is an urgent clinical need to reduce the
economic burden of knee MRI, with the most direct approach being to decrease the overall time required to
perform the MRI examination. Over the past decade, multiple techniques have been attempted to accelerate
knee MRI including parallel imaging, compressed sensing, multi-slice acquisition, and three-dimensional
isotropic resolution imaging. However, all current methods have limitations, including decreased signal-to-noise
ratio, image blurring, incompatibility to present necessary tissue contrasts, and inability to evaluate all joint
structures. Lack of appropriate acceleration methods also prevents quantitative MRI such as T2 relaxation time
mapping from being used clinically, despite its evident value for detecting early signs of joint degeneration. This
application aims to develop novel rapid acquisition and reconstruction techniques to maximize MR scanner
efficiency, improve imaging management, and automate scanning workflow, with the final goal of reducing the
economic burden of knee MRI and facilitating clinical imaging operation. Our proposed new methods will be
based on developing advanced deep learning reconstruction, combined with novel rapid image acquisition and
automatic processing, all of which are pioneered by our research group. We propose developing, optimizing,
and evaluating a rapid 5-minute knee MRI protocol consisting of all clinical sequences and additional T2 mapping
sequences, enabling rapid imaging of the whole knee for both morphological and quantitative assessment with
seamless incorporation into clinical workflow. The overall hypothesis is that a rapid 5-minute knee MRI protocol
can be equivalent to the standard 35-minute clinical knee MR protocol. Our proposal includes three specific aims:
(i) development of a robust deep learning method for a 4-minute rapid multi-planar morphological knee imaging,
(ii) development of a deep learning method for a 1-minute whole-knee-covered high-resolution T2 mapping, and
(iii) investigation of a comprehensive evaluation for rapid knee MR protocol in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
Successful completion of this project will deliver a rapid 5-minute knee MRI protocol, including routine clinical
imaging and additional T2 mapping that can fit into a standard 15-minute clinical time slot. This protocol will be
well-evaluated and implemented in clinical settings to facilitate dissemination for further validation. Our methods
would offer a unique opportunity to improve joint health care, reduce healthcare costs, and benefit a large
population that suffers knee pain and joint discomfort."
10840704,"Project Summary
Mammalian cells package two meters of linear DNA into a nucleus whose diameter is on average only a few
microns. This packaging must be done in such a way that DNA transactions such as transcription, replication,
and repair can faithfully occur. The development of the `Hi-C' technique has enabled the mapping of
chromosome-chromosome interaction frequency on the genome-wide scale in large populations of cells. Hi-
C has generated detailed datasets that have revealed key organizational features, including `domains' of
elevated interaction frequency and the broad partitioning of the genome into active and inactive
`compartments.' Disruption of these features is associated with cancer and developmental disease. However,
in part due to technical limitations, pressing open questions remain about the causes and consequences of
3D genome organization, particularly in single cells. For instance, it is not fully clear whether features such as
domains actually form in individual cells, or instead represent the averaging of many individual states that are
present in the population of cells profiled because single-cell Hi-C methods provide very sparse datasets in
which most features of genome organization remain invisible. Furthermore, the physical properties of these
genomic features have yet to be examined in single cells, and it is not currently known if these regions create
distinct diffusive environments that can impact the activity of trans-acting factors. Finally, the discovery of
additional proteins that influence nuclear architecture has been limited by the high financial and resource cost
of Hi-C. Our previous work established a powerful new platform for investigating 3D genome organization in
single cells using microscopy. We introduced a programmable fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
approach that uses sets of bioinformatically designed oligonucleotide probes to create complex hybridization
patterns in fixed samples. We have harnessed this technology to pioneer the use of single-molecule super-
resolution microscopy to study chromosome structure on the nanoscale, introduced a technique capable of
visually distinguishing homologous chromosomes, and also have developed an approach that facilitates the
multiplexed amplification of fluorescent signals in fixed cells and tissues. We will build upon this foundational
work by developing and applying single-cell imaging technologies and leveraging advanced optical
approaches to directly address these unsolved questions. Specifically, we will introduce a broadly enabling
single-cell imaging strategy capable of resolving features of 3D genome organization with unprecedented
detail using multiplexed FISH (Objective 1) and investigate the biophysical properties of 3D organizational
features with live-cell imaging (Objective 2). We will augment these efforts with high-throughput, unbiased
screening approaches to identify new regulators of 3D genome structure (Objective 3). Our detailed
characterization of nuclear architecture and its biophysical consequences will also provide an enhanced
framework for understanding how alterations in 3D genome organization can lead to human disease."

 HWWTP Abstract
The NJ/NY Hazardous Materials Worker Training Center has a long history of effective training that meets
the requirements of OSHA 29CFR1910.120, providing hazardous materials knowledge and skills to over
450,000 workers since 1987. Our Center will train workers about safety issues during clean-up of hazardous
waste sites, issues related to generation, treatment and storage of hazardous materials, and emergency
response. The courses develop competency in workers to critically analyze dangerous situations, and enable
them to identify safe work practices. Key principles of adult education are incorporated into our training, and
training courses are developed to include peer-learning, hands-on activities, and development critical thinking
skills. The Center has a robust evaluation plan, and will continue to expand the types of data collected on the
impact of training on workplace practice, as well as how training can more effectively influence workplace
safety culture.
The focus of the HWWT program is to provide comprehensive training for workers who clean-up hazardous
waste sites, are involved in the generation, treatment and storage of hazardous materials, and respond to
transportation and other emergencies. Over the next five years, the Center proposes to train 35,150 workers
in 1,960 courses in the HWWTP."
