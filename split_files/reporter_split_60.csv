Abstract:
The SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) aims to prepare physicians and scientists for independent
careers in translational research in breast cancer. Our goal is that investigators supported through this process
will spend their professional lifetimes conducting translational research in breast cancer and become academic
leaders in the field. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is ideally suited for this task, because of
the scientific and clinical environment at our Manhattan campus and affiliated institutions, and our long tradition
of training physicians and scientists of the highest quality. Our institutional environment includes numerous NIH
training grants, including a K12 grant for translational science training, a T32 grant to train PhDs in translational
research in Oncology, a Certificate Program in Clinical Investigation integrated with the Clinical and Translational
Science Program at Weill Cornell, and a well-established junior faculty mentoring program. We plan to use the
SPORE Career Enhancement funds over the next 5 years to enhance the existing formal mentoring programs.
We will encourage more physician trainees to focus on translational research in breast cancer, in particular to
leverage the emerging knowledge of DNA repair defects and specific patterns of genetic instability in breast
cancers to deliver targeted treatments to individual breast cancer patients. We will strive to attract basic,
translational and population scientists who are interested in devoting their careers to making discoveries that
have a realistic potential to clinical applications. The specific aims of the MSKCC Breast SPORE Career
Enhancement Program are to support the mentoring and research of junior faculty for careers in translational
research in breast cancer, using a dual clinical and laboratory/population science mentorship model, and to
recruit and mentor new junior faculty members to work in breast cancer translational research."

The development and protection of the germline is critical to the fertility and the health of the next generation.
My long-term objective is to elucidate the mechanisms, regulation and coordination of embryonic germline
processes as an independent investigator. Emerging evidence suggests that the secreted isoprene lipids,
retinoic acids and juvenile hormones, have more than one role in the germline lifecycle in vertebrate and
invertebrate animals, respectively. Juvenile hormone signaling has been implicated in several aspects adult
gametogenesis while retinoic acid has a prominent role in the regulation of meiotic onset timing. However, no
shared function for these two isoprenoids have been found to-date despite a high degree of structural
similarity, cross-activation capacity, and shared expression patterns during embryonic germline development.
Based on a wealth of preliminary studies, the central hypothesis guiding this proposal is that juvenile hormone
impacts embryonic germ cell dynamics through a non-classical mechanism and that two functions of retinoic
acid and juvenile function in embryonic germ processes are conserved between insects and mammals. Three
aims will be completed to test this hypothesis. First, the impact of juvenile hormone will be determined with two
approaches. Spatiotemporal juvenile hormone titers will be measured spectrometry-based metabolomics to
elucidate the source of juvenile hormone. Then, the impact of juvenile hormone on germ cell dynamics will be
determined using live imaging analysis in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Second, the non-classical,
transcription-independent, mechanism of juvenile hormone function will be elucidated by proteomic
identification of the juvenile hormone-binding plasma membrane receptors coupled to functional verification,
Downstream signaling events will be elucidated using live imaging microscopy in D. melanogaster embryos.
Third, the conservation of isoprene lipids on the embryonic germline will be defined by elucidating the impact of
retinoic acids on germ cell dynamics in Mus musculus embryos by ex vivo and in vitro necessity and
sufficiency assays. Concomitantly, conservation of the post-migratory role for isoprenoids will be examined by
defining the role of sex-specific differences in juvenile hormone titers in D. melanogaster germline
development. Upon successful completion of this work, the impact, mechanism and conservation of juvenile
hormone and retinoic acid on the embryonic germline will be defined. These insights will be important as these
bioactive isoprenoids are pervasive in our environment. In fact, juvenile hormone analogues are the active
ingredient of many insecticides used throughout the world and have been shown to activate retinoic acid
signaling in mammalian cells. Thus, understanding the full impact of these isoprenoids on the embryonic
germline is critical and the efforts to gain such understanding align well the general mission of the Eunice
Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to ensure every person is born
healthy, productive, are free of disease."
10902014,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Elongating ribosomes frequently encounter obstacles that cause ribosomes to stall. Stalled ribosomes
are then targeted by rescue factors to recycle the ribosomal subunits and target the faulty mRNA and nascent
peptide for decay. This process is critical for cellular fitness in bacteria: its loss often results in decreased
pathogenicity, viability, or antibiotic resistance. In E. coli, ribosome stalling leads to collisions, which recruit the
endonuclease SmrB to cleave the mRNA between collided ribosomes. These ribosomes are then targeted by
the rescue factor tmRNA. Several lines of evidence suggest E. coli employ a second pathway to split antibiotic-
inhibited ribosomes into subunits; however, a ribosome-splitting factor has yet to be identified. The DExH-box
RNA helicase HrpA decreases E. coli sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, suggesting this protein has a
ribosome-associated function in antibiotic resistance. In fact, HrpA has been shown to rescue ribosomes stalled
on reporter mRNA and resolve global antibiotic-induced ribosome collisions, indicating that it plays a role in
clearing stacked ribosomes during translational stress. The proposed experiments will explore whether HrpA is
a novel ribosome rescue factor that splits stalled ribosomes. Because ribosome collisions are critical for ribosome
rescue in yeast, mammalian cells, and E. coli, Aim 1 will determine if ribosome collisions also recruit HrpA.
Protein readout from a reporter-based assay in wild-type and ΔhrpA cells will be used to test if HrpA rescues
collided ribosomes from mRNA. To determine if HrpA preferentially associates with collided ribosomes in vivo,
sucrose density gradients will be used to determine if HrpA sediments with ribosome subunits, single ribosomes,
or collided polysomes from cell lysates that are treated with ribosome-stalling antibiotics. Finally, the impact of
HrpA on ribosome position and ribosome collisions transcriptome-wide will be explored using ribosome profiling
in antibiotic-treated wild-type and ΔhrpA cells. Two S. cerevisiae RNA helicases in the same DExH-box family
as HrpA are involved in ribosome splitting; therefore, Aim 2 will determine if HrpA similarly splits stalled
ribosomes in E. coli. Because the protein Hsp15 preferentially associates with 50S ribosomal subunits from
prematurely split ribosomes, HrpA splitting activity will be assayed in vivo by examining Hsp15 sedimentation in
sucrose density gradients in antibiotic-treated wild-type and ΔhrpA cells. Finally, HrpA will be tested for its ability
to split stalled ribosomes into subunits using an in vitro biochemical assay with purified components analyzed in
sucrose density gradients. This assay will be used to determine ATPase activity and precise substrate
recognition of HrpA. Characterization of HrpA will provide valuable insight into how E. coli mitigate the effects of
ribosome-targeting antibiotics, marking it as a promising potential target of antimicrobial compounds in the
treatment of human disease."
10902019,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing epidemic with ~16 million Americans affected by 2050. Despite recent
advances in catheter-based therapy, antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are still commonly used to treat patients with
symptomatic AF. However, response in an individual patient is highly variable and can be associated with
significant toxicities. The limited success of AADs in treating AF is due in part to heterogeneity of the
underlying substrate and our inability to predict individual responses to therapy. Thus, a major knowledge gap
is predicting which patients with AF are likely to respond to antiarrhythmic therapy. Emerging evidence
supports the overarching hypothesis to be tested here that variability in response to AADs is modulated by a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with AF. Although genetic approaches to AF have revealed
that susceptibility to and response to therapy is modulated by the underlying substrate, the translation of these
discoveries to the bedside care of patients has been limited in part because of poor understanding of the
underlying mechanisms by which risk alleles cause AF, challenges associated with determining the therapeutic
efficacy and lack of prospective genotype-guided studies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a common
chromosome (chr) 4q25 AF SNP modulates response to AADs in patients with symptomatic AF using burden
as a measure of therapeutic efficacy. The scientific premise for this proposal is based on our published study
which showed that a chr4q25 SNP not only predicted successful symptom control of AF but that patients who
carried the risk allele responded better to Na+-channel than K+-channel blocker AADs; a recent study that
confirmed our clinical observation; and preliminary data generated in our pilot and feasibility study. We propose
a randomized cross-over study whereby patients will be given flecainide/sotalol and therapeutic efficacy will be
assessed by implanting insertable cardiac monitors. While we showed that AF patients who carry the chr4q25
AF risk allele are more likely to respond to flecainide than those who carry the wild-type (WT) allele, the
underlying mechanism for this differential response to AADs is poorly understood. Aim 2 will elucidate the
underlying cellular mechanisms by which a chr4q25 risk SNP differentially modulates response to AADs in
patients with AF using human atrial induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). First,
we will generate atrial iPSC-CMs from chr4q25 risk and WT allele carriers. Second, we will test the hypothesis
that the electrophysiologic (EP) and structural maturity of atrial iPSC-CMs can be enhanced by precise
microenvironmental engineering of in-vivo relevant cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix, and cell-soluble factor
interactions. Third, we will determine the EP phenotypes of mature atrial iPSC-CMs from chr4q25 AF risk and
WT allele carriers and examine the effects of flecainide and sotalol ex-vivo. The proposed studies will not only
improve the prediction of response to AADs for AF patients and pave the way for a genotype-guided approach
but also facilitate the practice of personalized medicine."
10903729,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is a significant public health problem in the United States (U.S.).
Rates of SMM in the U.S. increased 200% from 1993 to 2014. Black birthing people endured 70% more risk of
SMM during the antepartum period, 40% more during the intrapartum period, and 18% more risk in the
postpartum period when compared to their White counterparts. In the U.S., minority patients report experiencing
higher rates of both chronic racial discrimination (day-to-day occurrences of interpersonal racial discrimination
occurring outside the medical setting) and acute racial discrimination in medical settings (discrimination
experienced inside the medical setting, perpetuated by nurses, midwives, and obstetricians) and disrespectful
care. Moreover, previous studies have primarily focused on discrimination perpetrated by physicians rather than
nurses and midwives, who typically interact more frequently with hospitalized patients. While research shows a
relationship between racial discrimination and adverse health outcomes, no studies have measured the
relationship between experiences of discrimination (acute and chronic) and disrespectful maternity care
perpetuated by all provider types and SMM outcomes.
Purpose: This study aims to conduct a case-control study with a nested qualitative study collecting quantitative
and qualitative data on 100 self-identified Black birthing people who gave birth in a U.S. hospital within six months
of enrollment.
Methods: The case-control design will compare 50 cases (birthing people who experienced an SMM outcome)
and 50 controls (birthing people who didn't experience SMM outcomes). Participants will complete five surveys,
including a demographic survey and scales assessing racial discrimination from providers while seeking
antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, respectful maternity care from all providers, and racial
discrimination in their daily lives. The study is comprised of three parts: (1) measure the association between
experiencing an SMM outcome and experiences of discrimination and respectful care; (2) analyze survey data
and purposively recruit a sample for qualitative interviews; (3) conduct 15-20 interviews of birthing people
identified by low scores on the respect scale (indicating low respect) and high scores on the discrimination scale
(indicating a high level of discrimination).
Implications: This study, for the first time, will provide information on both acute and chronic interpersonal racial
discrimination and maternal disrespect in Black birthing people experiencing SMM outcomes, a population at
high risk for health inequities. Importantly, we will measure discrimination and disrespectful care received from
all provider types, including midwives and nurses, the latter of who has been omitted from previous health
inequities research. The findings of this study have the potential to impact practice in many ways, including the
revision of standardized care practices of providers to improve risks of adverse outcomes in minority populations."
10903904,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are complex multifactorial disorders characterized
by progressive memory loss, confusion, and impaired cognitive abilities in older adults. In addition to
genetic variants, studies have reported that certain epigenetic, network, and genome organizational
perturbations, and their complex interplay, contribute to ADRD progression, informing new cellular
etiologies. The recent single-cell revolution, especially multimodal genomic profiling, makes it possible
to scrutinize multi-scale dysregulations in ADRDs at the finest possible resolution. However, few
methods have been developed to address this critical yet challenging task due to the high missingness,
dimensionality, and complex feature interactions in single-cell data. In this project, we will develop
interpretable deep learning methods and software tools to highlight multi-scale dysregulations
contributing to ADRDs, including genetic, epigenetic, network, and chromatin structural alterations at
a single-cell resolution.
 Distinct from previous efforts reporting a set of one-dimensional (1D) functional cis-regulatory
elements (CREs) from only one genome and applying it to all samples, we aim to construct personal,
compact, gene-centric, and cell-type-specific brain regulome from sc-multiome data. Specifically,
we will first propose a scalable multimodal deep generative model to integrate large-scale,
heterogeneous ADRD single-cell data with single-, multi-, and hybrid modalities. Distinct to existing
methods, we will include an invariant representation learning scheme to derive latent cell
representations uncorrelated with confounding factors (e.g., age, gender, read depth, and batch effects)
for bias-free transcriptome and epigenome reconstruction (Aim 1). Then, we will go beyond the 1D
genome annotation by deciphering the multi-scale gene regulation code (Aim 2), including cell-type-
specific chromatin compartmentation, CREs and their target genes for functional interpretation, and
transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks (TRNs). Lastly, we will develop interpretable deep learning
models to link multi-scale dysregulations to ADRD with mechanistic explanation (Aim 3).
 This proposal is built on an existing multi-year collaboration among the Zhang, Won, and
Gerstein labs that originated from the ENCODE and PsychENCODE projects, with diverse expertise in
computer science, neuroscience, and genomics. Upon completion, our proposal will significantly
accelerate research in a broader scientific community by providing essential tools to investigate
functional regions in the genome and prioritize multi-scale risk factors for ADRD."
10903913,"Project Summary
Every 30s, someone in the world has a limb amputated, with approximately 2.1 million people
living with amputations in the U.S.A. Upper limb amputees traditionally use passive, body-pow-
ered, or electrically powered prostheses that use surface Electromyographic (EMG) signals from
intact muscles in the residual limb for movement and rely on visual and/or surrogate sensory
input. Advanced peripheral nervous (PN) system interfaces have been proposed as a viable
mechanism to improve the control by amputees by delivering naturalistic sensory feedback from
sensorized robotic prosthetics. Unfortunately, current neural interfaces suffer from common chal-
lenges such as electrode failure, signal deterioration over time, and unstable or problematic sen-
sory percepts (“stinging and tingling”) that remain a challenge. Our Hypothesis is that we can
obtain superior control over the somatosensory thalamus and cortex (S1/VPL), which will lead to
more controlled sensory percepts by using molecularly guided regenerative peripheral nerve con-
duits that entice cutaneous and proprioceptive axons down their respective molecularly cued arms
of a Y-shaped Regenerative Ultra-thin Multi-Electrode Interface (Y-MG-RUMEI) implanted at me-
dian nerve transections. As the Ultra-thin MEIs have much smaller electrode surface areas it is
hoped they will offer more local control and decrease excitation of large, possible unrelated, axons
in the peripheral nerve. Additionally, we will utilize optimized microstimulation (opMiSt) through
UMEIs embedded in the 2 branches of the Y with their molecular cues for touch and propriocep-
tion, respectively. Neural recordings will be made from the S1/VPL towards the optimization of
the peripheral MiSt.
 Three specific aims are included: SA1. Achieve selective MiSt from Y-MG-REMEIs with
Proprioceptive and Cutaneous conduits in a rat model. SA2. Determine controllability of VPL/S1
via MiSt in Y-MG-RUMEI sensory conduits in a rat forepaw (hand) amputee model. SA3. Deter-
mine if Y-MG-RUMEIs allow better bidirectional Brain-Nerve-Machine Interface (biBNMI) control,
as compared to control-RUMIs, without molecular guidance, based biBNMI performance in a rat
amputee model."
10903914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Annual vaccination remains the primary public health strategy to mitigate the burden of influenza infection, and
there is evidence that repeated influenza vaccination can affect the efficacy of the vaccine. This evidence arises
not only from multiple observational studies of vaccine effectiveness but also studies of immunogenicity,
including small trials. Understanding what causes influenza vaccines to be more or less effective in different
people and populations is critical to the rational deployment of existing vaccines and the development of universal
vaccines. But the causes of altered effectiveness and immunogenicity in repeat vaccinees are intrinsically difficult
to study in populations in which vaccination is universally recommended, because repeat vaccinees differ from
other vaccinees and non-vaccinees in important ways. These differences leave open the possibility of residual
confounding in infection and vaccination history, and thus make it difficult to identify the effects of vaccination
itself. We propose a randomized, clinical trial to investigate the effects of repeat vaccination and their underlying
immunological causes in an adult population with low vaccination coverage and no recommendation for influenza
vaccination. Approximately 820 adults in Hong Kong will be randomized into five groups, with one group
vaccinated the first year, and other groups receiving placebo (saline) injections; each year, another group will
start receiving the influenza vaccine, and will be vaccinated annually until the study ends after four years. This
design will allow comparison of vaccine responses and failures (infections) in the placebo, newly vaccinated,
and repeatedly vaccinated participants. Additionally, it will provide longitudinal samples of immune status and
influenza-specific responses over time, from which we will develop predictive models of the response to
vaccination and infection, including repeat vaccination. The proposed high-dimensional immunological profiling,
coupled with statistical approaches that can accommodate the complexity of the key hypotheses, should
maximize insight into the effects of repeated vaccination on seasonal influenza. The models will formalize,
evaluate, and extend current theory, and thus provide a quantitative basis for anticipating vaccine non-
responsiveness and improving vaccination strategies. Banked specimens will enable new hypotheses to be
tested in the future."
10903918,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women. Approximately 70% of BCs are estrogen
receptor (ER) positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Endocrine
therapy (ET) reduces recurrence risk and improves survival for many in this group. However, despite standard
of care and adjuvant ET, over 20% patients with ER+/HER2- BC experience metastatic recurrence in the years
to come, and virtually all patients with metastatic disease eventually experience disease progression on ET due
to intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms. There are currently no biomarkers that reliably identify which of
these advanced breast cancer patients will benefit from ET-based approaches so that chemotherapy could be
avoided or delayed. To address this unmet need, the objective of this proposal is to develop co-clinical
quantitative PET/CT imaging strategies integrated genoproteomic discovery to predict response to ET in patients
with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC). To that end, we will interface with a recently awarded phase
II multicenter Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) trial to assess the functional status of
estrogen receptor in patients with ER+/HER2- MBC. The U24 will have three specific aims: in Aim 1 we will
optimize animal modeling and the quantitative accuracy of PET imaging agents of response to ET in ER+/HER2-
BC patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). In Aim 2 we will implement optimal quantitative methods to predict
response to ET in ER+/HER2- and integrate with multi-scale genoproteomic data across the co-clinical trial. And
in Aim 3 we will populate content from the co-clinical investigation on a web-accessible research resource and
expand capabilities of co-clinical database (CCDB). In addition, high value multi-scale analytic data will be
generated, including whole exome sequencing (WES), RNASeq, pathology, and CODetection by indEXing
(CODEX) to characterize tumor heterogeneity. All data will be uploaded to an informatics resource available to
the co-clinical community to test new algorithms and mine for novel leads integrating imaging and multi-scale
analytic data to predict therapeutic response. Overall, this proposal aims to have a far-reaching and high impact
on the implementation of precision medicine in identifying, stratifying, and predicting response to ET+CDK4/6i in
patients with ER+/HER2- MBC, integrating quantitative imaging with genoproteomic discovery."
10904232,"Complex neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among others,
impose an enormous socioeconomic burden on families and on society. The pathobiological mechanisms are
largely unknown, and treatment options are limited and often incompletely effective. During the past decade,
advances in human genetics and next-generation sequencing, coupled with expanding cohort sizes, have
permitted the identification of thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for neuropsychiatric diseases.
Each disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could provide insights
into a biological mechanism that underlies the risk of disease in humans. However, the availability of data is not
synonymous with the presence of meaning. The challenge researchers are facing now is the derivation of
biological meaning post-GWAS. Particularly, more than 90% of the risk variants are found in the non-coding
regions of the human genome. Although the potential contribution of non-coding variants to complex human
diseases has long been speculated, it has been a major challenge to develop testable hypotheses to decipher
their role in disease etiology. Here, we propose to develop innovative multidisciplinary approaches to bridge the
gap between human genetics and experimental biology. The major hypothesis underlying the approach is that
epigenetic changes caused by non-coding variation in the cis-regulatory elements, particularly enhancers that
are platforms for sequence-specific transcription factor binding and can influence gene transcription over long
distance, may confer disease liability by disrupting gene expression. We aim to (i) annotate functionally distinct
enhancers in disease-relevant human neuronal subtypes generated by reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells,
(ii) apply the cutting-edge HiChIP technology to profile the promoter-enhancer interactions in neurons in resting
and active states, and identify the target genes of enhancers, finally, (iii) we will determine how disease-
associated variants affect enhancer activity in human neurons. Such effort will provide the foundation to map
and prioritize non-coding risk variants for future mechanistic studies. Especially, the enhancer-interactome
analysis performed in this study will provide a physical-interaction-based approach for the identification of
enhancer target genes in neurons. The information will lay the groundwork for developing testable hypotheses
to elucidate the molecular impact of risk variants in non-coding regions. Last but not least, determining how non-
coding risk variants disrupt activity-regulated gene expression in neuronal subtypes may uncover novel disease-
relevant biology not observed using the incomplete existing methodologies and resources (activity-responsive
enhancers are not possible to identify from post-mortem tissue). Once accomplished, the proposed work will
have broad impact on translating genetic discoveries into actionable biological hypotheses that can potentially
power a new round of development of novel therapeutics strategies for complex neuropsychiatric disorders."
10899949,"ABSTRACT
Emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic public health problem that is associated with negative effects on
psychiatric outcomes and a large global economic burden. The development of novel treatments for emotion
dysregulation that are effective across a wide range of psychiatric disorders is therefore an urgent need. A single
session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to enhance emotion regulation in people
with transdiagnostic emotion dysregulation. In these participants we are finding that induction of negative
emotion is associated with hyperactivity in the insula, a key salience network node; utilization of emotion
regulation skills is associated with downregulation of the insula; and functional connectivity strength between the
insula and the dlPFC, a central executive network node, is positively correlated with emotion dysregulation
severity. In a comparison group of non-clinical participants, utilization of emotion regulation skills is associated
with increased functional connectivity strength between the insula and the mPFC, a default mode network node.
These findings may reflect that dynamics between the salience and other large-scale prefrontal networks differ
between emotionally dysregulated and non-clinical participants. Therefore, I hypothesize that cortico-insular
connections are critically involved in emotion dysregulation and may be a mechanism for the therapeutic
response to neuromodulatory perturbation. A connectomic approach will be employed to determine how cortico-
insular connectivity is related to emotion dysregulation and affected by brain stimulation. Studies proposed may
advance scientific knowledge about the role of functional and structural insular networks in transdiagnostic
emotion dysregulation, leading to the refinement of individualized targets in neuromodulatory interventions. The
expertise of Sponsor Dr. Kevin LaBar, Ph.D. in emotion regulation neuroscience and Co-Sponsor Dr. Andrada
Neacsiu, Ph.D. in neuromodulatory interventions for emotion dysregulation will provide me with high-quality
scientific training. The skills and training proposed in this application will allow me to establish the foundation for
a physician-scientist career at the intersection of psychiatry and translational neuroscience."
10900044,"Abstract
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are emerging at an unprecedented rate due to cultural, biological,
environmental, climatic, and social changes. Historically, considerable attention has been paid to the role of
human-mediated transportation in the dispersal and emergence of arboviruses amplified by birds. However,
few studies have focused on the role of migratory birds as disseminators of these viruses. In most migratory
bird species, seasonal migration consists of a series of consecutive stops where birds rest and feed en route
to their final destination. Wetlands, due to their high stability and productivity, offer excellent habitat for
resident birds as well as stopover and hibernation sites for migratory birds. Consequently, both groups of birds
can reach exceptionally high densities in wetlands. Wetlands are also known to harbor a high density and
abundance of arbovirus vectors, particularly mosquitoes. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and West Nile
virus (WNV) are two mosquito-borne flaviviruses amplified by birds. WNV was introduced to the Americas in
1999 and rapidly spread throughout North, Central, and South America. On the other hand, SLEV is endemic
to the Americas. In our country, its role as a human pathogen emerged in 2002. Possibly due to competition
with WNV, SLEV activity decreased in most parts of the United States. However, in 2015, SLEV re-emerged in
the western United States. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the (re)emergent SLEV strain belonged to
genotype III, related to a strain isolated in Córdoba, Argentina Representing the first detection of this genotype
in the United States. Recently, we detected the closest common ancestor to the introduced strain in the United
States in a pool of Culex maxi mosquitoes collected in May 2014 in Laguna Mar Chiquita (LMC) in the
province of Córdoba, Argentina. Based on the hypothesis that wetlands represent a hub for exchange and
emigration of bird-borne arboviruses, we propose to characterize the network of vector-host-virus interactions
within MCL/BdRD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive characterization of a wetland
as a hub for arbovirus exchange between resident and migratory birds in the Americas.
This study will: i) identify host bloodmeals in wetland mosquitoes to elucidate the potential viral flow between
resident and migratory birds, ii) analyze the previous exposure of migratory and resident birds to SLE and WN
viruses using serosurveillance, to identify key hosts in transmission networks of these viruses, iii) identify
mosquito species infected with SLE and WN viruses that could potentially act as vectors for these viruses, iv)
describe the phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships of viral strains circulating in the wetland with
strains previously detected in the Americas region and v) evaluate the vector and host competence role of
Culex mosquito species and urban bird species. While aspects of these transmission cycles have been
studied, this will be the first time they have been integrated in a single, key habitat."
10900045,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gc) is the Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea, resulting in an estimated
87 million cases globally each year. Gonococcal disease can result in pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic
pregnancies, and infertility. Rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance and detrimental effects on human health and
fertility make gonorrhea an urgent threat. Additionally, adaptive humoral immunity to native Gc infections is weak
and short-lived, making vaccines against gonorrhea a current public health priority. Immune factors recruited to
Gc-infected tissues include neutrophils (PMNs) which combat Gc through phagocytosis/antimicrobial
compounds, and the complement (C’) cascade. C’ enhances phagocyte activation and bactericidal capacity and
promotes direct bacterial lysis via the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC). The efficiency of C’
effector functions is enhanced by pathogen-directed antibodies that activate the classical C’ cascade.
Underscoring the importance of C’ to control Neisseria infections, individuals with impaired C’ have a more than
1,000-fold increased risk of serious Neisseria infections. Yet, despite the importance of C’ to Neisseria
pathogenesis, we still have an incomplete understanding of how C’ contributes to control of Gc. Furthermore,
the exact mechanism by which the MAC kills Gc and other Gram-negative pathogens is incompletely elucidated.
Although the MAC only inserts within the outer membrane, inner membrane damage is required for MAC-
mediated killing. It has been proposed that the MAC serves as a pore in the outer membrane barrier through
which antibiotics and immunologic antimicrobials can transit, thereby enhancing antimicrobial access and
activity. In Aim 1, I will determine how C’ destabilizes Gc to potentiate the activities of antimicrobials with distinct
targets (periplasm, inner membrane, cytoplasm) and human PMNs. We will specifically test the contribution of
multimeric C9 in facilitating C’ potentiation activities by using C9-depleted and -replete serum, and through
vitronectin, a MAC-inhibiting protein in serum. Recent studies in humans show multivalent Serogroup B
meningococcal vaccines, such as 4CMenB (BEXSERO), confer protection against gonorrhea and generate
cross-reactive antibodies with bactericidal activity against Gc. In Aim 2, I will characterize the efficacy of human
4CMenB-elicited antibodies in combatting Gc in an integrated whole blood model system and identify the
contributing complement effector functions. Together, the research proposed in this F30 application will define
how C’ controls Gc and how this knowledge can be leveraged to advance the development of vaccines and
therapeutics against gonococcal disease. This research plan, along with professional development activities, will
provide me with the training and expertise to accomplish my overarching career goal of becoming a physician-
scientist leading an independent research program at the interface of microbial pathogenesis and host
responses."

 Fibrosing cardiac diseases cause 25% of deaths in the United States. Fibrosis is a key pathological
hallmark of nearly all cardiac diseases, including hypertensive heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart
disease, which is caused by myocardial infarction (MI). Across these fibrosing cardiac diseases, cardiac
fibroblasts are activated to deposit excessive extracellular matrix that causes organ dysfunction, including
diastolic dysfunction, arrythmias, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Despite the clinical burden of
cardiac fibrosis, especially after MI, the molecular mechanisms driving cardiac fibroblasts to produce excessive
scar tissue are unknown. Uncovering the pathophysiological mechanisms for cardiac fibrosis formation has the
potential to reveal novel drug targets to reduce cardiac fibrosis and improve cardiac function. The Research
Training Plan will investigate the molecular mechanisms for cardiac fibrosis formation after MI. Specifically, this
project will test the hypothesis that thinning of the ventricle wall after MI increases wall stress to activate
mechanotransduction pathways in cardiac fibroblasts to produce scar tissue. To investigate this hypothesis, this
project will combine innovative computational and experimental approaches, such as advanced imaging,
computational modeling, spatial transcriptomics, and animal models. Specific Aim 1 will spatially correlate tissue
fibrosis and wall stress after MI in mice by using 2D histology, 3D whole-organ imaging, and finite element
analysis. Specific Aim 2 will determine the spatial heterogeneity of cardiac fibroblast subpopulations after MI
using publicly available mouse spatial transcriptomics datasets. Specific Aim 3 will functionally test if mechano-
transduction pathways activate cardiac fibroblasts by using an in vitro fibroblast-seeded hydrogel stretch assay
and an in vivo mouse model of MI. In summary, the proposed studies will investigate a possible
pathophysiological mechanism for cardiac fibrosis formation after MI and may provide novel therapeutic targets
to treat patients after MI.
 Importantly, through this project, the applicant, John Lu, will gain diverse expertise in cutting-edge
experimental techniques, computational approaches, and scientific reasoning under the mentorship of global
fibrosis expert, Dr. Michael Longaker, and leading cardiovascular biologist, Dr. Kristy Red-Horse. Through his
training activities, John will also develop the professional and clinical skills to direct an independent laboratory
as a future physician-scientist investigator. Furthermore, Stanford University offers an outstanding environment
for innovative and collaborative research, with the necessary infrastructure and core facilities to ensure this
project’s success. In summary, the strong mentoring environment and fellowship training plan will prepare John
to be an independent physician-scientist investigator working at the frontiers of cardiovascular research."

10901291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately half of many mammalian genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences, which include Long
INterspersed Element-1 (L1). L1 utilizes its ORF2p protein to increase its copy number through a process known
as retrotransposition. Despite the abundance of L1 copies in their host genome, many steps in their
retrotransposition cycle including the exact functions of ORF2p and how ORF2p accesses chromatin for
integration are unknown. The annotated half of ORF2p includes the functional endonuclease (EN) and reverse
transcriptase (RT), which are required for retrotransposition. The unannotated half of ORF2p, which includes the
Cryptic region and C-terminus, are evolutionarily conserved among L1s from diverse species but lack homology
to other cellular proteins. The C-terminus is required for retrotransposition, but it has no known function. Progress
in understanding mechanisms underlying ORF2p functions in retrotransposition is impeded by the lack of an
ORF2p protein structure and the unknown functions of ORF2p Cryptic and C-terminus regions. Our lab also
discovered that L1 sequences contain multiple splice sites, which can impact their host through generation of
splice variants with cellular genes. However, how often the thousands of L1 inserts form chimeric transcripts with
host genes and how their incorporation influences the cellular transcriptome is unknown. Thus, there is a need
for comprehensive analysis of L1 contribution to splice variants in different species.
Our lab has generated novel genetic approaches to study the function of the unannotated ORF2p regions in
retrotransposition. We previously identified the Cryptic region of ORF2p and proposed for it to be a structural
anchor for EN and RT. Studies, including our own, have shown that both Cryptic and C-terminus are essential
for retrotransposition. Our preliminary data show that the C-terminus (1) interacts with the proposed structural
anchor, Cryptic and (2) interacts with histones. Our preliminary data also show that the L1 3′-end sequence is
incorporated into cellular splice variants through alternative splicing events. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that the C-terminus of ORF2p is essential for retrotransposition through its intra- and intermolecular
interactions and the incorporation of L1 3′end sequence into splice variants impacts the cellular transcriptome.
We propose two aims to evaluate these central hypotheses. Aim 1 investigates the sequence requirements
involved in C-terminus interactions with Cryptic and core histones and retrotransposition steps requiring these
interactions. Aim 2 investigates L1 3′-end sequence incorporation into chimeric splice variants and its impact on
gene expression. Our results will determine (1) functional role(s) of unannotated regions within ORF2p and (2)
an impact of L1 3′-end sequence on cellular transcriptome. Our results will generate a database of chimeric
transcripts containing L1 3′-end sequences in different species, which will be a valuable resource for identifying
chimeric proteins containing L1 ORF2p C-terminus. Overall, our findings will contribute to the knowledge of
mammalian retrotransposition and describe a novel impact of retrotransposons on cellular transcriptome."

Night or rotating schedules under shiftwork are unavoidable, especially in healthcare work. Shiftwork can disturb
circadian rhythms due to unusual light exposure and has been linked to many long-term negative health
outcomes such as cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disorders. Studying disturbances in circadian rhythms in
shift workers has proven challenging due to limitations in measuring circadian rhythms in humans under real-
world conditions. However, with recent developments in wearable sensors, we can now capture continuous,
remote, and longitudinal measurements of physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, breathing rate, biomechanics),
behavioral patterns (e.g., activity tracking), and other external stimuli (e.g., light exposure), enabling the
characterization of circadian disturbances and supporting identifying actionable strategies for shift workers to
regain and maintain internal synchrony. This proposal seeks to examine the impact of the coordination of central
and peripheral body clocks internally and with the external environment in the real-world. We hypothesize that
internal and external synchrony of the body’s clocks is critical for regaining stability after perturbations such as
shiftwork. In this proposal, we seek to develop a quantitative framework for assessing body clock synchrony in
the real-world using wearable sensors. In the long term, we seek to leverage this work to interrogate the impact
of the coordination of body clocks on health state and develop timely interventions to regain stability. To do this,
in Aim 1, I will improve circadian phase prediction algorithms using real-world light diets to enable the study of
circadian rhythms outside of the laboratory and in real-world settings. In Aim 2, I will assess internal synchrony
leveraging continuous, ambulatory monitoring of physiological signals and estimation of central clock phase to
develop a quantitative framework for measuring the coordination of central and peripheral body clocks. This will
enable deeper understanding of their coordination and contribution to recovery from disturbances. In Aim 3, I
will develop predictive algorithms using machine learning to enable the evaluation of light diets to improve
synchrony in shift workers to translate tools to empower them to maintain synchrony and reduce risk of long-
term negative health outcomes. Completing these aims and working in collaboration with my sponsor, Dr. Jamie
Zeitzer, and co-sponsor, Dr. Todd Coleman, will enable me to develop the skillset necessary to study disease
dynamics in the real-world using wearable sensors and pursue a future career as a robust, independent, and
interdisciplinary researcher. My sponsor and co-sponsor are well equipped to provide training in measuring
complex human physiological signals, developing engineering skills in statistical signal processing and
estimation theory, and communication and leadership skills to facilitate the translation of my work to a wider
audience. The support of my mentors as well as the plentiful resources and collaborative environment of the
Bioengineering PhD program and Stanford University are opportune for the successful completion of this work
and complementary training goals."
10901361,"Project Summary/Abstract
Unilateral cochlear implantation is the standard treatment for adults with bilateral moderate to profound
hearing loss, and it is estimated that up to 1.2 million Americans could benefit from cochlear implants (CIs).1
Bimodal hearing (CI in one ear and a hearing aid in the contralateral ear) is the most common CI listening
configuration.2 Yet, an increasing number of patients are pursuing a second CI.3 Currently, there are no
evidence-based criteria for when to recommend a second CI, resulting in a common clinical dilemma: should
this patient continue using bimodal hearing, or should a second CI be considered (i.e., transition from bimodal
hearing to bilateral CIs)? Previous attempts to provide evidence-based guidance on this clinical dilemma have
focused on performance-based auditory tasks such as speech recognition;4-7 however, recent evidence
suggests that patient report may have great utility when determining if bimodal hearing or bilateral CIs is right
for a particular patient.6 Despite recent findings, the patient-reported advantages and limitations of each
listening configuration have remained understudied, thus limiting the potential ability of patient-report in solving
the abovementioned clinical dilemma. Our preliminary data demonstrates unexplained patient-reported
differences between bimodal hearing and bilateral CIs, but that previously unknown information regarding the
benefits and limitations of each listening configuration can be uncovered using qualitative patient interviews.
Thus, the present study aims to determine the patient-reported advantages and limitations of bimodal hearing
versus bilateral CIs using a mixed methods approach and two research designs (within-subject and between-
subject). Aim 1 will compare bimodal hearing, bilateral CI, and bilateral candidates (bimodal patients scheduled
to receive a second CI) using clinically relevant Patient-Report Outcome Measures (PROMs) and results of
thematic coding obtained from qualitative patient interviews. Aim 2 will follow bilateral candidates through the
preoperative (bimodal hearing) and postoperative (bilateral CI) phases using the same measures described in
Aim 1 and will assess changes in patient-report across the two timepoints. Our preliminary data demonstrates
the feasibility of this project and supports our central hypothesis, that patient reporting can offer valuable
information about each listening configuration that can aid in differentiating the advantages and limitations of
bimodal hearing and bilateral CIs. The long-term goal of this project is to equip clinicians with an evidence-
based approach to counseling bimodal patients on the most beneficial listening configuration determined by
individual needs and expectations. The proposed project will provide hands-on training in mixed methods
research, advanced statistical analyses and interpretation, and help PI Lewis establish a unique line of
clinically relevant research, thus preparing her for a post-doctoral position at an academic institution."

Gene regulation is a highly complex process that involves the recruitment of numerous regulatory factors as well
as dynamic 3-dimensional spatial rearrangements of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules that are important for
quantitatively controlling the rate of gene regulation. Yet, how these various components interact simultaneously
and what their quantitative contributions are to gene regulation remains unresolved largely because of the lack
of methods that can integrate combinatorial molecular binding, spatial information, and quantitative
measurements of various aspects of gene regulation within the same individual cell. Here we will develop highly
innovative methods that will allow us to generate dynamic molecular movies that monitor the movement of DNA,
RNA. and protein molecules at high resolution in a manner that provides information about the spatial
arrangement of molecules along with simultaneous information about transcription rates and mRNA splicing
rates within single cells. To achieve this, we will develop pioneering new genomic methods for measuring the
spatial interactions of RNA, DNA, and protein with single cell capabilities and build novel quantitative and
computational modeling approaches to generate high resolution temporal “movies” from snapshots derived from
tens of thousands of synchronized single cells. We will use these approaches to quantitatively understand the
dynamic assembly of RNA-protein complexes, localization to DNA, and structural dynamics of genomic DNA
and how these integrated components impact gene regulation across time. Specifically, we will dissect the
dynamics of three RNA-mediated processes that link dynamic 3D nuclear structure and gene regulation in unique
regulatory paradigms in biology and disease: (i) chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing, (ii) kinetic coupling
of mRNA transcription and splicing, and (iii) RNA-induced aggregation and cellular toxicity in neurodegenerative
disorders. Together, the results of this proposal will generate highly innovative new approaches for quantitatively
measuring molecular and spatial dynamics of various regulators and their role in gene regulation."

During the last decade, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications have expanded to include
measurement of dynamic outcomes underlying genomic function in development and disease. Measurements
related to functional elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control gene
activity, are at the core of studies undertaken by large consortia and individual labs alike. These
measurements introduce levels of variability that give rise to data analytic challenges related to distinguishing
unwanted or uninterested sources of variability, from biologically relevant signals. Furthermore, new
technologies and improved data analytic ideas are giving rise to a need for new mapping algorithms to facilitate
deployment on increasingly larger datasets. While existing tools have provided effective ways to process and
analyze data in functional genomics studies, new technologies, more complex biological questions, and the
availability of increasingly complete datasets are posing new challenges. Single cell RNA-seq and single cell
ATAC-seq technologies in particular have introduced complexities that current tools are not optimized to
address.
Our team has extensive experience developing computational tools and statistical methodology for functional
genomics, disseminated as open source software. Many of our methods have become standards among users
of high-throughput technologies and are commonly included as part of standard pipelines. Combined, these
software packages receive hundreds of thousands of downloads each year and the papers describing the
methods have been cited tens of thousands of times. Furthermore, Dr. Irizarry (PI) is a leader in the
Bioconductor project, one of the most widely used open-source projects for the analysis of high-throughput
genomics data which has greatly facilitated the development and dissemination of our and others
state-of-the-art statistical methodologies.
We have identified three specific computational challenges urgently requiring new or improved solutions that
can greatly benefit from our expertise. Namely, we propose to develop: fast and accurate read mapping
specialized for count-focused sequencing data; develop a unified statistical approach for normalization and
downstream analysis​; ​developing computational tools to integrate scATAC-seq data with scRNA-seq and using
public data to facilitate annotation and functional interpretation. We plan to disseminate our tools via open
source software and provide a user friendly suite of packages that functional genomics researchers can use to
extract knowledge from their single cell RNA-seq or ATAC-seq data."

Dengue is a human disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus mosquitoes that afflicts hundreds of millions of humans, causes 20,000 confirmed human deaths
annually, and puts >3.6 billion people at risk. Temperature is well-documented to influence the traits of both
mosquitoes and DENV, exhibiting unimodal responses known as thermal performance curves (TPCs), thus
also altering R0 an important proxy of the population growth rate of pathogens and thus transmission.
Consequently, global climate change is expected to alter incidence and seasonal dynamics of dengue, and
ecologically relevant predictive models are essential to mitigate these changes to disease risk. In recent years,
my sponsor, co-sponsor, and colleagues have developed temperature-dependent, trait-based transmission
models for mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue), using a generalized R0 equation derived from the
classic Ross-Macdonald model. This predictive equation, however, is limited by the fact that temperature is the
sole abiotic factor considered, despite other widespread abiotic factors, such as insecticides, being well known
to impact traits of mosquitoes that affect transmission. My objective for this application is to develop and
parameterize this model for DENV transmission by A. aegypti with commonly deployed insecticides with an
overall goal of reducing dengue. My central hypothesis is that insecticides and temperature interact
synergistically or antagonistically, rather than additively, to affect the R0 of DENV. To test this hypothesis, I will
conduct response surface experiments crossing 5 insecticide doses of both the larvicide temephos and the
adulticide deltamethrin and 7 temperatures on juvenile and adult A. aegypti and DENV, and I will measure all
eight temperature-dependent parameters in the generalized R0 equation. Using Bayesian inference, I will fit
thermal performance curves to each trait across insecticide doses and implement these into the R0 equation.
Once these aims have been completed, I will have developed the first fully parameterized insecticide- and
temperature-dependent R0 model for dengue. The aim of this R0 model is to more accurately predict disease
incidence, identify the extent to which temperature impacts the efficacy of common insecticides, determine the
ideal climatic and seasonal conditions to deploy insecticides in, determine concentration levels required for
insecticides to control dengue in different regions, and determine how to respond to and leverage climate
change in the face of range shifts and expansions."
10900910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A critical gap in rotator cuff tear research is understanding why some individuals have a torn rotator cuff but are
free of symptoms, while others experience pain and dysfunction. Dr. Pozzi’s Katz R01 (parent project,
AR080058) approaches this problem by examining the neural and somatosensory aspects (neuroimaging,
central sensitization, psychosocial distress) of symptoms in well-characterized cohorts of symptomatic tears,
asymptomatic tears, and healthy controls (no tears, no pain). We have a unique window of opportunity to submit
an ancillary project that evaluates the musculoskeletal aspects of symptoms, specifically neuromuscular control
and glenohumeral joint health, in the same cohorts as the parent project. The high prevalence of individuals with
asymptomatic rotator cuff tears as well as the success of some conservative exercise interventions for
symptomatic tears suggests neuromuscular control strategies can mitigate symptoms. However, since the
anatomical integrity of the torn tendon is not restored, to what extent previously identified changes of
neuromuscular control are adaptive versus pathological remains unknown. Current investigation on the
interaction between rotator cuff tears and glenohumeral joint health are limited to murine models, radiographic
imaging studies, and studies characterizing end-stage disease (i.e., co-presence of massive tears and
glenohumeral osteoarthritis). We will advance this prior work through three aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the
interrelationship between neuromuscular control and symptom expression in individuals with rotator cuff tears
by simultaneously measuring shoulder motion (including scapular motion) and electromyography (EMG) of
shoulder muscles (including intramuscular EMG of rotator cuff muscles) during functional tasks. In Aim 2, we will
elucidate the interrelationship between neuromuscular control, symptom expression, and shoulder joint health
in individuals with rotator cuff tear using static (magnetic resonance imaging to characterize cartilage) and
dynamic (musculoskeletal simulations to calculate glenohumeral joint forces) measures. In Aim 3, we will explore
potential treatment targets by leveraging recent advances in explainable artificial intelligence to evaluate the
relative contributions of various organ systems to rotator cuff symptoms. The organ systems evaluated in the
parent (nervous and somatosensory systems) and ancillary (musculoskeletal system) projects will be explicitly
studied. Completing this ancillary project will advance our knowledge of the musculoskeletal factors that
influence patient outcomes. Integrated analyses of the musculoskeletal (ancillary), neural (parent), and
somatosensory (parent) contributions to symptom expression will further elucidate the biological mechanisms
driving outcomes, thereby aiding the identification of rotator cuff tear phenotypes and treatment targets."
10901113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a double-stranded-DNA, enveloped virus that infects most of the global
population by establishing lifelong latent infections. It poses the greatest risk, however, to the
immunocompromised and is the leading cause of congenital birth defects in the US and Europe. Much of its
success as a pathogen stem from its efficient entry mechanism and immune evasion tactics.
 To enter target cells, HCMV requires glycoprotein B (gB), the membrane fusogen that functions by refolding
from the metastable prefusion to the stable postfusion form. While the involvement of gB in entry is clear, we do
not yet fully understand how each form contributes to the anti-HCMV host immune response. It is known that
HCMV gB is a major target of the humoral immune response and elicits antibodies (Abs), but a vast majority of
these Abs are non-neutralizing. Moreover, known anti-gB neutralizing (n) Abs bind both pre- and postfusion
forms. Such lack of specificity may render them less effective. However, studies in other viruses, such as
respiratory syncytial virus, have identified prefusion-specific antibodies with strong neutralization and protection
properties. Therefore, HCMV prefusion-gB-specific Abs may exist and have potential to be highly potent and
protective. However, isolation of these Abs has long been hindered by an inability to stabilize prefusion gB.
 We have engineered a soluble, prefusion-stabilized gB (s-gBpre) and I have verified that at a low resolution it
structurally resembles native gBpre. Additionally, our collaborators have isolated new Abs specific to s-gBpre.
However, it is not clear whether s-gBpre recapitulates native gBpre epitopes and if these new Abs have neutralizing
properties. Based on preliminary data, I hypothesize that s-gBpre is a promising reagent for the development of
Ab-based anti-HCMV therapeutics because it represents the active form of the fusogen with epitopes ideally
presented for development of robust neutralizing and protective antibodies. In Aim 1, I will determine the high-
resolution structure of s-gBpre by cryo-EM, alone and bound to known nAbs, to validate it and identify the epitopes
with the highest antigenic potential. In Aim 2, I will isolate and characterize new anti-gBpre Abs and examine their
binding to s-gBpre. This proposal is innovative because it describes the first engineered s-gBpre to isolate new
anti-HCMV nAbs. It is significant because long term, the epitope mapping of prefusion-gB will aid in developing
a gB-based immunogen for the first HCMV vaccine, and to isolate neutralizing and protective anti-HCMV
monoclonal Abs.
 In addition to its potential to make major contributions to the development of anti-HCMV therapeutics, this
proposal will provide me with extensive training towards my development into a premier scientist. My sponsor,
Dr. Ekaterina Heldwein, and collaborator, Dr. Andrew McGuire, will ensure that throughout this project, I acquire
the necessary skills for the successful completion of the proposed work and, in the future, for my successful
career as an independent investigator."

The main objective of this proposal is to understand how neutrophils migrate across the intestinal
epithelia, toward the eventual goal of manipulating this process in pathologic conditions where it
can become excessive as in the context of idiopathic inflammatory intestinal disease as well as
enteric bacterial infection. In particular, occurrence and severity of colitis appears to be correlated
with the extent of neutrophil transmigration across the colonic epithelium and recent studies have
shown that neutrophil migration can incite the migration of other cells that mediate inflammation.
Thus, neutrophil transepithelial migration and accumulation at mucosal surfaces is a hallmark of
many inflammatory conditions, and this process correlates directly with clinical disease activity
and epithelial injury. Currently, the mechanisms that define neutrophil-epithelial interactions
during an inflammatory response are not completely understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, we
have uniquely shown that secretion of the eicosanoid hepoxilin A3 (HxA3) through the apically
expressed efflux pump known as MRP-2 establishes the chemotactic gradient across the
intestinal epithelium that is required for neutrophils from the submucosal space to move into the
colonic lumen at times of inflammation. Additionally, we identified the N-acyl ethanolamine (NAE)
class of eCBs to function in suppressing neutrophil transepithelial migration, and that these
molecules are secreted through the apical efflux pump known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We
hypothesize that these pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways communicate to provide a
responsive, integrated mechanism to control inflammation status and that these are dysregulated
in disease settings. To test this central hypothesis, we aim to identify the HxA3 receptor(s) on the
cell surface of neutrophils (Aim 1), determine the nature of NAE-type ECBs/P-gp and HxA3/MRP2
signaling (Aim 2), and to explore crosstalk points between these two pathways that drive the
inflammatory function of neutrophils (Aim 3). Successful completion of these Aims will provide a
consolidated picture of mechanisms controlling neutrophil transmigration across the intestinal
epithelium that will lead to both novel biological principles and therapeutic intervention strategies."

The goal of this proposal is to develop novel PARP inhibitor nanomedicine and a companion PET biomarker for
treatment of prostate cancer. Despite recent advances, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer remains
a lethal, incurable disease with poor outcomes. Recently, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated great promise in
this disease in patients bearing enabling mutations. We have developed a novel nanomedicine, star-PEG-TLZ4,
with a cleavable linker which enhances delivery of talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, to tumors while reducing
potential toxicity. We have also developed a cognate molecular imaging tool, [89Zr]DFO-star-PEG-TLZ3, which
enables imaging of the delivery of this nanomedicine. In this proposal, we develop [89Zr]DFO-star-PEG-TLZ3 and
star-PEG-TLZ4 as novel imaging agent and drug combination in prostate cancer. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that the star-PEG backbone will enable enhanced delivery of PARP inhibitors and the
imaging agent to prostate cancer, both in animal models as well as in a pilot translational study.
In order to test this hypothesis, we have assembled an experienced team of chemists, imaging scientists,
physicists, and physicians to evaluate this method in preclinical models and to perform initial feasibility testing in
men with metastatic prostate cancer. In specific aim 1, we test the biodistribution of [89Zr]DFO-star-PEG-TLZ3 in
prostate cancer preclinical models including patient derived xenografts. In specific aim 2, we test if [89Zr]DFO-
star-PEG-TLZ3 can serve as a companion biomarker of star-PEG-TLZ4 mediated talazoparib delivery, and test
the efficacy of star-PEG-TLZ4 in prostate cancer models bearing enabling mutations. In specific aim 3, we
perform a translational study in men with prostate cancer, to determine the feasibility of star-PEG mediated drug
delivery and imaging in men with that disease. These experiments will help aid the development and
implementation of star-PEG mediated PARPi delivery, thereby improving patient care for men with prostate
cancer."

Great variation exists in opioid consumption after similar surgeries, with some patients using few opioids while
others consume opioids well beyond the expected acute pain episode. Prolonged opioid use is considered one
of the most common surgical complications. Recent models developed to predict the variability in postoperative
opioid use focus primarily on clinical and psychological survey data, but leave a significant proportion of the
variability unexplained. As it is unclear whether prolonged opioid use results from prolonged pain or other
factors, this project proposes to extend the previous research by prospectively examining important pain
sensitivity and biomarker predictors of pain to determine their effect on opioid use. Pain is a biopsychosocial
phenomenon, so the inclusion of these important biological variables will lead to increased mechanistic
understanding of postoperative opioid consumption variability and enable better management of postoperative
pain by providing potential new therapeutic targets. One such understudied variable is an individual’s
underlying pain sensitivity, measurable by quantitative sensory testing (QST). Use of QST to predict inpatient
opioid use and pain has led to inconsistent findings, but recent studies highlight a promising role for QST to
predict postoperative home opioid use. Speculation has long focused on genetic influences as a factor in
variability in pain sensitivity and opioid use. Candidate gene and whole genome-wide studies have proven to
be inadequate to study the complex trait of pain, resulting in small effect sizes and lack of reproducibility.
Assessing gene expression is an approach that can be used to augment the research on postoperative pain.
Gene expression analyses in blood have identified changes that confer vulnerability for the transition from
acute to chronic low back pain, lending support to the hypothesis that changes in gene expression from
preoperative to early and later postoperative time periods may identify early markers for the transition to
prolonged postoperative pain. By integrating genetic and gene expression data, we will assess whether acute
surgical pain leaves signatures in the blood that can be identified through gene expression which can influence
postoperative pain sensitivity and subsequent opioid use. Our proposal focuses on the total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) population, as this population demonstrates one of the highest variabilities in postoperative pain and
opioid use, and is projected to increase 700% within the near future. This project proposes to innovatively
incorporate standard demographic, clinical, and psychological variables with novel neurophysiological, genetic,
and gene expression data to holistically examine the variability in postoperative pain, and ultimately opioid use
through the biopsychosocial lens."

HIV is more common among underrepresented minority adolescents and young adults (AYA, 13–24 years old)
in the United States. Low uptake of HIV prevention services suggests a missed opportunity for implementing
evidence-based interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and sexually transmitted infection
testing among this important population. Most research institutions in the United States have limited
opportunities for AYA training, mentorship, and capacity building activities. Over the past three years, our multi-
disciplinary team organized AYA implementation HIV research as part of ITEST, Innovative Tools for
Expanding HIV Self-Testing. This study uses crowdsourcing methods and implementation science strategies to
develop innovative HIV self-testing services for AYA. Crowdsourcing has a group of people solve all or part of
a problem, then implement exceptional ideas. Our study discovered that crowdsourcing methods could also be
used to help identify highly qualified trainees through open calls, build capacity for youth-led research using
hackathons, and sustain these benefits through participatory learning communities. These approaches break
new ground in HIV training using participatory methods that will help AYA to become junior leaders while
building institutional capacity for AYA HIV research. Extending from this strong foundation, we propose the
“Stimulating Training and Access to HIV Research Experiences” (STAR) Institute. The project brings together a
highly qualified group of research mentors at Saint Louis University, UNC Chapel Hill, Georgia State
University, Texas A&M, and Wake Forest University. Specific aims of this project include: 1) identify and recruit
underrepresented minority AYA interested in HIV research for STAR Institute; 2) develop crowdsourcing and
implementation research capacity at participating US institutions; 3) initiate and sustain enduring AYA research
capacity through a digital participatory learning community. Each year we will identify 10 trainees who will join
our intensive six-week summer training program and a year-long virtual learning community. The proposed
R25 training program complements existing training opportunities and will provide unique resources to build
capacity for AYA studies, implementation research, and crowdsourcing."

Sepsis, defined as a dysregulated host response to infection, is responsible for 75,000 childhood
hospitalizations annually in the United States and 50% of inpatient pediatric deaths worldwide. Despite
multiple trials, there are no targeted therapies for adult or pediatric sepsis, and supportive care with timely
antibiotics and fluid resuscitation remains the mainstay of therapy. Fluid therapy is a cornerstone of sepsis
resuscitation, although the choice of fluid remains controversial. Recent trials in adults showed lower rates of
major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE30) with balanced crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer’s
(LR), relative to normal saline (NS). MAKE30 is a composite endpoint incorporating persistent kidney
dysfunction, initiation of dialysis, or death. Balanced solutions like LR have a composition more similar to
normal human serum, whereas NS has been associated with worse kidney function, albeit via unclear
mechanisms. While much of pediatric sepsis management is extrapolated from adults, children have a distinct
epidemiology and outcome profile, making application of adult data problematic. Thus, to specifically assess
whether LR or NS resuscitation improves MAKE30 in children, the PRagMatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced
versus nOrmaL Saline FlUid in Sepsis (PRoMPT BOLUS) was undertaken, with planned enrollment of 8,800
children. However, heterogeneity has contributed to negative trials in sepsis, as therapies effective in some
patients are ineffective in others. To mitigate this heterogeneity, biomarkers have been proposed for both risk
stratification and identification of sub-phenotypes with shared pathophysiology. Our study, entitled Finding
Appropriate Subtypes in a Trial of Balanced versus nOrmaL Saline FlUid in Sepsis (FAST BOLUS), will assess
for heterogeneity of treatment effect of LR versus NS in the PRoMPT BOLUS trial. Leveraging our group’s
extensive experience with biomarker-defined risk stratification and sub-phenotyping, we will measure plasma
biomarkers in 800 children collected at randomization and assess the for differential effects of fluid assignment
on MAKE30 across risk strata using two separate biomarker-based mortality prediction models (Aim 1).
Additionally, we will test for differential effects of fluid assignment on MAKE30 after stratifying subjects
according to one of two biomarker-defined inflammatory sub-phenotypes (Aim 2). Lastly, we will leverage this
biobank to investigate potential mechanisms between fluid choice and MAKE30 by measuring markers of
endothelial cell (angiopoietin-2) and endothelial glycocalyx (syndecan-1) damage (Aim 3). These Aims will
assess the utility of established biomarker-based strategies for prognostic (Aim 1) and predictive enrichment
(Aim 2) strategies by leveraging an ongoing pediatric sepsis trial, which is a necessary analysis of randomized
trials conducted in heterogeneous critical illness syndromes. Successful completion of the Aims will provide
evidence for personalized fluid resuscitation in pediatric sepsis and establish proof of concept data for
incorporation of biomarker-based methods to reduce heterogeneity in future trials."

Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies in the United
States. While OC is immunogenic and increased infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) correlates with
longer survival, single agent checkpoint inhibitors are largely ineffective in the relapsed/refractory setting. Our
long-term goal is to develop novel approaches to overcome obstacles to durable antitumor immunity to make
immunotherapy more effective. Our results point to previously unrecognized mechanisms for mature
neutrophils acquiring a suppressor phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Neutrophil
suppressors inhibited stimulated proliferation of circulating naïve, central memory, and effector memory T cells,
and of tumor-associated lymphocytes (TAL) from patients with newly diagnosed OC. Induction of the neutrophil
suppressor phenotype required complement signaling and NADPH oxidase activation. A similar complement-
dependent neutrophil suppressor phenotype was induced by ascites from patients with recurrent OC and from
malignant effusions from patients with a number of metastatic cancers, underscoring the generalizability of our
findings. These results in human samples and work by others in tumor-bearing mice support targeting
complement to enhance anti-tumor immunity. We will evaluate APL-2, a peptide C3 inhibitor, in a randomized
phase 2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent OC and persistent malignant effusions. APL-2 was safe and
superior to eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and is FDA-approved for this
indication; it’s use in cancer is novel. Following a safety lead-in, patients will be randomized to the following
cohorts: (i) bevacizumab (anti-VEGF); (ii) APL-2 + pembrolizumab (anti-PD1); and (iii) APL-2 + pembrolizumab
+ bevacizumab. Specific Aim 1: To evaluate safety and control of malignant effusions as primary endpoints
and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall
survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) as secondary endpoints. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of
APL-2-based therapy in modulation of immune responses in the TME. Patient samples (blood, effusion, tumor)
will be collected at baseline and at pre-specified time points during the trial. We will test the extent that APL-2
will abrogate neutrophil suppressor activity and expand activated T cells in the TME. A combination of
functional studies and transcriptional and mass cytometry profiling of circulating and ascites neutrophils and T
cells will be performed. The impact of our proposal is to gain safety and preliminary efficacy data on APL-2-
based regimens in recurrent OC with malignant effusions and a detailed understanding of how these regimens
modulate the immune landscape in the TME. This research is expected to establish the foundation for larger
randomized trials to definitively test the efficacy of C3 inhibition in enhancing cancer immunotherapy."

Tungsten is an emerging toxicant, due to increased human exposure, yet limited knowledge of the human
health risks. One large research gap is our lack of knowledge of the carcinogenic/tumorigenic risks of tungsten
exposure. Importantly, a few in vivo studies do suggest that tungsten can enhance tumor promotion. However,
more research is needed to determine which forms and routes of exposure of tungsten can drive tumorigenesis
and the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms of action. An accidental exposure of breast cancer patients
to tungsten following experimental radiotherapy, prompted us to investigate the role of tungsten on breast
cancer progression and metastasis, by conducting an animal study using an aggressive orthotopic mammary
cancer mouse model. Oral tungstate exposure enhanced breast cancer metastasis to the lung and increased
growth at the metastatic site. Interestingly, tungsten-enhanced metastasis was associated with enhanced
stroma in the tumor microenvironment, importantly, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that are known to
drive tumor progression. Our research identified, for the first time, a potential cellular mechanism of action for
tungsten-enhanced tumor promotion. However, what role the CAFs plays in this complex process remains to
be elucidated. This proposal will use a novel, integrative approach to investigate when and how tungsten
targets the tumor microenvironment to promote breast cancer. AIM 1 I will evaluate how different forms of
tungsten (oral tungstate, inhaled tungsten carbide and implantation tungsten metal fragments) target the tumor
microenvironment to affect breast cancer progression from initiation to metastasis. I will extend my initial
findings to determine how different forms of tungsten alter breast cancer development, growth and metastasis
to multiple sites including lung, liver, bone, and brain. AIM 2, I will measure CAF activation following tungsten
exposure in vitro. I will address the following questions. Can tungsten enhance CAF activation from stromal
precursors? Do tungsten-exposed CAFs enhance tumor cell invasion, growth, and immune cell recruitment?
And, does tungsten alter tumor cell cues to enhance CAF activation and/or recruitment? Finally, in AIM 3 I will
test the impact of tungsten-altered CAFs to enhance metastasis in an in vivo model. I will determine if
tungsten-altered CAFs promote metastasis and growth in the lung niche by answering the following questions.
What is the source of tungsten-enhanced CAFs in the lung niche? Do CAFs from the lung niche of tungsten-
exposed tumor-bearing mice have an altered cytokine/chemokine profile? And, are CAFs critical mediators of
tungsten-enhanced lung metastasis? Completion of this proposal will extend our toxicological knowledge of
tungsten to determine how different forms of tungsten impact breast cancer progression and define the role of
the tumor microenvironment, particularly CAFs in tungsten-enhanced breast tumorigenesis. This work will also
identify a novel cellular mechanism of action that can expand our knowledge of how environmental toxicant
can drive tumorigenesis and develop new therapeutic interventions."

Arsenic is a major factor for increased risk of several human health problems, including cancers of the liver, 
urinary tract, skin, and lung, among which lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality. Particulate 
arsenic trioxide (pATO) is frequently observed as a component of ambient particulate matter (PM), specifically 
in dust arising from unremediated surface mine sites and tailings piles, both of which are common in the 
southwestern US. Soluble arsenite ingestion and low-solubility pATO inhalation both lead to an increased risk 
of lung cancer development. Although pATO inhalation is an exposure route more relevant to lung 
carcinogenesis, there are very few studies investigating the biological impact of pATO. Moreover, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced lung carcinogenesis remain unknown. Previous studies 
exploring the carcinogenic properties of soluble arsenic may significantly underestimate the human health risks 
associated with pATO inhalation. The long-term goal of this work is to provide quantitative information for risk 
assessment and to facilitate prevention of the adverse health effects of inhaled particulate arsenic in human 
populations. The aim of the current proposal is to elucidate the carcinogenic mechanisms of pATO exposure. 
Our preliminary findings reveal that at the same concentration, pATO generates significantly more reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and yields higher DNA damage than soluble arsenic. Thus, we hypothesize that 
particulate arsenic has greater potential to incite lung carcinogenesis than soluble arsenic through combination 
effects of oxidative stress; DNA damage and DNA repair inhibition. Moreover, our preliminary results confirm, 
for the first time, that exposure to arsenic at an environmentally relevant level is sufficient to generate a unique 
spectrum of somatic mutations on the genome. The current proposal aims to analyze mutational signatures 
arising from pATO exposure as the readout of mutational processes and subsequent operative repair 
processes. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To assess the higher potency of pATO 
in terms of ROS induction and oxidative DNA damage. Aim 2: To analyze mutational signatures of pATO 
exposure and DNA repair mechanisms including alterations in DNA binding sequence specificity of DNA repair 
proteins such as PARP-1. Aim 3: To evaluate the transformation and mutagenicity effect of chronic particulate 
arsenic exposure in lung epithelial cells using whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify mutations and 
deletions on protein-coding genes associated with transformation. Successful completion of these aims will 
improve our scientific knowledge of particulate arsenic-induced lung carcinogenesis by identifying cell specific 
mutational signatures and their causes, including synergistic actions of oxidative stress, DNA damage, and 
DNA repair inhibition."
10883591,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in US. Understanding the
mechanisms of CRC development is essential to improve treatment. Increased tissue iron in both mice and
humans is associated with increased colon tumorigenesis. However, the precise mechanisms for how iron
contributes to colon carcinogenesis are still unclear. The metabolic differences between normal and cancer
cells are being interrogated to uncover potential new therapeutic approaches. Many tumor cells exhibit
increased glucose consumption, glutamine metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. This proposal will test the
central hypothesis that iron-driven cellular metabolic reprograming promotes DNA synthesis and colon
tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on: 1) iron supplement increases, whereas chelation of iron by
deferoxamine (DFO) inhibits the growth and cell proliferation of patient-derived CRC colonoids; 2) treating mice
with high-iron diet increases, while low-iron diet decreases colon tumor multiplicity, incidence and progression;
3) metabolomics analysis reveals that excess iron impacts glucose-stimulated nucleotide synthesis by
promoting hypoxia-independent “Warburg-like effect” and fueling pentose phosphate pathway in colonoids; 4)
iron restriction by DFO leads to glutamine accumulation and reduction of metabolites in nucleotide biosynthesis
pathways in colonoids. Based on these observations, the proposal will test the following three Specific Aims: 1)
Define the mechanism by which excess iron affects glucose-stimulated DNA biosynthesis in CRC; 2) Study the
impact of iron restriction on glutamine-dependent nucleotide synthesis in CRC; 3) Characterize the role of a
DNA polymerase in iron-regulated nucleotide metabolism and CRC. We will utilize highly clinic-relevant CRC
patient-derived colonoid culture, metabolomics analysis, and various animal models. Accomplishing the above
Aims will provide precise molecular mechanisms for how tumor cells are adapted to iron signal to synthesize
nucleotides for facilitating tumor proliferation. These studies will fill our knowledge gap of how iron regulates
CRC growth and progression."
10883593,"Project Summary:
 Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) is the fifth most common malignancy of the GI tract and the most common in
the human biliary tree. Approximately 4,000-5,000 new cases of GBC are diagnosed in the United States
annually. Survival outcomes are dismal with only ~8% 5-year survival rate, making it one of the deadliest
cancers. GBC has a distinct geographical incidence pattern with global hotspots. These hotspots include
countries like Chile, Bolivia, India and the state of New Mexico (NM) in the United States. GBC incidence is
abnormally high among the “minority-majority” Native Americans (5-8 fold higher) and Hispanics (2-4 fold
higher) compared to Caucasians living in New Mexico. The reasons underlying GBC incidence disparities in
NM is unknown and there are critical gaps in our understanding of gallbladder carcinogenesis.
 We postulate environmental heavy metal exposure is the key risk factor responsible for GBC disparities
seen among minorities of NM. The southwestern United States (NM, AZ, UT and NV) has a long environmental
legacy of abandoned heavy metal mines. These mines are usually found in close proximity to a significant
number of socio-economically disadvantaged Native American and Hispanic communities of NM. To prove our
GBC hypothesis, we propose the use of New Mexican patient derived gallbladder epithelial cell lines in this
proposal. Aim 1 will use post-surgical gallbladder samples to determine the somatic mutational landscapes and
key molecular drivers of GBC in an ethnicity and gender dependent manner. Aim 2 will determine the impact of
exposures of two metals of significance in New Mexico, uranium and cadmium, on the GB phosphoproteomic
cell signaling dysregulation. In particular, we will focus on the role of metal exposure driven PI3K-Akt and
MAPK signaling pathway alterations. Aim 3 will determine the effects of cadmium and uranium exposure on
gallbladder epithelial barrier disruption and wound healing as a mechanistic explanation of GBC disparities
seen in NM. Aim 3 will confirm, for the first time, the role of metal induced disruption of the GB epithelial barrier
causing chronic transmural inflammation which is a well-known prerequisite of gallbladder carcinogenesis.
 Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms of gallbladder carcinogenesis using
innovative, high-throughput bioinformatics approaches. This basic science proposal deeply informs the
translational clinical initiatives currently underway in our lab. Finally, this proposal will also provide a firm
scientific basis to enable preventative, population based screening measures to alleviate GBC disparities seen
in Native American and Hispanic communities of New Mexico."

Next-generation sequencing is ubiquitous in the study of biology and disease. The ﬁrst step when analyz-
ing a sequencing dataset is read alignment: the process of determining where each snippet of sequencing
data (“read”) came from with respect to a reference genome. Currently, genomics research is hampered
by the use of a single, arbitrary reference. This fails to account for the vast genetic diversity that exists
among humans and model organisms. Further, it can result in “reference bias,” in turn leading to false or
misleading scientiﬁc results.
 We propose a three-aim project that addresses the reference bias problem on multiple fronts. In
Aim 1, we will develop new methods and a new software tool called biastools for summarizing and
visualizing reference bias. In Aim 2, we will develop new software and methods that address reference
bias by enabling alignment to multiple representative reference genomes. In one subproject, we will use
genotype imputation to infer a personalized genome with the help of a large panel of reference haplotypes.
In a second subproject, we will use small collections of representative genomes connected in a “ﬂow
graph,” so that reads are ultimately analyzed with respect to the most appropriate reference. The methods
described in both subprojects will be implemented as part of a new software tool called pals. Also as part
of this aim, we will release a software library and tool called jector for transforming alignments from one
reference coordinate system to another. Finally, for Aim 3, we apply a novel text-indexing method called
r-index to enable alignment of reads to large panels of reference haplotypes. We will release the software
as a software library and tool called pandex.
 Successful completion of the project will provide the community with new methods and references
that leverage the genetic information we are gleaning from large-scale genotyping studies and from new
long-read assemblies. All software will be made available under an open source license."
10893006,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain cancer, with inherent or adaptive resistance to all
existing treatments. One important mechanism by which GBM develops resistance to temozolomide, the
frontline chemotherapy used in its treatment, stems from mutations in genes such as MSH6 and MSH2 critical
in DNA mismatch repair (MMR)—a mechanism found in colon and other cancers as well. These MMR-deficient
GBMs become hypermutated and particularly aggressive as well as resistant to many chemotherapies, and
there is a pressing need to identify therapies that are effective against them. While a recent report describes
two cases of pediatric MMR-deficient, hypermutated GBM that responded to immunotherapeutic checkpoint
inhibitors, our own and others’ clinical experience has uniformly indicated a lack of responses in adult patients
with MMR-deficient, hypermutated GBM treated with these agents. This proposal tests novel therapeutic
approaches to MMR-deficient, hypermutated GBMs and uses unique tools to do so. Our preliminary studies
expand on prior reports suggesting possible activity of calcium channel inhibition against MMR-deficient
cancers to show for the first time that combining inhibitors of different calcium channels—carboxyamidotriazole
(CAI), mibefradil, and verapamil—has preferential and synergistic activity against MMR-deficient GBM lines
versus parental lines. In addition, our preliminary results further suggest TGF-β as a potential target in this
setting, and that the chemotherapy drug irinotecan and the anti-cholesterol statins can be repurposed as TGF-
β inhibitors with preferential activity against MMR-deficient GBM. These therapeutic strategies are being tested
against matched sets of GBM lines that each include a parental line and an MMR-deficient line derived from it,
as well as sets of GBM lines that spontaneously developed MMR deficiency and control GBM lines. The MMR-
deficient lines each have MSH6 or MSH2 insufficiency derived either from mutations secondary to in vivo
temozolomide treatment or from stable expression of shRNA. This proposal will use these matched
parental/MMR-deficient GBM lines to test the effects of calcium channel blockade combinations and TGF-β
inhibition in vitro and in vivo. In addition, given that MMR deficiency and hypermutation and both therapeutic
approaches are likely to impact the anti-GBM immune response, we will also develop an immunocompetent
mouse model of MMR-deficient GBM to test these effects. Both targeted and unbiased studies of mechanism
will be performed, including assessing connections between the two therapeutic strategies and
phosphoproteomic and RNA-seq analyses. The proposed studies will yield new biologic and therapeutic
insights that could rapidly impact the treatment of MMR-deficient, hypermutated GBM and other cancers."
10893009,"Mammalian development results in the specification of over 200 different cell types from a single genome, with
subsequent maintenance of cell identity in adult organisms. The genomes of eukaryotic cells are packaged into
a dynamic chromatin structure, which allows cells to control the accessibility of all DNA encoded information.
The selective incorporation of specialized histone proteins, or variants, into this dynamic genomic structure is
an important feature of epigenetic regulation. A main focus of my lab is one such protein, the histone variant
H3.3. The identification of mutations in H3.3 and associated proteins in human cancers and developmental
disorders has heightened the pressing need to understand the role of this histone variant in normal
development and adult homeostasis. Although H3.3 is critical to cellular function in multiple contexts, how H3.3
contributes uniquely to chromatin function is a long-standing, unanswered question in the field. While long
associated with gene activation, recent studies establish that H3.3 also deposited at repetitive, heterochromatic
regions of the genome, with deposition at each region facilitated by independent chaperone complexes. We
still do not know how H3.3 is partitioned between its two chaperone complexes, or how this equilibrium
influences cellular function. Once deposited, our studies and others have demonstrated that H3.3 influences
the chromatin modification landscape at both euchromatin and heterochromatin. Our data suggest that H3.3
can perform this function directly at euchromatin via phosphorylation of a unique serine that influences the
activity of a histone acetyltransferase or indirectly at heterochromatin through chaperone-mediated recruitment
of a co-repressor complex. Despite these intriguing observations, we do not yet fully understand the detailed
mechanisms by which H3.3 deposition influences chromatin states. Finally, we do not understand how H3.3
performs its myriad functions in the context of complex, multicellular organisms. The goals of this proposal are
to: (1) understand how H3.3 chaperone complex equilibrium is established, and determine the effects of
disequilibrium on cell function, (2) determine the molecular mechanisms by which H3.3 influences local
chromatin landscapes, and how these events influence downstream genome usage, and (3) make use of our
novel mouse models to understand the role of H3.3 in adult organisms, including adult stem cells. Our
proposed research is significant because it will serve as a platform to understand epigenetic regulation of cell
identity in both normal development and adult homeostasis, and by extension, developmental misregulation
and disease states."
10893491,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
500,000 people in the United States suffer from a cardiac arrest every year. Many patients may be initially
resuscitated from the arrest but go on to die later in the hospital or to have a poor neurologic outcome from
cerebral ischemia. The primary medication used during cardiac arrest care, epinephrine, has been proven to
improve the chance that the heart will restart, but there is developing evidence that it makes neurologic
outcomes worse due to vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature. New therapies that can improve blood
flow to the heart and to the brain during CPR, and then maintain that increased perfusion after the heart
restarts, are needed. This study will test a new endovascular therapy that can augment perfusion to the heart
and brain and to decrease epinephrine requirements after the heart has restarted. Endovascular Perfusion
Augmentation for Critical Care, EPACC, is a small aortic balloon catheter that is placed retrograde from the
femoral artery into the proximal descending aorta. Using only partial inflation of the balloon, the device acts like
a “resistor” in the aorta to control blood pressure above the balloon while continuing to permit flow past the
balloon. Balloon inflation and deflation is automated through a series of algorithms that allow the balloon to
rapidly tailor balloon volume movements to the patient’s physiology. A recent small pilot study in a pig model of
cardiac arrest demonstrated that EVAC can decrease the rate of rearrest from 60% to 0% in the early period
after the heart has restarted. This study will model the first 24 hours of post-arrest resuscitation and critical
care in a pig model of cardiac arrest with and without EPACC. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposed research
will study the effects of EPACC on the heart and the rate of rearrest, Aim 2 will study the effects of EPACC on
the brain and on cerebral perfusion, and Aim 3 will study the effects of EPACC on organs distal to the balloon.
This proposed work will identify the potential benefits of EPACC during post-cardiac arrest care and provide
the foundation for future clinical trials if found to be effective."

The overall goal of this proposal is to establish the relevance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potential
therapeutic target for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), utilizing a well-characterized mouse model of
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The significance for adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potential therapeutic
target in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is based on preclinical rodent models that demonstrate long-
lasting deficits in neurogenesis following developmental alcohol exposure, the critical role of neurogenesis in
many hippocampal-dependent behaviors that are also disrupted in clinical FASD, and recent evidence that
neurogenesis continues throughout life in the human hippocampus. Using voluntary drinking paradigms to model
PAE in mice, our laboratory previously demonstrated marked impairment of the neurogenic response to enriched
environment (EE) that is associated with disruption of neurochemical, morphological and electrophysiological
indices of EE-mediated network activity. Experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to test the overall
hypothesis that impaired EE-mediated neurogenesis is relevant for deficits in behavior and hippocampal
network mechanisms in PAE, and can be restored using genetic and/or pharmacological therapeutic
approaches. This hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1: To determine whether impaired EE-mediated neurogenesis is directly correlated with
impaired pattern discrimination learning in PAE mice. We will utilize two complex neurogenesis-dependent
cognitive tasks in which pattern discrimination/separation is tested in both contextual and spatial domains.
Behavioral performance will be correlated with impaired neurogenesis in PAE-EE mice, and with immediate early
gene expression as a readout of network activation.
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether impaired EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice leads to
compensatory remodeling of afferent synaptic input to aDGCs. We will utilize neuroanatomical approaches
including rabies-based retrograde tracing to determine whether dendritic complexity and/or the distribution of
monosynaptic afferent inputs to aDGCs are selectively altered in PAE-EE mice.
Specific Aim 3: To determine whether sensitivity to EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice is restored
by genetic and/or pharmacological intervention. We will utilize a genetic gain-of-function approach to
augment the survival of aDGCs in an attempt to restore EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice. In addition, we
will test whether the neurogenic antidepressant, fluoxetine (FLX), restores EE-mediated neurogenesis and
behavior in PAE. If so, causal relationships between neurogenesis and FLX-mediated behavioral improvement
will be tested by selective, genetic silencing of aDGCs."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable, plasma cell (PC) malignancy that progresses from the precursor
conditions monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma
(SMM). Although MGUS and SMM PCs exhibit similar oncogenic mutations to MM PCs, they are considered
benign and it is unclear what drives tumorigenesis of these pre-malignant PCs. Aging is the primary risk factor
for cancers, including MM; it is therefore unsurprising that aging and tumorigenesis exhibit shared mechanisms.
One of these shared mechanisms is cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is induced in response to cellular
stress, such as oncogenic mutations, and activates growth arrest to prevent tumor formation. However, the
accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to aging pathologies, including cancer. Although deletion
or inhibition of genes necessary for senescence induction leads to tumor formation, elimination of senescent
cells reduces tumor incidence in aged mice. This suggests that senescent cell accumulation may create a pro-
tumorigenic microenvironment; alternatively, pre-tumor cells may themselves be senescent and targeted by
senescent cell elimination strategies. In support of this, we found that both MGUS and SMM PCs have
enrichment of cellular senescence genes. In addition, SMM PCs show characteristics of late-senescence,
including an interferon senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and the accumulation of cytosolic
ssDNA and DNA:RNA hybrids that are associated with increased genomic instability. These findings support a
role for PC senescence in monoclonal gammopathies, and suggest a potential mechanism that may ultimately
drive tumorigenesis. Importantly, clonal PCs have also been shown to induce senescence in the bone marrow
microenvironment (BMME), suggesting additional mechanisms by which senescence may promote a permissive
niche for MM tumorigenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that senescence within PCs and their proximate BMME
drives progression of MGUS/SMM to MM. In this application, we propose to use genetic mouse models and
human patient-derived cells and bone biopsies to ascertain the mechanisms by which senescence drives
tumorigenesis through both direct effects on pre-tumor cells and on the BMME. The results of these studies will
define a role for senescence, a common aging mechanism, in tumorigenesis. We anticipate that these findings
can be rapidly translated to clinical trials targeting the progression of monoclonal gammopathies to MM."

Microbes in host microbiomes, human infections and the natural environment often live in spatially structured
aggregates and interact antagonistically with each other. Toxin-mediated antagonistic interactions are
widespread in the gut, skin, and other human microbiomes, and protect these communities against external
invasion. Recent results suggest that spatial structure can strongly affect the evolutionary dynamics of
microbial populations, and, in turn, microbial interactions can feedback on the formation of spatial structure. For
example, we found that mechanical interactions among dividing cells in growing yeast colonies reduce the
power of natural selection by reducing the rates at which lower fitness strains go extinct and fitter ones expand
in these populations. Despite spatial structure and microbial interactions have a strong impact on the
evolutionary dynamics of microbes relevant for human health, most of what we know about microbial
evolutionary dynamics comes from experiments with well-mixed liquid cultures with limited interactions among
cells. To fill this gap, my group is interested in understanding quantitatively how spatial structure, mechanics
and biological interactions impact the adaptive evolutionary dynamics of microbial populations. We approach
this question via experimental evolution, synthetic biology, and mathematical modeling. In preliminary
experiments, we found that evolving yeast colonies selecting for faster expansion on agar surfaces results in
notable changes in cell shape: cells evolved from an ellipsoidally shaped ancestor to being elongated and
almost rod- like, changing the way cells interact mechanically when growing and dividing. We hypothesize that
an elongated cell shape is advantageous for faster expansion because it reduces cell packing, and that this
adaptive change is associated with changes in the way genotypes cluster in space leading to increased
genetic drift, the temporal change in allele frequencies due to chance events. Recently, we showed that a toxin-
producing microbe can only invade a landscape occupied by a weaker toxin-producer if its inoculum is larger
than a critical size, and that adaptive evolution can alter the dynamics of antagonism. We will experimentally
investigate the dependence of the critical inoculum size on the strength of the interaction, and we will study how
spatial structure controls the fate of mutations that confer resistance to the toxin produced by either the invader
or resident strain. Finally, we will investigate how antagonistic interactions among microbes affect the
dynamics of invasion in the gut of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: these experiments will help us
translate results obtained in simple laboratory settings to the more complicated but more realistic dynamics of
invasion of a host microbiome."

Insulin resistance (IR) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the mechanisms by which IR
predisposes to AD is unknown, notably, if IR is causally related to AD and which regulatory mechanisms
underlie IR and contribute to AD. The proposal is designed to address these critical gaps in scientific
knowledge by using omics to evaluate the causal relationship of IR on AD and to reveal new regulatory
mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Sarnowski, is a statistical geneticist and
an early career investigator with a research focus on the identification of genetic and environmental risk factors
of complex traits. The long-term goal of this project is to identify individuals who will benefit from treatments
improving insulin sensitivity to better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD. The overall objective is to
better characterize mechanisms by which IR contributes to AD and evaluate how they may differ from known
mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that omics will help to better understand
and characterize the relationships between IR and AD. The rationale is that omics will help to disentangle the
mode of action of IR on AD and identify targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions. Guided by strong
preliminary results in the Framingham Heart Study, the hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1)
Determine if IR is causally related to AD in a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework with various genetic
instrument variables (IVs); 2) Characterize molecular signatures of IR associated with AD using brain and blood
omic data; and 3) Develop a joint test to evaluate the genetic contribution at IR signatures associated with AD.
In Aim 1, genetic IVs, including standard and pathway-specific genetic risk scores and predictors identified by
machine learning, will be constructed to evaluate the causal relationships between IR and AD using various MR
methods. In Aim 2, association analyses will be performed to identify brain and blood omic signatures of IR
related to AD. In Aim 3, new integrative statistical methods leveraging annotations will be developed to evaluate
the genetic contribution on omics at loci involved in IR and AD. Career development activities will include training
in AD pathophysiology, multi-omic analysis and machine learning techniques through coursework, seminars,
mentorship, and collaborations with a team of leading expert scientists. The approach is innovative by shifting
focus to omics to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in IR and AD. The proposed research is significant
as the expected outcomes will contribute to a better understanding of how insulin sensitivity can be improved to
better prevent, delay or stop the progression of AD, reduce cognitive decline and prevalence of dementia due to
AD, and promote brain health in late life. The experience acquired in achieving the aims of this grant will advance
the PI’s career to an independent statistical geneticist with bioinformatics expertise, to dissect how vascular risk
factors interact with genomics to influence AD and dementia susceptibility using large-scale omics."
11036612,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomal recessive ataxia that occurs in the white population.
The disease is caused by expanded GAA repeats at the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene. There is no cure
for the disease due to the inherited expanded GAA repeats in the FRDA patient’s genome. Thus, it is urgent to
develop FXN gene-targeted GAA repeat contraction for FRDA treatment. Recent studies from our group have
found that inhibition of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation can lead to large GAA repeat contraction in FRDA
neural cells and transgenic mouse brain by opening the chromatin and promoting DNA base excision repair
(BER) at the FXN gene. We further hypothesize that FXN gene-targeted histone demethylation interplays with
BER to contract GAA repeats and activate the FXN gene in FRDA. The hypothesis will be tested by Dr. Rhyisa
Armbrister, the postdoctoral fellow of Dr. Yuan Liu, the PI of the NIHR03 project. The project will be conducted
by employing novel human natural vault nanoparticles encapsulated with CRISPR/dCas9-H3K9 demethylase,
KDM4D-sgRNA complex, inducing FXN gene-targeted histone demethylation and BER-mediated contraction of
the expanded GAA repeats in differentiated FRDA neural cells. The goal will be accomplished by pursuing two
Specific Aims under Dr. Liu’s supervision and mentorship through collaboration with Dr. Cheng-Yu Lai. Aim 1 is
to determine if vault nanoparticles encapsulated with FXN gene-targeted CRISPR/dCas9-KDM4D can lead to
the histone demethylation and contraction of the expanded GAA repeats in FRDA neural cells. We will generate
recombinant human vault nanoparticles encapsulated with dCas9-KDM4D fusion proteins assembled with
synthesized FXN gene-targeted sgRNAs and transduce vault nanoparticles into differentiated FRDA neural cells.
We will then determine if vault nanoparticle-mediated FXN gene-targeted histone demethylation can result in the
contraction of the expanded GAA repeats in FRDA neural cells. Aim 2 is to determine if vault nanoparticle-
mediated FXN gene-targeted histone demethylation can disrupt heterochromatinization to induce BER on the
expanded GAA repeats, thereby leading to upregulation of FXN gene expression and relief of FRDA
neurodegenerative phenotypes. We will determine if vault-mediated FXN gene-targeted H3K9 demethylation
can reduce heterochromatin protein 1α and 1β, increase H3K9ac, and induce the recruitment of DNA base
excision repair enzymes on the expanded repeats, leading to FXN gene upregulation in FRDA neural cells and
relief of FRDA phenotypes. Our study will integrate the CRISPR/dCas9 system with human vault
bionanoparticles to reveal the novel mechanisms of FXN gene-targeted GAA repeat contraction via histone
demethylation and DNA repair. The study will create the first platform for bionanoparticle-mediated gene therapy,
forging a new avenue for innovative treatments for FRDA and other repeat expansion diseases. Furthermore,
the project will provide an excellent opportunity for Dr. Armbrister to develop her future career as a tenure-track
faculty in neuroscience, thereby promoting underrepresented minorities and diversity in neuroscience."
10894302,"The goal of the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) is to apply multi-modal single-cell and imaging technologies
toward developing an Atlas of Senescence in Murine Tissues in male and female mice across the lifespan in
multiple strains. Our team of aging and bioinformatics experts have extensive infrastructure and unique expertise
that is ideally suited to build a comprehensive map of murine cellular senescence, including its regulators, cellular
manifestations, and impact on cell communication within the tissue environment. To achieve this, we will develop
an integrated pipeline for tissue analysis using genomic, imaging, and computational methods to characterize
senescence with single-cell and/or spatial context. We will leverage the NIA Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice
(SLAM) multi-strain mouse aging project, transgenic reporter and senescence-depleted mice, and extensive
single-cell datasets combined with novel transfer learning to yield cross-tissue identification of SnCs in
plasma/serum and multiple select tissues (chosen due to the prevalence of SnCs, their association with aging-
related pathologies in mice, and their inclusion in the Human SenNet Program). We propose the following
Specific Aims, which encompass a multi-tiered approach to screen and deeply characterize SnCs in murine
tissues across their lifespan:
Aim 1: Establish multi-modal profiling of aging mice and transgenic models to identify cell senescence
in murine tissues across lifespan and their impact on tissue physiology.
Aim 2: Generate single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing atlases of mouse aging to
reveal tissue-specific SnC identities.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of SnCs in tissues on their neighboring cell ecosystems using imaging-
based phenotypic and spatial senescent mapping."
10897941,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive increase of pulmonary vascular
resistance and obliterative vascular remodeling that causes right heart failure and premature death. Given
the underlying molecular mechanisms of obliterative vascular remodeling remain enigmatic, current therapies
have not targeted the fundamental disease modifying mechanisms and hence only resulted in a modest
improvement in the morbidity and mortality. While several transcription factors and transcriptional co-
activators have been studied in the context of PAH, post-transcriptional regulations of mRNAs that can affect
expression of key proteins remain largely unexplored. RNA modifications including N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) have recently been discovered as essential regulators of gene expression. The m6A modification
controls RNA stability, transport, and translation and has been linked to human diseases such as obesity and
cancers. Despite its functional importance in various fundamental bioprocesses, studies of m6A modification
of mRNAs in PAH are lacking. Our Supporting Data show that expression of fat mass and obesity-associated
protein (FTO), a well-characterized RNA demethylase, is markedly elevated in pulmonary vascular endothelial
cells (ECs) of idiopathic PAH patients. Tie2Cre-mediated deletion of Fto in ECs (FtoTie2Cre) inhibited PH
induced by chronic hypoxia. Our mechanistic studies provide evidence that several PAH-causing genes are
potential FTO targets in human lung ECs. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of FTO in monocrotaline-
challenged rats inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. Thus, we hypothesize that endothelial
FTO, as a major m6A eraser, acts as a key regulator of mRNA stability and accumulation of key PAH-causing
genes in ECs to regulate pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling and thus is a novel therapeutic
target for PAH. We propose the following 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the fundamental role of
endothelial FTO in the pathogenesis of PAH. In Aim 2, we will delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying
FTO regulation of endothelial dysfunction leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling.
We will identify the key FTO targets in ECs and address the possibility of rescuing the phenotype of FtoTieCre
by novel nanoparticle-mediated in vivo EC-specific gene transfer. In Aim 3, we will explore the therapeutic
potential of FTO inhibitors including a repurposed FDA-approved drug in the treatment of PAH employing 3
complimentary animal models of PAH. Based on the clear clinical relevance of our novel findings, we expect
that the proposed studies have significant translational potential by delineating the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling,
identifying druggable targets, and exploring pharmacological agents that can pharmacologically
inhibit/reverse vascular remodeling and also inhibit vasoconstriction for the prevention and treatment of PAH
in patients. Thus, we believe the proposed studies have great translational potential."
10897963,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease of blocked differentiation in which blasts fail to mature
and proliferate continuously. Differentiation therapy, which aims to reactivate latent maturation
programs and induce cell cycle exit, is curative in the promyelocytic (APL) AML subtype, but not in
other AML subtypes. Epigenetic factors help sustain the differentiation block, and inhibitors of
regulators such as the LSD1, BRD4, and DOT1L has recently been shown to re-activate myeloid
differentiation programs in selected AML models. However, these inhibitors generally do not achieve
terminal differentiation and disease remission. Accordingly, there is significant need to identify more
regulators of the AML differentiation block and to test whether their inhibitors can induce terminal
differentiation when used individually or in combination regiments. To identify novel regulators of AML
differentiation, we recently performed a chromatin-focused CRISPR sgRNA screen using gain-of-
differentiation as a readout. This screen identified the H3K9 histone acetyltransferase KAT6A as a
key driver of AML differentiation arrest, and mechanistic work showed that KAT6A and the H3K9ac
histone binding protein ENL closely cooperate to active promoters of AML oncogenes. We confirmed
that both genetic (CRISPR) and small molecule inhibition of KAT6A markedly induces differentiation
and reduces proliferation most commonly in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AMLs, and also in selected
MLL-wild type (MLL-WT) AMLs. Further, KAT6A inhibitors synergize with inhibitors of either LSD1 or
DOT1L to induce near-terminal differentiation and fully halt proliferation in vitro. This proposal has
three goals: First, we will determine the mechanisms by which KAT6A and ENL are recruited to
chromatin and activate transcription. We will identify the protein domains in KAT6A and the MOZ
complex it resides in that are responsible for its binding to chromatin at MLL-AF9 targets and non-
MLL-AF9 targets. We will also identify any transcription factors interacting with KAT6A and ENL and
test their effect on recruitment of the KAT6A-ENL module to chromatin. Our second goal is to test the
therapeutic potential of targeting KAT6A, individually or in combination with LSD1 or DOT1L
inhibitors, in genetically-defined AML mouse models. We will employ an Mll-Af9 model and a
Dnm3a/Flt3-ITD model and test the effect of inhibitor treatment schemes on disease progression and
overall survival. We will also test the effect of inhibitor treatments on normal hematopoiesis. Our third
goal will be to test the response of clinical AML patient samples to inhibition of KAT6A, individually or
in combination with LSD1 or DOT1L inhibitors. We will perform drug response assays in MLL-r and
MLL-WT samples in vitro using OP9 feeder layer culturing methodology, and will also perform PDX
transplant models and test the response to KAT6A and LSD1 or DOT1L inhibitors in vivo."

10897964,"Functions and Activities of p53 and Mdm2 in Normal and Cancer Cells.
The p53 protein, a major suppressor of cancer in animals and humans, is a DNA sequence
specific regulator of transcription of hundreds of genes whose products mediate cellular
outcomes such as cell cycle arrest, cell death, senescence, metabolic changes, DNA repair and
others that are consistent with tumor suppression. While a potent regulator of such processes in
cells undergoing various forms of genotoxic or oncogenic stress, if allowed to function
unchecked, p53 can be damaging or even lethal to cells and tissues. Keeping p53 under tight
control is therefore as important as allowing it to function when needed. The two proteins that
play the most central role in suppressing p53 are Mdm2 and its homologue MdmX. Over half of
all human malignancies (depending on the tumor type) harbor wild-type p53, which if released
from Mdm2/X, might be effective as a cytostatic or cytotoxic anti-tumor agent. Yet reagents
(peptides and small molecules) that prevent Mdm2 from binding to p53 have not yet been fully
realized as effective therapeutic agents. Similarly, there few effective drugs in the clinic that
prevent the oncogenic activities of mutant p53. Further, increasing lines of evidence document
p53-independent roles of Mdm2 and MdmX in cancer cells that can be exploited for therapeutic
and diagnostic purposes. The work proposed in this application for an Outstanding Investigator
Award follows a long history of contributions in the laboratory of the PI to our understanding
p53, Mdm2 and MdmX that continue to the present day. The plans going forward build on new
findings in the PI's lab, and incorporate novel technologies in order to gain more global and
mechanistic information about the p53/Mdm axis. The research proposed will extend recent
discoveries related to (i) a novel mechanism by which Mdm2 degrades p53 and the possibility
that this finding can lead to new therapeutics that prevent Mdm2 degradation of wild-type p53 or
conversely facilitate Mdm2 degradation of oncogenic mutant forms of p53, (ii) a series of
CRISPR-derived cell lines harboring unique Li-Fraumeni-Syndrome p53 mutations; (iii) p53-
independent roles of Mdm2 and MdmX that may either prevent or support oncogenesis, (iv)
long non-coding RNAs that are p53 targets and which may provide new biomarkers in human
cancers; (v) new approaches to understand how p53 identifies its sites in vitro and in vivo and,
(vi) examination at single molecule resolution the localization of wild-type and mutant forms of
p53 and Mdm2 after different stimuli. The long term goals of this program will hopefully lead to
new tools for diagnosis and treatment of sporadic and inherited cancers."
10897965,"Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are among the most
distressing symptoms in psychosis, and up to 30% of patients exhibit little to no response to current
treatments. This is especially concerning given that the presence of hallucinations alone increases risk
of suicide in patients with psychosis. One potential route toward development of new treatments for
AVH is based on new evidence that many people with AVH never develop the need to seek treatment,
despite the fact that AVH in treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking individuals tend to be similar
in terms of low-level acoustic qualities such as loudness, duration, and location of voices. One
particularly promising predictor comes from the fact that non-treatment-seeking voice-hearing
populations consistently endorse a higher degree of control over their experiences than their treatmentseeking
counterparts. Perhaps most strikingly, some individuals report an ability to fully control the
onset and offset of their voices, which may make the experience of living with these voices significantly
less disruptive and distressing. Moreover, new evidence indicates that voluntary inhibition of AVH may
be developed in both treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking voice-hearers. Understanding the
mechanisms specifically driving voluntary control over AVH could lead to new insights into potential
treatment strategies to bolster these abilities. We and others have proposed hypotheses for how
voluntary control of AVH might arise from cognitive inhibition, alterations in perceptual inference, or
interactions between these processes. We propose to identify the mechanisms underlying inhibitory
control of hallucinations. We will recruit 102 clinical and non-clinical voice-hearers with a range of
control abilities for participation in a set of behavioral, imaging, and electrophysiological tasks designed
to identify how voluntary control over voice-hearing occurs. Controlling for key confounds, we will relate
our proposed measures to control abilities as measured on the newly-validated Yale Control Over
Perceptual Experiences (COPE) Scale. We will also follow a subset of 60 of these participants over two
years to identify predictors and correlates of changes in control abilities. To control for presence of
hallucinations and psychosis, respectively, we will also recruit 51 matched healthy controls and 51
participants with psychosis but no voice-hearing to participate in the cross-sectional study. Principally,
we hypothesize that exertion of control over AVH will result in: 1) activation of separable AVH- and
control-related brain networks, the interaction between which will relate to abilities to exert control over
AVH; 2) specific alterations in perception as demonstrated by the Conditioned Hallucinations task and
EEG measures, corresponding to a decreased precision of perceptual priors, increased perceptual
belief updating, or both; and 3) dual-task interference on the Think/No-Think task, an assay of cognitive
inhibitory skills. Our goal is to translate the insights gained to new, mechanistically-informed treatments
to enhance control over AVH."

This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) proposal describes a three-year
career development and training plan for Dr. Forum Kamdar, a heart failure cardiovascular physician-scientist at
the University of Minnesota. Her long-term goal is to be an independent physician-scientist making significant
contributions in the field of neuromuscular cardiomyopathy. Her career development training plan encompasses
the following: (1) protected research time, (2) focused formal coursework and hands-on laboratory training in
cardiac tissue engineering and extracellular matrix dynamics, (3) rigorous training in the Responsible Conduct
of Research (4) a structured mentoring program with a multidisciplinary team of experienced scientists and
physician-scientists, and (5) focused research experience in basic science through the study of Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy utilizing cardiac tissue engineering to develop a DMD human
chambered muscle pump (hChaMP) culminating in the successful application for independent research funding.
DMD is the most common and deadly muscular dystrophy, and DMD-associated cardiomyopathy is ubiquitous
and significantly reduces survival in DMD patients. There are currently no effective treatment methods available
for DMD cardiomyopathy, and mechanisms defining DMD cardiomyopathy progression are not well understood.
The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a key component of cardiac mechanotransduction (MT) and the
loss of dystrophin in DMD results in loss of sarcolemmal integrity, which is a critical early event that ultimately
results in DMD cardiomyopathy. She and others have demonstrated that increased stress also exacerbates the
DMD phenotype, however a 3D model with progressive loading would allow for improved understanding of DMD
cardiomyopathy. The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine how progressive loading impacts
DMD cardiomyopathy disease progression and the impact of partial restoration of dystrophin using a 3D DMD
human chambered muscle pump (hChaMP). In Aim 1, Dr. Kamdar will evaluate the impact of altered MT on
DMD cardiomyopathy disease progression using a DMD hChaMP model system with increasing load. Next, in
Aim 2, she will determine the impact of dystrophin gene correction on cardiac remodeling mechanisms dictating
disease onset in DMD cardiomyopathy using dystrophin exon skipping. This research will provide novel insights
into DMD disease progression and ECM changes which will lay the foundation of her long term goal to identify
therapies to prevent or ameliorate DMD cardiomyopathy.
In summary, a comprehensive career development plan, in the context of a well-defined training, research and
mentorship structure, will allow Dr. Kamdar to emerge as a highly successful, independent physician-scientist in
DMD cardiomyopathy."

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and was responsible for 1.6
million deaths in 2021. The only licensed TB vaccine, the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, protects
infants and children from disseminated disease but provides only partial protection in adult pulmonary disease.
T cells are known to be critical in the host response to M.tb infection, but the mechanisms of this protection are
not fully understood and further research is needed to develop new, effective vaccines. The first category of T
cells are classical T cells that recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules
and include two subsets, helper T cells that express the CD4 coreceptor (CD4 T cells) and cytotoxic T cells that
express a CD8 coreceptor (CD8 T cells). The second category are nonclassical T cells that recognize non-
peptide antigens via MHC independent mechanisms and consist of several distinct subsets. Two subsets of
nonclassical T cells are CD1a/b/c restricted T cells and T cells that express a CD8 coreceptor (CD8 T
cells). CD1a/b/c T cells recognize mycobacterial lipids presented by CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c molecules and
have exhibited antimicrobial effector functions in response to M.tb infection. In contrast, the role of CD8 T
cells in M.tb immunity is unknown. Antigen independent activation of T cells, termed bystander activation, occurs
via proinflammatory cytokines and has been observed to have a protective effect in cancer and
infection. Specifically in M.tb infection, bystander activation of noncognate memory T cells has shown a host
protective impact by decreasing bacterial burden. CD8 T cells have exhibited higher levels of bystander
activation compared to their CD8 classical counterparts. In contrast, the ability of CD1a/b/c restricted T cells
to undergo bystander activation is unknown. Thus, CD1a/b/c restricted T cells are implicated in M.tb immunity,
but their susceptibility to bystander activation has not been explored. Conversely, CD8 T cells are known to
undergo bystander activation but their role in M.tb infection has not been established. In Aim 1, we will determine
the ability of CD1a/b/c restricted T cells to undergo bystander activation, explore the underlying signaling
mechanisms of this activation, and evaluate the ability of bystander activation to induce anti-bacterial effector
programs during M.tb infection. In Aim 2, we will define the role of bystander activated CD8 T cells in M.tb
infection, defining the antigen-independent functions of the subset on granuloma formation and bacterial control.
Our proposal aims to fill the corresponding gaps in knowledge of the role of bystander activated CD1a/b/c
restricted T cells and CD8 T cells during M.tb infection. In addition to potentially illuminating a novel pathway
to target for M.tb vaccines, these studies will more comprehensively analyze T cell activation in M.tb immunity."

Obesity and atherosclerosis are frequently comorbid conditions contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality

resolution of obesity-related inflammation influences cardiovascular disease and found that caloric-restriction-
induced weight loss in obese mice promotes resolution of atherosclerosis. Building upon these exciting findings,
I propose in Aim 1 to evaluate the impact of caloric-restriction on obese adipose tissue and hematopoietic
progenitors and whether the pro-resolving phenotype produced by to caloric-restriction can be transferred
through adipose or hematopoietic cell transplantation. In Aim 2, I propose to investigate the mechanisms by
which caloric-restriction influences the content and composition of atherosclerotic lesions and promotes
atherosclerosis resolution. This work will reveal novel functions of cells and tissues that influence the
atherosclerotic process in weight loss. Additionally, these studies will identify novel molecular pathways that may

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the fastest growing neurological disorders in the US. The number of people
with PD is projected to increase to over 12 million by 2030, with an economic burden surpassing $79 billion by
2037. The progression of pathogenesis is paralleled by an exacerbation in symptom severity, which underlies
the need for hospitalization. If environmental exposures exacerbate PD symptoms, then days (acute effects) or
years (chronic effects) of higher exposure should result in higher rates of hospitalizations. There is evidence that:
1) air pollution might negatively impact the central nervous system via oxidative stress and neuroinflammation;
2) temperature might increase the risk of PD due to thermoregulatory disorders or medication use; and 3) access
to green spaces might protect against PD exacerbation. While few studies have examined the association
between air pollution, temperature, and greenness and PD, the specific PM2.5 components contributing to PD
are unknown, the effects of weather parameters on PD are poorly understood, and there is a lack of evidence
on how to identify individuals who are at highest risk for adverse PD outcomes. To date, no study has estimated
the link between simultaneous exposure to air pollution, weather, and greenness and PD exacerbation in a
nationally representative population using rigorous statistical methods for confounding adjustment. Our goal is
to conduct national studies to identify the multiple modifiable environmental factors that contribute to PD
exacerbation and increased PD vulnerability. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national studies to estimate
the chronic effects of 1a) PM2.5, NO2, ozone, PM2.5 components, 1b) greenness, 1c) simultaneous multiple
exposures and their interactions on: a) incidence of first PD hospitalization and b) re-hospitalizations, as
surrogate for accelerated disease severity. In Aim 2 we will estimate the acute effects of 2a) PM2.5, NO2, ozone,
2b) greenness, 2c) mean daily temperature and heat index, 3c) simultaneous multiple exposures on PD
hospitalizations. In both Aims 1 and 2 in main analysis we will use Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalizations)
for the full study period (2000-2020), and we will then conduct sensitivity analyses using Part A linked to B
(outpatient) and D (medication use) claims to increase rigor in identifying PD cases. In Aim 3 we will develop
and apply machine learning methods and existing methods to identify subpopulations at increased risk. In Aim
4, to ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will develop peer-reviewed, open-source, and computationally
efficient software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary, findings of this study will
provide evidence on the link between simultaneous environmental exposures and PD exacerbation with the
highest possible scientific rigor, and will identify multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that lead to
increased vulnerability in PD. Completion of this project will provide the foundation to inform actionable policy
(e.g., ensure stringent air pollution standards for PM2.5, implement heat prevention strategies, inform urban
planning) to help slow the PD disease burden and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans."

Until recently, there have been no effective treatments for retinal degenerations. FDA approval of Luxturna, the
first gene therapy for bi-allelic mutations in RPE65, has opened the field for application to a broader range of
retinal diseases. The rapidly growing number of clinical trials and emerging companies reflect the impact of this
success and indicate the high expectations for retinal gene therapy. However, there is a significant need to
develop new approaches for the many remaining forms of retinal degenerations, as RPE65-related dystrophies
affect a very small population of patients. Moreover, the combination of the vector and surgical approach used
for this disease is suboptimal for targeting the fovea in retinas with significant structural alterations. The major
obstacles that must be addressed to improve clinical outcomes and extend the application of gene therapies to
numerous retinopathies at various disease stages are: 1) efficient vector delivery to the central retina without
damaging remaining photoreceptors, a significant, documented concern with sub-retinal injections in conditions
where the retina is structurally compromised, 2) efficiently targeting gene delivery to affected cells, especially
photoreceptors and RPE across the retina and 3) limiting the inflammatory/immune responses associated with
intravitreal injections. These issues are relevant to all current and future retinal gene therapy programs. Here,
we address each of these obstacles through development of an innovative new epiretinal gene therapy approach
for NPHP5-LCA and RPE65-LCA2, in which a novel, biocompatible, retinal adhesive gel developed by our team
releases high efficiency AAVs directly to the retina. We have created a comprehensive and efficient development
plan that allows for rapid translation, drawing on the complementary skill sets of a team of experts with a track
record of successful translational development. We will further develop the tunable, biocompatible gel and
injection system to deliver these vectors directly to the retina, and we will incorporate a backing layer into the
implant that allows for directionality of vector release for increased efficiency. We will determine the most efficient
implant-compatible photoreceptor and RPE-targeting AAV vectors by utilizing our recently developed single cell
RNA-Seq paradigm. We will fully validate this new gene therapy platform in two well-studied naturally occurring
canine models of LCA that affect primarily the photoreceptors (NPHP5-LCA) and RPE (RPE65-LCA2), and we
will characterize immune response and toxicity. The innovative approach developed herein will result in a new
platform for direct, non-invasive and efficient AAV delivery to the retina, reducing diffusion and required dosage
as well as the related immune response. This novel gene delivery platform has direct applicability to all outer
retinal disease targets, paving the way forward for a safer, more efficient and targeted approach to treat a wide
spectrum of disorders."

implicate subcortical structures, specifically the midbrain dopaminergic system. Recently, reports in both
animal models and humans indicate that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to hippocampus circuit may be
disrupted in AD. Interestingly, a report in a mouse model indicates that cells in the medial VTA, which project
predominantly to corticolimbic structures, are preferentially affected, suggesting differential subpopulations of
VTA dopaminergic neurons are affected by AD pathology. The field is currently limited by a lack of information
on how heterogeneity affects pathophysiological predisposition in the ventral midbrain. This proposal aims to
elucidate the underlying mechanisms of cognitive and non-cognitive deficits in AD and its related dementias.
The experiments in this proposal will use an established mouse model that expresses mutant amyloid and tau
to investigate this gap in the collective knowledge. The general strategy will be to use animals of 3, 6, and 12
months of age, representing well defined pathological timepoints in hippocampal pathology. We will isolate
subpopulations of VTA cells through immunohistochemistry, single cell sequencing, and retrograde tracing.
Following sacrifice, we will record electrophysiological parameters, perform RNA-sequencing, and
morphological reconstruction of single VTA dopaminergic neurons of transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Aim
1 will construct a spatiotemporal timeline of amyloid and tau accumulation across cortical and subcortical
structures. Aim 2 will investigate intrinsic dopaminergic properties including neurite length, action potential
generation, the ion channel conductances that govern firing, and single cell transcriptomic profile.
Understanding cellular and circuit decrements occurring outside of cortical regions is key to development of
efficacious treatments. These studies aim to establish dopaminergic processes in AD pathophysiology, to
understand how single cell heterogeneity predisposes cells to functional decline, and to identify novel targets
for intervention in AD."

Disparities in glycemic control and diabetes technology use are now widely recognized at all socioeconomic
levels in Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Recent data shows that NHB children
are less likely to start and less likely to continue use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and are also less
likely to use an insulin pump. Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, which require both CGM and insulin
pump, show greatest HbA1c improvement in those with baseline HbA1c over 8%, leading to concern that low
use of AID in NHB patients will further exacerbate existing health-care disparities. Therefore, novel interventions
to reduce disparities in technology use among NHB patients with T1D are critical to improving glycemic control,
reducing microvascular complications and preventing early mortality in NHB patients.
We aim to reduce disparities with a 2-part intervention: a diabetes triage dashboard with interactive smartphone
application and a community health worker (CHW) in the role of diabetes technology coach. A diverse advisory
group of stakeholders will define metrics of triage zones for the dashboard and frequency/content of messages
from the application and will refine the specific role of the CHW, Our shared goals are to 1) identify patients who
struggle to initiate or continue their device or do not meet glycemic goals and 2) utilize a CHW from the same
racial background and community to act as a diabetes and technology coach, building trust with families so as
to identify and overcome barriers to successful technology use.
The specific aims are to: 1) Convene a diverse advisory group of stakeholders to develop a protocol for a
diabetes dashboard and smartphone application; 2) Develop a diabetes dashboard and interactive application
using remote data capture from the cloud from CGM, insulin pumps, and AID systems; 3) Assess effectiveness
and implementation of the bundled intervention with a 1:1 randomized controlled study of NHB children and
young adults with new onset and insulin pump naïve existing T1D; 4) Aim 4: Understand lived experience of
diabetes management in context with 1:1 interviews, considering both perceptions regarding the intervention
itself (vs. usual care) and organizational/secular characteristics influencing that experience."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of
dementia in the United States. Variants in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is strongly associated with
development of AD. In the brain, APOE is mostly synthesized in the astrocytes. The primary role of APOE is to
deliver lipids and cholesterol from astrocytes to other cell types. Most humans have one of the major allele of
APOE, APOE ε2 (R176C), APOE ε3 (reference allele), and APOE ε4 (C130R). These missense variants are
associated with different levels of Alzheimer disease risks where APOE ε4 increases the risk of disease whereas
APOE ε2 decrease risk of AD. A recent analysis that genotyped over 100,000 patients showed that rare
missense variants were associated with different levels of Alzheimer disease risk. The molecular mechanism of
how variants in APOE changes astrocyte physiology that could lead to Alzheimer disease is not well known. To
attempt to understand this, our previous work adapted mass spectrometry-based thermal proteome profiling to
determine changes in protein interaction as a result of missense variants. Using yeast as simplified model, we
were able to show mutant thermal proteome profiling to resolve subcomplex level protein-protein interaction
disruptions of a protein complexes due to missense variants. To study the role of these rare missense variants
on APOE in astrocytes, we will employ an mouse primary astrocyte culture that will generate human APOE with
the specific missense variant. First, we will determine the effect of the rare missense variants on the lipoprotein
functions and astrocyte physiology. We will determine the differences between the APOE variants of uptake of
Aβ peptides, lipidation status, and the effects on the astrocyte transcriptome. Second, we will determine the
changes in protein interactions as a result in APOE variants using mutant thermal proteome profiling to detect
thermal stability changes. Taken together, these data will expand our understanding of how missense variants
change the functions of APOE and help give insight into the molecular mechanisms that result in Alzheimer
disease."
10901641,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The gut microbiota produces a myriad of metabolites that have been shown to have wide effects on host
biology. Specifically, peptidoglycan (PG) fragments are well established immunomodulators in many health
issues including inflammatory diseases, microbial infections, and cancers and have been shown to be
translationally relevant in immune cell differentiation, insulin processing, and the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapies. Although the microbiota’s ability to produce PG fragments may provide an underlying
mechanism for host-microbial interactions, it remains difficult to selectively modulate the amount of host-available
PG. Therefore, the development of new tools to upregulate PG fragments in circulation for gain of
function studies are needed to understand certain fundamental host biologies. Previous efforts to decipher
these signaling pathways have focused the phylogenetic relationships of correlated microbes rather than their
shared metabolic outputs; however, these genomic data do not provide information on protein secretion levels,
stability, or activity. Unlike previous work, this proposal will directly assay microbial enzymes through a
chemoproteomic platform to uncover functional PG-degrading enzymes for the development of functionalized
probiotics to control metabolite output in host systems.
 It is hypothesized that increased hydrolytic activity in the gut will selectively control PG fragment levels in
circulation. The proposal’s main goals are to identify highly active, secreted, and stable PG-degrading enzymes
(Aim 1) and to genetically engineer tools to upregulate PG metabolites in circulation (Aim 2). This research will
allow for the discovery of high performing microbial enzymes to rationally control circulating glycan metabolites
through gut colonization with engineered tool organisms. The potential discoveries in this proposal could be
translationally applied to alter microbe-human dynamics through the utilization of mechanistically-defined
probiotics.
 The Sponsor, Co-Sponsor and PI have developed a fellowship training plan that will enable the PI’s future
goal of becoming an independent researcher through enhancing both her scientific expertise and professional
skills. To accomplish the experimental aims as proposed, the PI will receive training in proteomics, probiotic
genomic engineering, and animal handling. In addition, the training plan outlines key professional development
events that will improve the PI’s scientific communication and writing abilities, which will enable a successful
career trajectory for her. This research plan will ultimately develop the PI’s scientific and professional
proficiencies so that she may obtain a post-doctoral research position, which will lead her toward
becoming an independent scientist. The expertise that will be gained through her experimental work on this
proposal as well as her participation in the didactic and career development activities planned will enable the PI
to accrue the tools needed to have a successful career as a future independent researcher."

10902958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematologic malignancy characterized by impaired myeloid
differentiation and blast proliferation, inhibiting normal hematopoiesis. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations
are highly prevalent in AML and contribute to leukemogenesis through production of oncometabolite 2HG.
Mutant IDH inhibitors (Enasidenib for IDH2, Ivosidenib for IDH1) suppress 2HG production and differentiate
leukemic cells to functional neutrophils. Despite initial excitement for differentiation agents, overall survival
remains abysmal as differentiation therapy fails to induce durable responses in most patients. Concomitant
oncogenic Nras mutations are the most consistent predictor of primary resistance to mutant IDH inhibitors. While
IDH mutations cause stem cell bias, surprisingly, oncogenic Nras mutations are associated with aberrant myeloid
differentiation. The role of oncogenic Nras in modulating IDH mutant AML leukemogenesis and the mechanism
by which it contributes to therapeutic resistance is completely undefined.
The goal of this research proposal is to define the mechanistic contribution of Nras to IDH mutant AML
leukemogenesis and characterize its role in therapeutic resistance. There are no available mouse models
that recapitulate patient phenotypes and provide dynamic range to study oncogenic Nras. We developed two
orthogonal mouse models (genetically engineered mouse models and patient derived xenograft models) of IDH
mutant AMLs with and without concomitant Nras. We will utilize serial IDHm AML patient samples to ensure
translational relevance. Preliminary data indicates oncogenic Nras causes aberrant myeloid differentiation in IDH
mutant AMLs, leads to rapidly lethal disease, and is not susceptible to Ivosidenib mediated differentiation. We
show in vitro inhibition of Mek signaling promotes IDH/Nras co-mutant AML susceptibility to Ivosidenib. Aim1
proposes to characterize oncogenic Nras mediated changes in IDHm AML hematopoiesis (Aim1A) and leukemic
cells of propagation (Aim1B). Aim2 evaluates the mechanism by which oncogenic Nras modulates response to
Ivosidenib, characterizing how oncogenic Nras mitigates Ivosidenib mediated differentiation changes (Aim2A)
and evaluating the role of Mek in attenuating Ivosidenib response (Aim2B). This work carefully considers the role
of DNA and histone methylation and metabolism in these processes, utilizing metabolomics, bisulfite sequencing,
and RNA-Seq. Completion of these aims will elucidate novel therapeutic targets for this high-risk AML sub-group
and reveal how signaling environments influence a cell’s differentiation state response to therapy. This project is
ideal for an aspiring physician-scientist, given its blend of clinical and basic biological questions. The work and
training plan outlined will be completed in the laboratory of Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering, with a
thesis committee of physician scientists, bioinformatic and metabolism collaborators, and support of the Tri-I
MDPhD program. It will prepare the applicant to achieve their goal of being an independent physician scientist."

hyperplasƟc expansion; the former increases overall size of exisƟng adipocytes and correlates with increased
inﬂammaƟon, insulin insensiƟvity, and ﬁbrosis, while the laƩer diﬀerenƟates new adipocytes from resident
preadipocytes through adipogenesis. Remedying the expansion of our adipose Ɵssue to favor healthier hyperplasƟc
expansion is of the upmost importance to combat the obesity epidemic, as western diets high in fat and carbohydrates
have shown to shiŌ the balance of fat expansion to the more consequenƟal hypertrophic expansion. All preadipocytes
have primary cilia, which are criƟcal for their diﬀerenƟaƟon into mature adipocytes. These organelles are typically rich in
signaling components, speciﬁcally G protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs), though liƩle is known about ciliary protein
composiƟon in preadipocytes. Thus far only one receptor has been discovered in the cilium of preadipocytes, and its
acƟvaƟon increases ciliary cAMP and subsequent adipogenesis. Increases in cellular cAMP are necessary for ex vivo
adipogenesis, but it is unknown what role compartmentalized ciliary cAMP has in adipogenesis, though ciliary cAMP in
other cell types has been shown to have diﬀerenƟal funcƟons than whole cell cAMP. I hypothesize that cAMP in the
cilium is necessary and suﬃcient to induce adipogenesis in preadipocytes, and that a suite of ciliary GPCRs acts to
inﬂuence this process in a cilia‐dependent manner. My ﬁrst aim will deﬁne the role of ciliary cAMP in adipogenesis, using
chemogeneƟc and optogeneƟc tools to control the generaƟon or depleƟon of ciliary cAMP during adipogenesis to deﬁne
its suﬃciency and necessity in preadipocyte diﬀerenƟaƟon. My second aim will idenƟfy GPCRs that localize to
preadipocyte cilia and invesƟgate their physiological roles in adipose expansion and prevalence in healthy versus
unhealthy adipose Ɵssues.
This work will be conducted at the University of Utah under the guidance of my sponsor, Dr. Keren Hilgendorf, and co‐

Despite decades of research uncovering the basis of neurogenesis during development, we do not know as
much about neurogenesis in a regenerative context. Regeneration, or the ability to regrow lost tissue, is a rare
feat in the animal kingdom. Although humans can replenish few cell types in the adult brain, they do not have
the ability to regrow large sections of tissue after injury. Improved regenerative therapies would benefit patients
who have experienced stroke, neurodegenerative disease, or traumatic injury. Because the human brain
regenerates itself poorly, our lab seeks to explore fundamental principles of successful brain regeneration
using organisms that can regenerate – planarians. Planarian flatworms regenerate all their body structures,
including a brain, over the course of a week. However, we currently understand little about the genetic
mechanisms governing neural regeneration in planarians. To uncover mechanisms of brain regeneration, this
proposal focuses on elucidating the timeline of dopaminergic neuron maturation and characterizing genes
important for dopaminergic neuron regeneration. A preliminary screen revealed two genes important for
regeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the planarian brain, lim only domain 3 (lmo3) and amyloid precursor
protein. To further study roles of these genes, I will perform the research outlined in this proposal. Aim 1: I will
establish a timeline of dopaminergic neuron maturation and regeneration. Aim 2: I will uncover the cellular
mechanism through which LMO3 promotes neuron regeneration. Aim 3: I will characterize the molecular
mechanism by which LMO3 impacts dopaminergic regeneration in the planarian brain. My studies will improve
our fundamental knowledge of planarian neural regeneration, outlining a path for elucidating the full genetic
mechanism behind creation of dopaminergic neurons from pluripotent stem cells in this fascinating organism.
My data will also establish a protocol for characterizing cellular lifespan and will create new protocols for
discovering new protein-protein interactions in planarians. The fundamental scientific knowledge gleaned from
the completed aims will reveal how successful regeneration of specific cell types is accomplished over time.
Future applications of this work could inform preclinical treatments for neurodegenerative disorders,
contributing to the promise and possibility of successful brain regeneration."
10904627,"The U.S government has declared an opioid crisis in the country and federal health agencies are
adopting emergency measures to obviate the high mortality associated with prescription opioid drug use. There
is an increased risk for sleep disordered breathing (SDB), sleep-related hypoventilation and irregular breathing
in individuals on chronic prescription opioid medications. Almost 30% of a veteran sleep clinic population had
opioid-associated central sleep apnea (CSA). Gravely, in a national sample of Veterans, sleep apnea was a
significant risk factor for opioid-related toxicity and overdose and the presence of CSA combined with chronic
prescription opioid use compounded the mortality risk. There are only limited and partially effective therapies
for this sleep disorder.
 Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms by which opioids produce SDB in adults remain unclear, and
varied and conflicting ventilatory control mechanisms have been suggested. Thus, we will systematically
investigate the chemoreceptor control mechanisms contributing to the increased propensity of SDB associated
with chronic prescription opioid use. We will investigate the effects of chronic opioid use on ventilatory
chemoresponsiveness and cerebrovascular responsiveness to carbon-dioxide and determine whether
modifying these mechanisms with hyperoxia or acetazolamide will mitigate opioid-related SDB/CSA. The
information garnered from the proposed experiments will drive development of novel personalized therapies to
reduce SDB associated with chronic opioids in Veterans and, ultimately, will positively impact their long-term

continue to work together as a longitudinal research track cohort for their medical school career, with
opportunities to receive additional funding for research electives and more advanced training.
The specific aims of the M4I project are to: 1) Inspire medical students to pursue careers in infectious diseases
and research by leveraging UMSOM’s extensive portfolio of infectious diseases research; 2) Recruit and train a
diverse cohort of medical students to engage in a meaningful, hypothesis-driven, infectious disease-oriented
research experience; and 3) Enhance the research environment for medical students and expand the pipeline
of medical students into the field of infectious diseases. We will collect data to assess our progress in achieving
these aims, as well as the ability of students to meet their milestones, in a standardized manner. We will review
our results regularly with an internal steering committee and through a thorough program evaluation with an
external advisory board twice during the grant period. We will create a sustainable model to prepare a diverse

emergence of zoonotic pathogens. Bats (order: Chiroptera) are the natural reservoir hosts for the majority of
the world’s most virulent zoonotic viruses, including Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg
filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. Remarkably, bats exhibit little
demonstrable disease upon infection with viruses that cause extreme pathology in other mammals, likely in
part due to their unique anti-inflammatory molecular adaptations, which are thought to have evolved to mitigate
the accumulation of physiological damage accrued during flight. Surprisingly, isolated island bat communities
around the world support the endemic circulation of numerous viruses in populations below the critical
community size required for persistence of related pathogens in other hosts. Since cross-species spillover of
several bat-borne viruses bears a distinctive seasonal signature, coincident with the timing of reproductive and

Despite significant advances in treatment, women are still dying from breast cancer, particularly triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). More than 50% of women with TNBC have elevated circulating triglycerides (TGs), and
these elevated levels are associated with reduced breast cancer survival. While the link between
hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) and TNBC is well described in epidemiology studies, checking and treating TG levels
in women with TNBCs are not part of standard clinical care. To understand the biological links between HTG
and TNBC progression, we employ pre-clinical models of hypertriglyceridemia in isolation from other metabolic
abnormalities. In our preliminary studies, we have found that the mice with HTG develop more rapid growth and
metastasis in murine models of TNBC. The HTG mice demonstrated lipid profiles with elevated very low density
lipoprotein (VLDL), and high circulating of phospholipids associated with elevated VLDL. Examining RNA
sequencing gene expression, we found that a number of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis and
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) signaling were downregulated in the TNBC from our HTG
models, while cytoskeleton related genes were upregulated. As these gene expression changes have previously
been related to hypoxia signatures, we examined lipid peroxidation products and found higher levels of lipid
peroxidation sterols in the tumors from the HTG mice. In addition, we found increased phosphorylation of p42/44
mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. VLDL binds
to the VLDL receptor (VLDLR), which is part of a breast cancer gene signature that is associated hypoxia and is
highly expressed on the basal-like subtype of TNBC. High VLDLR expression in breast cancer has been
associated with cancer metastasis, and its expression in basal-like TNBC is associated with a 50% decrease in
recurrence free survival. Therefore, we hypothesized that HTG promotes TNBC growth and progression by
increased VLDL uptake through the VLDLR, which contributes to lipid peroxidation in hypoxic tumors. We
hypothesize that lipid peroxidation increases cell signaling which enhances tumor survival in the setting of
hypoxia, and also contributes to EMT, cytoskeletal changes and changes in the tumor immune
microenvironment. In this project we will explore the importance of tumor VLDLR expression in HTG-driven
TNBC growth and metastasis using patient derived xenografts. Secondly, we will examine the importance of an
abundant lipid peroxidation product in TNBC. Finally, we will explore therapeutic strategies to lower TG, which if
successful could readily be translated into clinical care to improve outcomes for women with HTG and TNBC."

The high prevalence and associated negative impact of trauma on the mental and physical health of people living
with HIV and their engagement in HIV care (i.e., retention, viral suppression) underscore the need for
systematically addressing trauma within primary HIV care. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is an evidence-based
treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of trauma. Evidence
from other settings demonstrates that TIC improves patient outcomes, increases staff morale, and is cost-
effective. In recent years, WHO, HRSA, and NIH have called for trauma-informed HIV systems, yet limited
research exists on the strategies needed to facilitate TIC implementation in HIV care settings. In a pre-
implementation study to assess TIC provision and factors influencing adoption and implementation of TIC in
Ryan White-funded HIV Clinics (RWCs) at the epicenter of the US HIV epidemic (DHHS Region IV), we found
that most providers/staff felt that TIC was appropriate for RWCs and had some trauma screening and referral
protocols in place, but training on trauma and methods for working with trauma survivors and lack of staff support
for managing the emotional toll of working with trauma survivors were salient factors limiting TIC adoption.
Importantly, TIC training and use of an implementation advisor (herein called implementation facilitation) were
identified as potential strategies for facilitating TIC implementation in RWCs, including implementation of staff
support. Guided by the Interactive Systems Framework, our Emory team with expertise in TIC will work in
collaboration with The Emory Centers for Public Health Training and Technical Assistance (Emory Centers) and
RWCs to develop and pilot test two implementation strategies (TIC training and facilitation (of TI-staff support
practices, e.g. debriefings, selfcare, etc.)) on provider- and clinic-level implementation and patient effectiveness
outcomes. The aims include: 1) to develop trauma-informed HIV care trainings and an implementation facilitation
process to tailor staff support practices to clinic-specific needs, with iterative feedback via theater testing
methodology with RWC staff/providers/administrators to inform content, dose, intensity and delivery to optimize
effectiveness for RWCs; 2) to refine the two implementation strategies developed in Aim 1 using a modified
Delphi method to build consensus on content and delivery with RWC stakeholders across the DHHS Region IV
to optimize use across a diversity of RWCs; and 3) to pilot and perform a mixed-methods evaluation of the
preliminary effectiveness of the refined implementation strategies on provider- and clinic-level implementation
outcomes at two high-volume RWCs in Metro Atlanta. The results of this study will inform a future Hybrid Type
2 effectiveness-implementation trial examining the impact of centralized delivery of TIC training and facilitation
on TIC implementation and patient HIV effectiveness outcomes and enable an evidence-driven response to the
high-level calls for integration of TIC into HIV primary care services."

Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains higher in black populations than in other
race/ethnic groups.This may be due at least in part to accumulated disadvantage which accelerates the
progression of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, that in turn may contribute to the development of clinically
silent Alzheimer’s pathology as early as middle age. Our team has demonstrated that exposure to CV risk
factors such as obesity, elevated glucose, lipids and blood pressure can impact the vascular system by
childhood and even in utero. Early vascular changes, in turn, may contribute to changes in brain health
decades later. Despite documented socioeconomic and geographic disadvantages more often encountered by
blacks (in, e.g., food security, green spaces, education quality, pollutants) that promote CV health disparities
in childhood, there is little data examining such influences on Alzheimer’s related brain health in midlife or
later. This is primarily due to limited prospectively collected, life-course data on blacks. Addressing this
knowledge gap is increasingly urgent, as many more black and white children will develop adverse CV profiles
now as compared to previous generations. We propose to leverage the significant NIH investment in
prospectively collected data, from black and white men and women participating in the Bogalusa Heart Study
(BHS), NHLBI Growth and Health Study (NGHS), and Princeton Lipid Research Study (PLRS). These unique
life course studies have a strong history of collaboration and data harmonization formalized since 2009 through
the international childhood CV cohort consortium (I3C), with joint follow-up of CV events since 2015.
Shared exposure data include geographic, socioeconomic, and CV risk factors in childhood (from ages 3-19
years), with 40+ years of follow-up. Measuring brain health indicators in these cohorts will allow, for the first
time, exploration of the impact of early life CV health disparities and antecedent disadvantages on midlife brain
health in blacks and whites. In the proposed study, Disparities and Equity in Childhood CV Exposure and
Alzheimer’s DEmentia (I3C DECADE), we will collect structural, functional, cognitive and blood-based
indicators of ADRD-related brain health processes in mid-life (40-55 years), a period when the subtle impacts
of subclinical vascular changes on brain health first begin to emerge, often several decades before ADRD
become clinically evident. The PIs of these cohort studies will leverage their ongoing collaboration to build and
share a novel data resource that advances open science in early life risk factors, and extends that effort to
ADRD. The impact of this work will be to inform strategies that may reduce ADRD health disparities by
identifying and intervening among black and white boys and girls whose CV burden places them at increased
risk of ADRD decades later and has the potential to lead to changes in pediatric clinical practice guidelines.
The proposed I3C DECADE Study represents a unique, and arguably the only opportunity to investigate the
influence of childhood CV risk and disparities on ADRD-related brain health in the critical period of midlife."

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Consortium is applying for funding under the
DOE Worker Training Program (DOEWTP) cooperative agreement to provide appropriate model
health and safety training. The targeted population for the DOEWTP is workers who are engaged
in hazardous waste remediation, hazardous materials transportation, warehousing, and emergency
response on DOE sites.
The long term objectives and specific aims of the IBT Consortium are to increase worker,
community, and environmental safety and resilience by training workers to appropriately respond
to accidental releases of hazardous materials; work safely on hazardous waste remediation projects
on DOE sites; and safely transport hazardous materials, including radioactive materials, via truck
or rail.
The IBT Consortium will access the nationwide population of targeted workers through
established partnerships with appropriate local unions/lodges, community-based organizations, and
other partners to deliver training to 15,200 workers during the 5-year project period.

This application evaluates an integrated brief intervention to reduce alcohol and cannabis use and
consequences and improve sleep among young adults (YA) with comorbid heavy episodic drinking (HED),
cannabis misuse, and sleep impairment. HED in YA is an important public health problem; consequences
include accidental injury and death, academic/work problems, unsafe and unwanted sex, and development of
alcohol use disorders. Many YA with HED also use cannabis and experience increased harm as a result. Sleep
impairment is common and problematic among YA, identified as one of 5 leading barriers to academic success
for students and an important risk factor for mental health problems and suicide in YA. More than 75% of YA
report frequent daytime fatigue, 27% extreme distress related to sleep problems, and more than 1 in 4 are at
high risk for insomnia. Alcohol use has been linked to insomnia in adolescent, YA, and older adult populations,
with bidirectional causal links between alcohol use and impaired sleep. Comorbidity of HED and sleep
impairment is associated with increased consequences of alcohol use and exacerbates risk of accidents
(including automobile accidents), impaired decision-making, and work and academic difficulties. Similar
bidirectional relations exist with cannabis use and sleep, and co-use of these substances may be particularly
harmful for sleep. Despite these risks, alcohol and cannabis prevention programs rarely target sleep directly,
and the majority of YA sleep interventions either focus on sleep hygiene broadly in the absence of specific
strategies to improve sleep or reduce alcohol/cannabis use, or have insufficient sample size and duration to
truly evaluate impacts on sleep or related comorbid alcohol or cannabis use. Building on our successful R34
intervention development project, the current study addresses these gaps by evaluating efficacy of integrating
a brief sleep intervention (BBTI) with an efficacious brief alcohol and cannabis intervention (BASICS/Cannabis
BMI) to increase magnitude and duration of effects on sleep and alcohol and cannabis misuse among a
diverse community sample of YA with comorbid insomnia, HED, and cannabis use. Given bidirectional
influences between sleep impairment and alcohol/cannabis misuse leading to significant public health
challenges for this population, an efficacious integrated treatment is imperative. Impact will be evaluated in a
RCT comparing efficacy of telehealth-delivered, integrated BASICSSLEEP to BASICS/BMI only (BASICS+),
BBTI only (SLEEP), and Attention control (AC). Surveys and daily diaries will assess alcohol, cannabis, and
sleep at baseline, post-tx, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months. Specific aims are: (1) Evaluate comparative efficacy of
BASICSSLEEP, BASICS+, and SLEEP in reducing alcohol/cannabis use and consequences and improving
sleep; (2) Evaluate moderators of efficacy for integrated and monotherapies; and (3) Use diary data to evaluate
temporal sequencing of effects and duration/decay over time. Findings will remedy important gaps in the
literature and result in a scalable, accessible new resource to address this important and costly comorbidity."
10901110,"Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are associated with altered cerebellar activity and this
altered activity is thought to play a causal role in the cognitive deficits observed in these disorders. However,
the neural mechanisms underlying cerebellar contributions to intact and impaired cognition have not been fully
elucidated. We will address this gap in knowledge by examining the neural mechanisms underlying cerebellar
communication with forebrain systems during interval timing – a cognitive task requiring attention, working
memory, and precise response timing. The primary emphasis of the previous research on the role of the
cerebellum in interval timing has been on the ‘ascending’ cerebello-thamo-frontal cortical pathway. However,
the medial frontal cortex also projects back to the cerebellum via the pontine nucleus. This ‘descending’
pathway consists of the medial frontal cortical projection to the rostral pontine nucleus and its mossy fiber
projection to the cerebellum. A major goal of the current project is to determine the role(s) of the descending
pathway in interval timing. The descending pathway could plausibly modulate cerebellar activity with ramping
activity or a tonic increase in activity. We hypothesize that both tonic and ramping activity from the descending
pathway modulates activity in the cerebellum by increasing the overall firing rate and precision of ramping,
respectively. We also hypothesize that sensory information from the start cues in interval timing combines with
information from the medial frontal cortex to support cue-specific and interval-specific ramping of cerebellar
output. We will test these hypotheses in two aims that examine the pathways for cue information (Aim 1) and
mFC timing information (Aim 2) using optogenetics and electrophysiology in rats during performance of a dual-
interval timing task. A broad impact of this project is that we will be able to establish whether there are common
mechanisms for cerebellar organization and function in motor learning and cognition. The current proposal is a
basic research project, but the findings may have important implications for translational research on the role of
the cerebellum in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have
generally focused on how altered cerebellar function affects frontal cortical function, but it is plausible that the
altered activity originates in the cortex (or in both areas) and affects the cerebellum via the descending frontal
cortical-pontine-cerebellum pathway. The findings of our project could form the foundation for translational
research into how descending pathway abnormalities relate to cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder."
10906319,"Project Abstract/Summary
 Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as CsA and tacrolimus are vital immunosuppressive therapies in the
management of inflammatory conditions such as post-transplantation immunosuppression, lupus nephritis46 and
rare cases of atopic dermatitis47. Although CNIs have dramatically improved the quality of patient care, long-term
therapy causes irreversible damage to the kidneys in the form of renal fibrosis. These morphologic changes
ultimately lead to a decline in renal function and can progress to end-stage renal failure, a concern for both
clinicians and patients. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms by which CNIs induce kidney damage need to be
better understood, and to date, there are no specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate this injury.
There exists therefore, a critical need to explain mechanisms by which CNIs promote renal damage.
 Interestingly, loss of CnAα activity in vivo increases markers of renal damage such as TGFβ and
fibronectin3. It is currently unknown which signaling mediators promote the expression of renal damage
markers upon loss of the CnAα isoform. Preliminary data show that exclusive loss of CnAα not only promotes
expression of renal profibrotic markers but also induces NFκB activation. However, the next question,
identifying whether these signaling changes occur via a common pathway, has not yet been answered. This
grant proposal will address this gap in knowledge and test the hypothesis that renal CnAα inhibition
upregulates NFκB signaling, which promotes irreversible renal damage. The expected project outcomes
will characterize CnAα’s role in mediating renal damage through its regulation of NFκB. These findings will
advocate and inspire future development of CnAα-sparing CNIs, ultimately circumventing the nephrotoxicity
noted with long-term CNI use.
 To this end, this proposal seeks to I) determine whether NFκB activation promotes renal damage upon
CnAα inhibition and II) determine how renal CnAα inhibition drives NFκB signaling. Successful completion of the
proposed work will identify key mechanisms underlying the nephrotoxic effects of CNIs, thus informing future
development of CnAα-sparing CNIs and/or additional therapies to counter these toxic effects. The long-term goal
will be to mitigate the renal damage and dysfunction noted in patients placed on long-term CNI therapy."
10906320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Every cell exists in a complex and changing environment. To deal with their complex surroundings, cells
have evolved diverse systems to sense external cues (such as nutrients, stresses, or communication
molecules from neighboring cells) and store this information in an internal representation. Yet the details of this
internal representation are still mysterious. What patterns of protein activity do cells use to represent
information about their environment? How are these patterns generated, and what fates do they control?
 Growth factor signaling is an important model system for understanding principles of cell signaling, where
activation of cell surface receptors is coupled to activation of a membrane-localized protein Ras, the kinase Erk
and various downstream genes. Growth factor signaling plays crucial roles in embryo development (where
growth factors trigger cells to differentiate), adult tissue regeneration (where it controls various aspects of
wound healing), and cancer (where mutations in growth factor signaling genes drive uncontrolled growth and
tumorigenesis). Owing to its importance, growth factor signaling is intensely studied at increasingly high
resolution. Biosensors are now available to monitor Erk activity in real-time and in living cells, enabling the
experimentalist to trace fluctuations in growth factor signaling from one cell to another across a tissue and in
different cellular contexts.
 Studies using Erk biosensors have revealed previously-unappreciated complexity in growth factor signaling
activity. Instead of simply turning from off to on upon stimulation, Erk may pulse on and off rapidly in cells, or
even exhibit traveling waves of activity that propagate across entire swaths of tissue. Yet the field does not yet
understand whether Erk pulses lead cells to adopt distinct functional states, nor how the pulses themselves are
generated by biochemical networks inside or between cells. This state of affairs is not unique to Erk: pulses
have also been widely observed in many other signaling pathways and are generally poorly understood.
 The current proposal aims to provide new tools for studying signaling pulses to aid their study in cultured
cells and in living animals. We have invented a new technology – a prototype gene circuit that acts as an Erk
“pulse detector” – which will allow researchers to study Erk pulses without live imaging. This technology
addresses an important need: currently, pulses can only be detected by high resolution microscopy of living
cells, limiting contexts where they can be studied. Here, we propose to develop our imaging-free biosensor for
rapid deployment in mouse and human cell lines, to expand its design to other pathways and signaling
dynamics, and to establish transgenic animals expressing the biosensor for studies in many tissues where
microscopy is difficult or impossible to perform. Successful completion of this work will produce a new class of
biosensors to shed light on complex signaling with potential impact on human disease."
10906323,"High levels of alcohol consumption clearly place individuals at great risk and present a significant health and economic
burden to society. Emerging evidence indicates that many young adults engage in what can be called extreme drinking
(i.e., drinking at levels likely to lead to BACs > .16). Despite recent attention to extreme drinking5,6, we know surprisingly
little about this behavior beyond associations revealed by cross‐sectional studies that rely exclusively on retrospective
self‐report. The proposed study is designed to provide some of the first comprehensive data about influences on the
extreme drinking phenotype, and to compare these with those identified for the typical binge drinking phenotype.
Whether there are unique causes and correlates of extreme drinking (compared to binge drinking) is an empirical question
that has not been tested. There are challenges to investigating extreme drinking, including 1) overcoming the limitations
of retrospective self‐report, 2) adequately measuring personological and environmental influences, and 3) capturing the
temporal associations of these diverse influences and their impact on extreme drinking occasions. The proposed project
is designed to meet these challenges using a combination of laboratory, genetic, and ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) methods. Our multi‐method approach will combine laboratory alcohol administration, EMA, and real‐time BAC
assessment to capture the interplay between a broad range of potential influences on extreme drinking, extend our
investigation outside the lab and into the natural drinking environment, and explore the temporal associations of
influences on extreme drinking. We focus on four core constructs central to current theoretical models of addiction that
are hypothesized to influence substance use through in‐the‐moment processes: reward sensitivity (RS), incentive salience
(IS), impulsivity/loss of control (Imp), and negative affectivity (NA). We will recruit a sample of 400 young adults (ages
21‐29), ascertained from a statewide DMV database, who have a recent legal action with a recorded BAC consistent with
extreme drinking (≥ .12). Using a longitudinal burst design, we will follow participants over a 12‐month period, with five
self‐report assessments and four, two‐week EMA bursts. A baseline laboratory session will assess behavioral, trait, and
electrophysiological markers of core study constructs. We aim to (1) Evaluate the validity and utility of real‐time
assessments for identifying extreme drinking and alcohol‐related behavior. This aim could inform estimation methods
for characterizing extreme drinking and guide refinement of definitions of problematic drinking profiles. (2) Characterize
the structural influence of stable individual differences, transient intra‐individual factors, and environmental variables
on risky, binge, and extreme drinking occasions and alcohol‐related negative consequences. This aim will reveal the
incremental validity of state (EMA) and trait (lab; baseline questionnaires; polygenic risk scores [PRSs] when applicable)
indices of core study constructs in predicting extreme drinking occasions within and between individuals; as well as test
their interaction with specific contextual factors to predict extreme drinking behavior. (3) Identify multidimensional
profiles associated with stable or highly variable binge and extreme drinking behavior. Our longitudinal burst design
allows us to test hypotheses about the stability of drinking behavior over time."

The objective of this program is to provide predoctoral and postdoctoral training for individuals interested in
careers in translational brain tumor research. Despite the best efforts of neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists,
and laboratory-based scientists, brain cancer remains among the most deadly of all malignancies.
Improvements in brain cancer therapy have come slowly, in part because of the relative dearth of individuals
trained in a manner that allows them to communicate with both clinicians and lab-based investigators. This is
a renewal application for years 11-15 of the T32 Training Grant in Translational Brain Tumor Research at the
University of California San Francisco. The UCSF Brain Tumor Center is the largest program in the nation
that focuses on developing translational brain tumor investigators of the future; individuals who can move
seamlessly between clinical and laboratory worlds and in doing so can more effectively contribute to the
development of new therapeutic interventions for brain tumors. We intend to build upon the training successes
in the previous cycles, maintaining the number of trainees and mentors. This application requests support for
a postdoctoral and predoctoral Training Program (three postdoctoral trainees, 1 predoctoral trainees). The
postdoctoral trainees are selected from the labs and clinics of the faculty, and the predoc trainee is drawn from
the top-tier students in the Biomedical Sciences Program. The faculty of the Program consists of 23 mentors,
and a core of 19 research labs whose work has made the UCSF brain tumor community one of the most
productive and recognized in the world. Over the course of the two years of support requested, the trainees
work with the PIs of these labs and clinics to develop and complete meaningful and significant translational
brain tumor research projects, and in the process become fluent in laboratory-based and clinical research
techniques. The basic science trainees also have unique, supervised experiences in clinical neuropathology,
clinical neuro-oncology, clinical trial design and a new neurosurgery experience component. At the same time
trainees take part in a faculty-led didactic curriculum uniquely focused on brain tumor-related issues and which
allow trainees to develop a common language with which to discuss and understand brain tumor biology,
diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, and unresolved problems in the field. Additional courses and training
events that encourage effective speaking and writing are included, and there is an extensive selection of
existing courses to help tailor the educational experience of individual trainees. Evaluation and mentoring
mechanisms are included to help ensure success in the program and in attaining future career goals. The
UCSF T32 Program in Translational Brain Tumor Research has a strong track record of attracting well-qualified
individuals, and in successfully preparing investigators to lead translational brain tumor research teams
nationally, and internationally, and joining in the fight against brain cancer."
10906669,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are two of the most
common neurodevelopmental disorders and affect approximately 1 in 54 and 1 in 11 children in the U.S.
respectively with a surprisingly high comorbidity rate of up to 70%. Growing literature suggests that early
intervention can ameliorate symptoms and reduce burden of suffering for children affected by these disorders
and their families. In order for early intervention to be successful, identification of infants at the highest risk for
later challenges is necessary. Social communication deficits, atypical attention, and motor skills challenges have
been implicated in the development of both ASD and ADHD. However, little is known about the specificity of
these features as unique mechanisms related to the development of ASD and ADHD in infancy. Characterizing
the profiles of social communication, attention, and motor skills across infants at an elevated genetic likelihood
for ASD, infants at an elevated genetic likelihood for ADHD, and infants at a low genetic likelihood for both
disorders can provide important information about disorder-specific symptoms of ASD and ADHD.
Understanding transdiagnostic and disorder-specific features of ASD and ADHD will lead to improved screening
tools and tailored interventions. Thus, the present study leverages a prospective, longitudinal design to study
trajectories of social communication, attention, and motor skills and their relation to ASD and ADHD
symptomology throughout the first three years of life. Consistent with NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
approach to investigation of mental disorders, this study will use physiological and behavioral measures to
assess these constructs. Further, ASD and ADHD symptoms will be assessed on a dimensional basis. Specific
Aim 1 will provide novel information about three phenotypes of ASD and ADHD – communication, attention,
motor skills – in infants at genetic risk to provide an early profile of infant skills across three groups. Results from
this study will provide information about symptoms associated with genetic risk for ASD and ADHD. Specific Aim
2 will investigate a physiological measure of attention as a predictor of ASD and ADHD symptomology. Notably,
this aim will address a gap in current literature concerning the association between attention measured
physiologically and symptoms of ADHD. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will explore trajectories of social communication,
attention, and motor development as predictors for ASD and ADHD symptomology. These research aims will
inform the complex mechanisms implicated in the development of ASD and ADHD symptoms."
10903309,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
In the past, protein function was viewed as dependent on a well-defined, folded three-dimensional structure;
now, it is well established that disordered regions actively participate in the diverse functions mediated by
proteins. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are abundant in the human proteome and these IDRs cultivate
dynamic, transient interactions. The process of transcription is regulated by dynamic, IDR-containing proteins.
Such proteins are overrepresented in multiple major disease pathways, making them ideal targets for drug
discovery. Transcriptional coactivators are central proteins in transcriptional regulation; however, traditional
drug discovery methods are less effective for targeting these dynamic domains, so there is a need for a
directed approach to target these structures. IDRs evoke the conformational malleability of transcriptional
protein domains in their essential protein-protein interactions (PPIs), thus conformational stabilization can be
utilized as a modulation marker for dynamic domains. My research focuses on building a novel system to
identify modulators of the dynamic transcriptional coactivator domains, KIX and HEAT and optimize modulators
for use in therapeutics. Dysregulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between these domains and their
partnering transcription factors (TF) promotes several TF-dependent cancers. Representing the two major
types of IDRs, the IDR within KIX acts as an allosteric site and the one in HEAT is an orthosteric site. My first
aim is the identification of a variety of IDR modulators that functionally invoke conformational stabilization of
these IDR-containing domains. There is a high correlation between conformational stability and thermostability;
thus, for KIX primary screening, high-throughput differential scanning fluorimetry (HT-DSF) has been employed
to observe IDR modulation by measuring change in protein thermostability upon ligand binding. With the
preliminary KIX hits, follow-up fluorescence polarization (FP) screening will identify the hits that modulate the
IDR in KIX such that its native PPIs are enhanced or inhibited. An expression and purification procedure will be
developed to produce a stable HEAT construct. This domain will then be subjected to a HT-DSF and follow-up
FP to define molecules that alter its IDR and native PPI binding. My second aim is the optimization of IDR
modulators to be defined as therapeutic candidates. Collaborative structural assessment will then connect IDR
modulation to modulation site, establishing structural models and defining ligand binding classes. Using the
structural models, concerted high-throughput lead optimization will be performed for each ligand class to
enhance their therapeutic potential. By implementing this system for the KIX and HEAT domains, it will be
considered applicable for targeting an array of ‘undruggable’ dynamic domains and advancing the drug
discovery efforts for this class of proteins."
10903003,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is part of a larger group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and is
diagnosed in more than 1% of the human population1-3. Patients with severe forms of ASD live with debilitating
symptoms that can prevent them from living independent lives. ASD has a strong genetic component, but is
genetically heterogenous1, 4-7. Whole exome studies have identified hundreds of risk loci, including the
Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 8 (CHD8) gene2, 8-12. CHD8 is a chromatin remodeling factor
(CRF)13-16 and has a high occurrence of de novo loss-of-function mutations in ASD cohorts8-11, 17-20. Moreover,
along with ASD, CHD8 mutation carriers frequently exhibit intellectual disability (ID), macrocephaly, and gut
dysfunction21-22. Our lab generated and characterized mice with germline heterozygous loss of function mutations
to Chd8, finding macrocephaly and disrupted cognitive function, as well as ASD relevant transcriptional
pathology during neurodevelopment23. While we and others have characterized Chd8 mutant mouse lines and
human in vitro models, the molecular underpinnings of core ASD pathology in Chd8 haploinsufficient mice are
still not well understood. CHD8 has been shown to bind regulatory targets in the genome in brain development
and adulthood, impacting neurodevelopmental gene expression programs. The primary hypothesis in the field is
that CHD8 haploinsufficiency drives ASD pathology by first disturbing neurogenesis and developmental
processes, but there may also be disturbances to synaptic function in adulthood that perpetuate and exacerbate
cognitive and behavioral symptoms23-24. In addition to core symptoms, 69% of ASD patients exhibit increased
neuroinflammation or microglial activation25. Studies on postmortem ASD brain samples indicated increased
expression of immune related genes27-28. The neuroimmune interface in Chd8 haploinsufficient mice has yet to
be characterized in significant detail, and the neuroimmune signatures seen in human ASD patients have not
previously been observed in mouse models. Intriguingly, our transcriptomic studies have revealed preliminary
evidence of perturbed immune pathways in the brain23. Whether these immune symptoms are an intrinsic part
of CHD8-mediated pathology or secondary to disruptions in other pathways is uncertain. In this proposal, I will
leverage Chd8 mutant mice to elucidate cell-specific transcriptomic mechanisms associated with Chd8
haploinsufficiency and NDD-associated pathology. My studies will secondly test for microglia-specific effects of
Chd8 mutation and map the relationship between immune and neuronal signatures in the brain. This work will
comprehensively expand the breadth of our understanding of molecular pathology across cell types in the adult
brain, as well as interrogate at depth the impacts of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on neuroimmune signaling and
microglia. Overall, these studies may provide novel insights into cellular and molecular origins of NDD pathology
as well as yield new insights into neuronal-microglial interactions in the brain in severe monogenic NDDs."

Candidate: Shirley Cohen-Mekelburg, M.D., M.S. is a gastroenterologist with master’s level clinical research
training. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator and to develop and evaluate
self-management interventions to improve health outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
This K23 will provide Dr. Cohen-Mekelburg with the training and support to achieve her career goals and improve
IBD care and outcomes by assisting patients in IBD self-management. Research context: The management of
active IBD (i.e., inflammatory symptoms) focuses on prescribing medications to control inflammation. However,
the vast majority of IBD management occurs between clinic visits, demanding patients’ active participation in
their care. To decrease symptoms and maximize quality of life, IBD patients need to master self-management—
the daily behaviors they must perform to keep their illness under control, minimize its impact on their health, and
cope with comorbid psychological symptoms. IBD-focused self-management interventions hold promise for
improving IBD-related quality of life. However, existing IBD interventions are not based in established theory,
and focus solely on cognitive behavioral therapy or a specific skill, limiting their impact. Further, they are
understudied in patients with active IBD. Research aims: This K23 proposes to develop a self-led digital self-
management intervention for active IBD that will be designed for delivery as part of gastroenterological care. The
central hypothesis is that a theory-driven evidence-based self-management intervention that meets both the
behavioral and psychosocial needs of patients with active IBD (including confidence, motivation, and skills) will
improve IBD-related quality of life and health outcomes. The current research will focus on intervention
development, laying the foundation for testing this hypothesis. In this study, intervention development will be
guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, a process for adapting evidence-based interventions to create self-
management interventions for target populations. Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to develop an in-depth
understanding of factors that affect IBD symptoms and quality of life, and patient preferences related to the
design and delivery of a self-management intervention. Aim 2 will focus on designing and pre-testing the content
and structure of an IBD self-management intervention. Aim 3 will pilot test the IBD self-management intervention
to establish clinical trial feasibility. This process is iterative but not interdependent, providing pilot data for an R01
submission to conduct a larger-scale efficacy study. Training aims: Dr. Cohen-Mekelburg will develop expertise
in (1) select behavioral intervention research concepts to develop self-management interventions for
gastrointestinal conditions, (2) qualitative methods to inform intervention development, and (3) clinical trial
methods for intervention evaluation. In addition to coursework and seminars, Dr. Cohen-Mekelburg will be guided
by a strong mentorship team with a history of collaboration and success. Environment: University of Michigan
offers the ideal environment for this training, with strong institutional commitment and interdisciplinary institutes."

Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus that has
emerged as a common cause of swallowing difficulty in children and adults leading to increased health care
utilization and negatively impacting quality of life. With rapidly increasing prevalence, clinical phenotypes have
emerged including a fibrostenotic phenotype (FS-EoE) defined by characteristic endoscopic appearance,
significant esophageal stiffness and narrowing. This phenotype has had lower treatment response and increased
symptom burden. Management guidelines do not yet provide a paradigm that consider symptom severity or the
presence of fibrostenosis and do not yet incorporate newly approved biologics for EoE. With the recent approval
of biologics targeting pathways implicated in the propagation of inflammation and fibrotic remodeling,
comparative studies that inform patients and providers alike on the effectiveness of alternate treatment strategies
are needed. The purpose of this small R01 proposal is to establish pilot data on the comparative effectiveness
and feasibility of a randomized clinical trial of dupilumab versus swallowed topical corticosteroid, fluticasone, in
the treatment of FS-EoE. This trial proposes the use of a novel and innovative outcome measure of treatment
response, distensibility as measured by EndoFLIP, for its ability to measure changes in esophageal narrowing
and association with patient reported symptoms. Biospecimens collected during the course of this trial, including
esophageal mucosal biopsies and a state-of-the-art Esophageal String Test, will be used to establish a
biorepository linked to trial outcome data to explore next step mechanistic questions related to treatment
response and esophageal remodeling in EoE. Results from this proposed study will lay the foundation for a
definitive multicenter comparative therapeutic trial for the management of FS-EoE."

Summary
Encounters between DNA replication proteins (replisome) and specific genomic lesions invoke requirements
for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) dependent repair by homologous recombination (HR). Replisome conflicts
with endogenous DNA damage also elicit error prone homology directed repair (HDR) mechanisms and
damage tolerance pathways that allow replication through persistent genomic lesions. Such noncanonical HDR
pathways become prominent in BRCA mutated cells. They are also responsible for telomere maintenance in
~15% of human cancers that utilize the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. We have
developed unique systems to investigate the endogenous lesions that provoke BRCA dependent and
independent HDR and have used them to understand how each repair mechanism is initiated and resolved. In
the current R01 funding period, we have demonstrated that (1) loss of the PAR dependent chromatin
remodeler, ALC1, potentiates PARP inhibitor responses by several orders of magnitude specifically in HR
deficient cells, (2) Break induced replication utilizes PCNA-Ub interaction with SNM1A for resection dependent
template switch recombination bypass of polymerase blocking lesions, and (3) BLM helicase activity generates
single-strand DNA at replicating telomeres to promote a damage response that executes ALT. The proposed
research investigates the biochemical basis for these phenomena, and how they process specific endogenous
DNA lesions to provoke either classical or alternative forms of recombination. We utilize approaches to identify
the full spectrum of responses that occur at damaged telomeres and interrogate specific DNA replication
associated structures that ALC1, SNM1A, and BLM act upon to affect repair mechanism. Overlapping genetic
vulnerabilities in ALT and BRCA mutant cells suggest commonality in the repair processes that ensue in each
scenario. Our overarching goals are to delineate molecular events necessary for each process and understand
how classical and alternative mechanisms of homologous recombination intersect in the settings of (1) BRCA
mutation, and (2) during ALT. These objectives will be performed in parallel and with equal emphasis. Our
studies will yield fundamental advances to the understanding cancer genome integrity control."
10883597,"Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) co-infections in children residing in malaria
holoendemic areas have been linked to an increased risk of an EBV-associated cancer called endemic Burkitt
lymphoma (eBL). Most African children are infected with EBV before 1 year of age, yet this B-cell cancer does
not occur until years later. It has been postulated that repeated episodes of malaria ‘suppress’ immunity to
EBV, creating a permissive environment for eBL pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms responsible are not
fully understood. Our prior studies found that malaria-exposed children had pathologically high EBV loads;
naïve-like EBV-specific CD8+ T cells with diminished effector functions; unconventional, innate-like CD8+ T
cells that expressed Granzyme B in lieu of IFN-γ; and an expansion of ‘chronic-infection induced’ CD56neg
Natural Killer (NK) cells with impaired cytotoxicity. Thus, we have identified proximate immunologic alterations
that allow unrestrained EBV replication and eBL tumorigenesis. In this renewal application, we will our central
hypothesis that malaria-induced immunoregulatory mechanisms restrain T cell cytotoxicity against
EBV-infected B cells and eBL tumors. This will be tested by the following Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine
if repeated Pf-malaria infections, known to induce EBV reactivation, lead to increased inhibitory co-
receptor expression on EBV-specific CD8+ αβ T cells. Expression of TIGIT, PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3,
CD160, 2B4, KLRG1, BTLA, on T cell subsets will be measured by flow cytometry. Exhaustion versus
cytotoxicity signatures will be further defined with single cell RNA sequencing, and functional capacity tested in
vitro by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays using EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs).
Aim 2. Determine if repeated Pf-malaria infections induce IL-10 producing CD4+ or CD8+ T cells that
exert an immune-regulatory effect on EBV-specific T cells. The frequency of IL-10 secreting Foxp3neg
regulatory CD25+, CD4+, Tr1 cells (CD49b+, LAG3+, CD226+/DNAM1+), Treg-of-B cells (LAG3+, ICOS+, PD1+,
GITR+, OX40+) and CD8+ CD25neg Foxp3neg T cells will be measured by flow cytometry and RNAseq to
distinguish them from classical CD4+Fox+p3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). CTL assays will determine the impact of
IL-10 cytokine family members on CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, in vitro. Aim 3. Determine if repeated Pf-malaria
infections influence the frequency of γδT to NK cell subsets and how their relative ratios impact
cytotoxicity to eBL tumors. The frequency of γδT and NK cell subsets will be evaluated by flow cytometry
and associated with malaria exposure. Cytotoxicity of γδ T and NK cell subsets will be quantified in vitro
against BL tumors, including our newly established patient-derived eBL cell lines. Ligand-receptor blocking
experiments will evaluate the relative contribution of each subset to overall cytotoxicity. Understanding how
malaria influences the human immunologic landscape, especially in children, will allow us to explore
interventions that modulate regulatory mechanisms while maintaining protective immunity to EBV."
10884002,"Abstract
 Bone fractures, due to aging and disease, contribute significantly to healthcare cost
affecting the quality of life of 32.6 million adults in the US. Clinically, fracture risk can be
predicted by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool.
Because type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients exhibit high bone mineral density, both of these tools
fail to correctly predict fracture risk, leading to a significant increase of fragility fractures in
diabetic subjects. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how modifications in collagen and
other organic components in bone can forecast diabetic fractures. Pentosidine (PEN), a
fluorescent Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE) that forms in bone by reaction between
sugars and proteins, is the only established marker of bone fragility. However, it does not
consistently predict T2D and fragility fractures. Here, for the first time in bone, we demonstrate
the formation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a non-fluorescent AGE associated with
glycoxidative damage and hyperglycemia. We further show that it forms in abundance in bone
and is highly correlated to loss of bone toughness. Preliminary data presented in the proposal
demonstrate that, in contrast to other AGEs, CML is upregulated >60% in T2D human bone
compared to their age-matched controls. We then provide evidence that CML promotes
formation and growth of additional hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, similar to human T2D condition,
and forms a ‘molecular link’ between the organic and inorganic components of bone (collagen-
HA interface) impairing bone quality. CML could therefore be a ‘new and relevant’ biomarker
of T2D fracture that captures the effects of hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in bone
and explains why diabetic bone is susceptible to fracture during overt T2D. Using an
obese and a non-obese mouse model of T2D, that mimic both causality and impact of human
T2D on bone, we provide evidence that T2D increases AGEs, with CML explaining bone
fragility. Similarly, we show that higher serum CML levels are associated with increased risk of
incident clinical and prevalent vertebral fractures in T2D, independent of BMD. Thus, our overall
goal is to establish CML as a new and relevant biomarker of bone fragility and determine how it
contributes to bone fragility in T2D. Using a combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models
we will pursue the following three aims: Aim 1: Evaluate CML as a putative new biomarker of
bone fragility and determine the mechanism(s) by which it reduces energy dissipation in bone;
Aim 2: Determine the contribution of CML and other AGEs to alterations in bone matrix and
energy dissipation in human T2D vertebrae and cortical and cancellous bone from hip fracture
patients.; Aim 3: Validate CML as a biomarker of T2D bone fragility using obese and non-obese
mouse models of T2D and data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC) study. Our
findings will provide a new understanding of the mechanism and the effects of CML and other
AGEs on bone fractures leading to new strategies to predict, manage and mitigate T2D and
fragility fractures."

 Quadriga Biosciences’ new small molecule therapeutic, QBS-72S, combines a DNA alkylating moiety with
an amino acid analogue that leverages the L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1) to achieve transport across
the blood brain barrier (BBB) and selective accumulation in tumor cells. Results from preclinical studies suggest
QBS-72S is likely effective against brain metastases (brain mets) resulting from multiple cancer types, including
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Currently, treatment for brain mets in patients with TNBC is limited to
surgical intervention or radiotherapy, and drug development has been unsuccessful due to the challenge of
transporting effective agents across the BBB. In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, Quadriga proposes to conduct a
Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with brain mets resulting from TNBC to test the safety and
efficacy of QBS-72S using a Simon’s two-stage design. Data from this study is expected to inform the design of
a pivotal Phase 3 trial. Aim. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of QBS-72S in TBNC patients with brain
metastases. Up to 25 patients with TNBC and brain mets will be identified by physicians at Stanford University
and its referral network based on contrast MRI of the brain. Participants will be treated with the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of QBS-72S administered intravenously every four weeks for up to 2 years. Tumor growth
will be assessed by MRI the day prior to each administration for the first four months and every other month
thereafter. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients with ≤ 25% growth
in tumor size, no change in tumor size, or reduction in tumor size) at 3 months. Secondary endpoints include
overall survival, length of progression-free survival, response of systemic disease, adverse events, and changes
in lab-assessed patient parameters. Milestones: Using a Simon's two-stage Minimax design, if two or more of
the first 15 evaluable TNBC patients treated with QBS-72S achieve an objective tumor response
, the study will
enroll 10 additional patients. If six or more patients (out of 25 total) have an objective tumor response within 3
months after initiating therapy, we will meet with the FDA to discuss the design of a registration trial for patients
with brain mets resulting from TNBC. Impact—Successful completion of these studies will establish the
foundation for a subsequent Phase 3 clinical trial. If QBS-72S proves efficacious in treating brain mets in patients
with TNBC, it would be the first chemotherapeutic agent available specifically for this population. Findings of
efficacy would also support further exploration into using QBS-72S to treat patients with other brain metastatic
cancers, including lung cancer and melanoma. In addition, since LAT1 is highly expressed on many other forms
of aggressive cancer, QBS-72S may be suitable for treating both systemic cancers and CNS metastases,
especially in diseases like TNBC where there are few therapeutic options."
10891427,"Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a major public health burden. Over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. alone, with as many as 64% complicated by CSA-AKI. Those who develop CSA-AKI have a 6- to 18-fold higher acute mortality compared to those without CSA-AKI. No pharmacologic therapy reliably prevents or treats CSA-AKI. Based on a strong pathophysiologic rationale from both animal models and human studies, we propose that hepcidin and other heme/iron regulatory proteins play a key role in CSA-AKI.
In Aims 1 and 2, we will leverage the CABG Genomics Project, a large prospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery. CABG Genomics collected detailed clinical data and biospecimens, including plasma/serum samples pre- and postoperatively at multiple time points. In Aim 1, we will measure plasma hepcidin preoperatively in 2,000 patients to test its association with CSA-AKI. We will use multivariable models to adjust for potential confounders, including plasma IL-6. We will externally validate our findings using samples from the TRIBE-AKI study, which enrolled 1219 high-risk adults who underwent cardiac surgery at 6 sites in North America. In Aim 2, we will measure plasma hepcidin, free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, transferrin saturation, and ferritin longitudinally in a nested 1:1 case-control study (n=600) to test whether early changes in these markers are independently associated with CSA-AKI.
In Aim 3, we will enroll 250 high-risk adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at three major hospitals in Boston. We will isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells pre- and postoperatively to investigate the relationship between monocyte expression of ferroportin and other heme/iron regulatory proteins, examined by flow cytometry, with CSA-AKI. We will also assess whether early postoperative changes in monocyte expression of ferroportin and other heme/iron regulatory proteins are associated with CSA-AKI.
Investigating the hepcidin-ferroportin-iron axis and other heme/iron regulatory proteins in the setting of CSA-AKI could have actionable implications for the design of future trials to prevent CSA-AKI. Unlike many other markers previously examined in CSA-AKI, those proposed here are directly involved in the pathogenesis of CSA-AKI and are targetable. This proposal will help determine the therapeutic strategy targeting disordered iron homeostasis that has the highest likelihood of success. If low preoperative hepcidin is confirmed as an independent risk factor for CSA-AKI, prophylactic administration of hepcidin agonists, which are currently in development, could be tested in future studies of CSA-AKI prevention. Alternatively, if the proposed studies reveal that other heme/iron regulatory proteins (e.g., haptoglobin, CD163, HO-1) have a greater influence on CSA-AKI than hepcidin/ferroportin, therapeutic strategies targeting these proteins could be tested."

NVC impact and desire for intervention and identify combinations of individual differences most predictive of

develop community-drafted guidelines for NVC intervention development. Contributions will be significant be-

10891490,"Despite major advances in global health care, there were an estimated 1.5 millions deaths and 10 million new
cases of tuberculosis (TB) in 2018. Nearly 1 million people living with HIV developed tuberculosis (TB). Co-
infection with HIV and TB is associated with high morbidity and mortality and treatment with TB drugs and anti-
retroviral (ART) therapy is now universally available. TB drug treatment followed by ART improves long term
survival, particularly among those whose immune systems are severely suppressed from HIV infection. Signs
and symptoms of disease improve soon after treatment is started but, in many cases, disease can recur and
appear clinically worse as the immune system is being re-established from ART. This is known as TB-
associated Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (TB-IRIS) and is more common among patients
with severely suppressed immune systems before treatment and those who have a short time interval between
starting TB treatment and ART. Very little is known about how or why TB-IRIS occurs and how to best to treat
or even prevent it. We hypothesize that symptoms of TB-IRIS are driven by the dynamic interaction between
the immune system, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the bacteria that causes TB) and HIV deep within
infected tissues in the body such as the lung granuloma. Virtually nothing is known about what happens in the
tissues where both Mtb and HIV interact during TB-IRIS. This proposal will develop an animal model of TB-
IRIS by taking advantage of our pre-existing model of HIV-TB co-infection in which animals with SIV-Mtb co-
infection undergo TB drug treatment and ART just like humans. We will use sophisticated imaging,
immunology and microbiologic tools to better understand how and why TB-IRIS develops and what factors can
predict its emergence. Aim 1 will determine how often TB-IRIS occurs in this model and to what extent Mtb and
SIV remain in the tissues during treatment. We will also perform a detailed examination of the changes that
occur in the tissues but especially the lungs (granulomas) and lymph nodes through serial in vivo images to
better understand the events that lead to TB-IRIS and its predictors. In Aim 2, we will perform a detailed
examination of the immunologic events in the tissues and blood during TB-IRIS. Tissue specific (lung
granulomas and lymph nodes) immune responses will be correlated with the amount of Mtb bacteria and virus
with the imaging findings so that we can better understand the causes of TB-IRIS. Our short term goal is to
better understand the pathogenesis of TB-IRIS in this proposal and these findings will ultimately lead to better
treatment and prevention of TB-IRIS which is our long term goal."
10891522,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cisplatin (Cis)-based Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care prior to cystectomy, for patients
with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Up to 30% of patients respond and show no residual tumor at
cystectomy with >80% survival, but “non responders” have <30% chance of surviving 5 years. Thus, improving
the effectiveness of Cis-based NAC will greatly improve outcomes in BC. Through whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9
synthetic lethal screens in Cis-resistant human BC cell lines, we discovered NPEPPS as a novel and druggable
target whose expression determines sensitivity to Cis. NPEPPS was the only one of 13 M1 aminopeptidases
found to be synthetic lethal with Cis. Depletion of NPEPPS enhanced Cis therapy and reduced growth in animal
models. To find how NPEPPS drives these two phenotypes, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the
proteins that are in complex with NPEPPS in BC cells. We found NPEPPS in complex with subunits (LRRC8A-
E) of the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), a recently identified mechanism of platinum (Pt) cellular
import. In BC cells, LRRC8A/D depletion increases resistance to both cisplatin and carboplatin, while NPEPPS
depletion had the opposite effect. Supporting a role in human BC growth, NPEPPS expression is associated with
poor patient outcome regardless of chemotherapy use. Leveraging our MS results, we developed an approach
to prioritize candidate genes found in complex with NPEPPS that most likely affect growth, are associated with
aggressive disease, and are prognostic markers. Thus, we propose the Guiding Hypothesis that NPEPPS
drives Pt resistance and tumor growth in BC by inhibiting VRAC activity and interacting with genes regulating
cell proliferation respectively. Specific Aims test this hypothesis with the Objective to lay the foundation for
novel approaches to improve the outcomes for BC patients. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that NPEPPS
aminopeptidase activity is required for Pt resistance and growth using enzymatically dead NPEPPS mutants in
vitro and in vivo. Next, we evaluate our top candidate gene CHD2, a chromatin regulator and putative tumor
suppressor for its role in NPEPPS-driven tumor growth and the dependency of this role on NPEPPS enzymatic
activity. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of LRRC8A/D in NPEPPS-mediated Pt resistance. We have used
molecular modeling to identify residues on NPEPPS that interact with LRRC8A/D. Site-directed mutagenesis of
these residues will test the hypothesis that direct interaction of NPEPPS with LRRC8A/D reduces the ability of
VRACs to properly function and contributes to NPEPPS-mediated Pt resistance in vitro and in vivo. To establish
the preclinical rationale for the effect of novel, anti-neoplastic agents that circumvent Pt resistance, Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that Tosedostat (Tose), a clinically well-tolerated aminopeptidase inhibitor, enhances the
sensitivity of BC to Pt, and NPEPPS expression is required for this. The impact of Tose on BC cells ± NPEPPS
expression will be examined for growth, Pt sensitivity and import in vivo in human BC models of localized and
metastatic disease. Organoids derived from patient tumors before Cis-based NAC, will be tested with Pt ± Tose."

The Weill Cornell Medicine Clinical and Translational Science Center’s (CTSC) future strategies are built on the
considerable accomplishments achieved over the last 14 years, providing the translation of research and the
generation of research ideas that pave the way for future innovations despite the effect of the pandemic on the
medical school, with the city in lockdown for over 14 months. The plans for the next five years are devised to
continue to develop the existing infrastructure and its initiatives, to add new ones, to enhance networking, and
to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. In so doing, we will continue to advance translational science to
improve community health. With our multi-institutional hub of distinguished partners firmly in place, the strategic
plans for the CTSC are geared to rapidly advance translational science discovery by: 1) Enhancing informatics
to increase resource adoption, reduce roadblocks and streamline workflow through training, novel software, and
new collaborations; 2) Improving health inequities, developing strong translational research engagement with
communites, and preparing for health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, where the CTSC organized a
vaccination hesitancy program and set up vaccination sites in underserved communities; 3) Continuing to
develop our highly successful clinical and translational education programs through innovative and
entrepreneurial multifaceted initiatives including training in health disparities and a new cross-hub KL2/TL1
collaboration with the Georgetown/Howard CTSA; and 4) Creating Team Science initiatives that promote
inclusion across the CTSC. Innovative didactic opportunities will continue to be offered and expanded, such as
seminars on innovation and entrepreneurship, the newest of which will be a collaborate with eLab on “Unmet
Needs for Stimulating Device Development,” a five-part series which is designed to stimulate device
development. The Pilot Translational and Clinical Studies program will be enhanced to target projects in device
and therapeutics development, precision medicine and research in special populations while promoting
collaborations between the community, community organizations and CTSC Investigators. The CTSC also offers
educative opportunities that reach the broader community such as our Teaching Ethics Through Art program,
while the Special Population Network (SPN) will expand to include community outreach studies and continue
clinical research studies with a focus on the following populations: children, the elderly, ethnic and racial
minorities and those with disabilities. Additionally, the Network Capacity Component will do more outreach to
encourage local investigators to initiate multi-center clinical trials. The CTSC has also been extremely successful
ensuring the availability of biostatisticians from all partners with expertise in diverse disease systems and with
adequate computational resources to support the design and conduct of research studies performed within the
CTSC. All of these initiatives allow the CTSC to accomplish its goal of translating science to improve public
health more effectively and efficiently.

 Candida albicans is a frequent commensal of the human microbiota and an important opportunistic
pathogen. This fungus is chameleon-like in its ability to grow in alternative cellular states and different
morphological forms, and this plasticity is critical for infection of diverse niches in the body. Here, we
examine the transcriptional regulation of cell fate decisions that drive key developmental programs in C.
albicans including filamentation, biofilm formation, and phenotypic switching. Each of these programs
contributes to the ability of this fungus to colonize and/or cause disease in the mammalian host. Previous
studies have identified multiple transcription factors (TFs) that regulate these developmental programs and
showed that they act together in highly coordinated networks to drive gene expression. However, a major
knowledge gap exists as to how cell fate-defining TFs act together in a coordinated manner rather than as
individual entities. To address this gap, we highlight preliminary data revealing that network TFs can
undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and demonstrate that this process enables the formation of
complexes containing multiple network TFs. We further show that phase separation is driven by prion-like
domains (PrLDs) present in each TF and, critically, that targeted mutation of these domains can abolish
both LLPS and TF function.
 To build on these exciting observations, experiments outlined in Aim 1 will determine how the
composition of PrLDs promotes LLPS and the formation of multifactorial complexes in vitro and in cells.
We also address how changes in LLPS relate to the function of C. albicans TFs within key networks,
including those controlling phenotypic switching and biofilm formation. In Aim 2, we will identify additional
regulators of C. albicans cell fate using an overexpression library covering all TFs in the C. albicans
genome. Preliminary data indicates that multiple novel regulators can be uncovered by this approach, and
newly identified TFs will be integrated into existing transcriptional networks using a variety of approaches
including the use of complex haploinsufficiency (CHI) analysis. In Aim 3, we examine how phase
separation of C. albicans TFs impacts their function during commensalism and pathogenesis by testing
mutant TFs in murine models of infection. These experiments will be facilitated by a barcode sequencing
(barcode-SEQ) approach in which multiple strains can be evaluated in parallel for their competitive fitness.
 Together, these studies will lead to new insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which
transcription factors regulate cell fate decisions in C. albicans, with an emphasis on how LLPS enables the
formation of functional, multifactorial TF complexes. We will also identify novel TFs in these networks and
test these TFs for their role in infectivity. Given the central role of TFs in regulating C. albicans cell fate,
these studies will identify new targets for therapeutic intervention against this important human pathobiont."
10898434,"In the U.S., substance use disorders (SUDs) cost more than $820 billion dollars a year and continue to present
significant challenges to health and justice systems [1, 2]. Although there are clinically effective
pharmacotherapies for numerous drugs of misuse there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for cocaine
use disorder (CUD), despite decades of preclinical research. The lack of effective medications for CUD
suggests that there are gaps in translatability between preclinical and clinical research. One possible cause of
this gap is the fact that most individuals with CUD are using more than one drug at the same time [3]. One
substance that is commonly co-used with cocaine is alcohol and estimates suggest that up to 90% of
individuals who misuse cocaine also co-use alcohol [4, 5]. While the mechanistic basis of alcohol and cocaine
co-use is still poorly understood, research suggests that ethanol may enhance cocaine’s elevation of striatal
dopamine concentrations, thus increasing cocaine’s reinforcing effects [6]. It is also important to note that the
co-use of cocaine and alcohol is associated with more severe cocaine dependence, higher rates of psychiatric
co-morbidities, and poorer treatment outcomes [7-9]. Despite this, the vast majority of substance abuse
research has focused on the use of cocaine or alcohol in isolation, which may limit the clinical translatability of
research findings. Given this, the aims of this NRSA are to characterize the effects of ethanol on vulnerability to
cocaine reinforcement (Aim 1), to examine how ethanol influences maladaptive cocaine choice in the presence
of an alternative reinforcer (Aim 2), and to explore a potential pharmacotherapy for cocaine and alcohol co-use
(Aim 3) in a translational nonhuman primate model of substance use. I hypothesize that ethanol consumption
will enhance the potency of cocaine reinforcement, resulting in greater sensitivity in studies of acquisition and
the ability of alternative non-drug reinforcers to decrease cocaine choice. I also hypothesize that a combination
of modafinil analog JJC8-091 and naltrexone will reduce both cocaine and ethanol self-administration. These
findings will build on other data providing evidence as to why people co-use multiple drugs (e.g., enhance
reinforcement) and how the study of pharmacological interventions need to consider these conditions."

Developing a vaccine that elicits HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) remains a top priority in HIV
vaccine design. However, typically HIV bnAbs originate from rare B-cell germline precursors (‘UCAs’) and
require improbable somatic hypermutations (SHM) in HIV+ human repertoires. To reproducibly activate such
B-cells, ‘Germline Targeting’ (GT) vaccine priming strategies appear to be useful for activating specific bnAb
UCAs particularly in polyclonal systems including rhesus macaques, a key preclinical animal model. We
recently developed a novel membrane (m)Env liposome (MEL) platform using mEnvs that contain GT
mutations. One novel GT-MEL regimen targets a ‘CDRH3 dominated’ nAb response to the CD4-binding site
(CD4bs) and reproducibly elicited tier 2 serum neutralization in CH103 UCA knockin (KI) mice after only two
boosts. This GT-MEL regimen offers an alternative to the more commonly studied VH restricted CD4BS cluster
often targeted by soluble (s)Env immunogens. Meanwhile, we have generated GT-MELs based on described
GT-sEnvs that have been reported previously to elicit VH-restricted CD4BS HIV nAbs, i.e., activation of CH235
bnAb UCA in KI mice and possible CH235 homologs in macaques. The overall objective of this proposal is use
novel GT-MELs to elicit HCDR3-dominated and VH restricted CD4BS responses in rhesus macaques, in
addition to responses targeting HIV’s Fusion Peptide (FP). We will test a hypothesis that a CD4BS CDRH3-
dominated plus VH-restricted CD4BS GT-MEL prime-boost regimen tested in macaques will elicit serum
neutralization against tier 2 HIV (SA1). In SA2, we will use a fusion peptide nanoparticle (FP-NP) ‘pre-prime’
strategy followed by BG505 variant MEL boosting regimen designed to elicit tier 2 serum neutralization based
in part on a prior report by others using a sEnv immunization protocol that elicited tier 2 serum neutralization
and FP bnAbs. In Phase 2 of this ‘Innovation’ grant proposal, we will use the results of the above studies to
integrate the CD4BS (CH505) MEL and FP (BG505) vaccine approaches into one regimen meant to elicit HIV
nAbs to both the CD4BS and the FP supersites. These studies, will reveal the serum HIV nAb breadth that can
be elicited by the MEL vaccine platform in rhesus macaques against multiple overlapping targets on the
CD4BS and FP, and may inform the development of an HIV vaccine for humans.

An estimated 43% of children under age 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience
compromised development due to poverty, poor nutrition, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Numerous
early childhood development (ECD) parenting interventions have been shown to be effective at improving ECD
outcomes, at least in the short-term, but they are a) still too expensive to implement at scale in low-resource
and rural settings, and b) their early impacts tend to fade over time in the absence of continued support. New
ways to deliver effective ECD parenting interventions are sorely needed that are both low-cost to be potentially
scalable, while also able to sustain impacts long-term.
The rapid growth and low cost of mobile communications in LMIC settings presents a potentially promising
solution to the competing problems of scalability and sustainability. Yet there is no rigorous research on
mobile-health (mHealth) interventions for ECD outcomes in LMIC settings. We recently showed that an 8-
month ECD parenting intervention featuring fortnightly group meetings delivered by Community Health
Workers (CHWs) from Kenya's rural health care system significantly improved child cognitive, language, and
socioemotional development as well as parenting practices, and our group-based delivery model was more
cost-effective than previous ECD interventions. Yet it is still too expensive for scaling in a rural LMIC setting
such as ours, particularly if we need interventions that can be extended for longer periods of time to increase
their ability to sustain impacts. Our proposed study experimentally tests a traditional in-person delivery model
for an ECD parenting intervention against two mHealth-based delivery models that partially or almost fully
substitute remote delivery for in-person meetings. Kenya is an ideal setting for testing mHealth programs given
its high penetration of mobile phones (94%). We will assess the relative effectiveness and costs of these
mHealth delivery models against a purely in-person model, and extend the interventions over two years to
increase their ability to sustain changes in child outcomes longer term. Our evaluation design is a non-
inferiority clustered Randomized Control Trial across 60 CHWs and 1200 households in which we will use an
adaptive trial design to allow for midcourse review and feedback on the remote delivery models. By testing
three interventions that vary in how much in-person delivery is substituted by remote-delivery, we can assess
the degree of substitutability or complementarity to inform the design of more scalable and sustainable
interventions. Our goal is to determine the best model to maximize the intervention's reach and sustained
impacts to improve child outcomes. By integrating delivery into the ongoing operations of local CHWs within
Kenya's rural health care system, utilizing new low-cost technology, and involving local ECD policymakers and
stakeholders as key collaborators from the project's inception, our project has the potential to make important
contributions towards discovering potentially scalable, sustainable solutions for resource-limited settings."
10899731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mechanical properties of the cornea determine the structural characteristics of the ocular globe and may be
altered in several devastating disease states, including axial elongation in myopia, pathological deformation in
keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. Accurate measurement of corneal
biomechanics with high spatial resolution would not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests,
e.g., measuring intraocular pressure or assessing effects of drug therapies, but also predict the development of
posterior eye diseases, such as glaucoma. Currently, there is no available reliable method to perform quantitative
measurement of corneal elasticity in vivo and with high resolution. Here we propose a novel method for a “no-
touch” assessment of corneal elastic properties. Such a technology, termed heart-beat optical coherence
elastography (hbOCE), could revolutionize methods for routine corneal examination, bringing additional
mechanical information and warrant rapid clinical adaptation.
The project has four primary Specific Aims:
Aim 1 is focused on the development of a hbOCE system capable of high-speed volumetric measurement of
corneal deformation under small intrinsic IOP changes.
Aim 2 will test the developed system in the eyes ex vivo.
Aim 3 will test the system in eyes in vivo in rabbits.
Aim 4 will perform in vivo human studies to refine measurement methods for broader clinical use.
The proposed project will make fundamental advances in the understanding of corneal biomechanics through a
novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g., corneal surgery, LASIK, corneal
cross-linking, corneal transplants, personalized treatments). Most importantly, the proposed studies will
accelerate the transition of ocular elastography into clinics, influence our selection and application of corneal
surgical treatments, and will help us understand the structural consequences of corneal diseases and wound
healing."
10900574,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness,
hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a
decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this
important public health issue.
Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior.
For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected.
Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need
to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of
Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems
and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic
health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is
an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges.
In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers
among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a
pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the
following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk
groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2:
To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the
identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising
nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults.
In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim
1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized
nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate
the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice
characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design."
10900575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Precision engineering of the gut microbiota requires a mechanistic understanding of how microbes interact with
host physiological pathways in order to produce desired health outcomes. In stunted children, commensal gut
microbes have been correlated with aberrant host inflammation and growth impairment, but mechanisms
underlying these associations are poorly understood. Mouse models have suggested causality, but they fail to
recapitulate the dynamics of the mucosal immune system in humans and the complexity of the human gut
microbiota. This project will interrogate these questions in vivo in a cohort of >1500 children from rural
Bangladesh at risk for stunting, for which biological specimens were collected longitudinally from 0-3 years of
age. Preliminary analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences from >3700 fecal samples collected from these children
has identified a Bifidobacterium sequence variant that is highly correlated with intestinal inflammation and
subsequent growth faltering. In Aim 1, I will identify strain-specific microbial genes that might mediate these
observed associations. In Aim 2, I will interrogate the mechanistic underpinnings by evaluating microbial small-
molecule metabolites in feces and blood associated with high levels of Bifidobacterium and concurrent gut and/or
systemic inflammation in children 14 months old. In Aim 3, I will use advanced latent variable statistical modeling
to determine the importance of associated groups of microbial (taxonomic, metagenomic, and metabolic) and
host (gut and systemic inflammation) features on future growth faltering. I will also estimate the maximum
achievable improvement in child growth from a theoretical, 100% efficacious microbiota-manipulation
intervention, providing an expected effect size for comparison with other intervention alternatives. This work will
increase our mechanistic understanding of the associations between early life gut microbiota and aberrant
intestinal/systemic inflammation as well as future growth faltering, producing new options for predictably
manipulating the gut microbiota to mitigate adverse health outcomes. The proposed project will provide a
rigorous training experience in the fields of gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, multivariate statistics, and
pediatric gastroenterology under the mentorship of a group of scientific experts, and will equip me with the skills
necessary to become an independent researcher."
10902125,"ABSTRACT– Dissemination and Partnership Core
The Dissemination and Partnership Core uses novel participatory methods to engage the autistic community
while simultaneously developing the careers of researchers from diverse backgrounds and lived experiences.
In these efforts, the primary aims of the Dissemination and Partnership Core are to: (1) Establish and convene
the Autistic Partners Group to enhance all Center community engagement, dissemination, and training
activities. We will use participatory methods to establish the Autistic Partners Group, a team of diverse autistic
community members that will partner with investigators for all community engagement, dissemination, and
training efforts. Convening of the Autistic Partners Group will be co-facilitated by a researcher and autistic
community leader ten times annually; (2) Create an inclusive and supportive research environment that attends
to intersectionality and prioritizes engaging diverse autistic adults and their allies. Using messaging co-
developed in our Autistic Partners Group (Specific Aim 1), we will engage with community partners to prioritize
participation by autistic adults from groups that have been marginalized (e.g. racial and ethnic identities,
female sex, LGBTQIA+ community, intellectual disability, and rural and under-resourced communities). Using
established partnerships, we will engage in community activities, such as ‘pop-up’ events and registering a
booth at the local Pride festival, to increase visibility and enhance recruitment efforts in intersectional
communities; (3) Partner with autistic adults to co-develop materials for disseminating research to autistic and
neurodiverse communities. We will partner with local autistic adults to co-develop dissemination materials (e.g.
infographics; photographic representation; videography; social stories; the Center website) to distribute in the
community; (4) Speed the translation of research to practice by disseminating findings to community-based
providers serving autistic adults. Each year, we will host a continuing education seminar series on mental
health and suicide risk of autistic adults across 4 different practitioner settings (i.e. psychiatric hospitals,
primary care providers, post-secondary education and vocational rehabilitation, and community mental health
clinics); (5) Enhance the scientific community by disseminating our research of impact broadly; and (6)
Enhance diversity in the autism scientific community by developing careers of students and early career
investigators. We will facilitate monthly Center-wide career development seminars and writing clubs for all
Center trainees, with an emphasis on supporting new investigators from diverse and disadvantaged
backgrounds. The Dissemination and Partnership core will work together with the Clinical Core to prioritize
research participation by autistic adults from groups that have been marginalized. This will simultaneously
expand and strengthen our community partnerships while enhancing recruitment of diverse autistic adults. This
participatory approach will address existing structural inequities in autism research, by centering the voices of
the autistic community and increasing diversity in sampling pools and among scientific researchers."
10902127,"Clinical Core Abstract
The purpose of the Clinical Core is 1): To manage recruitment activities and consent and enroll a Pittsburgh
ACE Cohort for participation in the three Projects. We will prioritize increased participation by individuals
traditionally minoritized in ASD research (e.g., race/ethnicity, LGBTQIA+, females, and diagnosis of ASD in
adulthood); 2): Administer, score, and enter data for ASD diagnostic assessments and administer all RFA-
required and center-wide phenotypic measures; 3) Apply a novel posterior probability of diagnosis (PPOD)
index to estimate the presence of psychiatric diagnoses and ASD; 4) Establish age-related variables for use
across Projects, including a biomarker of brain age and documentation of age of ASD diagnosis; 5) Manage
scheduling of participants for all Projects. 6) Support retention of participants and monitor progress through
Projects; 7) Monitor risks related to suicidality and other adverse events, and 8) To collaborate with other
Cores and Projects. The Core will enroll 200 autistic and 100 non-autistic 18- to 65-year-old adults (>50 in
each group with a recent history of suicidal ideation or behaviors [SI/SB], defined as active SI/SB within the
past four months). We anticipate needing to consent and assess approximately 100 additional individuals to
account for those who do not meet inclusion criteria. Those meeting study inclusion criteria will be invited to
participate in all three Projects. Our team has consistently met recruitment goals for numerous NIH-funded
studies of autistic adults, we have active partnerships with several registries for autistic and non-autistic adults,
and we will collaborate with the Dissemination and Partnership Core to enhance our inclusion of autistic adults
from groups that have been marginalized. The Clinical Core organizes the extensive recruitment effort to
assure the Projects meet their targeted enrollments and complete their proposed studies, while assuring all the
data mandated by the ACE funding mechanism is collected. The centralization of these services in a Core
combines the recruitment resources that would otherwise be distributed across Projects, thereby reducing the
redundancy and inefficiency that would occur if each Project had to perform these efforts individually.
Research-reliable Clinical Core staff will conduct ASD diagnostic and cognitive assessments using the tools
outlined in the RFA; this also creates an efficient process and supports the collaboration of investigators new to
autism in this ACE center. Finally, Clinical Core staff are highly experienced in the assessment of SI/SB and
psychiatric diagnoses and will monitor for suicide-related risks."
10902129,"ABSTRACT- Project 1
Suicide rates in autistic adults are alarming high in recent research; 4- 72% have endorsed suicidal ideation
and 4-33% have engaged in suicidal behavior or attempts. Both scientific and advocacy groups have endorsed
research for effective suicidality assessment and identification of risk factors. However, existing suicidality
screening measures do not seem to function in the same way for autistic adults, and to date, no research has
used a measure of suicide risk rather than a screen of imminent risk. Adaptation of existing suicide screens
may be insufficient, given evidence that autistic adults may have unique risk factors, such as camouflaging of
autistic traits and autistic burnout. This study will develop a suicidality measure for autistic adults, the Autism
Suicidality Inventory, that will capture a continuum of suicide risk. Autistic adults and their allies will refine an
item pool, and 25 autistic adults (at least 10 of which with suicidality) will complete cognitive interviews of the
drafted items to ensure clarity and comprehension. A sample of 1000 autistic and non-autistic adults will
complete the drafted questionnaire and a related online battery of measures to evaluate the dimensionality of
the item pool, conduct Item Response Theory calibration, and compare existing suicide measures to the
proposed questionnaire via IRT co-calibration. A subsample of 300 autistic and non-autistic participants (the
ACE core sample) will repeat the measure every two months for a year, and cross-project analyses will
examine whether those who report more suicidality baseline also report more suicidal ideation in daily life,
model suicide risk over time via latent growth models, and identify factors that are most strongly associated
with suicidality trajectories. The Autism Suicidality Inventory will be the first validated suicide propensity
measure developed for ASD, designed with input from autistic adults and capturing a continuum of risk via an
emphasis on processes that relate to risk. The availability of such a measure is essential to inform intervention
development to improve safety and quality of life."
10902130,"Suicidal ideation and behavior, non-suicidal self-injury, and impulsive aggression are highly prevalent in autistic
adults. These difficulties are proposed to arise from emotion dysregulation (ED), including problems flexibly up-
regulating or sustaining positive valence systems or down-regulating negative valence systems. However,
there is limited prior research on ED among autistic adults. Findings from the scant prior studies on emotional
reactivity and regulation in autism have been mixed, including evidence of patterns of both hyper- and hypo-
reactivity across multiple response systems (i.e., physiology, behavior, and self-report), which may vary as a
function of individual differences and context. Despite the clinical significance of ED for autistic adults, how and
why ED manifests in autistic adults and the significance of either hyper- or hypo-reactivity for real-life functional
outcomes remain poorly understood. To address these gaps, we will assess ED using a 14-day ecological
momentary assessment protocol with continuous ambulatory monitoring of parasympathetic and sympathetic
nervous system activity in a sample of 200 autistic adults and 100 non-autistic adults (both groups
oversampled for suicidality). Specifically, we will characterize how ED emerges in a variety of contexts across
response systems (i.e., subjective, behavior, physiology) in daily life, and how ED components may
dynamically contribute to proximal risk for subsequent suicide ideation, self-injury, and impulsive aggression as
a function of both autism and suicidality history. Findings will reveal aspects of ED that are unique to autism
versus those that are common across autistic and non-autistic individuals at risk for suicide. Our cross-project
integrative aim will identify individual and subgroup patterns of ED processes that characterize distinctive risk
groups. Linking ED components to real-world outcomes of clinical significance using physiologically-triggered
EMA will allow us to characterize and evaluate the functional significance of different patterns of ED
components and identify near-term risk and resilience processes in a temporally sensitive manner. Findings
will lead to novel treatment targets and just-in-time intervention strategies prior to onset or escalation of ED
and associated deleterious outcomes."
10902131,"Abstract
Autism is frequently characterized by hyper-reactivity to emotional and intense stimuli, but also, apparent
shutting down or blunted reactions, consistent with hypo-reactivity. This project uses neuroimaging to test a
mechanistic model in which the same individuals display hyper-reactivity in brain networks responsible for
perceiving emotional and sensory information, but inability to recruit neural mechanisms responsible for
physiological and behavioral regulatory responses (i.e., apparent hypo-reactivity). This combination yields
inwardly sustained, but outwardly blunted reactions akin to being locked in, “screaming inside” while unable to
use typical executive, motor, and social mechanisms to regulate these experiences. N=200 autistic and 100
non-autistic individuals will complete tasks involving hearing criticism and praise, naming the valence of
emotional words in alternation with cognitive tasks, and seeing visually intense full-field images as well as
resting state assessment. Aims include assessment of early hyper-reactivity in brain systems responsible for
perception and emotion generation, and subsequent hypo-connectivity and hypo-reactivity with regions that
facilitate regulatory control cognitively, socially, and through motor actions. An integrative mechanistic neural
network model will be used to examine whether this formulation could yield individual differences in ecological
momentary assessment, ambulatory psychophysiology, and self-reported suicidality in the other projects. The
potential significance of this work is to dispel the idea that autistic individuals have blunted reactions, and
rather to say that their brains are very reactive, and they cannot effectively express or cope with this reactivity.
This formulation could lead to different approaches to intervention than are currently available to the autistic
community."
10899270,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal is in direct response to NIMH’s Strategic Goal 1, which aims to define the
brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors by using new techniques and multidisciplinary approaches to
characterize the cellular and circuit components contributing to brain organization and function. The primary goal
of this training proposal is to dissect the neurocircuitry of local projections to the locus coeruleus (LC) from
GABAergic pericoeruleus (peri-LC) neurons in hyperarousal and avoidance behaviors. The LC has been
implicated in regulating these physiological and behavioral responses, with increased norepinephrine (NE)
resulting in increased arousal levels and anxiety-like behaviors. Recent evidence from our lab suggests that peri-
LCGABA neurons directly inhibit the LC and respond heterogeneously to different aversive stimuli. However, a
direct relationship is not yet established between peri-LCGABA activity, LCNE activity, and aversive behavioral and
physiological outputs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an ensemble of peri-LCGABA neurons
coordinates LCNE activity during acute stress exposure in an anti-correlated manner, which induces stimulus-
dependent changes in arousal levels and drives avoidance behaviors. The first aim of this training proposal
seeks to characterize the modulation of noradrenergic LC activity by local GABAergic projections during acute
stress exposure and examine the resulting changes in arousal levels and avoidance behaviors. Aim 1A uses in
vivo 2-photon calcium imaging to observe LCNE and peri-LCGABA activity in response to acute stressors. Aim 1B
uses clustering methods to assess the relationship between LCNE and peri-LCGABA activity during each stimulus,
while Aim 1C reinforces the specific role of peri-LCGABA activity in the stress-induced modulation of LCNE activity
by using a generalized linear model to predict LCNE activity from peri-LCGABA responses to aversive stimuli. The
second aim of this training proposal seeks to determine how arousal levels and avoidance behaviors are
coordinated by changes in LCNE and peri-LCGABA activity. Aim 2A uses designer receptors exclusively activated
by designer drugs (DREADDs) in conjunction with 2-photon imaging to assess how tonic activation or inhibition
of LCNE neurons alters avoidance behaviors and phasic LCNE activity in response to aversive stimuli. Aim 2B will
modulate peri-LCGABA activity while monitoring LCNE activity using 2-photon imaging to evaluate how changes in
peri-LCGABA activity during acute stress exposure alter LCNE activity, arousal levels, and avoidance behaviors.
During my training period, I will learn to utilize cutting-edge biological and computational techniques to perform
powerful, high-resolution investigations of neural circuitry, and I will gain valuable career development skills
through a wide variety of scientific, intellectual, and mentored opportunities. This F31 proposal is specifically
tailored to my needs and will allow me to fully engage in my individual development plan and prepare me for a
successful career as an independent neuroscientist."
10983468,"Our goal is to continue the Intermountain West Clinical Center for the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) at the University of Utah and Primary Children’s Hospital. During the previous funding cycle, we enrolled and retained a significant number of participants, achieved outstanding site performance, and participated in a highly collaborative manner in all Network activities. Additionally, during the previous funding cycle, we transferred, aligned, and processed genomic sequences in support of Network genomics efforts. We prioritized gene variants likely to contribute to liver disease and shared these results with ChiLDReN investigators for experimental validation studies. For the next funding cycle we propose two aims. In Aim 1, we will continue to enroll infants, children, and adolescents in with primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary atresia; continue longitudinal follow up of previously enrolled participants in ChiLDReN’s legacy protocols; continue to submit valuable biological specimens and accurate and timely data; and collaboratively participate in all Network activities. In Aim 2, we will continue to support and coordinate Network genomics efforts including sharing of genomic data with Network investigators as outlined by Network policies; supporting the Scientific Data Coordinating Center’s compliance with genomic data sharing policies; and/or implementing innovative scientific approaches using genomic data the Network will adopt during the next iteration of ChiLDReN. Accomplishing the proposed aims as a highly collaborative Center for ChiLDReN will lead to new knowledge regarding the biochemistry, physiology, and mechanisms of childhood liver diseases, and improve the diagnostic and management options for children afflicted with them."
10900242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Catheter-based renal nerve ablation (CBRNA) decreases blood pressure (BP) and disrupts the chronic
overactivity of sympathetic efferent renal nerves thought to underlie neurogenic hypertension (HTN), diminishing
the risk for developing other cardiometabolic diseases. Studies have demonstrated that a contributor to the
development of neurogenic HTN is sensory afferent renal nerves (ARNs) whose input to central autonomic
regions modulates sympathetic outflow to other organs. Recent work from our lab has identified the close
proximity of ARNs to glomeruli in the renal cortex, which is novel in comparison to the traditional view that ARNs
primarily innervate the renal pelvis. The implication of ARNs in regulating BP and the identification of ARNs in
the renal cortex indicates the need for the role of ARNs in kidney function and autonomic processes to be
investigated. This proposal aims to address this gap in knowledge by 1) elucidating the central
terminations and regional specificity of renal afferents, and 2) identifying how renal afferent input
influences the activity of central autonomic regions that regulate blood pressure using a salt-induced
model of hypertension. Aim 1 will use viral vector-based neurotracing to label ARNs from the renal cortex and
renal pelvis of the kidney to identify their central terminations. I hypothesize that two distinct populations of ARNs
innervate the renal cortex and pelvis respectively, and project to distinct primary central termination sites. Tracing
will be visible throughout the neuroaxis including the renal vasculature, dorsal root ganglia, nodose ganglia,
spinal cord, and brainstem. Aim 2 will be completed using the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt mouse
model, which induces HTN through sodium and water retention, in targeted recombination of active populations
(TRAP2) mice where the fluorescent reporter protein tdTomato is expressed under the immediate-early gene c-
Fos, a neuronal activation marker, via tamoxifen-inducible Cre. The expression of tdTomato will be quantified as
a direct measure of c-Fos in brain regions known to be involved in BP regulation during early DOCA-salt HTN
development and compared to immunolabeled c-Fos at a later timepoint. I hypothesize that DOCA will increase
the expression of tdTomato and c-Fos in non-denervated mice, and that afferent renal denervation (ARDN) and
an IL-1 receptor antagonist will both attenuate the DOCA-induced neuronal activity. The expected outcomes of
this proposal are to have traced the terminals of ARNs from the kidney to central primary processing centers and
identified changes in neuronal activation in central autonomic centers relevant for ARN processing. These results
will expand the understanding of how ARNs are involved in salt-induced HTN and establish an anatomical
foundation for future investigations into the physiological roles of ARNs in the autonomic control of BP regulation.
Further, these findings may contribute to the potential mechanism by which ARDN attenuates increased BP in
salt-induced HTN allowing the development of interventions that can more accurately target ARNs, both
peripherally and centrally, increasing the therapeutic potential of ARDN as a treatment for hypertension."

Microbiome research through sequencing is becoming increasingly important for clinical studies.
The human commensal microbiomes have been shown to have a wide variety of potential health
impacts. However, our ability to genetically assay microbes is still limited. Microbiomes are
extremely complex and standard short-read sequencing technologies often do not provide
sufficient basis for the recovery of relevant genes and organisms.
Low-input and low-cost linked-read DNA sequencing technologies, such as the 10x Genomics
chromium system, have recently emerged with unprecedented promise for de novo assembly of
whole genome or metagenome samples. These technologies employ a novel molecular
barcoding technique which offers long-range information over standard high-throughput short
read, next-generation sequencing, while still at reasonable reagent and low-costs. We plan to
develop several innovative novel algorithms to fully leverage barcoded reads in a fast manner to
improve several integral and challenging applications, in particular: improving metagenome
assembly and leveraging the increased sensitivity to low abundance genomic information in
order to identify clinically relevant and potentially pathogenic organisms that can inform clinical
decisions.
All our proposed methods and computational tools will be made freely available with extensive
documentations for the community to use. To ensure the utility of our methods we plan to
extensively apply them to a wide range of research and clinical shotgun metagenome data sets,
in my laboratory and through various established local, external and industrial collaborations.
We also plan to collect control samples and sequence them using multiple platforms (Illumina,
10x Genomics, Loop Genomics Read Cloud, UTS TELL-SEQ, Oxford Nanopore) for
benchmarking. We will also use our proposed methods to improve the detection and
classification of low abundance organisms in clinical samples. We will launch two pilot projects
in collaborations with our Department of Pathology and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS).
Successful completion of this project will provide fast and scalable computational methods that
can be applied to large-scale data sets."
10877821,"Project Summary
Systematically improving upon current voice therapy outcomes is problematic as the specific clinician actions
(i.e., ingredients) responsible for improved patient functioning (i.e., targets) are unknown. For example,
Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) can show that therapy A works better than therapy B on global
outcome X. But why did therapy A provide better outcomes? Why did some patients in therapy B significantly
improve with the “worse” program; and some patients in therapy A remain unchanged with the “better”
program? A theory-based system is needed to scientifically identify a program’s ingredients associated with
improved outcomes across patients. And standard labels are needed to make the identified active ingredients
generalizable across therapy programs. Therefore, this project will use a theory-driven framework for
describing the ingredients/targets of rehabilitation treatments—called the Rehabilitation Treatment
Specification System (RTSS)—and standard voice-specific terminology/definitions—called the RTSS-Voice—
to standardly describe (Aim 1) and compare (Aim 2) variations in treatment across 9 well-known and diverse
voice therapies. Also, we will create/test an implementation toolkit to facilitate RTSS-Voice adoption in clinical
care across 5 Voice Centers (Aim 3). It is hypothesized that the RTSS and RTSS-Voice will characterize all
therapies without needing revisions (Aim 1) and identify ingredients/targets that are unique to one therapy
and/or common across multiple therapies (Aim2). And since the RTSS-Voice will help clinicians think about
their treatment more specifically and in relation to 9 evidence-based therapies, we hypothesize adoption will be
associated with improved outcomes at all 5 Voice Centers. The resulting list of mutually exclusive
ingredient/targets across therapy programs will obviously improve the state of CER by enabling the
identification/comparison of active ingredients across therapy programs; instead of the current practice of
studying/comparing entire programs. Clinical adoption will result in large datasets with standard ingredients
linked to outcomes, which will facilitate innovative hypotheses and interpretable datamining/machine learning
to realistically improve voice therapy effectiveness. This work is likely to generalize to other Centers due to the
involvement of >20 influential clinicians and the implementation toolkit."
10903781,"Project Summary
Our research project is designed to test our central hypothesis that the contact activation system
contributes to pathologic mechanisms that lead to vascular dysfunction, thrombin generation, and
inflammatory responses during systemic bacterial challenge by specific pathogens.
Despite the availability of effective antibiotics, sepsis remains a prevalent clinical syndrome and significant
cause of severe in-hospital morbidity and mortality, brought about by a sequence of rapidly advancing
dynamic molecular and cellular events that occur upon exposure to and subsequent systemic infection by
certain pathogens. Complicating the problem is the increasing prevalence of multiresistant bacterial
pathogens. At present, after more than half a century of research, drug development, and countless
clinical trials, there are still no FDA-approved marketed drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of
sepsis. Sepsis can lead to multiple organ system failure, including failure of vasoregulation, poor tissue
perfusion, edema, and systemic hypotension, which are hallmarks of severe sepsis. By triggering
cardiopulmonary and vascular collapse, it is often lethal even with available supportive and antibiotic
treatments. Sepsis may be accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead
to both thrombosis and bleeding due to the consumptive coagulopathy. We focus on the contact activation
system, because 1) there appears to be a causal relationship between activation of coagulation factor XII
and the poor prognosis of some forms of sepsis, and 2) targeting the contact activation system as a
therapeutic approach is unlikely to have detrimental consequences for the host such as bleeding. We will
study the role of the molecular steps in the contact activation system in the development and outcome of
experimental bacterial infection, in vivo. We will define the roles of FXII (Aim 1) and its procoagulant
substrate FXI (Aim 2), and translate our mechanistic in vitro studies to characterize the pathological role of
contact activation in two distinct baboon models of bacterial infection.
The potential translational relevance of our project will be the identification of safe and druggable
molecular targets and mechanisms within the contact activation system. Our research may ultimately
provide rationale for the development of selective contact activation inhibitors that could safely benefit
patients that have or are at risk of infections by pathogens that can cause contact system activation."

Over the past decade(s), research has highlighted that substrate stiffness and architecture/topography can be
recognized by cells and serve as mechanical and topographical cues that ultimately drive cell behavior through
mechanoreceptors. Substrate changes can also affect the mechanical stimulation of cells and thus their
response to loading. These cell responses are largely governed through mechanosensitive ion channels, such
as the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRPV4 is of specific interest as its activation and expression
can be affected by matrix stiffness and topography. Furthermore, its activation controls extracellular matrix
(ECM) synthesis, matrix-degrading enzyme expression, and ECM remodeling in various cell types.
The annulus fibrosus (AF), the outer area of the intervertebral disc (IVD), is a mechanosensitive tissue in which
topographical and mechanical cues change during degeneration, thus likely affecting cell fate, cellular activity,
and disease progression. The AF plays a crucial role in the development of
low back pain as its structural failure
can lead to IVD
herniation.
Surprisingly, only very few studies have thus far investigated cell-substrate
interactions in AF cells and no data exists on the relevance of substrate stiffness/topography on TRPV4 activation
in AF cells. It is also unknown whether TRPV4 regulates ECM synthesis/remodeling in the AF, which would, in
turn, affect its activation and hence create a crucial feedback loop.
Our long-term goal is to reveal the relevance of cell-substrate processes in IVD health and disease and to use
this knowledge in the development of regenerative approaches. Specifically, this project aims to: (1) Determine
the relevance of substrate stiffness on TRPV4 activation in AF cells in response to (a) a pharmacological TRPV4
agonist and (b) cyclic stretching. (2) Determine the relevance of substrate topography on TRPV4 activation in
AF cells in response to (a) a pharmacological TRPV4 agonist and (b) cyclic stretching. (3) Determine the
importance of TRPV4 activation in AF cells in regulating ECM synthesis and remodeling
The proposed project will use an innovative design of stretching chambers that allows investigating the
integrative role of substrate cues (stiffness, topography) and mechanical stimulation in modulating cell function
and fate. TRPV4 will be activated by specific agonists or stretching upon seeding in these chambers and cell
responses will be determined by qPCR, ELISA, and Western Blot for targets selected based on RNA-seq data.
Furthermore, ECM synthesis and remodeling following TRPV4 activation will be evaluated.
This will be the first study to investigate TRPV4 in the context of substrate stiffness and topography in AF cells.
As the developed tools will also apply to other research areas, I can help advance the fundamental understanding
of mechanotransduction processes in health and disease. The gained knowledge will be applicable in tissue
engineering and support the identification of new drug targets related to dysregulated mechanotransduction."

Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the United States and represents a major burden on the US
healthcare system. Mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption of cellular energetics are heavily implicated in the
pathogenesis of heart disease. A key regulator of mitochondrial function is Ca2+ uptake through the mitochondrial
calcium uniporter complex (“the uniporter”). The uniporter regulates cytosolic Ca2+ transients, oxidative
phosphorylation, and cell death pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms that control uniporter activation
are not well resolved. Further insight into how the uniporter is regulated would increase our understanding of
mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and inform the development of therapeutics aimed at modulating uniporter activity.
The Research Training Plan involves using a multidisciplinary approach to investigate how key signaling
molecules and regulatory factors control uniporter activity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the Ca2+-
dependent regulation of the uniporter and elucidating a novel gating mechanism will produce a major advance
in the field. The PI will receive comprehensive training to carry out structural, biophysical, biochemical, and
functional studies on membrane transport proteins. The Career Development Plan is tailored to help the PI
develop skills in experimental approaches, research design, project management, mentorship, and written and
oral communication. The sponsor, together with the environment, offers strong support for the PI’s training and
career development. In summary, completion of the strong Research Training Plan together with the Career
Development Plan will help prepare the applicant for a career as an independent scientist. The proposed
research will lead to significant advances in understanding mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and will open potential
avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases involving aberrant mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important and underreported infectious disease, causing chronic infection in ~58
million people worldwide. The CDC estimates there are ~67,000 new cases of HCV every year in the US and
about 20,000 deaths annually, making HCV more deadly than 60 other infectious diseases combined, including
HIV. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to chronic HCV infection followed by end-stage liver disease
are poorly understood. Although chronic hepatitis C can now be effectively treated with direct-acting antivirals, a
vaccine to prevent transmission remains a high priority due to extreme treatment costs (up to $50,000 for a 12-
week course) and the irreversibility of virally induced liver damage even in “cured” individuals. Efforts to better
understand HCV and develop effective vaccines have been limited by the lack of small animal models for this
virus, which only robustly infects humans and chimpanzees. In the proposed work, we will build on our substantial
research findings to meet this need for an immunocompetent animal model that will allow us to not only
systematically analyze the molecular basis of barriers to interspecies HCV transmission but also how such a
model could be leveraged for assessing vaccine candidates. Towards this end, we recently identified a highly
murine-adapted HCV variant, coined Mad18, with increased replicative capacity in primary murine hepatocytes,
which historically only poorly support HCV replication. Through continued passaging of Mad18 in HCV entry
factor transgenic (EFT) mice with impaired antiviral signaling (EFT Stat1-/-), we aim to further adapt this variant
to a murine physiological environment and define the underpinning biological mechanism (Aim 1). Our
considerable experience with studying viral infections in genetically humanized mice will be utilized to also study
Mad18 and its derivatives in a variety of new mouse lines, including immunocompetent models, with targeted
changes to increase their support of HCV infection (Aim 2). Our observations of persistent HCV infection in
hepatocytes from immunocompetent HCV entry factor knock-in mice that also express human TRIM26 (EFT
TRIM26[h/h]) put us in a strong position for these in vivo studies.
The Ploss lab has made many seminal contributions to the field and will be aided in this important work by our
long-standing collaborators Drs. Schwartz (Weill Cornell) and Pietschmann (Twincore, Germany). Our work will
advance the field of HCV research by making progress in deciphering the mechanism underlying the
exquisitely narrow host tropism and the development of small animal models suitable for studying HCV
infection and immune responses, a necessary precursor to improving treatment and developing vaccines."
10904740,"The objective of this proposal is to develop a prototype for the next generation multivariable automated
insulin delivery (mvAID) systems (also called artificial pancreas) by integrating systems engineering and
artificial intelligence (Al) techniques that will mitigate the effects of meals, physical activities ,acute
psychological stress inducements and sleep irregularities without manual inputs by the user to tightly
regulate the glucose levels of people with diabetes. The first generation of automated insulin delivery
(AID) systems relied on hybrid closed-loop technology, collecting data from continuous glucose monitoring
devices and requiring manual user inputs for mitigating the effects of meals and exercise. The multivariable
AID that we developed provides a well-integrated next-generation system that analyzes historical and realtime
data from different sources, including continuous glucose monitoring systems, insulin pumps, and
wearable sensors in wristband physical activity trackers, to mitigate the effects of meals, physical activities,
and acute psychological stress without manual inputs by the user. Meals, planned exercises, many
physical activities of daily living, acute psychological stress, and sleep irregularities affect blood glucose
levels differentially, challenging people with Type 1 diabetes to continuously consider all these complex
factors in maintaining their blood glucose levels in the target range. Further improvement in glucose
regulation can be achieved by developing novel, interpretable, and interactive Al techniques that can
explain their predictions to medical care providers and AID users, and by integrating these Al techniques
with systems engineering techniques to develop an Al-mvAID system. The function of these Al techniques
is to predict the state of a person based on historical trends and current data, and provide additional
valuable information to the mvAID system to relieve the users from onerous repetitive tasks for interpreting
their current metabolic state, predicting the impact of their current actions on future variations in glucose
levels, and tuning the parameters of the Al-mvAID controller. The goal is to produce a powerful userfriendly
technology that integrates novel Al techniques with mvAID systems for minimal user burden in
achieving tight control of glucose levels despite the many complex glycemic disturbances occurring in freeliving
conditions, such as meals, physical activities, acute psychological stress, and sleep irregularities."

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a globally prevalent disorder (~11%) characterized by an alteration
in stool form/frequency in association with abdominal discomfort or pain. IBS is categorized into
constipation, diarrhea or mixed (IBS-C, IBD-D, IBS-M) based on the predominant stool form/frequency. The
pathophysiology of IBS is complex and therapeutic options targeting the underlying pathophysiology in IBS
are limited. Recent studies support a role for gut microbial metabolites in maintaining normal
gastrointestinal (GI) function, but how changes in different microbial metabolites and interactions among
these metabolites affect molecular pathways involved in IBS pathophysiology remains a critical knowledge
gap. Hence, it is not surprising that the current empirically designed microbial therapies (probiotics) have
largely proven ineffective in IBS. To address this gap, in the previous grant cycle we focused on the
bacterial metabolite tryptamine and found tryptamine increases secretion and mucus release in a 5-
HT4R dependent manner, accelerates transit, and protects against inflammation in rodent models. The
observations were supported by our finding of elevated levels of tryptamine in IBS-D in our human study. In
the same longitudinal multi-omics human study, the most consistent finding in IBS-C across multiple -omics
platforms were significant decreases in stool hypoxanthine and butyrate. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine the physiologic relevance of these metabolites by identifying the molecular
pathways affected by each of these metabolites that are relevant to IBS-C. Our central hypothesis based
on prior research and our preliminary data is that hypoxanthine is an effector metabolite that
accelerates GI transit by increasing enterochromaffin (EC) cell serotonin release while butyrate is a regulatory
metabolite that augments the biologic activity of effector metabolites. This will be tested in two Aims: In Aim
1, we will determine the mechanism by which hypoxanthine increases EC cell serotonin release and
accelerates GI transit and in Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which butyrate regulates EC cell
responses to effector metabolites and the resultant effects on GI function. We will use Ca2+ imaging in
organoids/primary EC cell culture from novel transgenic mice, heterologous receptor expression with site-
directed mutagenesis, and epigenomic and transcriptomics data, combined with ex vivo colon
preparations, gnotobiotic- and EC cell-depleted mouse models, isogenic bacterial mutants, and novel
encapsulation methods to address the above aims. Our findings will uncover specific pathways by which
these microbial metabolites affect GI transit and allow development of novel mechanism-based microbial
therapies for IBS-C."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory disease in children, the elderly and
immunocompromised individuals and there is currently no licensed RSV vaccine. The host inflammatory
response is believed to contribute to disease severity following RSV infection. Much less is currently known
regarding the role of RSV strains in modulating the host inflammatory response. The production of
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 have been found to be significantly increased in the respiratory tract
of infants with severe disease. In addition, RSV infection has been reported to promote hypermetabolism in the
upper respiratory cells of RSV-infected children. IL-1β is a key proinflammatory cytokine and its secretion is
tightly regulated by multi-protein complexes named inflammasomes. Activation of the inflammasome is a two-
step process, including priming and activation steps, that requires metabolic reprogramming of the cell.
Previous studies have demonstrated that RSV A2 infection induces the activation of the NLRP3
inflammasome. Our preliminary data illustrate that infection with the RSV 2-20 strain results in significantly
increased IL-1β production as compared to infection with the A2 strain. We also observe an increase in
glycolysis in RSV 2-20 infected macrophages as compared to A2 infected macrophages. Unexpectedly, when
we infect cells with a recombinant RSV A2 strain engineered to express the 2-20 fusion (F) protein, termed
A2/2-20F, we observe a significant increase in both IL-1β production and glycolysis in macrophages. Thus, our
exciting new preliminary data indicate that RSV strains differentially activate the inflammasome and this strain-
dependent increased inflammasome activation is mediated by the F protein. Thus, important knowledge gaps
exist regarding how RSV-derived genes modulate the host inflammatory response. Our long-term goal is to
understand the virus-derived factors that modulate the host immune response and disease severity following
RSV infection. The objective of this application is to determine the changes that occur in inflammasome
signaling and metabolism following RSV infection. Moreover, we will explore how these changes impact innate
cell recruitment into the lung and shape the subsequent adaptive immune response. Our central hypothesis is
that the RSV 2-20 strain enhances both inflammasome priming and activation signals resulting in increases in
both neutrophil influx and the Th17 response. We will achieve the goals outlined above by pursuing the
following two specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of RSV F protein-mediated inflammasome
activation. Aim 2. Examine the role of differential inflammasome activation on immune cell recruitment and
disease following RSV infection. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide a mechanistic
understanding of RSV-mediated inflammatory responses. In addition, these studies will greatly impact the
evaluation of therapeutic targets and design of future RSV vaccine candidates."

Cerebral (cortical) visual impairment (CVI) is the leading cause of congenital vision impairment in the United
States. Yet, there remains an alarming gap in our understanding as to how observed visual perceptual deficits
in these individuals relate to perinatal damage and early maldevelopment of central visual pathways and
structures. Children and adolescents with CVI show striking impairments in complex motion processing (a
dorsal stream function), particularly in the setting of complex dynamic environmental scenes. While impaired
motion perception is an important marker of developmental vulnerability (referred to as the dorsal stream
dysfunction hypothesis), standard ophthalmic clinical assessments fail to capture and fully characterize these
visual deficits. Thus, in the absence of any apparent ocular abnormality, clinicians may dismiss reported
perceptual difficulties, and many individuals with CVI will remain undiagnosed and never receive the timely
education and rehabilitative support they need. The objective of the proposed research is to investigate the
underlying neurophysiology associated with motion processing deficits in CVI. We will carry out psychophysical
behavioral testing combined with multimodal neuroimaging (to characterize structural and functional
connectivity along with brain network activation) in children and adolescents with CVI associated with
periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Indices of behavioral performance and neuroimaging outcomes will be
compared to neurotypical controls. Our overarching hypothesis is that motion processing deficits will be
associated with the maldevelopment of key visual processing pathways. However, altered patterns of
functional connectivity and activation of brain networks implicated in complex motion perception may serve as
indicators of compensatory neuroplasticity. In our first aim, we will assess motion processing abilities using
random dot kinematograms, virtual reality simulations, and visual search tasks. In our second aim, we will
characterize the integrity and topology of structural and functional connectivity networks (using high angular
resolution diffusion imaging and resting state fMRI respectively) implicated with visual motion and attention
processing. The third aim will investigate brain network activation (using functional MRI) in response to our
behavioral task assessments. Executed by a multidisciplinary research team with strong community
involvement, this combined behavioral assessment and multimodal imaging approach represents a key
distinguishing innovation of the proposal. This study will provide convergent and high-level insights into the
neurophysiological basis of visual motion perceptual deficits in CVI. The proposed program of research is
highly significant given that uncovering brain-behavioral associations in the case of CVI represents a crucial
step in establishing a neurorehabilitative framework specifically designed for the care of these children; a
population that has been greatly underserved despite its important"

 Jerry Zifodya, MD, MPH plans to develop an independent research career as a physician-scientist,
focused on improving the understanding and outcomes of lung disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The
objective of the proposed career development award is to provide necessary training in research
methods to facilitate Dr. Zifodya’s transition to independent research. The mentorship available at Tulane
University (TU), the University of Washington (UW), and the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)
are outstanding. He will continue his work under the mentorship of Drs. Jay Kolls (TU), David Horne
(UW), and Kristina Crothers (UW). Collaborators and mentors on his multi-disciplinary research team
span the disciplines of tuberculosis (TB) research in Kenya (Dr. Videlis Nduba, KEMRI), global HIV
epidemiology (Dr. Patricia Kissinger, TU), TB immunology (Dr. Thomas Hawn, TU), advanced statistics
(Dr. Sudesh Srivastav, TU) and bioinformatics (Dr. Yu-Ping Wang, TU). To complement the support from
his mentors, Dr. Zifodya will augment his MPH with advanced coursework at the internationally renowned
TU School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine and TU Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program.
 TB is the leading opportunistic infection and primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide for
people with HIV. Even with adequate treatment of TB, up to half of all persons with pulmonary TB
develop post-TB lung disease (PTLD), which is defined by chronic respiratory abnormality after
pulmonary TB. The underlying mechanisms of PTLD are unclear. There is a critical need to define the
long-term trajectory of PTLD and identify host clinical, immunological, and genetic risk factors. The
overall objectives for this proposal are to identify (i) clinical host factors and (ii) host inflammatory and
immunological factors that predict PTLD. In preliminary studies we have shown PTLD to be common and
associated with elevated inflammatory markers. We hypothesize that upregulation of inflammatory and
immune activation pathways after pulmonary TB predicts PTLD and is skewed by HIV (dependent on
degree of immunocompromise). We will test these hypotheses in a longitudinal cohort of Kenyan adults
with TB with the two specific aims: 1: Determine host characteristics associated with pulmonary function
decline and PTLD over 2 years of follow-up in Kenyan adults with and without HIV. 2: Determine whether
transcriptomic responses in activated PBMCs can predict impaired pulmonary function and PTLD.
 This award will provide essential research training in the conduct of longitudinal studies in a low
resource setting, measurement and analysis of biomarkers, and interpretation and integration of
immunologic data. With the support of this K23, the research and training plan that Dr. Zifodya has
devised will assist him in achieving his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator."
10892977,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The focus of my laboratory’s efforts is the proteasome, the protease that degrades ubiquitin-protein
conjugates. That the proteasome is the central activity within the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was known
from the time the UPS was charted, but its significance was not fully recognized at the time because the
proteasome was presumed, incorrectly, to be unregulated and passive–essentially a dumb enzyme. But this
perception has been overturned by the progressive identification of diverse mechanisms that finely regulate
proteasome synthesis, turnover, localization, substrate specificity, and specific activity. These mechanisms are
of special interest because they provide the means for global control of UPS output. In parallel, evidence of the
importance of proteasome activity in disease has accumulated. For example, even a modest elevation of
proteasome levels substantially increases the lifespan of D. melanogaster and C. elegans, as well as their ability
to withstand stresses such as the expression of toxic polyQ proteins. A fascinating mode of proteasome
regulation is that involving the dynamic reconfiguration of ubiquitin chains on a substrate at the proteasome. Two
such chain-editing factors are highly active as well as conserved across eukaryotes: Ubp6/USP14 and
Hul5/UBE3C. Ubp6 is a deubiquitinating enzyme and Hul5 is a ubiquitin ligase, and they work in opposition to
one another; Ubp6 will remove ubiquitin groups added to the substrate by Hul5. Both are recruited to
proteasomes when the UPS is impaired or challenged. The specificity of Ubp6 is remarkable in that it acts only
on substrates that carry multiple ubiquitin chains. We will characterize this specificity further and investigate its
mechanistic basis. We have reported that Hul5 functions as an E4 on the proteasome–it ubiquitinates proteins
that are already ubiquitinated. We will focus now on how this E4 activity promotes the processivity of the
proteasome, as Hul5 appears to be the main regulator of processivity. We will reconstitute the processivity effect
in a purified system and use highly specific mutants in Hul5 in single-molecule analysis. We will also investigate
the mechanisms by which Ubp6 and Hul5 are controlled by stress. The third major factor recruited to
proteasomes under proteostasis stress is Ecm29, which has the unique feature of binding both the RP and CP.
Ecm29 regulates both the activity and assembly of the proteasome, most likely by bridging these complexes.
Our studies will focus on how Ecm29 is recruited to faulty proteasomes and how it affects their structure and
stability. Finally, substrate recognition by the proteasome is mediated by six distinct ubiquitin receptors. However,
our detailed genetic analysis in yeast indicates the existence of at least one additional, unknown ubiquitin
receptor within the proteasome. We will attempt to identify this receptor, and once we generate suitably precise
mutants we will explore this receptor’s role in substrate recognition and processing. In summary, we propose,
by applying the methods of genetics, enzymology, structural biology, and quantitative global proteomics, to
elucidate major pathways of proteasome function and regulation."

We hypothesize that high affinity synthetic agonists of TLX may enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis
(AHN) and improve cognitive function in patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we
focus on developing, refining, and validation of TLX assays for the purposes of performing a screen for novel,
synthetic TLX ligands that can be used as points to initiate drug discovery optimization efforts to develop TLX
agonists towards potential clinical evaluation for treatment of dementia including AD. This is an application for
a R61/R33 grant which focuses on the development and validation of assays that can be used to “identify and
characterize potential therapeutic agents for neurological or neuromuscular disorders”. We are focused on
identification of ligands targeting the nuclear receptor TLX that may hold utility to treat neurological disorders
associated with cognitive dysfunction. The R61 phase is focused on development and validation of the key in
vitro assays to identify putative TLX ligands. This is in alignment with the NIH's description of R61 activities
which include (as specifically indicated in PAR-21-124): (1) Development and validation of assay(s) (including
phenotypic assays) to support a succinct testing funnel…, (2) Development of in vitro or ex vivo
potency/efficacy assays designed to indicate the specific ability of an agent to achieve a desired biological
effect, and (3) Assay development and/or optimization for High-Throughput Screening (HTS). The R33 phase
is initiated upon successful development of the assays and testing funnel and specifically is focused on (as
specifically indicated in PAR-21-124): (1) HTS, comprising screening of large libraries for activity against
biological targets via the use of automation, miniaturized assays and large-scale data analysis, (2) Preparation
and screening of select series of therapeutic agents using…medicinal chemistry…, (3) Assessment of
therapeutic agent's properties using computational analysis and early physicochemical measurements, polar
surface area, solubility, cell permeability and efflux, (4) Assessment of initial in vitro pharmacokinetic
parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), (5) Assessment of potential
off target activities, and (5) Optimization of therapeutic agent(s) for FUTURE in vivo testing. To address these
goals, we propose the following Specific Aims: R61 phase: AIM 1– Develop, refine, and validate a biochemical
assay to detect TLX ligands in an HTS format and AIM 2 – Develop and validate secondary/tertiary assays for
the purpose of characterizing “hits” identified in a TLX screen. R33 phase: AIM 1 – Screen both
chemoinformatic driven nuclear receptor-biased chemical libraries and chemical diversity libraries using the
validated assays from the R61 Phase to identify putative TLX agonists. AIM 2 – Evaluate the hits from the
screens for their potential for further optimization as TLX agonists and perform initial structure-activity-
relationship on priority hits. Our goal is to identify TLX agonists from multiple chemical scaffolds that will be
pursued in future lead optimization studies in models of dementia and subsequently pursued in clinical studies."

Human consciousness and cognitive function are governed by a complex brain circuitry made up of neural
connections regulated by an integrated multicellular network. Glial make up 90% of all cells in the brain and play
dynamic and active roles in neuronal signaling, where astrocytes and microglia regulate synaptic transmission
and plasticity. In the past decade, increasing evidence suggests that the principal co-agonist for N-methyl-D-
Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is the D-amino acid, D-serine, rather than glycine; however, few studies have
examined its role in CNS pathologies. To address this gap, we have recently identified a novel mechanism of
synaptic damage, where glia within the tripartite synapse uniquely synthesize and release D-serine following the
onset of pathological events. We hypothesize that microglia are a key source of pathological D-serine that
hyperactivates extrasynaptic NMDAR subunits to initiate synaptic damage as a result of microglia targeting and
pruning of dendritic spines. Our proposed experiments will examine (1) the mechanisms of D-serine release from
microglia; (2) the mechanisms of synaptic damage and microglia targeting & pruning; (3) transcriptomic analysis
of brain injury in both murine and human models. We will achieve this by employing both genetic and
pharmacological approaches to dissect the mechanism of microglial action within the complexity of brain injury
using state-of-the-art transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic techniques. Our studies will result in a better
understanding of the mechanisms that regulate synaptic damage and dysfunction, but also will start to define
novel therapeutics for patient interventions."

Despite treatment advances, the prognosis of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains poor. Autologous T-
cells modified to express a CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T-cells) produce durable responses
in subgroups of these patients, which has led to FDA approval of two such therapies to date; numerous other
CAR T-cell therapies are under investigation, including a CD19-targeted CAR T-cell product bearing a CD28
costimulatory domain (19-28z) developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. However, CAR T-cell
therapy for B-ALL and DLBCL is associated with high risk of severe neurologic toxicity (including
encephalopathy, dysphasia, seizures, and rarely, cerebral edema) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Host
monocytes are the major source of elevated cytokines (IL-1, IL-6) observed in the context of neurologic toxicity.
Administration of conditioning or “lymphodepleting” chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell infusion, most commonly
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, appears to improve CAR T-cell expansion and efficacy by several
mechanisms. However, a conditioning strategy that depletes monocytes as well as lymphocytes may reduce the
risk of severe neurologic toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy. The anti-CD45 antibody apamistamab
labeled with 131-iodine (131-I apamistamab) is being investigated as myeloablative conditioning prior to
hematopoietic cell transplantation in the Phase III SIERRA trial for patients with active, R/R acute myeloid
leukemia. In SIERRA, transient lymphodepletion is observed clinically when 131-I apamistamab is given at low
doses for dosimetry. Additionally, in preclinical models, a single low dose of 131-I-radiolabeled anti-CD45
antibody efficiently depletes lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T-cells, without
impact on bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells.
We propose investigating low-dose 131-I apamistamab in lieu of conditioning chemotherapy prior to 19-28z CAR
T-cell therapy in patients with R/R B-ALL or R/R DLBCL, hypothesizing this will more effectively deplete host
monocytes and reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of monocyte-derived cytokines, and thereby lower the
incidence of severe neurologic toxicity following 19-28z CAR T-cell infusion. This clinical trial will be the first to
test radiopharmaceutical conditioning prior to CAR T-cell therapy. The phase I/II study is designed to determine
the maximum tolerated dose of 131-I apamistamab in this setting and subsequently to assess the incidence of
severe neurologic toxicity associated with 131-I apamistamab conditioning and 19-28z CAR T-cell therapy in
patients with R/R B-ALL or R/R DLBCL, as well as antitumor efficacy. A correlative study plan will characterize
the effects of 131-I apamistamab on cytokine profiles in blood and CSF, and on the composition of the immune
cellular microenvironment. Results of this trial can be applied toward ongoing development and refinement of
CAR T-cell therapies targeting hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies."

Chronic infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV alone
is responsible for more than 3% of worldwide cancer deaths of all cancer sites combined. How HBV promotes
carcinogenesis is not fully understood, leading to limited therapeutic options for advanced diseases. We
previously revealed that 10% of HBV-associated HCC tumors carry clonal integrations of HBV in the KMT2B
gene locus in cancer cell genomes. All these integrations are located between exons 3 and 6 of the KMT2B
gene. KMT2B is the only close homolog of KMT2A (also known as MLL1). It has been well established that the
chromosomal translocations affecting KMT2A are the primary drivers of infant mixed lineage leukemia. HBV
integrations in KMT2B in HCC may mirror KMT2A rearrangements in leukemia, but its function has not been
studied. We have identified patient-derived HCC cell lines carrying HBV integrations in KMT2B. Using these cell
lines and RNA-seq data of HCC tumors with HBV integrations in KMT2B, we found that these integrations lead
to expression of truncated KMT2B from the N-terminus to 697 to 906 amino acid residues. Knockout of the
KMT2B truncation in an integration-carrying cell line suppressed cell proliferation in vitro. Overexpression of a
KMT2B truncation transformed normal human hepatocytes in vitro and induced tumor growth in vivo in
hydrodynamic injection-based mouse models. Mechanistically, we found the KMT2B truncation sequestered the
tumor suppressor MENIN from the KMT2A/B histone methyltransferase complex and chromosome. A KMT2B
truncation carrying a mutation that blocks MENIN binding failed to promote tumor formation in vivo. Based on
these preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that HBV integrations in KMT2B produce truncations, which
sequester MENIN from KMT2B complex and promote hepatocellular carcinoma. To test this hypothesis,
we will determine the oncogenic function of KMT2B truncations, using various in vitro and in vivo models (Aim
1), and determine the mechanism of KMT2B truncation-triggered tumorigenesis (Aim2). Specifically, a new
genetic engineered mouse model of HCC will be generated and a potential targeted agent for HCC with HBV
integrations in KMT2B will be tested. The proposed studies aim to establish the oncogenic driving function and
mechanism of HBV integrations in KMT2B in HCC, which cause 35,000 HCC cases every year. It is among the
most common cancer-causing genetic alterations but it is significantly understudied. The completion of the
proposed studies will discover a novel oncovirus-driving, epigenetic mechanism of HCC development and
provide information for developing prevention approaches, early detection assays, and targeted therapeutics for
affected individuals."

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is expected to increase four-fold by 2050.
Consequently, there are efforts to identify “actionable” risk factors, that if identified and addressed early, have
the potential to prevent cognitive decline and onset of ADRD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with
risk of cognitive decline and ADRD, particularly among older adults. As effective treatments are available for the
condition (e.g., Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [CPAP]) that are demonstrated to be highly efficacious
when used adherently, OSA may be an ideal target for ADRD risk reduction. In this study, we propose to
characterize associations between OSA treatment (specifically CPAP) and cognitive decline and ADRD over up
to 14 years of follow-up (2010-2024) in two nationally representative NIA-funded cohorts of U.S. older adults:
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We also intend
to determine whether the effects of OSA treatment on cognition differ in those at higher risk for ADRD (e.g.,
minority race/ethnicity, advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors/disease, etc.) in order to identify populations
among whom treatment is most likely to yield effects and ways OSA treatments could be optimized in groups
not benefiting. Both HRS and NHATS include nationally representative samples, have repeated performance-
based cognitive measures to characterize cognitive performance trajectories and ADRD, and linkages to
Medicare claims for ascertainment of OSA diagnosis and treatment. The study will use innovative methods to
harmonize datasets and will address three specific aims. Aim 1 will be to determine the association of OSA with
cognitive trajectories and incident ADRD from 2010-2024, and examine whether OSA interacts with other ADRD
risk factors with regard to cognitive decline and ADRD risk. Aim 2 will be to determine, among individuals with
OSA, whether CPAP is associated with better cognitive outcomes from 2010-2024. Specifically, we will examine
whether a) receipt of CPAP (compared to no treatment) is associated with slower cognitive decline and lower
risk for ADRD, b) among those treated whether initiation of CPAP is associated with a slowing of cognitive decline
and lower risk for ADRD before and after initiation, and c) whether these associations vary across levels of CPAP
adherence. Finally, Aim 3 will examine whether associations found in Aim 2 will differ across known ADRD risk
factors. If we find that addressing OSA is particularly effective in slowing cognitive decline/preventing ADRD,
especially in high-risk groups, then our study’s results will help us understand the means by which OSA can be
treated in the population and contribute to development of programs to treat OSA in these populations at greatest
risk. Further, it will inform efforts to curb the burden of ADRD in the U.S. and contribute substantially to dementia
prevention efforts."

Males living with HIV are estimated to be at a 2- to 5-fold higher risk of developing human papillomavirus-
related oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) compared to the general population, with up to 90% of cases
attributed to oral high-risk (oHR)-HPV16. Because precancerous lesions are a challenge to diagnose and
clinicians have no reliable means of identifying vulnerable patients, effective interventions will require a
thorough understanding of the natural history of oHR-HPV. The presence of persistent non-oral HR-HPV
precedes precancerous lesion development in other HPV-related cancers; the same may be true for oHR-HPV.
HIV and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) may alter the oral microbiome and give rise to oral lesions and
periodontal disease, creating an immune microenvironment conducive to persistent oHR-HPV that ultimately
increases the risk for HPV-OPC. Predictors of oHR-HPV infection and persistence could serve as detection
markers for HPV-OPC to prompt preventive treatment early in disease progression when treatment outcomes
are most favorable. We propose to conduct a prospective study to characterize longitudinal events of oHR-
HPV among an at-risk population (CLEAR). We will leverage our longstanding multidisciplinary and
international collaboration and the established cohort receiving care at the sexual and gender minority-friendly
TRUST clinic in Nigeria. A total of 1,200 HPV-unvaccinated Nigerian non-heterosexual males who perform oral
sex and are living with or without HIV will be screened for oHR-HPV. A subset of 500 males, including those
with a prevalent oHR-HPV will be followed every 3 months for up to 2 years. We will collect oral gargle and
blood samples to detect incident and persistent oHR-HPV infection; measure CD4, HIV viral load, and the oral
microbiome; characterize oral sex practices; and perform dental examinations to document periodontal
disease, oral lesions, and dental caries. We will determine the association between HIV clinical markers and
oral-anogenital contact and the prevalence of oHR-HPV (AIM 1). We will compare the time course of oHR-HPV
as a function of HIV status (AIM 2). We will evaluate the relationship between dental phenotypes, the oral
microbiome, HIV clinical measures, and oHR-HPV infection (AIM 3). Understanding the oHR-HPV burden, time
course of infection, and oral cavity indicators of the immune microenvironment in the context of HIV will
generate robust data needed to help inform predictive models and develop rational risk-stratified screening
algorithms to help mitigate risk of HPV-OPC in males living with HIV."
10893305,"This proposal requests support for the five-year continuation of our NIMH-funded institutional training grant,
“Clinical and Translational Research Training in Late-Life Mood Disorders” (T32 MH019986), Years 26-30.
The primary goal of this two-year post-doctoral fellowship (three years in selected case) is to provide rigorous
training in the basic foundations and methodologic tools necessary for successful clinical and translational
investigation in geriatric mental health and psychiatry. The fellowship is designed for MDs and PhDs in the
behavioral sciences (four post-doctoral fellows annually). Consistent with NIMH priorities, the focus of training
in the new funding period will be translational and computational approaches for treatment development, as
well as interventions and mental health services research. Research training is designed to be broadly
multidisciplinary from bioengineering to community-based research. The most important components of the
training program are apprenticeship with an academically successful mentor, a structured training plan
facilitated by a network of committed faculty, and supportive environment to foster each trainees’ unique
strength. In most cases, this leads to faculty appointments and successful competition for extramural funding.
Trainees develop core skills and knowledge in grant writing and research project management by participating
in a weekly career and research development seminar, and bi-weekly meetings with the various researchers in
geriatric mental health. A wide range of didactic offerings is available and is prescribed on an individual basis.
All fellows participate in ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research.
The second goal of the program is to provide research training opportunities, in the form research electives, to
rising medical students, in order to attract a diverse and talented group of medical students into psychiatric
research careers. We propose to continue funding two summer research elective slots annually through this
training program, as well as one year-long medical student research fellowship.
Both components of the program, pre- and post-doctoral, are part of a broad research training strategy at the
University of Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry, to respond to a national shortage of researchers in geriatric
mental health. The Department fosters many research career development activities for students and faculty at
all levels. This training grant both contributes to and benefits from this developmental strategy. In this
continuation we are increasing our efforts to address inclusivity and diversity among geriatric mental health
researchers."
10893371,"The broad, long-term objective of this project is to identify factors that may explain why substance use
disorders occur and to identify methods for most effectively reducing drug use. Both of these goals are
aligned with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. More specifically, a behavioral
economic approach will be taken here to experimentally test variables that control cocaine- and opioid-
taking behavior in an animal (rat) model of drug abuse. Addiction has been conceptualized as repeated,
maladaptive choice of drugs over important non-drug rewards. Research in behavioral economics has
found that one of the most important factors determining choice between two reinforcers (rewards) is how
they interact along the substitute-to-complement continuum. If substitutes, increasing the price of one
reinforcer results in reduced consumption of that reinforcer and increased consumption of the other because
subjects allocate relatively more behavior to the now cheaper option. If complements, increasing the price of
one reinforcer reduces consumption of both reinforcers, but, counterintuitively, subjects allocate relatively
more behavior to the now more expensive option. If they are independents, then choice is relatively
insensitive to price changes. Little is known about how psychostimulants like cocaine and opioids like
heroin relate to non-drug alternatives in terms of substitutability/complementarity. This knowledge gap
significantly limits our ability to explain, predict, or modify choice between these drugs and non-drug
alternatives. This proposal will address this knowledge gap with three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will
test cocaine and heroin’s degree of substitution, independence, or complementarity with respect to a
variety of non-drug alternatives (including both positive and negative reinforcers). Specific Aim 2 will
investigate how the availability of non-drug reinforcers of varying substitutability/complementarity with
cocaine and heroin affects drug value (defined in terms of behavioral economics, where value reflects how
much effort subjects make to obtain the drug). Specific Aim 3 will test how these drugs’ interactions with
non-drug reinforcers change on the transition from initiation/recreational use to addiction by
investigating substitutability/complementarity before and after intermittent access self-administration (a
procedure that produces addiction-like behavior). Completion of this research will provide important new
information about factors responsible for the excessive allocation of behavior to drugs that is a hallmark of
substance use disorder, a significant problem for public health today. By learning what causes excessive
allocation of behavior towards drugs, we can learn how to most effectively modify behavior such that drug
choice is reduced and this information can be used to improve treatments for substance use disorder."
10893953,"Project Summary/Abstract. While neuroinflammation is a proposed contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD),
the spatial and temporal relationship among inflammation, tau pathology and neurodegeneration remains
unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand how microglial responses can be used to predict and monitor AD
progression and potentially be manipulated for therapeutic purposes. Our objective is to determine how microglial
activation, measured with PET imaging, is spatially and temporally related to tau pathology and
neurodegeneration in AD. Our central hypothesis is that the microglial biomarker TSPO correlates with tau
pathology and neurodegeneration cross-sectionally, and precedes the spread of tau and neurodegeneration
longitudinally. We also postulate that the emerging CSF biomarkers YKL-40 and sTREM2 correlate with TSPO
density, strengthening the argument that increased TSPO is a signal of pathological inflammation. Our rationale
is that demonstrating how inflammatory mechanisms temporally correlate with tau pathology and
neurodegeneration will identify time-points where immune-modulating therapeutics would be most beneficial.
Inconsistencies in prior TSPO studies in AD are likely due in part to heterogeneity of age-of-onset, pattern of
cognitive impairment, and topography of neurodegeneration in included patients. To overcome these confounds,
we will enroll patients with specific clinical variants of AD – amnestic AD, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and
logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA). With this recruitment approach, we will acquire relatively
uniform cohorts where disease is expected to have focal epicenters and spread in a predictable neuroanatomic
distribution. We will acquire TSPO and tau PET, MRI markers of neurodegeneration, and CSF markers of
inflammation in PCA, lvPPA, and amnestic AD patients, and in controls in a two-year longitudinal study. The
specific aims are 1) Determine the topographical pattern of microglial activation in different AD subtypes, 2)
Determine the spatial and temporal relationships between neuroinflammation and tau pathology in different AD
subtypes, and 3) Determine the spatial and temporal relationship between neuroinflammation and MRI-based
markers of neurodegeneration in different AD subtypes. For the first aim, we will measure TSPO using the state-
of-the-art radioligand 11C-ER176, which has substantial advantages over earlier tracers and has been tested by
our laboratory in AD patients. In the second aim, we will use the improved radioligand 18F-MK-6240 to measure
tau pathology. In the third aim, we will use novel dimensionality reduction and multivariate statistical procedures
to relate TSPO to tau pathology and MRI-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration in an unbiased, data-driven,
and rigorous manner. Our innovative approach uses both PET and CSF measures of inflammation, clinically
homogeneous cohorts, and novel statistical procedures to relate TSPO to tau pathology and neurodegeneration.
The proposed research is significant, as it will inform use of TSPO PET to predict and monitor AD progression
and response to novel therapeutics, and provide a robust imaging biomarker for future inflammatory targets."

10893964,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for almost half of stroke-related morbidity and mortality. Among ICH
survivors, nearly 2/3 will develop either incident cognitive decline, in the form of Vascular contributions to
Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID), or recurrent stroke within 5 years. This rapid functional decline,
the result of progression of underlying Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), is accelerated for Black and
Hispanic ICH survivors, yielding a substantial health disparity. Arresting this progression therefore holds the
promise of markedly improving outcomes for the >50,000 ICH survivors annually in the US and correcting a
considerable health inequity.
Elevated Blood Pressure (BP) is the most potent predictor of incident VCID and stroke after ICH. Yet >50% of
ICH survivors have untreated hypertension after their ICH, with substantially higher rates among Black and
Hispanic patients. Improving BP control following stroke remains a persistent challenge. Clinical trials of BP
lowering programs have not demonstrated efficacy. A chief obstacle has been a failure to engage patients in the
programs. Social determinants of health (SDOH), the wider set of forces and systems shaping daily life,
contribute to risk for most medical conditions, and are key contributors to race/ethnic health inequities.
Nonetheless, there have been no systematic studies of SDOH in ICH, leaving a crucial gap in knowledge.
The overarching goal of the present renewal proposal, entitled Race / Ethnicity, Hypertension and Prevention
of VCID and Stroke after ICH, is to build on the results of the soon-to-conclude Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke
in Minority Populations (R01NS093870) study and fill gaps in the knowledge that is essential for informing the
design of future interventions to enhance BP control and eliminate racial/ethnic inequities in VCID and recurrent
stroke after ICH. The crucial next step is identifying potentially modifiable SDOH that have the highest impact on
1) post-ICH VCID and recurrent stroke; 2) rates of uncontrolled hypertension, and 3) engagement with strategies
to lower BP.
We will enroll and follow longitudinally 700 ICH survivors divided among Black, Hispanic, White, Asian
individuals, all of whom will receive a standardized state-of-the-art evidence-based program of BP management.
We seek to: 1) determine whether modifiable SDOH in association with established biological factors, predict
increased risk for VCID and recurrent stroke after ICH; 2) determine whether modifiable SDOH predict risk of
poor hypertension control after ICH; 3) determine whether modifiable SDOH are associated with decreased
engagement with our standardized BP management program. The data generated will be used to develop novel
strategies for BP management and prevention of VCID and recurrent stroke after ICH, and are likely to have
implications for preventing CSVD-related VCID and stroke, even in those who have not suffered an ICH."
10894132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal outlines an advanced drug delivery methodology, argues for the power of biotherapeutics, and
demonstrates increased biotherapeutic efficacy through receptor upregulation. The benefit of specificity that is
inherent to targeted biotherapeutics comes at the cost of predicated efficacy based on the cognate receptor
being present at a high enough density to achieve a therapeutic effect. Current advances in delivery systems
are enabling localized and prolonged drug release. However, localization is only one component of effective drug
administration. Here, we propose an advanced drug delivery system, rationally designed to potentiate drug
activity while simultaneously localizing and prolonging biotherapeutic concentration. As a clinically relevant
example, this proposal outlines the coordinated localization and potentiation of the natural antifibrotic peptide
hormone, relaxin-2 (RLX), and its receptor, RXFP1, to both treat the underlying causes of shoulder contracture
and to restore joint range of motion. RLX remodels extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins via upregulating matrix
metalloproteases (MMPs) and decreasing collagen levels. We recently made the exciting discovery that
dexamethasone (DEX) increases RXFP1 expression in fibrotic synoviocytes and further exploration of the
molecular mechanism of actions of RLX and DEX will enhance rational drug design. We will test the hypothesis
that co-administration of RLX and DEX from polymeric microparticles (MPs) via a local single intraarticular (IA)
injection into the synovial space, will rapidly alleviate arthrofibrosis symptoms (increased joint stiffness and
decreased range of motion, ROM) and reduce fibrotic tissue accumulation in the afflicted joint. Further, DEX
potentiation of RLX’s antifibrotic activity will decrease the minimum effective dose and increase recovery rate by
modulating RXFP1 receptor density. Successful completion of this proposal will provide a novel treatment for
arthrofibrosis, a debilitating condition which affects more than 15 million people in the United States, and
demonstrate the importance of both delivering a biotherapeutic while also increasing the target receptor density
to maximize efficacy. Importantly, significant preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized
materials and rigorous experimental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and
expertise are in place to address these hypotheses. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are as follows.
Aim 1 determines RLX’s ligand-receptor binding mechanics and the novel role of TGF-β1 and DEX in regulating
RXFP1 expression, as well as RLX’s antifibrotic mechanism of action. Aim 2 identifies the material property
characteristics of biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric MPs loaded with either DEX or RLX. Aim 3
evaluates the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the optimal DEX MP + RLX MP codelivery formulation cocktail
identified in Aim 2 using an established in vivo shoulder contracture model."

Research on the social dynamics of social media use in preteen girls is scarce, yet crucial: suicidal thoughts and
depression have significantly increased among preteen girls in recent years, and this deterioration of mental
health coincides with changes in social media use. Our conceptual model highlights two potential factors that
may make preteen girls more susceptible to the negative effects of specific social media experiences: rejection
sensitivity and pubertal timing. Online rejection experiences, overt and perceived, are a key component of
preteen girls’ social media use that impacts mental health; however, these have not been directly quantified,
particularly among those high in rejection sensitivity. Early puberty may be a window of vulnerability to the
negative effects of social media use in girls, given the link between early puberty, depression, bullying, and social
struggles. To address this, we propose a longitudinal study to examine the bidirectional relations between
preteen girls' mental health and social media experiences, exploring psychological and developmental risk
factors that strengthen – as well as mitigate – these relationships. This study will recruit a community sample of
250 girls, ages 10-11 years at baseline, to assess their mental health, social media use, rejection sensitivity, and
hormone levels over three annual assessments (final age 12-13 years). The study will be the first to include
microEMA (8x per day for 14 days, collected via smartwatch) and daily diaries (14 days) to assess preteen girls’
social media use. This approach offers an unparalleled examination of social media engagement, encompassing
not only frequency and duration, but also how social media is used in daily life: the temporal unfolding of activities,
mood, and social connection and rejection experiences that occur during social media use on a day-to-day basis.
Weekly saliva samples will be collected across this period to assess global levels of puberty-related hormones
as well as whether weekly hormonal fluctuations are linked to social media use and/or rejection sensitivity. In
laboratory clinical interviews, questionnaires, and neural indices of rejection and acceptance sensitivity (EEG)
will complement the social media measures. The overarching aim of this study is to examine the relationships
between preteen girls' mental health and social media experiences, assessing whether high rejection sensitivity,
and puberty impact these relationships; the protective effects of social connection on SM and neural response
to acceptance will also be examined. Tests of the hypotheses within each of the aims will be performed through
a series multi-level (also known as mixed effects) regression models, including growth models which incorporate
time in the study as a variable. Through a detailed and focused assessment of how social media engagement
unfolds over time, we will be able to highlight key turning points where elements of problematic social media use
commence and persist, leading to the onset or maintenance of psychopathology. These elements of problematic
social media use could inform media use guidelines and be future targets for intervention and prevention,
particularly in those who may be sensitive to rejection and/or more advanced in pubertal development."

Investigating the factors that contribute to healthy aging and exceptional long life represents an opportunity to reduce the burden of diseases of aging including Alzheimer’s and related dementias. To this end, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has established four longevity translational projects working to identify genetic and other molecular signatures of long life and resilience to age-related diseases in humans and non-human species.

Antimicrobial drug resistance is an ongoing challenge for many serious diseases, including
staphylococcal infections. Development of new antibiotics to combat methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus—labeled a “serious threat” by the CDC—is a high priority. During drug
development efforts, poor cellular penetration and drug-like features of compounds are a common
roadblock. The studies in this proposal will advance a novel strategy to overcome this roadblock, by
employing a prodrug approach, in which a bipartite molecule is activated intracellularly to release the
active “warhead.” Central to our strategy is the determination of structure-activity relationships that
define selective prodrug activation within S. aureus bacteria. We will advance this strategy by evaluating
our preliminary prodrug SAR using two classes of inhibitors that are distinct in chemical structure and
intracellular target. We will determine the enzymatic selectivity and evaluate how prodrugging alters
biological properties of inhibitors, using in vitro and in vivo assays. In addition, we will use
crystallographic approaches to delineate the structural features that define selective substrate
recognition. Together, this project will establish and validate our approach for subsequent pre-clinical
optimization of much-needed new antistaphylococcal therapies."

Biomolecular condensates are micrometer-scale membraneless structures that self-assemble in living cells.
They are ubiquitous across diverse organisms and exist in protein-only conglomerates or protein associated with
nucleic acids. Biomolecular condensate formation is critical to normal cellular processes and the mis-regulation
of condensate assembly or disassembly drives various pathologies. We recently discovered that the pathological
fusion protein EML4-ALK spontaneously forms micrometer-scale condensates in the cytoplasm while lacking
conventional condensate-forming domains or sequence motifs. This condensate elicits a novel mode of cell
signaling by acting as a physical platform that enriches signaling proteins. The recruitment of client proteins to
elevate local protein concentrations implies a general strategy through which multi-protein condensates achieve
biological function. A major gap in the field is that very little is known about condensate-promoting motifs beyond
a few conventional motifs, or about how proteins work together in condensates to achieve their biological function.
We propose a research program that systematically elucidates novel motifs and biophysical principles in protein-
only condensates. This will be accomplished by leveraging innovative approaches such as CRISPR imaging,
optogenetics manipulation, and custom-written analysis and quantification algorithms to pursue two interrelated
research themes. The first theme is identification of alternative mechanisms that enable protein condensate
formation by: discovering novel condensate-promoting motifs by interrogating fusion proteins known or
suspected to form condensates; determining the essentiality and modularity of such motifs; and mapping motif-
function relationships in condensate-mediated processes. The second theme is to uncover physical principles
that regulate composition and dynamics in multi-protein condensates. Although the molecular details may differ,
the sequence space and principles demonstrated here are broadly applicable to a diverse range of proteins and
cellular processes. The long-term objective of our research program is to build an expanded biophysical
foundation to understand biomolecular condensate assembly and functions across cellular homeostasis and
pathology. Such knowledge brings new opportunities to modulate cellular processes through independent
physical approaches instead of traditional ways of interfering with biochemical reactions, and provide a
biophysical framework to prevent, diagnose, and treat condensate-driven diseases."

There is a vast repertoire of species within cells for which we have a poor understanding of their function and
biomolecular interactions. These species can be referred to as the “dark matter” of biology, as their mechanism
of action is hidden from conventional observation. Our laboratory seeks to illuminate the function of cellular “dark
matter” through the development of new chemical technology. The proposed research program will pursue two
major research thrusts. First, we plan to develop tools for site-specific RNA modification, and apply these tools
for the manipulation, imaging, and isolation of disease relevant RNA protein complexes. We will create tools for
use in live cells and develop the ability to covalently recruit proteins to RNA, forming RNA-protein
macromolecular conjugates. The technology will be applied to study RNAs implicated in disease. Specifically,
we are interested in characterizing the pathways of pathogenicity for the C9orf72 nucleotide repeat expansion
RNA, which is thought to play a major role in genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the second thrust,
we will carry out the in situ synthesis of lipid species within living cells, with the goal of uncovering the molecular
mechanism by which enigmatic lipid species affect cell behavior. We plan to develop approaches enabling the
selective and bioorthogonal delivery of sphingolipids to living cells. Building upon technology previously
developed in our lab, we will deliver cell permeable lipid precursors which will spontaneously assemble into
functional lipids within the cell. Leveraging this approach, we will create photoaffinity probes for the pulldown of
sphingolipid-interacting proteins, with the goal of elucidating the protein partners of the non-canonical
deoxysphingolipid 1-deoxydihydroceramide, which is cytotoxic and implicated in several diseases. Realization
of our research program goals would improve our knowledge of cell biology and lead to the development of new
tools for interrogating RNA and lipid species. Our long-term vision is to create and apply technology that enables
improved mechanistic understanding of biomolecular interactions, leading to an increased understanding of
human disease, and accelerating the development of possible therapeutic interventions."
10898812,"Disturbances of the human vaginal microbiota can cause severe complications for women and, if pregnant, their
neonates. Currently, about one in four women experience vaginal dysbiosis, a condition marked by the absence
of the health-associated genus Lactobacillus and the presence of a heterogenous consortium of microbes.
Although clinical studies have found associations between Lactobacillus dominant vaginal communities and
reduced vaginal infection, the complexity of the role that vaginal microbiota play in the protection against
pathobiont outgrowth has not been thoroughly studied. Without an understanding of protective microbial and
host factors leading into vaginal dysbiosis, antibiotic therapeutics targeting the symptomatic influx of other taxa
have not been effective in preventing the recurrence of infection. Thus, it is necessary to define the initial factors
that increase susceptibility to vaginal infection. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the
capacity at which the vaginal microbiota can directly confer protection against pathobiont outgrowth or indirectly
alter the local immune response to inhibit pathobiont colonization. To attribute a reduction of pathobiont
colonization to local factors, we will delineate whether the vaginal microbiota or immune profile are shaped by
microbial and immunological processes in the gut. We hypothesize that endogenous vaginal microbiota are
sufficient to determine susceptibility to pathobiont colonization and shape the local immune profile both
in homeostasis and in vaginal dysbiosis. To understand both the vaginal microbiota’s influence on the
transition to the susceptible state of vaginal dysbiosis and the ability to enhance immunological protection against
pathobiont outgrowth, we will interrogate in vivo and in vitro models. Specifically, we will determine the microbe
and immune factors that mediate protection against vaginal dysbiosis-associated pathobionts Group B
Streptococcus and Prevotella bivia by utilization of the HMbmice model, which reflects a humanized vaginal tract
dominated by Lactobacillus spp. We will describe the vaginal microbiota of HMbmice to understand the community
dynamics and compositions through longitudinal 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We will then employ mini-
bioreactors to cultivate vaginal microbes in vitro, testing for specific bacteria and metabolites that are capable of
limiting vaginal infection. Additionally, we will utilize flow cytometry to elucidate the impact that different vaginal
microbiota have on training of the local immune function. Lastly, we will generate gnotobiotic mice to resolve
whether the vaginal microbiota and immune system are influenced by the gut, establishing the source of vaginal
susceptibility to infection. Ultimately, this proposal seeks to benefit underrepresented groups in science through
the therapeutic discoveries for women’s health and the training of the applicant, who will focus on disseminating
scientific knowledge to a diverse population. Baylor College of Medicine is the optimal institution for the fulfillment
of this proposal because of the applicant’s access to cutting-edge research facilities, basic and clinical science
experts, and dedicated research and career mentorship."
10902891,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder without cure. RTT is characterized by
cognitive impairment, seizures, and loss of intentional motor skills, and is caused by heterozygous mutations of
the
X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene on the X chromosome. As female mammalian cells
undergo X chromosome inactivation (XCI), female patients with RTT are mosaic in terms of their MeCP2
expression; around half their cells express the wild-type allele and the other half express the loss-of-function
mutant allele. Thus, reactivation of the silenced, functional MeCP2 allele may serve as a therapeutic treatment
for these patients with RTT. Current efforts to reactivate MeCP2 have focused on approaches to globally
reactivate the inactive X chromosome. However, prior studies have shown that global reactivation of the
inactive X is associated with adverse side effects, such as the development of hematologic and gastrointestinal
malignancies. Recently, we demonstrated that targeted reactivation of MeCP2 could be achieved efficiently by
using a combination of CRISPR-based epigenome editing tools to demethylate the MECP2 promoter and
insulate the MECP2 locus through recruitment of CTCF in vitro. However, whether this approach is sufficient to
rescue RTT phenotypes in vivo and the molecular mechanisms underlying MeCP2 reactivation remain
unknown. This proposal seeks to address these questions using a diverse set of Mecp2 reporter systems. In
Aim 1, I will perform multiplexed DNA methylation editing of Mecp2 in vivo and in vitro to identify the epigenetic
mechanisms underlying Mecp2 reactivation and to quantify the extent of reactivation in the mouse brain. In Aim
2, I will assess the motor function, hippocampal circuit function, cognitive function, and survival of edited RTT
mice to determine if DNA methylation editing rescues RTT associated phenotypes in vivo. Together, these aims
will help elucidate the mechanisms that allow for Mecp2 reactivation from the inactive X chromosome and
guide epigenetic approaches to treat RTT and other X-linked disorders. The training plan presented in this
proposal will allow me to benefit from expert mentors and collaborators across Columbia University Irving
Medical Center, preparing me with the scientific and clinical training necessary to become an independent
physician scientist studying biology of neurological disease."
10903225,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammation promotes regeneration of epithelial tissues, but it is also implicated in intestinal pathologies
including cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease. Recent studies in barrier tissues (i.e. skin
and airway epithelium) demonstrate that stem cells in these organs maintain a memory of inflammatory
exposure, which enhances their wound healing capacity in later injuries. Whether intestinal stem cells (ISCs)
remember encounters with inflammatory stimuli, and how this affects their subsequent function, is poorly
understood. Our group recently demonstrated that infection with the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides
polygyrus (Hp) generates inflammatory granulomas in the murine intestine, which alter ISC identity and induce
a fetal-like transcriptional signature in granuloma-associated crypts (GACs). Furthermore, we observed that ISCs
isolated from GACs maintain this fetal-like identity when cultured as organoids ex vivo, indicating that they retain
a memory of their exposure to helminth infection. The goal of this application is to investigate whether this
inflammatory memory is encoded through epigenetic reprogramming of ISCs and how this process impacts their
future regenerative capacity. In Aim 1, I will perturb candidate molecular regulators of inflammatory memory
identified through analysis of epigenetic datasets comparing enteroids generated from non-inflamed tissue and
fetal-like spheroids generated from GACs. Next, I will examine the in vivo epigenetic landscapes of intestinal
crypts from naïve, Hp-infected, and previously infected/recovered mice using the 10x genomics Multiome assay.
This will enable characterization of cell states across conditions and identification of open chromatin domains
that are established during inflammation and retained after its resolution. Analysis of transcription factor motifs
associated with these regions will provide additional insight into the signaling pathways that control this
phenomenon. In Aim 2, I will study the downstream effects of these epigenetic changes on ISC function. I will
first test whether ISCs that had prior exposure to inflammation have increased organoid forming capacity in vitro.
I will then investigate whether previously inflamed tissue has faster regeneration kinetics in vivo, by inducing a
second injury and assessing tissue morphology, proliferation, and differentiation. This study will improve our
mechanistic understanding of ISC function in regeneration and provide insight into the role of inflammatory
memory in intestinal homeostasis and pathology. The proposed research will be carried out under the guidance
of a multi-disciplinary co-mentorship team with expertise in ISC biology and allergic inflammation within the
dynamic and collaborative environment of UCSF. The proposed research plan is integrated with a
comprehensive training plan which involves building conceptual knowledge in intestinal biology and immunology,
and developing technical proficiency in the use of transgenic animal models, epigenomic assays, and
bioinformatic analyses. During this fellowship, I seek to advance my mentorship, networking, and career skills to
ultimately enable a successful transition to an independent investigator position at a top-tier academic institution."
10903331,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Estrogen receptor (ER) signaling is the main driver of tumorigenesis in ER+ breast cancers by inducing
proliferation and survival through genomic and non-genomic means. Therefore, inhibition of ER signaling has
been a mainstay of treatment for decades. While primary ER+ breast cancer has a relatively good initial
prognosis, ~30% of patients will develop treatment-refractory recurrence or metastasis within their lifetime, with
bone metastasis being twice as likely for patients with hormone receptor positive disease. Despite the frequency
of diagnosis, breast-to-bone metastasis of ER+ breast cancer remains an incurable condition. Treatment
includes administration of ER antagonists like Fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitors, often in combination with a
CDK4/6 inhibitor, which negatively regulates the cell cycle downstream of ER activity. These treatments are
designed to slow progression of disease but are incapable of eliminating metastatic cells. A new endocrine-
targeted therapy, Elacestrant, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ER+, ESR1-mutant advanced
or metastatic breast cancer. Interestingly, this compound shows selective agonist activity in the bone
microenvironment, and antagonist activity in cancer cells. Although Elacestrant has been approved by the FDA,
the compound is understudied and is only approved for a fraction of patients. This proposal will utilize in vitro, in
vivo, and ex vivo models of breast-to-bone metastasis of ER+ breast cancer to evaluate the efficacy of
Elacestrant versus the standard of care, as well as dissect the transcriptional landscape which is promoted by
its ER modulation in the treatment setting. Intra-Iliac artery injection of PDX cells in pre-clinical rodent models
will be used to model metastasis and evaluate progression free survival following treatment with Elacestrant as
a mono-agent, in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, as well as in novel therapeutic combinations. Because
Elacestrant-induced ER-controlled transcriptional regulation is context dependent, NanoString GeoMx spatial
transcriptomic sequencing, ER ChIP-seq, and rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous
proteins (RIME) will be used to begin to determine how one drug can act as an antagonist and agonist in different
contexts. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that Elacestrant will extend progression free survival in
pre-clinical models of bone metastasis because it displays context dependent agonist and antagonist activity.
This study will not only lead to a more complete understanding of ER biology in the bone metastatic
microenvironment but will also provide insights which could lead to improved patient outcomes. This project will
also afford me the outstanding training experience to work with multidisciplinary leaders across multiple fields of
biology while I work to complete my PhD training at Virginia Commonwealth University."

10904830,"Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period
of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of
the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms.
However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the
most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain
uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented
opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical
maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional
psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16.
The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific
features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to
relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline
data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of
differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well-
established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and
imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from
neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices)
associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and
cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further
substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic
scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether
cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent
dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass
participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood
safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of
exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical
maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the
conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors
with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative
interventions."
10904832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adipose tissue is a major depot for senescent cell accumulation and sterile inflammation in aging. While adipose
tissue senescence in aging is causally linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, the underlying
mechanisms are undefined. Here, we propose the novel hypothesis that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a class
II histone deacetylase, plays a key role in promoting adipose tissue senescence in aging by promoting
mitochondrial dysfunction. Our preliminary data demonstrate that HDAC9 expression is increased in adipose
tissues of aged mice and humans. Moreover, HDAC9 gene deletion improves adipose tissue mitochondrial
energy expenditure and reduces adipose stem cell (ASC) senescence in 1-year-old chow diet fed mice, while
protecting ASCs against senescence in vitro. Our hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that increased HDAC9 expression in aged adipose tissues contributes to mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics. Our preliminary data suggest that HDAC9
is strongly upregulated in the mature adipocytes of aged mice. Therefore, we will employ two novel mouse
models to test our hypothesis: adipocyte-specific HDAC9 knockout (A-KO; HDAC9flox/flox adiponectin-Cre) and
adipocyte-specific transgenic (A-Tg, HDAC9Tg-flox-STOP-flox adiponectin-Cre) mice. Primary ASCs will be cultured
and differentiated to mature adipocytes. Mitochondrial function and dynamics will be measured in adipose tissue
explants and mature adipocytes using the Seahorse analyzer, Western blot, immunofluorescence, transmission
electron microscopy and confocal imaging. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HDAC9 gene deletion represses
the development of adipose tissue senescence and promotes healthy adipose tissue aging, while overexpression
of HDAC9 accelerates adipose tissue aging and augments senescence. We will quantify senescent cell
accumulation in adipose tissue and metabolic health through glucose and insulin tolerance testing. ASC cultures
from global HDAC9 knockout mice will be used to assess susceptibility to UV-induced senescence. Additionally,
senescent cell accumulation in A-KO and A-Tg mice will be assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase
staining, qRT-PCR and Western blot. This project will allow me to acquire deep knowledge of mitochondrial
biology while developing new technical skills, including primary cell culture, tissue staining and imaging. Most
importantly, it will allow me to gain expertise in conducting rigorous, hypothesis-driven research, thus setting the
stage for a career as a physician-scientist. The project will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Neal
Weintraub and co-mentorship of Dr. Masuko Ushio-Fukai in the Vascular Biology Center at the Medical College
of Georgia at Augusta University, which has a rich history of successful pre- and post-doctoral training. We
anticipate that findings from this proposal will identify elevated HDAC9 expression in adipose tissue aging as a
key mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence and will provide insight into potential therapeutic
approaches to improve adipose tissue health in aging."

 Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common genetic conditions in the United States with a
prevalence rate estimated at 6.7 people with DS per 10,000 of the population in 20101 and is characterized by
global developmental delays, intellectual disability, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),2,3 which may be linked
to severe impairments in speech and language domains for those with DS.4
 Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGS) is a novel therapy for OSA in adults and children.5,6 Since 2015,
Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEEI) has conducted a multi-center FDA-approved Phase 1 clinical trial
examining the effects of HGS on children and adolescents ages 10-21 with DS and has shown to diminish
OSA. The primary outcome is implant safety while secondary measures are changes in the standard measure
of OSA called the Apnea Hypopnea Index. Following qualitative parental reports of speech and language
improvement, formal language testing using a procedure called Expressive Language Sampling (ELS) and
neurocognitive testing (NCT) were conducted on 5 children children prior to surgery and then 3-6 months post
HGS. Results showed an improvement in their IQs, in the diversity of vocabulary and complexity of syntax in
spoken language, as well as in several neurocognitive domains. However, despite this promising data, more
rigorous testing is needed with a larger sample size to demonstrate the significance of these findings in a
rigorous fashion. This proposed study focuses on the effects on neurocognition and expressive language
before and after hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGS) treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) for 57
children and adolescents who are 10 to 21 years of age. Our aims include: (1) we will test if the treatment of
severe OSA with HGS significantly improves the neurocognition of patients with DS. Our hypothesis is
that HGS, by improving sleep and thereby facilitating memory consolidation, will result in patients with DS
having an improvement of at least 0.5 SD from baseline neurocognitive measures. The primary outcomes of
the study will be five neurocognitive measures collected pre-operatively and at 6 months postoperatively: brief
attention, sustained attention, processing speed, verbal intelligence, and executive functioning; and (2) we will
test if the treatment of severe OSA with HGS significantly improves the expressive language skills
(ELS) of patients with DS. Our hypothesis is that HGS, by strengthening the motor tone of the tongue
musculature, will result in patients with DS having an improvement of at least 0.5 SD on the ELS measures.
The two primary outcomes will be a measure of the diversity of vocabulary and a measure of syntactic
complexity, each derived from an ELS narrative, or storytelling procedure. Narrative samples will be collected
pre-operatively and then 6 months post-operatively at each site and sent to a central site where blinded
investigators will transcribe and analyze the samples of expressive language."
10894715,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to determine how interoceptive nutrient detection modulates chemosensory responses and
innate behavior. Protein-rich foods are widely considered beneficial to postpartum mothers by supplying energy
and cellular building materials, or improving moods by acting as precursors for neurotransmitters. However, it
remains unclear whether the nutrient’s restorative effect can also arise from other means: specifically, whether and
how dietary amino acids can trigger signaling events to modulate neuronal function and behavior. To address these
complex questions, it is necessary to dissociate the multifaceted functions of dietary proteins in neuromodulation or
nutrition. Gut enteroendocrine cells, found in both flies and mammals, present excellent opportunities to address
these questions, because these cells release peptide hormones in a nutrient-specific manner and, with modern
genetic tools, can be specifically manipulated to release their hormones without ingestion of the nutrients. Using
fruit flies as a model, this project leverages the powerful genetic toolkit and tractable nervous & gut enteroendocrine
systems of D. melanogaster. Preliminary data showed that high-protein diet can accelerate receptivity recovery in
mated females. At the molecular level, a subset of enteroendocrine cells exhibits heightened sensitivity to amino
acids, thereby increasing the likelihood of releasing a specific peptide hormone from those cells upon protein
ingestion. At the neuronal level, high-protein diet heightens the sensitivity of two types of olfactory receptor neurons
(ORNs) to external social cues. Importantly, the specific gut-released peptide hormone is necessary for the ORN
sensitization as well as the restorative effect of high protein on postmating receptivity. This proposal will test the
hypothesis that mated females employ a “gut-to-nose” signaling pathway whereby dietary amino acids trigger
the release of a peptide hormone from the gut to regulate sensitivity to social cues and restore critical innate
behavior. The proposed experiments will characterize the regulation and function of the gut-released peptide
hormone (Aim 1), identify the molecular mechanism by which the specific enteroendocrine cell subset responds to
amino acids (Aim 2), and determine the role of peripheral chemosensory neuromodulation on receptivity recovery
(Aim 3). The mechanistic insights expected from this research will shed light on how macronutrients impinge on
particular internal physiological states to influence neuronal function and behavior—in a manner beyond nutrient
assimilation or energy supply. Importantly, the proposed research reveals that nutrient responses of gut
enteroendocrine cells can be modulated by mating status, and that the outcome of this modulated interoception
(elevated release of a peptide hormone by dietary proteins) can in turn impact exteroception of social cues (ORNs’
sensitization to pheromones)."
10894736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Language acquisition at the neural level requires the maturation and engagement of speech comprehension
and speech production centers in the frontal and temporal lobes. The structural connections (white matter, WM)
between these centers must therefore play an important role in children’s ability to learn speech with rapid
proficiency and without explicit instruction. However, an important question is: does maturation of WM tracts
(through increased myelination or efficiency of connections) precede the acquisition of increasingly complex
components of language, setting up the developing brain to acquire language? Or does language acquisition
simply reinforce ongoing WM development in an activity-dependent manner? Little is known about the typical
developmental trends in WM maturation with respect to the known stages of language acquisition, despite the
importance of these connections in mature language functioning. This proposal aims first to clarify the
relationship between WM connectivity and language acquisition in typically developing infants by examining the
timing of WM changes with emerging language functions. Our hypothesis is that rapid maturation of WM tracts
enables infants to learn increasingly complex aspects of language through iterative feedback between frontal
and temporal language centers.
 The importance of WM is further reinforced when considering language deficits seen in pathologies that
damage WM connections as well as cortical speech centers. WM damage in adults can result in deficits ranging
from problems in naming and verbal fluency to aphasia, but infants have a remarkable ability to acquire language
normally when WM tracts are similarly affected, raising questions about WM plasticity in the developing brain.
The second aim of this proposal is to examine WM tracts after early-onset focal epilepsy (L-EPI) and perinatal
stroke (L-PSP) in the left hemisphere and to characterize how differences in their microstructure impact overall
language processing. Our hypothesis here is that disruption of typical WM maturation due to either an acute
stroke or chronic epilepsy differentially impairs tract organization such that chronic seizure activity disrupts typical
myelination of WM tracts in the language network in L-EPIs, impairing communication between cortical language
centers without leading to hemispheric reorganization. In contrast, early ablation of WM in L-PSPs disinhibits
right hemisphere tract development, allowing language acquisition and function to proceed normally.
 This proposal aims to characterize the brain-behavior relationships of key WM pathways in the language
network in typically developing infants and young children that are acquiring language (Aim 1) (NIDCD Voice,
Speech, and Language Program: Language, Understanding Normal Function); and aims to understand how
disruptions to these key WM tracts due to either L-EPI or L-PSP affect long-term WM organization and linguistic
function (Aim 2) (NIDCD Voice, Speech, and Language Program: Language, Understanding Diseases and
Disorders)."
10894737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is critical to improve the reach and efficacy of psychosocial treatments for childhood attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the single most prevalent pediatric mental health disorder (9% prevalence;
Danielson et al., 2018a). Evidence-based treatments for ADHD, such as behavioral parent training (BPT),
produce moderate effect sizes on clinical outcomes including parenting skills, parent stress, child impairment,
and child academic functioning when targeted (Evans et al., 2018; Merrill et al., 2017; Power et al., 2012).
However, the impact of BPT in the community is attenuated by poor transportability and high therapist
involvement in standard treatment. The magnitude of treatment need is far beyond the capacity of the current
mental health system, with only about 30% of parents receiving BPT (Danielson et al., 2018b). Technology-
delivered interventions, and specifically mHealth applications, can overcome this gap as 81% of Americans
own a smartphone (Pew Research Center, 2019), and many minoritized and low-income individuals rely on
smartphones for internet access.
 The current study aims to leverage an established data collection and intervention development
smartphone application to develop and pilot a mobile BPT intervention for parents of children with ADHD and
academic difficulties. The intervention will target candidate mechanisms of child behavioral and academic
success including parenting skills, parent academic management, and engagement with treatment material.
mBPT will include: 1) online, asynchronous treatment videos, 2) survey data collection, 3) prompts to complete
between session parent practice, and 4) personalized adaptive components to enhance parenting skills.
Following intervention development and refinement, 60 children with ADHD will be recruited from area pediatric
practices and randomly assigned to (1) business and usual (BAU) or (2) mBPT. Within the mBPT group,
adaptive components of the intervention will be evaluated in a microrandomized trial.
 Primary aims are to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention approach. Further,
the hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., parent skill use, user engagement) will be measured and correspondence
to hypothesized outcomes (e.g., improved child behavior and homework performance) will be evaluated. Data
collected will be used to justify a larger effectiveness trial to evaluate mBPT effects on child behavior and
academic impairment."

context of a teen dating relationship, is pervasive and associated with myriad negative health outcomes for
youth. Parental monitoring of adolescents’ interpersonal relationships and activities is a powerful and
modifiable protective factor to prevent ARA. However, for Hispanic immigrant families, parent-adolescent
acculturation gaps (i.e., differences in acculturation) may create challenges in using parental monitoring as an
ARA prevention tool. Less is known about which specific acculturation gaps are related to decreased parental
monitoring and increased ARA. Furthermore, few parent-adolescent ARA prevention interventions exist,
especially ones culturally tailored for Hispanic immigrant families. The goal of this mentored career
development award is to identify specific acculturation gaps that create the most challenges to achieving
optimal parental monitoring and address these acculturation gaps through development of a parent-adolescent
ARA prevention intervention for Hispanic immigrant families. Dating Matters for Parents (DMP), a Centers for
Disease Control developed ARA prevention intervention for middle school aged youth and their parents, will be
used as a foundation for intervention development. Guided by an experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship
team and with strong institutional support, Dr. Ragavan, who is the PI and an early career physician-scientist,
will build upon a upon a descriptive research background to gain critical new skills in: 1) assessment of parent-
adolescent interaction and the development of parent-adolescent relationships; 2) theory-based, stakeholder-
involved intervention development; 3) clinical trial design and analysis; and 4) leadership and team
management. These career goals are tightly linked to three research aims. In Aim 1, Dr. Ragavan will use
observation-based techniques to examine, in a sample of 50 Hispanic parent-adolescent dyads, which
acculturation gaps are related to parental monitoring and ARA and thus most important to target during
intervention development. Informed by Aim 1 results and guided by a stakeholder advisory committee, in Aim 2
Dr. Ragavan will use the Method for Program Adaptation through Community Engagement framework to
develop a novel parent-adolescent ARA prevention intervention for Hispanic immigrant families (called Juntos
[“Together”]). In Aim 3, Dr. Ragavan will conduct a pilot two-armed randomized clinical trial of Juntos among
middle school aged Hispanic adolescents and a first-generation immigrant parent. Primary outcomes of the
pilot RCT include feasibility and acceptability; a secondary exploratory outcome will be descriptively assessing
candidate outcomes for inclusion in the fully powered trial. By completing this K23, Dr. Ragavan will have the
training, experience, and preliminary data needed to become an independent physician-scientist leading
studies aligned with NICHD’s strategic priority of “exploring prevention and treatment strategies to address the
leading causes of trauma and injury in children and adolescents.”"

Channelopathies are diseases or physiological disorders caused by the dysfunctional ion channel proteins. For
example, the essential mechanosensitive channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 have been tightly linked to multiple
diseases, such as distal arthrogryposis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, and Gordon Syndrome. There
are ~100 disease alleles that have been identified in PIEZO1/2, most of which caused severe physiological
disorders in cardiovascular, vestibular, neuronal, and connective tissues. Despite the electrophysiological
studies in the patients’ cells indicated that these symptoms are likely due to a mechanotransduction defect, the
underlying mechanisms or molecular determinants of PIEZO diseases remain largely unknown. Here, I
introduce a facile and powerful in vivo system for the functional study of PIEZO; the stretch sensitive and
responsive C. elegans reproductive tract. I have discovered that the dysfunctional PEZO-1 (the sole ortholog of
PIEZO in C. elegans) causes severely reduced brood sizes due to the crushing oocytes in the spermatheca
and poor sperm motility (3). This proposed study aims to discover the nature of the pathways and genetic
interactors that enable PIEZO to respond to mechanical stimuli and coordinate mechanotransductive tissue
function in vivo. Furthermore, I will identify new genetic suppressors and associated pathways in the C.
elegans reproductive tract. This basic research will shed light on the understanding of channelopathy diseases
caused by PIEZO dysfunction and the potential therapeutical drug target design. To achieve these goals, I will
pursue three specific aims: The first aim is to identify novel genetic interactors of PEZO-1 in C. elegans. A
combination of genetic screens and biochemical assays will be used to achieve this aim. I expect that
completing the proposed aims will establish the C. elegans reproductive system as a simple and genetically
tractable model to elucidate PIEZO biological functions and to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
PEZO-1 activity. The second aim is to determine whether inter-tissue signaling pathways (such as the sex
hormone prostaglandin) is affected in pezo-1 mutants. To achieve this aim, I will perform genetic and
biochemical assays to determine whether PEZO-1 contributes to prostaglandin synthesis and secretion, which
are essential for sperm attraction. The final aim is to identify target tissues and relative contribution of PIEZO
disease alleles to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling. To achieve this aim, I will generate a set of the
tissue-specific Ca2+ indicators to quantify the calcium influx in each mutant. These studies should lead to a
comprehensive delineation of genes that interact with pezo-1, and new pathways that involve
mechanotransduction. This research will also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the genetic diseases
caused by PIEZO dysfunction. Overall, this K99/R00 award will strengthen my research skillset and facilitate
my transition into an independent researcher in the field of genetics, development, mechanobiology, and
translational science of human rare diseases."

MPRC will support population research in the Primary Research Areas of Gender, Family, and Social Change,
Social and Economic Inequality, Health in Social Context, and Migration and Immigrant Processes, and will
support innovations in data and methods for population research across these substantive areas. This support
will be provided by three cores that are central to increasing the pace and impact of population science
research: Administrative, Development, and Scientific and Technical. These cores will provide research
infrastructure for population scientists, foster a vibrant, interdisciplinary intellectual environment, and promote
the development of junior and underrepresented minority scholars in population research. The cores will also
each provide resources to population researchers in institutions without Population Dynamics Center (P2C)
funding. The Admin core will support the preparation of grant applications, post-award project management,
and will provide services for other cores. The Admin core will deploy web-based tools to enhance Center
activities and will provide scholars effective means of managing research collaborations and disseminating
research. The Development Core will promote the intellectual community of population research at UMD
through seed grant programs, by organizing a weekly seminar series, workshops on focused topics, and by
organizing and co-sponsoring conferences and symposia. The Core also supports resident population scientist
and visiting population scientist programs that provide options of both a physical and a virtual home for
population researchers whose research productivity may be enhanced by the infrastructural and intellectual
resources of MPRC and UMD. Taking advantage of our location in the Washington, DC area, MPRC will
promote the research of our associates through engaging with the research and data activities of federal
agencies in the Washington, D.C., including through support to biennial workshops and conferences on time
use research using the American Time Use Survey and its international counterpart surveys. The Scientific and
Technical Core will manage the Center’s computing resources, and provide confidential, secure-data access,
both in-house and through facilitating and promoting access to campus-wide secure-data computing
infrastructure. It will also provide statistical computing short courses and consulting to support empirically-
focused population research."
10895061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The MPRC Administrative Core has as its goal the provision of services to allow the Center and its Cores to
operate as a smooth-running, productive, dynamic, and innovative unit that reaches across the university and
to the broader community of population research. The Admin Core provides leadership and strategy for the
Center through the Center Director, Associate Director, and Executive Committee faculty roles. This includes
advocating for MPRC within the university, and acting as liaison to university administration across its
departments, colleges, and schools. The Administrative Core Coordinator, as a full-time staff member, serves
a similar function at the level of the unit administrators across our Faculty Associates academic departments.
Everyday functions such as Associate and Affiliate membership application and record-keeping are performed
by the Admin Core. The Admin Core provides services to the MPRC Executive Committee including meeting
preparation and follow-up, and maintaining and retrieving as needed the “institutional memory” of the MPRC.
The Admin Core provides logistical and administrative support to researchers for vital functions including
external grant submission and management, and for research oversight, compliance, and for research
dissemination. The Admin Core provides the administrative services to maintain a moving target of 80 to 90
Faculty Associates, plus those Associates’ sponsored Internal and External MPRC Affiliates. These include
resident and visiting scholar UMD paid or unpaid employee appointments. The Admin Core’s information
services to the Associates include assistance with writing research press releases, preparation of weekly or bi-
weekly electronic circulars of population research news to Associates and Affiliates, and semi-annual
Newsletters advertising recent and upcoming MPRC activities to a wider audience. The Admin Core provides
support to the Scientific and Technical Core and the Development Cores. It provides highly efficient
administrative staffing services to those Cores, including handling of seed grant applications, reserving
collaborative and workshop space, tracking of Associates’ and Affiliates’ participation in MPRC activities, and
enabling access to both MPRC physical facilities and to university privileges ranging from electronic and library
borrowing card provision to payroll system engagement. The physical facilities overseen by the Admin Core
include state-of-the-art meeting and conference rooms, collaborative spaces, restricted data laboratories, and
offices of MPRC staff and faculty directors, resident and visiting population scientists, and research assistants.
The Admin Core also provides support services that are vital for the logistics of conferences and symposia
organized by MPRC and held in both MPRC and other campus facilities."
10895062,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Development Core has, as its primary mission, the development, support, and promotion of population
research of the highest scientific merit, in line with our four Primary Research Areas: Gender, Family and
Social Change, Health in Social Context, Social and Economic Inequality, and Migration and Immigrant
Processes. The Core’s mission is accomplished through: 1) promoting active inter-disciplinary engagement in
population research through seminars, workshops and other collaborative opportunities including with the
Federal statistics agencies and larger metropolitan Washington DC community; 2) supporting our faculty, in
particular junior and underrepresented minority (URM) faculty, to develop, expand, and consolidate their
research agenda in the population sciences through Seed Grants; 3) hosting resident and visiting population
scientists in order to support and expand collaborative research opportunities for MPRC faculty associates and
extending outreach of intellectual resources to our External Affiliates, particularly those at institutions without a
Population Dynamics Center (P2C); 4) fostering the careers of underrepresented scholars in population
research in order to foster inclusive and broadened perspectives in population research; and 5) co-sponsoring
symposia and workshops on a range of population related issues in order to increase our visibility in and
outside of UMD and strengthen our interdisciplinary mission. The seminar series and workshops offer
invaluable opportunities for the UMD community to engage with cutting edge theoretical and empirical
advances in population research and to develop fruitful collaborations outside of UMD. The Seed Grant
program is fundamental to supporting our faculty, especially junior faculty and URM faculty, to develop
proposals for submission to NICHD’s Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) and for proposals in the PDB
mission submitted to other federal agencies and foundations. It is a dynamic program, adapting to special
opportunities for high-impact research, such as those occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic or sudden
restrictions on reproductive health access. The resident and visiting researcher programs are critical to
increasing the visibility of MPRC nationally, internationally and the greater Washington DC community. Our
outreach to External Affiliates, particularly at non-P2C institutions, enriches population research at MPRC and
provides vital networks to access intellectual resources for our External Affiliates. The Development Core’s
programs to support URM scholars integrate diversity throughout all of our activities, including seminar and
workshops, mentoring, seed grants and resident and visiting scholars programs, thereby addressing the call by
NICHD-PDB and other federal funding agencies to increase the visibility of URM researchers in population
research. Finally, co-sponsoring symposia is a highly effective way to interact with other entities at UMD and to
further elevate the role of MPRC in promoting inter-disciplinary population research at and outside of UMD."
10901455,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gastric cancer is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is diagnosed in
approximately one million people per year. The most common type of gastric cancer is intestinal-type, which
develops through a series of metaplastic and dysplastic lesions of the stomach lining beginning with pyloric
metaplasia. The hallmark of pyloric metaplasia is the transdifferentiation of gastric chief cells into spasmolytic
polypeptide-expressing metaplastic (SPEM) cells. While gastric carcinogenesis is histologically well defined,
the molecular drivers of the cellular and morphological changes that occur in each of these stages have not yet
been discovered. Transcription factors are proteins that control cell fate via gene expression during
development and in adult progenitor cell differentiation. To determine if transcription factors also control cell
fate in metaplastic processes in the stomach, my lab probed for the expression of select factors in carcinogenic
gastric tissue and found a strong upregulation of the master transcription factor SOX9 in SPEM cells. To follow
up on this finding, I characterized two novel transgenic mouse models of pyloric metaplasia with Sox9 knock-
out in chief cells and found that SPEM cell formation and subsequent carcinogenesis was severely disrupted. I
hypothesize that SOX9 is necessary for chief cells to transdifferentiate into SPEM cells which are
essential for carcinogenesis. To understand the significance of SOX9 in SPEM cells and carcinogenesis, I
propose three specific aims. First, I will investigate the functional role of SOX9 by performing an in vitro
experiment using organoids from Sox9 knock-out tissues to determine if SOX9 is required for chief cells to
transdifferentiate. I will also examine whether Sox9 knock-out chief cells are able to stimulate to
transdifferentiate into SPEM cells. Second, I will perform transcriptomic profiling to identify direct downstream
genes of SOX9 to elucidate its transcriptional mechanism in SPEM cell identify and function. Finally, I will
investigate the success of microenvironment recruitment which is essential to the progression of
carcinogenesis without SOX9 upregulation in chief cells. This will elucidate a biological mechanism by which
SPEM cells drive carcinogenesis. Together, these data will provide functional and transcriptional mechanisms
of SOX9 in SPEM cells during gastric cancer development. This research will move the field forward by
uncovering the molecular mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis and will provide potential therapeutic targets
for preventing gastric cancer development."
10901179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Survivors of critical illness often face significant challenges, such as neurocognitive disorders, physical
disabilities, and respiratory limitations. Healthcare disparities by race heighten such challenges. Risk
prediction tools designed to identify high-risk patients for interventions such as post-acute care clinics may
exacerbate existing bias among racial and ethnic groups. Intending to address bias in prediction tools for
survivors of critical illness, our team brings expertise in health services research focusing on healthcare
disparities, statistical modeling, and causal inference. In previous work, we have highlighted racial differences
in patients with cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 across different healthcare systems, including the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Furthermore, we have begun exploring outcomes among survivors of
critical illness including mortality and re-admission rates and developed an innovative post-ICU care model
showing early indications of reducing hospital readmissions, increasing hospital-free days, and reducing
mortality across diverse patient populations. As an F32 grant recipient, I will integrate and build on the
expertise of my mentorship to identify and characterize racial disparities within three datasets of critical care
illness survivors as defined by mortality, 90-day re-admissions, and hospital-free days (HFDs) at 90 days. In
parallel, I will compare bias within two statistical models used to stratify patients by one-year mortality: (1) the
Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score, a mortality risk model widely used to guide interventions among
Veterans, and (2) the PREDICT score, a simplified one-year mortality risk model used at first patient contact to
guide interventions such as palliative care consultation. Statistical fairness is an emerging concept geared
toward reducing bias within statistical models and algorithms. To address any identified bias within our models,
our team will employ novel approaches to achieve statistical fairness, including double prioritization. In addition
to identifying healthcare disparities within a population of increasing care complexity, my proposal investigates
statistical models as underlying contributors to healthcare disparities, aiming to rectify such inequalities through
refined and equitable modeling approaches. In doing so, we propose establishing a fair care delivery
framework for critical illness survivors. With close mentorship from an experienced team in healthcare
disparities research, healthcare delivery, and innovative research methodologies at the University of
Pittsburgh, this training plan forms a foundation for a Career Development Award and a future career as a
physician-scientist."
10906105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anorexia of acute illness has traditionally been considered a maladaptive response in the face of a presumed
hyper-catabolic state. Surprisingly, we found that anorexia is protective in bacterial sepsis. Glucose
supplementation during the period of anorexia induced by bacterial sepsis is detrimental and promotes mortality,
even in the absence of live pathogen as in the mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sepsis. Core fasting
metabolic pathways activated in LPS sepsis, including liberation of free fatty acids, ketogenesis, and production
of fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), an endocrine FGF hormone that mediates adaptive responses to
metabolic stresses such as starvation, are suppressed by glucose supplementation. Knockout mice that are
deficient in FGF21 or in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, which cannot produce FGF21 or
ketones, are more susceptible to bacterial sepsis. We have also found that similar to normal fasting responses,
lipid droplets accumulate in the liver and kidney during bacterial sepsis. Emerging evidence suggests that lipid
droplets may in fact reflect protective mechanisms against cellular stress rather than lipotoxicity. Based on our
preliminary data, we hypothesize that components of fasting metabolism are integral protective mechanisms that
support survival and tissue protection during bacterial sepsis. Over the next five years, key goals for the Huen
laboratory are to determine whether and how components of fasting metabolism: 1) FGF21, 2) ketogenesis, and
3) lipid droplet formation, are protective in bacterial sepsis. Proposed studies include using pharmacologic
targeting and genetic mouse models of tissue-specific deletion of key components of these metabolic processes.
Interdisciplinary methods will be used to investigate the interactive physiology between the innate immune
system and metabolic organs, in order to elucidate the complex interactions between multiple organ systems
including the brain, liver, kidney and heart as part of the adaptive response to bacterial sepsis. The overarching
objectives of our proposed studies aim to differentiate between pathologic and protective metabolic pathways in
bacterial sepsis, interrogate the beneficial aspects of fasting metabolism that support survival, and elucidate the
mechanisms of action."

Intravascular administration of adenovirus (Ad) vectors holds great promise for improving survival of patients
with disseminated metastatic cancer and ameliorating numerous genetic diseases through permanent correction
of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. Although potentially advantageous, intravascular delivery makes
therapeutic Ads vulnerable to humoral components of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.
Extensive previous analyses by us and others showed that binding of coagulation FX to HAdv-5-based vectors
in the blood facilitates highly efficient hepatocyte transduction, triggering hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, a relatively
high prevalence of HAdv-5-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in the human population, prompted active
development of therapeutic vectors based on alternate Ad serotypes that don't interact with FX and exhibit low
NAb prevalence. Our preliminary studies indicate however, that both pre-existing neutralizing and non-
neutralizing humoral immunity can significantly exacerbate the host inflammatory antiviral response. We found
that the majority of human sera that lack HAdv-5-neutralizing activity are still able to trigger complement fixation
on the virus, leading to potentiated inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells. Moreover, we found that
immunization of mice with adenovirus HAdv-11 triggers generation of non-neutralizing antibodies, which are
highly efficient at complement fixation on phylogenetically-distant HAdv-5 virus. Based on these findings, we
propose a novel concept of cryptic opsonizing non-neutralizing antibodies, or CON-Abs, which bind to Ad after
systemic delivery, trigger complement fixation on the virus, and target Ad-immune complexes (Ad-ICs) to
immune phagocytic cells, leading to drastically potentiated systemic inflammation. The molecular mechanisms
mediating the immune-stimulatory properties of pre-existing non-neutralizing immunity and its effect on the safety
of systemic Ad delivery are virtually unknown. Therefore, in Specific Aim 1 of this project we will analyze how
phylogenetically-distant HAdv serotypes trigger generation of CON-Abs to HAdv-5. In Specific Aim 2, we will
determine the structural bases for CON-Ab-mediated complement fixation on the virus and complement-
mediated virus neutralization. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine specific cell types and their receptors that
sequester Ad-ICs in vivo; and in Specific Aim 4 we will determine specific signaling pathways responsible for the
exacerbated inflammatory response to Ad-ICs and develop targeted pharmacological approaches to improve
the safety of systemic Ad delivery in gene transfer and cancer therapy models. The proposed studies will provide
new mechanistic insights into fundamental functions of innate and adaptive immunity and host anti-viral defense,
as well as allow for the development of novel patient stratification tools and pharmacological approaches to
improve the safety of clinical interventions that rely on systemic delivery of therapeutic Ads."

 Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is a deadly disease among young people in
Central America, especially agricultural workers. Risk factors and presentation of this disease are distinct from
that of traditional CKD; metal exposure is a hypothesized CKDu risk factor and is of concern in regions of
Nicaragua due to volcanic bedrock and industrial practices. Among youth, metal exposure is known to interfere
with developmental processes affecting organ and system function, contributing to deficits across the life
course. Likewise, metals have been shown to affect the microbiome, which plays a role in kidney function and
disease. Our work displays evidence of kidney injury in non-working young people in Nicaraguan regions with
high adult prevalence of CKDu, and we hypothesize that disease processes initiate in youth before
occupational exposures. Our longitudinal cohort “Jovenes-Nica Study” has enrolled over 400 youth across
Nicaragua for three rounds of follow-up from 2022-2024. At each round, biological samples and a health
survey are collected to assess exposures, kidney function, and overall health status of participants. In this
proposal, we will apply sophisticated analytical methods to evaluate the associations between biomarkers of
metal exposure and renal endpoints in youth at high risk of CKDu, while considering the urinary microbiome as
a key intermediary on the exposure-disease pathway. Though understudied in comparison to other human
microbiomes, the urinary microbiome has been associated with kidney health.
 Ms. Samantha Hall (PI) proposes the following research activities under the dedicated mentorship of
experts in environmental epidemiology, biostatistics, mixtures modeling, and microbiome analysis. We will use
a portable x-ray fluorescent analyzer to quantify toenail metal concentrations. Flexible mixtures models like
quantile-based g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression will be used to explore associations
between metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury) and kidney function, modeled as estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) (Aim 1). Machine learning techniques, such as principal components analysis and
microbial co-occurrence network models, will detail the composition and diversity indices of urinary microbiome
samples in relation to metal exposure (Aim 2) and eGFR (Aim 3). The proposed training plan will expand Ms.
Hall’s existing skillset through the implementation of novel methods to understand highly dimensional exposure
and microbiome data. This work will address an important research gap by providing the first data to date on
any association between an environmental exposure and the urinary microbiome, as well as the first analysis
concerning the microbiome and renal health among youth in Central America. Our results will shed light on
unexplored pathways of disease for those at high risk of CKDu with applications for early disease intervention."

The respiratory microbiome was reported for the first time in 2010. Since then, various studies have shown that
the microorganisms in the respiratory tract influence respiratory health, as changes in the respiratory microbiome
have been associated with airway inflammation and various respiratory diseases, like asthma and allergic rhinitis.
While studies have reported dysbiosis of the microbiome with exposure to general pollutants like particulate
matter, the impact of climate change-dependent pollutants like wood smoke is currently unknown yet is likely to
have significant health implications. As wood smoke exposure events are growing worldwide due to wildfires, it
is critical that we learn more about the respiratory response to this exposure. Therefore, the overall objective of
this proposal is to characterize the structural and functional changes of the respiratory microbiota and its
metabolome after wood smoke exposure and identify the mechanism(s) by which the respiratory microbiota and
its metabolome modulate the host response to this exposure. The central hypothesis of this project is that the
respiratory microbiome is a significant component of the host response to wood smoke via metabolite-driven
host-microbiome interactions. Therefore, my specific aims will first (Aim 1) characterize the in vivo effects of
wood smoke on the respiratory microbiota and metabolome individually, followed by an innovative multi-omics
approach that integrates respiratory microbiome and metabolomics data to determine interactions. My second
aim (Aim 2) focuses on identifying the microbe-derived metabolites and metabolite-driven mechanisms that
modulate the host response to wood smoke. Here, I will study the in vitro effect of this exposure on the individual
components of host-microbiota interactions and their metabolite-driven crosstalk. The results of this proposal will
be significant as they will demonstrate for the first time that the respiratory microbiota has an active role in the
host response to wood smoke via metabolites, highlighting the importance of considering the respiratory
microbiome in inhalational toxicology. Furthermore, these results will identify microorganisms and
microorganism-derived metabolites with potential therapeutic and prophylactic properties against wood smoke-
induced respiratory adverse health effects. Notably, this project will provide multiple training opportunities in
microbiome analysis, metabolomics, and advanced computational analyses, such as multi-omics data
integration and machine learning, significantly advancing my goal to become an independent scientist."

A canonical feature of migraine is visual discomfort (i.e., “photophobia”), with particular sensitivity to ﬂicker
(time-varying modulations of light). We lack a mechanistic understanding of this symptom generally, and
speciﬁcally require a framework that unites the phenomenon of discomfort with the properties of the visual
environment, perception, and neural response. Such a synthesis may be offered by recent work in information-
optimal representation. Computationally “efﬁcient” representations represent the statistical structure of the
environment and maximize sensory information storage. Recent research in experimental psychology has
shown that these “efﬁcient coding” models account for aspects of human sensory judgments and the properties
of neural activity. Importantly, these models explain how changes in the statistics of the visual environment to
lead to changes in perception. Our project is motivated by the idea that photophobia is an experience of
“inefﬁcient” information processing. Over three Aims we will apply the efﬁcient coding framework to understand
the properties of ﬂicker exposure, perception, and neural representation in typical observers and in people with
migraine and photophobia. Using personal light-logging devices, we will test the idea that people with migraine
and photophobia experience a systematically different visual world. Using psychophysical and discomfort
measures we will test for the effects of stimulus properties upon ﬂicker perception, and for differences between
people with migraine and headache free controls. Finally, we will examine the neural representation of visual
ﬂicker using functional MRI to test for the signature of efﬁcient coding in distributed neural responses."

One of the most pressing research goals in neurobiology is to understand how brain circuits develop, and how
these circuits control the behavior of an animal. This problem is of general importance if one wants to
understand, and (therapeutically) manipulate, brain circuitry in a medical setting. A prerequisite to attain this
goal is (1) the detailed mapping of complete neuron assemblies that embody specific circuits, and (2) the
availability of precision tools for functional studies. Both of these conditions are now met for Drosophila.
Complete connectomes (digital maps that contain all brain neurons and their synaptic connections) exist for
both the larval stage (funded in part by this grant in previous years) and the adult. And in addition, genetic tools
have been developed that allow one to manipulate (that is, silence, or activate) virtually every neuron, or at
least neuron class, and test for the effect on specific behaviors that one is interested in. The strategy then is to
extract from the connectome a wiring diagram of a specific circuit, develop hypotheses of how the different
elements in the circuit interact, and use genetic tools to test these hypotheses.
 Studies of this proposal focus on a Drosophila brain circuit involved in navigation. Animals navigate in
response to sensory stimuli in order to find food and mating partners, or avoid danger. Brain centers controlling
navigation require processed, multimodal sensory input (smells, visual cues) which are integrated with
proprioceptive input (feed back from muscles, joints etc) to calculate the commands required to steer the
animal in the right direction. Our analysis of the larval connectome highlights a brain center called the lateral
accessory lobe (LAL) as a focus of interest. We have identified the relevant LAL neuron classes and their
connections, and are in the process to systematically screen for genetic constructs with which we can target
these neuron classes to do functional studies. Larvae have a simple, highly quantifiable navigation behavior
that allows them to find a food source (by odor) or avoid light. We will analyze how the LAL controls motor
circuits that carry out this behavior.
 The second and third objective of the proposal is to study how the larval LAL neurons become
modified and incorporated in the LAL of the adult. Adult flies have a new set of organs (e.g., wings, legs) with
which to move, and receptors with which to sense; but according to our initial data, the larval neurons remain
and have to adapt to cope with their new input and output. Using the connectome of the adult brain and our
genetic tools we intend to identify the descendants of larval neurons in the LAL, and to address their function in
adult navigation."

10906120,"Bilinguals have remarkable control abilities to prevent interference between languages in production and
comprehension, two modalities that have different goals and go through different pathways. However, it still
remains unclear if and to what extent language control mechanisms are shared or different across these two
modalities. The proposed project will systematically compare language control mechanism in production
versus comprehension at different processing levels. We will combine ERP (Event-Related Potential in the
brain) measures and the mixed-language paragraph reading paradigm to reveal the neuro-cognitive processes
of language switching in sentence context, modulating syntactic and phonological constraints. Bilinguals will
read the same mixed-language paragraphs in production and comprehension tasks, with the only difference
being if articulation is required. ERP measures will provide detailed information about how language control
works as the language-switching event unfolds in real time. My Specific Aims are: Aim 1 (K99): to investigate
the role of syntactic constraints in language control during production vs. comprehension by measuring
bilinguals' ERPs on language switching with content vs. function words, which carry more semantic vs.
syntactic information, respectively. In production, I expect larger costs switching function words, as these need
more inhibition and monitoring, revealed by N2 and ERN respectively. If syntactic constraints equally affect
production and comprehension, function switches should be more costly than content switches also in
comprehension, revealed by P600/LPC, or even N400 as well. Alternatively, content switches might be more
costly in comprehension, revealed by P600/LPC and N400, due to vague syntactic analysis and the priority to
integrate semantic information. Aim 2 (R00): to investigate how phonological constraints influence language
control during production vs. comprehension by measuring bilinguals' ERPs on intra-sentential language
switches with cognates vs. noncognates. Cognates are words with cross-language phonological overlap (e.g.,
lemon-limón). I expect larger costs with cognate than noncognate switches in production, as more inhibition
and monitoring are needed for cognates, revealed by N2 and ERN respectively. For comprehension, if
language selection is also critical, switch costs with cognates may be larger than noncognates, revealed by
N400 and/or P600/LPC. Otherwise, switch costs may be smaller with cognates than noncognates due to easier
semantic integration with cognates, revealed at least by N400, or even by P600/LPC as well. My training in the
K99 phase will include structured mentorship by my advisory committee on both theoretical framework
(language production and comprehension, as well as bilingual language control) and the training of new
methodology (ERP measures). It will also include formal course work, workshops, and a program of career
transition. This career plan and research project will ensure my successful transition to independent research,
fulfilling my career goal of understanding bilingual language processing in a comprehensive view.

10906259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiomyopathy patients are prone to ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden death. Current therapies to
prevent VA include radiofrequency ablation to destroy slowly conducting pathways of viable myocardium which
support re-entry. Here we propose to test the reverse concept, namely that boosting local tissue viability in zones
of slow conduction might eliminate slow conduction and suppress VA. We seek to do so by local injection, into
mapped areas of slow conduction, of exosomes secreted by cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), a
stromal/progenitor cell type from the human heart. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles laden with bioactive
cargo. Those secreted by CDCs (CDCEXO) reduce scar and improve heart function after intramyocardial delivery.
In a VA-prone porcine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy, we present preliminary data in which we injected
CDCEXO or vehicle into zones of delayed conduction defined by electroanatomic mapping. Up to one month post-
injection, CDCEXO, but not vehicle, decreased myocardial scar, suppressed slowly conducting electrical
pathways, and inhibited VA induction by programmed stimulation. In silico reconstruction of electrical activity
based on magnetic resonance images accurately reproduced the suppression of VA inducibility by CDCEXO. Here
we will explore alternative intracoronary delivery methods which would be more readily translatable clinically
than the intramyocardial injection approach, which requires non-approved catheters. We will also explore
mechanism of the anti-VA effects histologically and by RNA sequencing, as well as in a co-culture assay of
cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. We will also compare directly the efficacy of exosomes versus conventional RF
ablation. In conclusion, we seek to establish biological substrate modification by exosome injection as a
nondestructive alternative to conventional ablation for the prevention of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias."
10883691,"Microbial infection often begins with colonization. Success for an organism requires persistence
during colonization for a sufficient period to allow for host-to-host transmission. For the leading
bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), colonization occurs along the mucosal
surfaces of the upper respiratory tract. Extensive experience with vaccination has shown that
interruption of colonization is the key to reducing the burden of all Spn disease. Our ongoing
project examines the biology of Spn colonization, which occurs in recurrent episodes that are
prolonged (lasting weeks to months), variable in duration by serotype, and more common during
early life. We have established models of infection in adult and infant mice that recapitulate each
of these characteristics of Spn colonization in the natural host. Our preliminary data using these
models establish the importance of two bacterial factors, the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (Ply)
and capsule, the determinant of serotype. Additionally, we have shown critical roles for three host
factors, the alarmin IL-1α, the cytokine IL-17, and the macrophage scavenger receptor MARCO.
This proposal examines the relationship between these factors. In Aim#1, we test the hypothesis
that IL-1α is released in a Ply-dependent manner following Spn uptake by neutrophils and triggers
the differentiation/proliferation of CD4+ T cells to express IL-17. A further aspect of this aim is that
attenuated neutrophil responses during infancy delay the IL-17 response resulting in more
persistent colonization. Elevated IL-17 levels are required to drive an increase in numbers of
macrophages derived from the pool of inflammatory monocytes. In Aim#2, we test the contribution
of the subset of macrophages expressing MARCO as the effectors of clearance and whether
MARCO interactions with the Spn capsule dictate clearance dynamics. In this aim, we generate
a MARCO humanized mouse to determine if this interaction is responsible for differences in host-
specific patterns of colonization among serotypes. In Aim#3, we explore how inflammation
induced by Spn colonization promotes exit of the organism from its host (shedding) at levels
permissive for transmission in our animal model. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that Ply-
dependent stimulation of Type I interferons increase the flow of nasal secretions and Spn
shedding. We also test the hypothesis that Spn takes advantage of the recruitment of neutrophils
and their ability to bind to the organism to `hitch a ride' out of the host with purulent secretions.
The overall goal of this project is an understanding of these determinants of colonization with a
long-term view towards a more comprehensive approach to address the continuing public health
problem of the pneumococcus."

doctoral physician scientists for productive careers in clinical, translational, or basic research in prevention or
treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes and other metabolic consequences of obesity and excess visceral and ectopic
(e.g. hepatic) fat deposition in children. The training program has evolved in three important and positive ways
during the current funding period. First, the updated name (from CDCMRT: Childhood Diabetes Clinical and
Molecular Research Training Program) highlights the expanded focus on research in adipose organ development
and site-specific adipose deposition as a key risk factor for adverse metabolic effects of calorie excess during
childhood. Second, building on the success of the previous 10 years, the program has both refined its trainee
focus to be the research training of MD physician-scientists while expanding applicant scope to include trainees
from multiple specialties. Third, C-DART is applying learning theory Team Science Learning Points to formally,
critically evaluate and modify each training program component. Insulin resistance, strongly associated with
ectopic fat deposition and overt diabetes, is a major health problem in children. C-DART trainees can begin a
research career ranging from molecular/cellular study of pancreatic islet biology and insulin resistance to whole
body pathophysiology of childhood adiposity to prevention/treatment of childhood obesity in ethnically diverse
youth. Training objectives include 1) establishing quality and productive research projects, 2) developing a
successful record of peer-reviewed publications, 3) submitting proposals for extramural funding during T32
tenure such as NIH K series (or similar) to continue training after C-DART, and 4) transitioning to successful
research-focused academic careers for at least 80% of graduates. To achieve these objectives, a research
Capstone Certificate curriculum developed in collaboration with the NIH-funded University of Wisconsin Institute
for Clinical and Translational Research (UW-ICTR) provides training in research techniques, statistics and study
design, responsible conduct of research, and scientific writing and presentation skills. C-DART research training
opportunities include clinical, translational, and basic science activities that expose trainees to a multi-disciplinary
study of diabetes and diseases associated with childhood adiposity. The rising burden of diabetes and other
obesity-related metabolic disorders, the strong 10-year record of accomplishment of our T32-supported trainees,
and recognition of a scarcity of basic and clinical science researchers with childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes
training prompt us to seek continued funding for the C-DART program. During the proposed funding period, C-
DART will continue utilizing existing resources and new strategies to recruit underrepresented minority trainee
candidates. The program will continue to build collaborations with new potential mentors engaged in innovative
and cutting-edge science related to development and consequences of childhood adiposity to provide state-of-
the-art mentored training for productive research careers in childhood diabetes, insulin resistance and obesity."
10883695,"The innate immune system provides protection against bacterial pathogens by initiating a highly conserved cell death response that promotes pathogen clearance following the detection of pathogen-mediated perturbations. The executioner caspases-3 and -7 (Casp3/7) are activated by the initiator caspase-8 (Casp8) to induce apoptosis, an immunologically silent form of cell death. Conversely, pyroptosis, mediated by caspase-1 (Casp1), is highly inflammatory, and is associated with inflammasome activation, lytic plasma membrane pore formation by Gasdermin D (GSDMD), and secretion of IL-1 family cytokines. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yp) is one of the three human pathogens in the Yersinia genus along with Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. Yp utilizes a conserved type Ill secretion system to inject virulence factors, known as Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into the host cell cytosol, to facilitate infection. While Yops are important for bacterial virulence, they also enable the host to detect the presence of the bacteria and generate an immune response. In particular, YopJ blocks inflammatory gene expression, triggering a pathway of host cell death mediated by Casp8 and involving activation of Casp1 that is independent of all known Casp1 activation regulators. Surprisingly, bulk assays show that Casp8 activation in response to Yp infection induces activation of both apoptotic Casp3/7 and pyroptotic Casp1, posing the question of how an individual cell might be simultaneously undergo two distinct forms of cell death. Surprisingly, my new preliminary microscopy analysis reveals that individual cells display morphological features of either apoptosis or pyroptosis, suggesting that individual cells undergo distinct cell fate choices masked by bulk population-based analyses. Intriguingly, Casp3 negatively regulates GSDMD, providing a built-in negative regulatory mechanism to limit pyroptosis. Intriguingly, individual Yp-infected cells vary in their levels of YopJ injection and Casp3 cleavage, suggesting that variability in YopJ injection enables cells to integrate levels of Casp3 and -1 activation, thereby regulating the choice between apoptosis and pyroptosis. These data and my preliminary findings provoke the hypothesis that Casp8 mediates a novel form of Casp1 activation, and the relative balance of Casp8-dependent Casp3/Casp1 activation in individual cells determines apoptotic and pyroptotic fates in response to immune signaling blockade. In this fellowship, I aim to use powerful single-cell-based approaches to dissect the regulation of single-cell fates during infection with Yp. In Aim 1, I will define the mechanism of Caspase-1 activation during Yersinia infection, which we previously demonstrated occurs through a pathway independent of known inflammasome components. In Aim 2, using innovative single cell-based caspase reporters, I will dissect the role of YopJ and test whether levels of YopJ injection determine the cell death pathway choice in individual cells. Understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of cell death during Yp infection will provide novel insights into anti-bacterial host defense and facilitate the development of host-directed approaches to combat infections."
10883599,"The constant search for new chemical entities to address unmet medical needs compels the continued invention
of new molecular editing approaches to derivatize complex small molecules. Single atom changes in a molecule
alter the electronic properties of the molecule without extensive accompanying structural changes and are known
to dramatically alter its biological activity. However, methods that enable substitutions of atoms embedded in the
carbon framework of a molecule remain sparse. Substitution of a single atom – “atom swapping” – in the core
structure of a molecule, rather than on the periphery, is challenging to execute because it involves multiple bond-
breaking and bond-forming events. The conventional approach for introducing single atom changes in a molecule
is thus to re-design synthesis routes to access atom-swapped derivatives. We challenge this long-standing
practice by presenting a general strategy for atom swapping that proceeds in two stages – oxidation and
transition metal-catalyzed carbon-extrusion reactions. The proposed research encompasses carbon-to-oxygen
and carbon-to-nitrogen substitutions, and the conversion of lactones to lactams or cycloalkenes. The key step in
all the proposed transformations is a transition metal-catalyzed decarbonylation or decarboxylation reaction. We
will focus our efforts on the discovery and development of catalysts that promote decarbonylation and
decarboxylation reactions on core motifs native to natural products and pharmaceuticals. These proposed
reactions require that the catalyst be able to: 1) activate inert amide or ester bonds yet promote challenging
carbon-heteroatom reductive eliminations; and 2) undergo site-selective oxidative addition. To identify catalysts
that fulfil both criteria, we will examine ligand effects in each step of the catalytic cycle to enable rational ligand
design and optimization. We will then interface the newly developed catalytic systems with well-documented C-
H oxidation and rearrangement reactions to directly modify the carbon framework of cyclic natural products and
pharmaceuticals. Realization of the goals of this proposal will circumvent tedious de novo synthesis for a single
atom change and bring to fruition a highly desired transformation in the pharmaceutical industry."

A heterozygous hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in a single allele of the C9orf72 gene is the most
frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two fatal
and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases without effective treatment. Given that the cellular dysfunction
caused by this mutation is multifactorial, targeting the gene itself by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is a potentially
curative intervention.
This work proposes novel applications of CRISPR gene editing technology to edit or silence the pathogenic
C9orf72 disease gene in FTD/ALS patient derived iPSC. Three editing strategies will be evaluated for ability to
correct the pathologic C9orf72 repeat expansion, including: A) excising exon 1a to silence transcription of the
repeat expansion, B) excising the repeat expansion itself, C) allele-specific inactivation of the mutant allele
(Aim 1a). In addition, the efficiency of gene editing, off target effects, and ability to correct cellular pathology
will be investigated in C9FTD/ALS patient-derived neurons and microglia (Aim 1b). Finally, new single-
molecule sequencing technology to accurately measure the repeat expansion size will be employed to size the
repeat expansion in various patient iPSC lines and human tissue (Aim 2). This work combines novel
CRISPR/Cas9 editing technologies, cellular disease modeling, molecular and genomic analysis, and
bioinformatics to address these aims.
My goal in seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is to acquire the
necessary knowledge and scientific training to launch my career as an independent R01 funded academic
investigator. My long-term goal is to make major advances in the therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative
diseases, including dementias. My doctoral and clinical training provide me with the impetus to address
clinically relevant and high impact hypothesis driven research questions. The exceptional research
environment at the UCSF affiliated Gladstone Institutes combines leaders across many fields with cutting-edge
technology and equipment. I have assembled a team of highly accomplished mentors and advisors to guide
me on my path to becoming an independent investigator. My training plan is designed to advance my technical
skill set in areas that are new to me (CRISPR gene editing, genomic analysis, bioinformatics, and advanced
cellular disease modeling) as well as provide experience in areas critical to successfully running a lab
(scientific communication and lab management). Completing the research and obtaining the skill set I propose
here will prepare me well to obtain an R01 or equivalent funding to launch my career as an independent

Rising life expectancy is contributing to rapid increases in the size of the older population and is
expected to lead to a sharp rise in Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related
dementias from about 47 million people worldwide today, to potentially more than 140 million in
2050. However, recent population studies have found that the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease
and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias is lower than that indicated by previous projections
in some countries, but greater in others. Lifestyle factors as well as environmental factors
might reduce or increase an individual’s risk of developing dementia. We propose to advance
our understanding of protective and risk factors for late-life cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (hereafter referred to as dementia) in China.
We propose a novel life-course model of risk factors, building on the recently proposed model by
the Lancet commission, which links dementia risk to early and mid-life factors, within the
context of historical, institutional, and physical environments, including obesity, diabetes
hearing loss, visual impairment, smoking, drinking, depression, physical inactivity, social
isolation, and socioeconomic status.
Specifically, this project aims to further study early and mid-life personal, family, community,

Fundamental aging processes appear to be root-cause contributors to most of the disorders and diseases across
the lifespan that account for the bulk of disability, mortality, and health costs. The goal of the nation-wide
Translational Geroscience Network (TGN) is to accelerate translation of geroscience-guided lifestyle, nutritional,
and drug interventions that target these aging processes from biological discovery and pre-clinical validation to
testing in humans. The TGN is motivated by the hypothesis that clinical interventions targeting fundamental
mechanisms of aging can delay, prevent, alleviate, or treat age-related diseases and disabilities as a group,
instead of one at a time (the Geroscience Hypothesis). During the next grant period, the aims of TGN are:
Aim 1) Accelerate development of a diverse portfolio of interventions targeting fundamental aging processes
(gerotherapeutic interventions) by leveraging TGN expertise and infrastructure in terms of study design, outcome
measures selection, quality control, regulatory compliance, biostatistics, data management, gerodiagnostic
assays, and biobanking for translational early phase gerotherapeutic clinical studies. The current 81 endorsed
or planned studies linked to the TGN now include lifestyle and nutritional interventions, metformin, rapalogs, anti-
inflammatories, MitoQ, senolytics, &/or NAD precursors for several indications as well as observational studies.
Aim 2) Discover, develop, select, optimize, and validate gerodiagnostic measures of aging mechanisms across
studies and optimize reference analytical capabilities of the Facilities for Geroscience
Analysis (FGA). The >150 gerodiagnostics and indicators of organ & immune dysfunction that are or will be
tested in response to interventions include analytes in blood, urine, saliva, synovial fluid, buccal swabs, CSF,
biopsies, & other samples from TGN clinical studies.
Aim 3) Provide statistical and data management support to select efficient designs, facilitate sample size
estimates, and incorporate FDA-compliant network-wide data capture, allowing cross-study comparisons.
Sensitive, specific, and reliable phenotypic signatures responsive to interventions that are based on body fluid
analytes, questionnaires, exam findings, physical & cognitive function, imaging, and biopsies will be refined and
composite scores/ signatures integrating these analytes, clinical scales, and physical function tests developed.
Aim 4) Expand TGN biobanking of samples from across studies to facilitate reverse translation, exploratory
analyses, and new ancillary research as hypotheses develop and assays become available. We will continue to
work with the NIA Biobank to ensure sample storage and distribution, even beyond the terms of this award.
Blood (plasma, serum, PBMCs), urine, buccal swabs (& as available, CSF, saliva, biopsies, aqueous humor,
synovial fluid, hair & nail clippings, microbiome), ECG, imaging, medical record (diagnoses, history, physical
signs, routine labs), and questionnaires from TGN/FGA minimally invasive & interventional studies are archived.
The TGN has enormous potential to impact public health through delaying, preventing, alleviating, and treating
multiple disorders and promoting healthspan, the period of life free of disability."
10899682,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a deeply conserved protein kinase that regulates eukaryotic
metabolism. TOR senses and integrates upstream signals, especially nutrient availability, to coordinate
metabolism and promote growth only when conditions are favorable. TOR dysregulation causes or
contributes to a broad range of human diseases, including cancers, age-related health disorders, and
metabolic disorders, which are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.
Therefore, a major goal for biomedical research is to develop therapeutic treatments that specifically
target components of the TOR signaling network without broadly disrupting metabolism and
homeostasis in healthy cells that rely on TOR. Recently, there have been significant advances to that
goal with the discovery of several putative amino acid sensors for TOR. Conflicting reports about the
relative contributions, importance, and molecular mechanisms of these sensors have stymied these
advances, however. This project uses an innovative approach to bring fresh perspective to these
ongoing debates by shifting focus to the other major eukaryotic lineage, plants.
 In my lab’s ongoing work to elucidate the TOR signaling network in plants, I discovered a novel amino
acid sensor for TOR, an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS). This aaRS is necessary to maintain TOR
activity and sufficient to stimulate TOR in plant cells. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular,
genetic, and systems-level approaches, I propose to precisely define how the aaRS activates TOR in
plant cells through three independent aims. In Aim 1, I propose to mutate key enzymatic residues and
structural features of the aaRS to determine the molecular features it requires to activate TOR. In Aim
2, I propose to map the signal transduction pathway mediating aaRS-TOR activation using robust
orthogonal interactomic approaches. Putative signal transduction components will then be validated
using reciprocal assays and functional genetics to comprehensively define how aaRS-TOR interactors
contribute to TOR regulation. In Aim 3, I propose to establish the selective sensitivity of TOR for specific
amino acids and determine whether the aaRS is a bona fide amino acid sensor for TOR.
 Taken together, these three aims will define the molecular mechanisms underlying the putative amino
acid-aaRS-TOR signaling axis and open new directions for future research on metabolic regulation in
eukaryotes. Moreover, this pathway will serve as a model for understanding how tRNA synthetases
have evolved functions beyond translation in signal transduction pathways and illuminate how the
complex TOR signaling network evolved to integrate diverse physiological cues in humans. Long-term,
our findings will make significant contributions to a major goal of contemporary biomedical research:
fine-tuning TOR signaling networks to improve and lengthen healthy human lifespans."

More than 75% of persons living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias who reach 80 years of age
require residential long-term care, which is increasingly provided in assisted living (AL). Across the country,
almost 29,000 AL communities with more than 996,000 beds have become the primary residential care
provider for persons with dementia: 90% of AL residents have cognitive impairment and 42% have recorded
moderate or severe dementia, with actual rates being higher. AL provides supportive but not nursing services;
consequently, virtually all care is provided by direct care workers (nursing assistants and personal care aides).
Unfortunately, direct care workers are undervalued and undertrained, leading to poor care, workplace injury,
dissatisfaction, and high turnover. AL is state-regulated, and only 17 states stipulate minimum training hours
(some being as low as one hour), meaning that two-thirds of states are silent on training. Fewer than 40% of
staff have education beyond high school, and so it is not surprising that a minority report sufficient knowledge
to care for persons with dementia. In striving to fill this gap, training for direct care workers must be accessible
and have efficacy in benefitting the staff, organization, and persons with dementia.
Online training is an especially promising option due to its low cost, wide availability, and potential for self-
pacing, automated skills tests, and certification. The Alzheimer's Association is the national leader in dementia
care training, and in 2021 developed essentiALZTM (pronounced “essentials”), an online program teaching
evidence-based, person-centered care, which can be accessed from a computer, tablet, or mobile device.
Already more than 1,500 staff have essentiALZ certification, but as is true of the majority of training programs,
evidence as to its ability to improve care and outcomes is lacking. It is possible that essentiALZ is effective in
changing care and outcomes, but it may also be that additional supports are necessary to do so. A timely
model of support is Project ECHO, which has flooded the field of long-term care as a proven way to provide
expert guidance and peer support via a remote, online approach. Adding ECHO to online dementia training
might provide a necessary boost to achieve care change and improved outcomes.
The proposed project responds to the NIA Notice of Special Interest that calls for strengthening the workforce
through enhancing and supporting skills training. It will conduct a hybrid implementation/effectiveness cluster-
randomized trial in 126 AL communities across six states, comparing essentiALZ alone, essentiALZ + ECHO
enhancement, and a waitlist control. Outcomes grounded in the RE-AIM model and the Kirkpatrick training
effectiveness model will be examined over six months, comparing the arms in terms of (1) implementation and
(2) effectiveness, and (3) examining the extent to which implementation and effectiveness differ based on
characteristics of the AL community, staff, residents, and family members. Results will inform next steps in
dementia care training for the AL and broader long-term care workforce."

Cardiac injury and heart failure are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. Enhanced
therapeutic strategies that are informed by new discoveries in the fundamental mechanisms of
biology have the potential to enhance tissue repair and improve health. Diverse risk factors
including age, sex, diet, and hypertension can affect disease outcome. Within this framework,
common underlying factors of disease progression are inflammation and cells of the innate
immune system. This includes myeloid phagocytes, which have the capacity to be either
cardioprotective or cardiopathogenic. After myocardial injury, the extent of inflammation and the
activation state of myeloid macrophages have been linked to the degree of myocardial stress,
cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac performance. One explanation for this is the ability of macrophage
subsets to secrete potent cytokines which regulate the activity of nearby cells, such as
parechymal, stromal, and neighboring immune cells of the heart. Our studies will identify novel
roles for macrophage subsets and intercellular crosstalk by signaling through vascular
endothelial growth factors, as well as integrated contributions of mitochondrial

Although males and females both suffer from cocaine use disorder (CUD), females represent a particularly
vulnerable population and the neural mechanisms underlying this sex difference remain poorly understood. CUD
is characterized by cocaine-induced alterations in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Sex
differences in dopamine release and its regulation in the NAc has also been linked to sex-specific behaviors in
CUD. The goal of this proposal is to define sex differences in dopamine release regulation in the NAc and
determine how this process is dysregulated following cocaine self-administration. GABA-A and GABA-B
receptors in the NAc have been linked to the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Further, GABA is a key regulator
of dopamine release through direct actions of GABA receptors on dopamine terminals in the NAc. However,
long-term plasticity in GABAergic regulation of terminal dopamine release is unknown, and sex-differences in
this process have been virtually unstudied. The goal of this proposal is to define sex differences in GABAergic
regulation of dopamine release, determine if cocaine self-administration alters this regulation in a sex-specific
fashion, and examine the causal role of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors in cocaine-induced plasticity in the NAc.
In Aim 1, I will use ex vivo optical recordings in the NAc with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor (dLight1.2)
to record evoked dopamine release in males and females. Using pharmacology, I will investigate GABA-A and
B receptor regulation of dopamine release and determine if sex differences exist. Based on my preliminary data,
I hypothesize that GABA-A-mediated inhibition of evoked dopamine release will be sex-dependent, with greater
effects in males. In Aim 2, I will investigate cocaine-induced plasticity in this regulation following cocaine self-
administration in mice. In Aim 3, I will knock out GABA-A and GABA-B receptors in dopaminergic neurons and
determine if these receptors are necessary for cocaine-induced plasticity in dopamine release in the NAc. Taken
together, the experiments in this proposal will be the first to define sex-differences in GABAergic regulation of
dopamine release in the NAc, determine how these processes are altered by cocaine self-administration, and
investigate the roles of GABA receptors in cocaine-induced plasticity in NAc dopamine release. This proposal
encompasses technical and theoretical training that will provide the foundational expertise and conceptual
thinking needed to address larger questions regarding how drug-induced and sex-specific changes in the brain
support the development and sustainment of CUD. Additionally, these findings can ultimately inform our
understanding of sex-specific mechanisms underlying reward and learning process and lead to more efficacious
treatment interventions for males and females."

Food animals, including retail pork, chicken, ground turkey and ground beef have been
implicated as sources of Salmonella and Campylobacter and are the leading causes of bacterial
foodborne illness. Both wild-caught and farm-raised salmon, shrimp, and tilapia have been
implicated as sources of Vibrio and Aeromonas and are leading causes of sea-foodborne
illness. Indicator pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp., are also
frequently isolated from these meat products. The situation is further complicated when the
strains are also resistant to different antimicrobials. It is therefore important that we monitor the
prevalence and trends of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) foodborne bacterial strains in the retail
meat and seafood products that can eventually pass to the consumers along the farm-to-fork
chain resulting in significant public health impact. The National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System (NARMS) plays an important role in surveillance of AMR bacterial pathogens
in humans, food animals and retail meats. North Carolina is an important food producing state
situated along the eastern US seashore and ranks among the top states in pork and poultry
production. As an existing NARMS laboratory, our major objective is to continue to enhance the
surveillance of AMR pathogenic and indicator bacterial strains in retail meats and seafood in
North Carolina and generate critical data to contribute to the NARMS mission. We propose to
conduct this study in collaboration with the FDA GenomeTrakr program. The PI (Dr. Thakur)
laboratory is a GenomeTrakr laboratory, which will provide the opportunity to generate the
whole genome sequences (WGS) of the bacterial strains thereby significantly assisting us in
tracking the emergence of potential new AMR bacteria and allowing the public health agencies
to take appropriate steps.
The specific objectives of our proposal are:
1) Monitor antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends in Salmonella, Campylobacter,
Escherichia coli, Vibrio, Aeromonas, lactose fermenters, and Enterococcus spp. from retail meat
and seafood samples collected in North Carolina region.
2) Generate and compare the WGS profiles of Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli,
isolated from retail meat in North Carolina to detect the emergence of new AMR strains.
The long-term objective of our proposal is to protect and promote public health by enhancing
and strengthening the surveillance of AMR Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Vibrio,
Aeromonas, lactose fermenters, and Enterococcus spp. in retail food specimens in the US."

The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) is a long-term participant and leader in the
National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System Retail Food Surveillance (RFS)
program. TDH feels that the expansion of the retail food arm of NARMS is critical step in
conducting surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AR) in the food chain and for
monitoring the impact of recent national initiatives including important regulatory
changes in the use of antimicrobials in food animals. Use of antimicrobials in food
animal production creates selective pressure that enables antimicrobial resistant
bacteria to matriculate into the food supply and ultimately cause human infections. Of
concern, antibiotic resistant infections are accompanied by more severe illnesses, more
deaths, higher healthcare costs, and increased harm to society. We feel that
surveillance is critical “data-for-action” to not only understand the sources of AR and
multi-drug resistance (MDR) in the food supply chain but to combat this public health
problem. Tennessee embraces the goal of the NARMS food surveillance program to
improve the detection of and surveillance for AR among enteric bacteria in raw retail
food commodities through this cooperative funding agreement (FOA # PAR-20-124,
CFDA # 93.876). Tennessee will participate fully in all project components including
purchase of approved meats and seafood, testing by NARMS protocols, shipment of
isolates and meta data, and continued activity in the NARMS working groups.
Additionally, Tennessee anticipates participating in any future pilot activity or expansion
to other commodities. Tennessee capacity for testing food has translated to increased
ability to assess isolates and their link to human clusters, as well as more proficiency in
testing food during outbreaks and quickly characterizing the AR properties to inform the
public heath investigation. Tennessee will participate fully in all NARMS RFS activities
and follow the accepted protocols during the 5 year period. Our strategy include: 1.
Maintain sampling and reporting with a continuous quality improvement paradigm in
RFS. 2. Foster partnership among Tennessee, federal, state, local, and external
partners. 3. Enhance outbreak investigation response and reporting. 4. Sustain and
enhance NARMS laboratory diagnostic capacity. 6.Improve laboratory coordination,
outreach, and information flow. 7. Maintain and exchange integrated surveillance
information system. Tennessee’s expectations and outcomes, strategies and activities,
and collaborative activities will continue throughout the 5 year period with continued
funding. We hope our response to this FOA will be favorably considered."

Macrophages are ubiquitous innate immune cells that display tissue-specific function and phenotype.
Microenvironmental factors derived from a tissue niche can regulate the development of tissue specific
macrophages (TSM). The molecular basis of the specialization of TSM remains poorly understood. Perivascular
macrophages (pvMAC) are TSMs that can regulate vascular permeability and immune responses to blood-borne
pathogens. Whether and how factors unique to the vascular or perivascular microenvironment regulate pvMACs
is currently unknown. This proposal will address these key knowledge gaps. Preliminary work in our laboratory
showed that pvMACs in murine fibrosarcoma tumors promote angiogenesis and immunosuppression. We
discovered that pvMACs have high intracellular iron and express the GPCR endothelin receptor-B (EdnrB).
Macrophage-specific deletion of EdnrB led to reduced vascular density in tumors. I also found that heme induces
EdnrB expression in macrophages by inhibiting the transcription factor Bach1. Outside of tumors, I have found
that pvMACs express EdnrB in lung and adipose tissue. However, we do not know whether EdnrB expression is
a common feature of all pvMACs and whether heme regulates EdnrB expression in these cells. The expression
of EdnrB in pvMACs close to the source of the endothelin ligand (endothelial cells) and heme (circulating
erythrocytes) leads us to hypothesize that increased heme availability in the perivascular niche drives
EdnrB expression in pvMACs through degradation of Bach1 and EdnrB signaling in pvMACs regulates
vascular function. In Aim 1, I will assess the iron content and transcriptional profile of pvMACs in adipose tissue
through single cell RNA sequencing. In Aim 2, I will identify the function of EdnrB signaling in adipose tissue
pvMACs using macrophage-specific EdnrB KO mouse and reductionist ex vivo approaches. In Aim 3, I will
determine the role of Bach1 in pvMAC development and function using a Bach1 KO mouse and a model of
intravascular hemolysis. Better understanding of the biology of pvMACs is essential given the central importance
of the vascular system. This work has far-reaching implications for many pathological conditions, such as
hemolysis and ischemia. Endothelin signaling can be targeted by existing small molecule inhibitors. Hence, this
work also has the potential to be translated into appropriate clinical contexts."
10900267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in late childhood and adolescence is alarmingly high,
yet scientific understanding of STBs in youth is surprisingly limited. The NIMH has recently highlighted an urgent
need for research examining mechanisms of complex health risk behaviors, including suicide, and a prioritization
of child health research using existing datasets. The proposed study addresses these and additional scientific
priorities by capitalizing on the unprecedented methodological advantages of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study to examine patterns of neurobiological, behavioral, and psychological processes,
measured across multiple units of analysis, that define distinct subtypes of youth experiencing STBs in late
childhood, as well as longitudinal associations between subtypes and STBs over adolescent development.
This proposal addresses several critical limitations of prior research on suicide. First, despite epidemiological
data that STBs frequently onset and escalate in late childhood and adolescence, suicide research has focused
primarily on adults. Second, studies of suicide are largely cross-sectional and consider a narrow set of self-report
variables. Third, most research takes a variable-centered approach and assumes a single set of risk-relevant
processes apply similarly to all individuals, despite theoretical and emerging empirical evidence supporting the
existence of multiple ‘subtypes’ of suicidal individuals defined by distinct profiles of risk-relevant vulnerabilities.
The current study addresses these limitations in multiple ways. First, the proposed work adopts a primarily
person-centered approach to examine patterns across neurobiological, behavioral, and psychological domains
that distinguish distinct subtypes of youth who experience STBs by late childhood (ages 9-10)—the age at which
suicide becomes a leading cause of death. Second, this work will test prospective associations of suicide
subtypes with trajectories of STBs into adolescence, including potentially differential risk for persistence of
suicidal ideation and/or onset of suicidal behavior. The proposal also offers opportunity to examine similar
questions in a Supplemental Aim among initially nonsuicidal children, to examine risk for new onset of STBs in
the adolescent transition. Finally, the proposal is not reliant solely on self-report and uses multimodal measures
across units of analysis, including some that are relatively novel for suicide research (e.g., neuroimaging).
In line with NIMH strategic objectives, the study will pursue these aims in the ABCD Study dataset. This dataset
offers novel opportunity to address the aforementioned limitations of suicide research with longitudinal data on
a large, heterogeneous, national representative youth sample from late childhood into adolescence. The
research has potential to reduce heterogeneity of suicide by revealing distinct suicide subtypes earlier in
development than has previously been examined. Findings can inform developmentally-salient risk models of
youth suicide, and facilitate more precise interventions and treatments based on unique subtype profiles."

This application proposes a tailored research training plan that is designed to promote my development into an
independent clinician-scientist. The plan includes a rigorous laboratory training experience in multiple
techniques as well as a customized professional and career development plan. Furthermore, the training plan
is supported by outstanding institutional resources, including a strong and interwoven research community and
a supportive mentorship team. My research area of interest is translationally-relevant biomimetic approaches
to tissue repair. In the field of tissue engineering, there is a need for therapeutic tools that target specific
inflammatory and regenerative pathways. The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is activated in several systemic
diseases, such as type I and type II diabetes. This pathway also contributes to chronic inflammation and
directly impairs repair and regeneration of various tissues within the body including bone and craniofacial
tissues. Diabetes-related chronic inflammation and poor craniofacial bone repair are significant oral healthcare
problems. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs) and their miRNA cargo have high
therapeutic potential for immunomodulation in dental diseases and craniofacial tissue regeneration. Several
miRNAs within MSC EV cargo have been identified to regulate and suppress the NLRP3 pathway. However,
there is a gap in knowledge regarding the lack of mechanistic approaches to direct pathway-specific
manipulation of inflammation using EVs and to achieve controlled release of EVs to employ their therapeutic
effects. The proposed research will address this gap in knowledge through developing a controlled release
system for engineered anti-inflammatory EVs at wound sites. This release system will use an alginate-based
hydrogel platform to deliver engineered EVs. The alginate-based hydrogel can be functionally modified by
incorporating cell/EV binding motifs to the alginate backbone. The results of this proposal will work towards the
long-term goal of maximizing the therapeutic potential of EVs and enhancing tissue repair. Aim 1 will utilize
miRNA-based EV engineering to generate engineered MSC EVs to target the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway
using miRNA-22-3p as the candidate. Aim 2 entails developing a photocrosslinkable hydrogel for the controlled
release of engineered EVs using tissue resident metalloproteases abundant at wound sites as a trigger for EV
release. Aim 3 is focused on assessing the efficacy of the engineered EVs and the delivery system in vivo
using a diabetic mouse calvarial defect model. Overall, successful completion of these aims will provide me
with a comprehensive training in EV biology and related techniques, stem cell biology, molecular biology,
immunology, biomaterial design, imaging, animal handling and related histology and immunohistochemical
techniques. Results from this work will directly address oral healthcare issues such as diabetes-related chronic
inflammation and poor craniofacial bone repair."

A critical limitation in development of disease-modifying interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) and other
neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of reliable, objective measures of disease progression. Walking and
turning dysfunction appear early in Parkinson's disease and use of inertial sensors to measure walking and
turning may provide sensitive, objective markers of disease progression as well as of decline in quality of life.
New wearable technology can provide reliable, objective measures of walking and turning that are feasible for
clinical trials. However, quantifying walking and turning during unsupervised, daily life has the untapped
potential to provide objective measures that are even more sensitive to disease progression, to quality of life
and fall risk than current subjective clinical measures of mobility. We predict that turning quality may be even
more sensitive to progression of disease in early PD, than straight walking because of the added dynamic
balance challenges. Aim I will determine the most sensitive measures of mobility (daily life) in 100 people with
early, untreated PD and 50 older control subjects. We hypothesize that unsupervised daily life mobility
measures will be sensitive and specific for early PD. Aim II will determine the measures of mobility in daily life
most sensitive to disease progression. We hypothesize that turning characteristics during daily life (particularly
variability of performance) will be the most sensitive mobility measures to change over 3 years in recently
diagnosed people with PD. Aim III will predict future falls based on daily life objective measures of walking and
turning. We hypothesize that objective measures of daily life gait and turning quality will significantly improve
prediction of who will fall and time-to-first-fall compared to clinical measures (i.e., fall risk). Identification of the
most sensitive set of measures of mobility disability progression during real life activities with wearable
technology will provide quantifiable and objective outcome measures for testing the effectiveness of new
disease-modifying therapies. Improved prognosis of mobility decline will also improve timing of clinical
interventions."
10877758,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal presents a curriculum and research plan focused on the services of Peer Recovery Specialists
(PRS) to improve patient retention in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in primary care. PRS are individuals
in recovery who use their experience and training to provide emotional support to patients, motivate behavior
change, and help patients overcome the barriers to treatment engagement and retention. Currently, the approved
standard for treating persons with OUD in primary care is medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which combines
medications – most commonly, buprenorphine – with counseling or behavioral therapy. However, most patients
who begin buprenorphine treatment discontinue within the first 6 months, which elevates the risk of relapse,
overdose, morbidity and mortality.
In Aim 1 of the research plan, I will identify the structures, functions, resources and practices of a diverse set of
primary care PRS programs and their potential for increasing OUD treatment retention. Data will be collected
through (a) a detailed survey of program characteristics, including PRS recruitment, qualifications, hiring
practices, training and professional development, supervision, caseloads, patient matching, specific tasks
performed, frequency and mode of patient contacts, incentives, and integration into the larger care team; (b) 3-
5 days of direct observation at 7-10 sites to capture PRS behavior and context; and (c) in-depth interviews with
patients, PRS, clinicians, and care team members. The studies will provide a granular understanding of the
scope, organization, and operational differences in PRS services and their potential effect on OUD treatment
retention. In Aim 2, a planning group of community stakeholders, OUD and PRS experts will guide the
development of an enhanced model of peer support services that combines the components and priorities most
likely to provide a cost-effective, robust intervention for OUD treatment retention in primary care. In Aim 3, I will
pilot test the enhanced model in a primary care MAT clinic with a small sample of adult patients. The pilot will be
a 180-day intervention designed to test the program logistics, operations, training, data collection, and overall
management. I will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and the fidelity and sustainability
of its implementation in preparation for a future R01 randomized controlled trial.
Our proposal aligns closely with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) 2016-2020 strategic plan to develop
and test strategies for effectively and sustainably implementing evidence-based treatments (Objective 3.4), and
with the goals of the NIDA 2021-2025 draft outline strategic plan to develop and test novel prevention, treatment
and recovery support strategies (Goal 2), and to implement evidence-based strategies in real-world settings
(Goal 3). The proposed research and didactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross
disciplinary skills that will enable her transition to independence as a physician scientist in the field of community-
based interventions for the treatment of OUD in primary care."

Genomic sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify clinically relevant genetic variants, yet
there are many challenges to overcome before this technology can be applied routinely in the healthy
population to identify individuals with actionable disorders in time to prevent or ameliorate symptoms. This
project explores an innovative age-based genomic screening (ABGS) paradigm that aims to provide targeted
and highly actionable genetic information to parents via their child’s routine wellness visits, thereby avoiding
some of the more difficult aspects of genome-scale sequencing while retaining most of the benefits. We will
utilize an established metric that evaluates parameters relevant to “clinical actionability” and defines the age of
onset and/or the age of intervention, to identify conditions that would be applicable for screening. In
collaboration with a diverse Expert Deliberative Group, we will define a consensus framework for carrying out
the ABGS program using targeted sequencing panels at specified time-points during infancy and childhood.
We will engage community stakeholders to raise awareness of the ABGS program and obtain critical feedback
to inform the development of accessible study materials. We will apply the Genetic Medicine Implementation
Research framework and utilize rigorous methods and measures to identify potential barriers and facilitators
and develop strategies to address them. Finally, we will conduct a pilot project in a small number of primary
care pediatrics clinics assessing preliminary outcomes, including perspectives of parents and providers, and
the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of ABGS. The expected result of this proposal is a validated,
stakeholder-informed, and practical ABGS program that includes hundreds of conditions that are actionable
throughout the lifespan, setting the stage for a future longitudinal study in a larger number of practices that can
assess clinical and health economic outcomes. Throughout this work, we will employ a community-based
participatory research approach to seek out perspectives from diverse stakeholders and emphasize the
importance of studying ABGS in a wide range of settings. The long-term goal of this research program is to
create a broadly applicable genomic screening program that extends well beyond newborn screening and can
be incorporated into routine well child care. We envision that this program will also prepare individuals to
eventually make informed decisions about the potential benefits and risks of screening for adult-onset
conditions during adulthood, thus creating a connection between genomic screening efforts in all age groups."

This is a basic science training grant focused on an integrative understanding of post-natal
human behavioral development. The rationale for the focus on integrative training is that
effective translation requires more than merely rapid movement of single-variable basic science
findings to efficacy studies but a different basic science, one that embraces complex causal
pathways of development, and considers processes at nested time scales and multiple levels of
analysis. The training program focuses on behavioral development (and relations to brain
development) because advancing research shows that post-natal behavior and the experiences
generated by that behavior modulates both structural and functional connectivity in the brain,
tunes specialized neural systems and influences gene expression, with atypical patterns of early
behavior and experiences determining the quality and opportunities of whole lifetimes. The
trainees are 5 predoctoral candidates in psychology and in two joint PhD programs in
psychology and neuroscience and in psychology and cognitive science and 3 post-doctoral
fellows from various fields interested in developmental process. The training program for pre-
doctoral trainees is 5 years (with 2 years supported by the training grant and 3 years by the
department of Psychological and Brain sciences); the training program for post-doctoral trainees
is typically 2 years. All trainees are required to submit at least one grant (foundation, F31, F32,
or NSF) while affiliated with the program. The training program emphasizes the use of cross-
levels methods to study the same problem, basic science that can link to translation, the
collection and analysis of large data sets, open data and data sharing, and the ethical conduct
of research."
10877917,"Millions of people suffer from chronic or persistent pain, which is a major medical problem. The current
treatment for chronic pain conditions is unsatisfactory. In recent years, ample evidence has documented the
role of glia and their interactions with neurons in the development of persistent pain. Despite overwhelming
evidence from preclinical studies, clinical trials for the treatment of chronic pain with glial modulators have not
been successful, which is related to our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms. While a majority of
studies show the pain-facilitating aspect of the injury-related glial activity, a potential inhibitory/protective role of
neuron-glial interactions in the development of persistent pain has been largely overlooked. The central
nervous system (CNS) homeostasis is supported by multiple inhibitory signaling pathways, among which the
CD200-CD200R signaling tandem has attracted attention. Immunoglobulin CD200 from neurons signals via its
receptor CD200R on microglia to maintain microglia at the surveillance state. Loss of or reduced CD200-
CD200R signaling after injury facilitates microglial activation.
 Descending pathways provide balanced modulation to maintain normal pain sensitivity. Facilitation or
disinhibition from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a pivot structure in descending pathways, to the
spinal/ trigeminal dorsal horn contributes to the development of chronic pain. Our preliminary results point to a
new descending pathway from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that directly projects to the RVM and is
involved in the 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R)-dependent pain facilitation. The cellular mechanisms underlying the
function of this direct ACC-RVM connection is unclear.
 We propose to analyze inhibitory/beneficial neuroglial interactions in the novel ACC-RVM descending pain
modulatory circuitry and test the hypothesis that disrupted inhibitory glial activity contributes to the emergence
of chronic pain. Our working hypothesis is that the CNS CD200-CD200R signaling axis is necessary for
homeostasis and insufficient/disrupted signaling of which disturbs the balance and contributes to chronic pain
conditions.
 Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that pain facilitation from the novel ACC-RVM pathway involves insufficient
homeostatic CD200-CD200R signaling and hyperexcitability of 5-HT-containing neurons. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that disrupted inhibitory CD200-CD200R signaling in the RVM contributes to the emergence of
chronic pain. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the CD200/CD200R signaling is important for the anti-
inflammatory phenotype of microglia in the RVM and involves downstream forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activity.
 Exploring the beneficial effect of glial activity will fill the gap in our understanding and lead to a transformative
shift in the search for improved management for chronic pain."
10878214,"Children with Down Syndrome have joint laxity, low muscle tone, and cognition impairments that lead to
delayed walking and exploration compared to their typically developing peers. Supporting mobility at a
developmentally appropriate age can benefit not only physical development, but also social, emotional, and
cognitive development. There are a wide range of mobility aids that children with other disabilities use, like gait
trainers and powered mobility – but evidence is lacking to support their use in prewalking children with Down
Syndrome. The proposed project will test the ability of two mobility aids, partial bodyweight support and
powered mobility, to promote increased mobility and play in young children with Down Syndrome.
This TL1 application will fund the training of Ms. Hoffman, a PhD Student in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering, whose research is at the intersection of accessibility, biomechanics, and rehabilitation medicine.
In parallel, we aim to 1) measure exploratory behaviors during play with both devices, 2) measure a child's
postural alignment and muscle activity with both devices, and 3) conduct a stakeholder analysis using
qualitative interviews and children's responses. Twelve participants with Down Syndrome, from 12 to 36
months of age, will join four play sessions: a) control – no devices, b) partial bodyweight support, c) powered
mobility in a sitting posture, d) powered mobility in a standing posture. We will quantify the impact of device
use on environmental exploration of the play space via overhead cameras. Additionally, we will use
electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activation and wearables sensors (IMUs) to measure posture
with and without mobility devices. Finally, we will conduct qualitative interviews to understand caregivers' and
clinicians' perspectives on using mobility devices to augment play and exploration.
Ms. Hoffman aspires to lead an independent research group specializing in the evaluation of mobility and play
technologies for young children with disabilities. Her project is poised to expand her engineering training with
co-sponsor Dr. Kat Steele to create a diverse range of sensing metrics that cater to participants' unique needs,
ensuring comfort and durability. Ms. Hoffman will also collaborate with clinicians, forming a strong foundation
for her future translational research. Didactic coursework and guidance from co-sponsor Dr. Heather Feldner
will allow Ms. Hoffman to build her qualitative research skills to incorporate the perspectives of all stakeholders
into her research and enrich her technical background. This award will not only support completion of her PhD
but will foster her growth as an independent researcher through her multidisciplinary mentorship team and
focused career development plan. In sum, Ms. Hoffman's participation in the TL1 program through the
INCLUDE initiative is poised to equip her with essential skills to drive the future translation and advancement of
pediatric assistive technology, benefiting children with disabilities and developmental delays."

In response to NOT-MD-22-012: Gender minority adolescents (GMAs; adolescents whose gender identity is
different than their sex assigned at birth) have higher risk for suicidal behavior when compared to non-GMAs.
In preliminary data, 85% of GMAs ages 14–18 seriously considered suicide in their lifetime, and 50% of GMAs
have engaged in suicidal behavior. Despite alarmingly high rates of suicidal behavior, very little is known about
how psychosocial experiences predict risk for suicidal behavior among GMAs. In particular, longitudinal data
examining GMA risk for suicidal behavior over time remain limited. The proposed study will be the first to
identify how multiple psychosocial experiences predict changes in risk for suicidal behavior over a 12-month
period in a large, diverse, nationwide sample of GMAs and a comparison group of non-GMAs.
 GMAs report higher levels of general stressors than non-GMAs, including peer victimization and low
parental support. GMAs also have unique psychosocial experiences, including undergoing social and medical
gender transition steps to increase congruence between gender identity and gender expression as well as
experiencing minority stress and discrimination. These psychosocial experiences likely increase risk
for suicidal behavior among GMAs, but current empirical knowledge is critically limited, including a dearth of
longitudinal studies. We propose to examine how risk for suicidal behavior changes over time among GMAs,
including how changes in general stressors and unique psychosocial experiences predict changes in
established risk factors for suicidal behavior among a large, diverse sample of GMAs and non-GMAs. This
study will be the first to integrate constructs from minority stress theory and the interpersonal theory of suicide
to explicate pathways between psychosocial predictors and established risk factors for suicidal behavior over
time among GMAs, elucidating novel intervention targets to reduce their risk for suicidal behavior.
 We will recruit 1,500 diverse adolescents ages 14–18 through social media advertisements, including
1,000 GMAs, and participants will complete a clinical interview and survey protocol at baseline and follow-ups
at 3-, 6-, and 12-months. We aim to examine how risk for suicidal behavior changes over time among GMAs as
compared to non-GMAs during adolescence, how general stressors predict risk for suicidal behavior among
GMAs as compared to non-GMAs, and how unique psychosocial experiences predict risk for suicidal behavior
among GMAs.
 Gender minority individuals are an NIH-designated health disparities population, and the proposed study
will advance our understanding of the psychosocial predictors of risk for suicidal behavior among GMAs, a
pressing health disparity between GMAs and non-GMAs. Our proposed longitudinal investigation is responsive
to NIMHD scientific priorities, represents a pioneering effort to move the field of GMA health equity forward,
and will identify novel intervention targets to reduce alarmingly high rates of suicidal behavior among GMAs."

 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune arthritis in children characterized by chronic joint
inflammation. T helper type 1 (Th1), Th17, and pathologic Th17.1 cells and the inflammatory cytokines
produced by these cells, interferon gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), are implicated in JIA
pathogenesis. A major knowledge gap is to understand how these inflammatory Th cells and cytokines
develop. This proposal outlines a research and training plan focused on studying how IL-17 and dual IFNγ-IL-
17 producing cells inappropriately develop during JIA Th1 differentiation. A goal for these studies is to identify
biologic factors that can be used to improve diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The investigator conducted
studies that described: 1) polyarticular JIA circulating cells that underwent Th1 differentiation produced high
levels of IL-17 and IFNγ and dual IFNγ-IL-17 producing cells, 2) a JIA patient with a rare loss-of-function
GATA3 mutation exhibited an exaggerated form of this phenotype, and 3) additional JIA patients carry rare
protein-coding mutations in genes important for Th1 differentiation. The proposal’s central hypothesis is that
JIA Th1 differentiation inappropriately produces IL-17 and Th1.17 cells and rare genetic mutations contribute to
this phenotype. The proposed Specific Aims test this hypothesis. Aim 1 identifies the role of novel genetic
mutations from JIA patients in production of IL-17, IFNγ, and Th1.17 cells during Th1 differentiation. Aim 2
identifies the cytokine and STAT signaling pathways that lead to the production of IL-17 and Th1.17 cells
during polyarticular JIA Th1 differentiation. This proposal involves translational studies in human cells using
advanced cytometry, molecular biology, and next generation sequencing. A major focus of this proposal is to
support Dr. Patrick’s development as a physician-scientist. Her career goal is to study the pathogenesis of JIA
in a basic research program and identify biologic factors that generate novel therapeutic targets and improve
diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. She will accomplish this goal through career aims to become an
immunology expert, gain advanced expertise in immunologic techniques, establish proficiency in the use and
analysis of next-generation sequencing, and acquire skillsets to become an independent principal investigator.
The research environment for the proposal is outstanding. Dr. Patrick has full departmental and institutional
support for the development of her research program. Her mentors are immunologists with expertise in the
planned advanced techniques. Vanderbilt has excellent facilities and shared resources for training in these
techniques. Her mentoring team includes experts in immunology, gene regulation, and rheumatologic disease
to guide development of her independent research program. This K08 will support the generation of data and
lead to publications providing insight into the pathogenesis and genetics of JIA and in support of a successful
R01 application."

While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers, including
metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the development of agents that overcome resistance to
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based therapy represents a critical unmet need for ccRCC patients. We have shown that the
B7 family member HERV-H LTR-associating 2 (HHLA2) is expressed in the majority of ccRCC and recently
have discovered an inhibitory receptor (KIR3DL3) for HHLA2. Monoclonal antibodies that selectively block the
HHLA2/KIRDL3 interaction, which we call the HHLA2 Inhibitory Pathway (HIP), could be an important means
to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. In this proposal, we will study the expression of HHLA2 and it
receptors in kidney cancer on tumor cells and immune cells and the relationship of HHLA2 and PD-L1
expression on tumors cells. Using clinically annotated specimens from clinical trials of patients with ccRCC on
anti-PD-1 therapy, we will determine whether HHLA2 expression is associated with lack of response to PD-1
therapy. We will elucidate the regulatory pathways that are similar and different between HHLA2 and PD-L1 to
better understand the expression of these immune checkpoints in kidney cancer and how their expression may
change over the course of tumor progression and selection pressures. We will identify the optimal reagents for
activating T cells and NK cells through the HHLA2:KIR3DL3 pathway in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our
results will direct the selection of humanized blocking antibodies of HHLA2 Inhibitory Pathway that will move
into primate toxicity and human Phase I clinical trials during year two of this grant."

GENE EXPRESSION AND SIGNALING IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
 April 16-20, 2024
ABSTRACT
 The proposed meeting on Gene Expression and Signaling in the Immune System, to be held in spring
2024, will focus on the most recent advances in this rapidly moving field. The meeting will be open, with
attendance limited only by the facilities available to a maximum of ~425 participants. Oral presentations will
be delivered by a combination of invited speakers and those selected from submitted abstracts. This ensures
the participation of junior and senior leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results
emerging at the time of the meeting. A particular emphasis will be made to ensure that a substantial number
of speakers will be advanced trainees or junior PIs. The oral presentations will be complemented by poster
presentations in two sessions, also selected from submitted abstracts. The areas to be covered in the 2024
meeting include 1) Regulation of gene expression; 2) Differentiation; 3) Signaling at the membrane; 4)
Intracellular signaling; 5) Intercellular communication; 6) Host:microbe interactions; 7) Immune Responses;
and 8) Tissue-immune communications (immunophysiology). Rather than focusing on one particular type of
immune cell or disease process, the meeting will highlight mechanistic approaches that aim to rigorously
advance our knowledge of how the processes of signal transduction and gene regulation operate within the
immune system at different scales. Ample opportunity is provided for the presentation of important, late-
breaking findings. The meeting format also ensures and encourages highly productive discussions, particularly
during meals and in poster sessions. The meeting will foster interactions among immunologists working in
related areas, and provide a forum for the development of new ideas and approaches for current and future
investigations of regulation of signaling and gene expression in the immune system."
10904696,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY. The proposed R01 is built upon the premise that: 1) Cognitive impairment
(CI) persists even in the context of HIV viral suppression; 2) women living with HIV (WLWH) experience
disproportionate burden of CI and have higher rates of, and stronger associations with, many of the underlying
biopsychosocial risk factors for CI, as well as unique sex-specific risk factors; 3) immune activation persists in
the context of viral suppression; 4) immune activation (e.g., Interleukin[IL]-6, sCD163) is a consistent risk factor
of CI in HIV; 5) neurobiological pathways affecting cognitive functions are activated by HIV directly and indirectly
through immune activation; 6) psychosocial factors such as stigma/discrimination, depression, and substance
use impair cognitive functions and are associated with heightened immune activation, likely both directly and
indirectly through reduced ART levels. By leveraging the strong infrastructure of the Women's Interagency
HIV Study (WIHS), including existing behavioral data and specimen, the current longitudinal study will
fill significant gaps in the field by examining the role of the neurobiological pathways whereby chronic
immune activation leads to CI phenotypes in a large phenotypically well-defined group of WLWH. In a
highly cost-effective approach, we will use existing biospecimen to assess biomarkers of chronic immune
activation and neurobiological pathways and link them to existing neuropsychological assessments among
N=500 WLWH aged 26 and older (Median age = 50) at 3 time points, to assess the following aims: Aim 1. To
examine neurobiological pathways mediating the link between chronic immune activation and CI phenotypes in
WLWH. Aim 2. To identify psychosocial factors affecting immune activation and neurobiological pathways. Aim
3. To examine the role of ART hair levels in mediating the effect of psychosocial factors in Aim 2 on immune
activation and neurobiological pathway biomarkers. Impact. The results of this study will have several important
clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of CI in WLWH, including behavioral and pharmacological
therapies. Understanding the unique impact of biomarkers on cognitive outcomes will provide guidance on
clinical intervention targets (e.g., immune therapy, dopamine reuptake inhibitors). Understanding the role of
psychosocial factors in modulating immune activation and neurobiological pathways and the mediating role of
ART adherence level, will inform behavioral intervention strategies (e.g., resilience, social support). Psychosocial
factors may be particularly ideal intervention targets to curb the inflammatory cascade leading to CI."

Eliciting or suppressing an adaptive immune response has become central to oncology, autoimmunity, and
infectious disease. Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of cancer, while TNF inhibitors and
other immune-suppressive biologics have become the standard of care in autoimmune diseases. Vaccines are
a stunning accomplishment of biomedical research; the mRNA vaccines for SARS-2 are only the latest example.
CAR-T cells induce long-term remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a previously incurable disease.
However, current methods for modulating adaptive immunity have serious limitations. Checkpoint inhibitors and
biologics only work in a subset of patients, and global stimulation or suppression of immune function frequently
leads to autoimmunity or opportunistic infection. Despite their extraordinary properties, many vaccines require a
needle and a cold chain, making them difficult to deploy in low- and middle-income countries, and they fail to
induce mucosal immunity, so vaccinated people can infect others. Engineered T cells have not been successful
against solid tumors to date, and ex vivo T cell engineering is costly and difficult to scale.
Here, we propose to address these challenges by tapping into the host’s ‘colonist interaction program’. Certain
bacterial strains from the microbiome elicit a strikingly potent, specific, and durable immune response. In a new
unpublished project in the lab that inspired the work we propose here, we showed that the anti-commensal
immune response can be redirected against the host by engineering commensal bacteria to express host
antigens on their surface. Commensal bacteria have all the key attributes of an ideal vaccine vector: they induce
highly potent, antigen-specific T and B cell responses; colonization is durable on the timescale of years to
decades (experimental evidence suggests the same is true for the immune response they elicit); and colonists
modulate immune function safely, in a way that spares host tissue from autoimmune attack.
Our vision is to create a general platform for eliciting a potent and durable adaptive immune response in a way
that is safe and inexpensive. The kernel of our idea is to develop a set of vaccine scaffolds in which a
commensal is the adjuvant and colonization is the mode of administration. We propose a four-part process
to build the foundations of commensal vaccines: Goal 1: identify a core set of commensals with immune
modulatory properties; Goal 2: optimize CD8+ T cell induction for antitumor therapy; Goal 3: enhance B cell
induction for preventing viral infection; and Goal 4: redirect colonist-specific Tregs against autoimmune disease.
These goals can proceed in parallel, and success in any one of them would have a great deal of impact. We
note that although this work is applied, it will create useful tools for basic research into immune modulation by
the microbiome, just as biologics and methods for T cell engineering have done for other sub-disciplines of
immunology."

One of the primary goals of the primate brain is to learn about structure in the world, and to shape neural
representations such that they encode this structure in an efficient, generalizable format. An important behavior that
relies upon the formation of these abstract neural representations is categorization, the process by which objects that
may differ in their basic sensory features are assigned to the same behavioral output. Decades of research on the neural
basis of categorization has contributed substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
representation of learned categories, and has led to the identification of a widely-distributed network of brain areas that
may be involved, such as the lateral intraparietal region (LIP), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and superior colliculus (SC).
However, prior work has almost exclusively relied on tasks that involve teaching non-human primates (NHPs) to assign
stimuli to categories using a single visual feature, such as motion direction or color. Natural categorization, in contrast,
often requires the integration of multiple features in order to determine to which category an object belongs
(multi-feature integration categorization). Categorization and category-learning are disrupted in a number of neurological
disorders, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s, and ADHD, and multi-feature integration categorization seems to
show a different pattern of deficits in these disorders than simpler category structures. This suggests that the circuit
mechanisms mediating categorization or category learning may differ, depending on task demands. However, little is
currently known about mechanisms of stimulus categorization when assignment to the correct category first requires the
integration of disparate sensory features. A greater understanding of the neural mechanisms that support
feature-integration for categorization will enhance our ability to provide targeted treatment for disorders that disrupt the
categorization system. This work will involve conducting large-scale simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in two
regions that have been implicated in mediating categorization; LIP and PFC. In Aim 1, neural activity in areas LIP and PFC
will be recorded while NHPs switch between performing a multi-feature integration categorization task in which the
direction of motion and the color of a moving-dot stimulus must be combined to determine the category, and a
motion-direction categorization task in which only the direction of motion is relevant. In Aim 2, paired
recording-inactivation experiments will be performed in which LIP (or PFC) will be reversibly inactivated while recording
in PFC (or LIP). The results from this study will reveal what computations are necessary to perform categorization tasks of
complex structure in which multiple sensory features must be combined or integrated, and how these demands shape
the neural mechanism the brain uses to perform these tasks. Further, this work will elucidate the circuit mechanisms
underlying categorization behavior through the use of simultaneous multi-area recordings and paired
inactivation-recording experiments."

Obesity and increased adiposity contribute to cardiovascular disease and mortality, but high-altitude
populations have lower rates of chronic metabolic disease and cardiovascular mortality. In mice, oxygen
deprivation recapitulates these effects, lowering body weight, adiposity, and blood glucose levels. Elucidating
the mechanisms underlying this metabolic reprogramming can inspire effective therapies for obesity.
Untargeted metabolic profiling of adipose tissue from hypoxic mice revealed the enrichment of branched-chain
hydroxyacids (BCHAs), which are understudied derivatives of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Notably,
impaired BCAA clearance has consistently been associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Understanding
the regulation of BCAA metabolism in hypoxia can uncover causal mechanisms linking BCAA metabolism to
metabolic health.
Hypoxia may promote BCHA production by driving a shift in adipocytes from canonical BCAA metabolism to
this alternative pathway. Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control the metabolic pathway
producing BCHAs. The enzyme that catalyzes BCHA production has not been identified, but human genetics
data suggests that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression is associated with BCHA levels. Moreover,
prior work suggests that the biochemical effects of hypoxia disrupt complexes of canonical BCAA metabolism
enzymes, facilitating BCHA production through the alternative pathway. In vitro models of adipose tissue
hypoxia will be used to determine whether these mechanisms drive hypoxia-induced BCHA production (Aim 1).
Beyond these regulatory mechanisms, the impact of BCHA production is not known, but observational data
from mice and humans shows that increased BCHA production is associated with diminished adiposity.
Therefore, BCHA production may contribute to the decreased fat mass in hypoxia. This hypothesis will be
tested using Bckdk-knockout mice, which exhibit impaired BCHA production (Aim 2). Measuring adiposity and
glucose clearance of these mice in hypoxia will reveal the metabolic role of BCHA production in hypoxia.
These experiments will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of adipose BCAA metabolism
in hypoxia. These experiments will be conducted with the guidance of Dr. Isha Jain and Dr. Andrei Goga, both
experts in the regulation of cellular metabolism and metabolic physiology. Investigating the causal relationship
between BCAA metabolism and metabolic health will inspire new therapeutic approaches for obesity."
10901067,"Abstract: Infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have historically been the leading cause of
death from a single infectious agent and still result in 1.5 million deaths annually. One of the hallmark
characteristics of the disease is an aggregate of immune cells called the granuloma, where macrophages
develop epithelioid character, expressing epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) and other canonical markers of
epithelial cells. This structure restrains the bacteria within but is unable to eradicate the infection despite exposing
the pathogen to pH changes, hypoxia, and antimicrobial peptides. The unique, lipid-rich cell envelope of
mycobacteria protects them from these stressors while simultaneously modulating the host immune response.
Thus, targeting bacterial cell envelope components that are specific to the granuloma is a potential avenue for
future drugs and therapeutics. Using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) model to recapitulate key
aspects of TB disease, the proposed aims will uncover novel bacterial elements with importance in mycobacterial
granulomas. I will explore how specific cell envelope components impact both mycobacterial survival and host
dynamics in mycobacterial granulomas. I will assess how the bacteria sigma factor SigE (σE) impacts survival
within the granuloma through cell envelope-mediated interactions with the host immune response. We have
identified SigE as a potential modulator of bacterial survival in the granuloma, which will help better understand
the host-pathogen interactions that occur in the granuloma. In addition, the knowledge of bacterial factors that
allow mycobacterial persistence in granulomas can unveil potential drug targets and therapies to treat
tuberculosis."
10904743,"In the setting of structural lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and COPD, non-tuberculous bacterium Mycobacteroides abscessus can cause chronic pulmonary disease that is often incurable and associated with rapid lung function decline. Additionally, existing treatment requires more than a year of daily intake of antibiotics with poor efficacies and significant toxicities. M. abscessus has been designated as an “antibiotic nightmare” and “an environmental bacterium turned clinical nightmare” due to extensive natural and acquired antibiotic resistance, which severely limits treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for new treatment options that are effective against these drug-resistant strains. β-lactams are the most widely used class of antibiotics globally to treat bacterial infections in humans and have a demonstrated record of safety and tolerability. However, today, only a single β-lactam is used at a time to treat M. abscessus infections. This recommendation is based on a now debunked historical concept that all β-lactams have the same single target (DD-transpeptidases), thus the inclusion of more than one β- lactam in a regimen would be redundant. We have completed proof-of-concept studies demonstrating that paired combinations of certain β-lactams, each at less than half the dose required for single β-lactams, exhibit synergy in bactericidal activity against M. abscessus in vitro and hypothesized that one agent optimally inhibits LD-transpeptidases while the other targets DD-transpeptidases to achieve synergy. Lastly, we have developed a mouse model of pulmonary M. abscessus disease based on the natural route of infection in humans and observed that synergy between β-lactams against M. abscessus observed in vitro is also preserved in this pre-clinical model. Three of the combinations identified in our in vitro synergy assessment are comprised of orally administered β-lactams. This finding has raised the possibility that a combination of select two oral β-lactams may be effective in treating M. abscessus disease. Here, we will test this hypothesis by assessing whether novel oral regimens consisting of select two β-lactams (which may include an additional oral traditional antibiotic) will produce a stable cure in mice infected with M. abscessus. The experimental regimens will be tested in a C3HeB/FeJ mouse model of pulmonary M. abscessus disease model against a range of recent clinical isolates of the M. abscessus complex. In addition to potency of the regimens, we will also assess their ability to minimize selection of drug-resistance."
10901066,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a complex, multifactorial, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder that affects ~1%
of the worldwide population (~1.5 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by skin inflammation and
chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to
increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the
understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other
“biologics” have led to substantial improvements in PsA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions
of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains
unanswered: why do over 50% of PsA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to
these agents? Machine learning methods investigating the effect of inter-individual variations of molecular
features and digital data on drug response – promise to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine
approaches in autoimmune disease.
 TNF inhibitors (TNFi), remain the anchor drugs for the treatment of PsA (and many autoimmune diseases)
and are used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, TNFi achieve significant results in less than 50%
of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that patients’ response to TNFi and
other biologics is highly variable. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial and while many biomarkers
have been studied, they have been unable to demonstrate significant predictive value for clinical use in PsA.
 Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, experts in remote studies (homeRNA), digital
biomarkers, transcriptomics analysis, and immunoinformatics will address our overarching goal to study: a)
whether remote characterization of frequent (weekly) gene/module expression can promptly identify distinctive
dynamics of inter-individual variations in the blood transcriptional trajectories following treatment with two
cytokine-specific biologics in early PsA (i.e., TNFi and IL-17 inhibitors); and b) if a novel, remote precision
medicine approach based on the earliest detectable transcriptome and smartphone-based digital signatures can
be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to TNFi in treatment-naïve, new-onset PsA (NOPA)
patients. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PsA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical
efficacy response would be predicted early in any given patient about to initiate TNFi, limiting or preventing
disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$60,000/year/patient
in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in
rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study of other similar small molecules
(e.g., JAK inhibitors) and other biologic agents (e.g., anti-IL-17 or -IL-23 inhibitors)."
10883630,"Summary 
 Accurate and complete replication of the genome is essential for both proliferation and genomic stability. 
Genomic DNA is constantly under assault from both exogenous and endogenous agents. The resulting DNA 
lesions can cause stalling of the replication fork and activation of the replication stress response (RSR). This 
activates a group of proteins that protect and restart the replication fork so that genomic integrity is maintained. 
Incorrect repair can lead to cancer and aging, and defects in the RSR predispose individuals to develop cancer. 
Our overall goal is to define the molecular mechanisms that protect the genome during replication stress. We 
have discovered that DNA Helicase B (HELB) protects stalled replication forks from aberrant degradation by 
nucleases and promotes replication restart. This is consistent with data showing reduced recovery from 
replication stress with HELB knockdown; however, the mechanism by which HELB promotes recovery from 
replication stress is unknown. In addition, we have found that HELB enhances replication through G-quadruplex 
(G4) structures, suggesting that HELB may enable the replication fork to progress through difficult to replicate 
sites. Since replication stalling can result in epigenetic instability, HELB may be involved in epigenetic 
maintenance in addition to genomic maintenance. HELB has also been implicated in initiation of DNA replication 
and regulation of end resection in homologous recombination (HR). Due to its varied roles in multiple processes, 
regulation of HELB activity is likely required. Indeed, we have evidence that HELB activity is regulated by post- 
translational modifications (PTMs). We hypothesize that HELB maintains genomic and epigenetic integrity by 
protecting nascent DNA from degradation, aiding in replication restart, and assisting in replication through difficult 
sites. We will test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: (1) Ascertain the role of HELB in protection 
and restart of stalled DNA replication forks, (2) Determine the function of HELB in replication through difficult to 
replicate regions of the genome, and (3) Delineate the role of HELB PTMs and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 
in the replication stress response."
10892777,"Abstract Summary:
Failure to deliver care near the end of life that reflects the needs, values and preferences of patients with
advanced cancer remains a key shortcoming of our cancer care delivery system. National organizations
including the National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology have called for
increased attention to advance care planning (ACP) to improve patient-centered care near end of life. A critical
barrier to progress in the field is a lack of evidence about the most effective and efficient ACP strategy to
improve treatment decisions near end of life and ensure patients' wishes are honored.
Two different patient-facing ACP interventions are widely used and known to be effective but entail sizeable
differences in costs and complexity to deploy: (1) in-person discussions with trained facilitators and (2) web-
based advance care planning using interactive videos. These approaches have never been compared directly; it
is therefore unclear whether one form of ACP is more potent—and if so, for whom and under what
circumstances. Understanding the relative effectiveness of in-person, facilitated versus web-based ACP is
important because in-person ACP requires far more resources.
This proposal is a single-blind, patient-level randomized trial to address this evidence gap, using mixed
methods to compare the effectiveness of in-person, facilitated ACP vs web-based ACP among 400 patients with
advanced cancer and their family caregivers. Aim 1 compares the effect of these approaches on patient and
family caregiver outcomes (engagement in ACP—primary outcome; ACP discussions with family caregivers and
physicians; advance directive (AD) completion; and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety). For
patients who die during the study period, we will use validated, caregiver-reported measures to compare
perceived quality of EOL care, patients' EOL goal attainment, and bereaved caregiver symptoms of depression,
anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Aim 2 assesses implementation costs of each intervention and effects on
healthcare utilization at end of life. Aim 3 identifies contexts and mechanisms influencing the effectiveness of
each approach.
This trial will have a high impact because it will provide new and much-needed empirical evidence about two
patient-facing ACP approaches that successfully overcome limitations of traditional written advance directives
but entail very different investments of time and resources. It is innovative in using mixed methods to
evaluate not only the comparative effectiveness of these approaches, but also for whom, how and in what
circumstances they are effective. It is feasible because it builds on extensive infrastructure developed by an
accomplished research team with experience conducting behavioral intervention trials and qualitative research
in ACP and oncology."

Sepsis is the most common cause of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit and is coupled with very high
mortality. It is a highly dynamic pathological state in which a wide array of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways
are aberrantly activated, resulting in a complex syndrome that evolves rapidly over hours. Therefore,
determining the timeline of sepsis and developing timeline-specific therapies are essential for successful
interventions. Recently, we examined temporal changes in the translatome of the kidney in animal models of
bacterial sepsis. We showed that 1) initial outburst of inflammation is accompanied by significant increases in
RNA transcription and translation, 2) the initial inflammatory phase is followed by activation of antiviral
programs, and 3) the activation of antiviral programs leads to translation shutdown—a hallmark of late phase
sepsis. Crucially missing from this recent work is the nature and source of the antiviral program activators in
the absence of an actual viral infection. We hypothesize that induction of the initial inflammatory cascades
results in a state of self-RNA overburden, which provokes a milieu resembling that of a viral infection. In this
proposal, we will investigate the role of endogenous RNA stress as the determinant of antiviral program
activation and resultant sepsis-induced organ failure. This work will provide an important framework for
understanding the link between the early phase inflammation and late phase total organ shutdown, and could
lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications in sepsis-induced kidney failure."

Prokaryotic horizontal gene transfer (HGT) underlines the spread of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic traits.
The battle against antibiotic resistance must be fought on multiple fronts, including the understanding of natural
barriers that microbes use to restrict HGT. Most bacteria rely on the CRISPR-Cas system to establish adaptive
immunity against mobile genetic elements. DNA pieces from these invaders' genome can be captured and
stored as immunological memories termed spacers, at the CRISPR loci. Small, antisense RNAs produced from
CRISPR (crRNAs) will guide Cas enzymes to destroy invaders with a matching target site. In the past decade,
much progress has been made in understanding the CRISPR interference enzymes and their applications in
genetic engineering. However, how microbes acquire their CRISPR memories remains very poorly understood.
In this proposal, we aim to uncover the molecular basis for CRISPR memorization (i.e. spacer adaptation). We
use the gram-negative pathogen Neisseria meningitidis (Nme) as a model organism, due to of its clinical
importance and tractable genetics. Current knowledge about spacer adaptation mostly comes from studies of
the type I CRISPR native to E. coli; products of its conserved cas1-cas2 integrase genes can create functional
memories independently of the interference enzymes. Our recent preliminary
findings
suggest that the type II
CRISPR of N. meningitidis creates memory by a distinct mechanism. The interference genes, Nmecas9 and
tracrRNA co-factor, play important but non-conventional roles in the acquisition of functional spacers. We will
use molecular genetic, genomic and biochemical approaches to address fundamental questions, including:
What are the molecular roles of Cas9 and the CRISPR-encoded tracrRNA in spacer acquisition? What are the
rules governing memory DNA selection? How does Cas9/tracr cooperate with the Cas1-2 integrase? And
finally, how would the anti-CRISPR proteins affect the memorization process?
The proposed research will illuminate the interplay between pathogenic bacteria, their CRISPR systems, and
HGT. This work also promises to guide technology advances, including CRISPR-based novel antimicrobials
that kill specific bacterial pathogens, and Cas9-Cas1-Cas2 based genome-tagging devices that help record
cellular/disease history."

Strong demographic evidence shows that Native students are not integrating into STEM professional communities at the
same rate as majority students. While Native people (Native American/Alaskan Native/Native Hawaiian) make up nearly
2% of the U.S. population according the most recent U.S. Census, they make up only about 0.01% of enrolled undergraduate
students (NSF, 2014) and 3,014 (.5%) of the 601,883 enrolled graduate students in Science and Engineering (S&E)
programs, with even smaller percentages persisting to faculty STEM careers (NSF, 2017). Why don't Native scholars with
high interest in biomedical careers integrate into their STEM professional communities at rates equal to majority
populations? At this time, most research regarding Native STEM scholars has been qualitative, involving in-depth
interviews with those who persevere. To broaden the research, we propose to build on research regarding the Tripartite
Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI) (Kelman,1958, 2006; Estrada et al., 2011), Native American culture, and
integrative identity, to conduct a prospective propensity score matched longitudinal study to compare the short-, medium-,
and long-term outcomes of three groups of emerging Native biomedical scholars (N=162). The groups include: (A) No
Treatment Comparison group (matched Native scholars engaged in the American Indian Science and Engineering Society
(AISES) community), (B) Modified Treatment group (matched Native scholars engaged in the AISES community + online
professional development intervention), and (C) Full Treatment group (matched Native scholars engaged in the AISES
community + complete professional development intervention). The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of an
online intervention that “scales up” key aspects of an intensive professional development intervention relative to a control
group. The second aim is to understand the mechanisms that explain the intervention effects. We will assess the degree to
which key psycho-social factors (i.e., [i] efficacy, identity, and values [measures of integration into professional
communities], [ii] Native scholars' professional-and-Native identity integration, and [iii] perceptions of communal value
affordances in biomedical careers) mediate the relationship between the group differences and long-term integration into
the professional community, greater career persistence, and higher rates of mentorship of future Native scholars. The
hypothesis-driven design of this study will provide results that inform the biomedical community regarding factors and
mechanisms that are most likely to influence and foster a sustained career in the biomedical research workforce. Further,
this study provides a generalizable example of how to create added value from existing interventions (at significantly less
cost than the parent intervention) for larger populations of students. Useful and meaningful findings will be made available
in formats that are supportive and useful to biomedical educators instructing, mentoring or advising Native Scholars,
university science training programs, and education programs with undergraduates in biomedical majors."

The goals of this research project are to use the ADAPT-ITT framework to adapt elements of an existing career
readiness interventions tailored to young SMM and trans women of color at-risk for HIV infection
(Work2Prevent) to the needs of young Black SMM (YBSMM), ages 18-29, living with HIV. Once adapted, a
pilot study of the intervention (Work2Prevent Plus; W2P+) will be conducted with 40 YBSMM to determine
intervention feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy for improving care engagement.
To ensure W2P+ can serve the needs of HIV-positive YBSMM, the research team will engage in a formative
phase of adaptation, wherein quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from employers. A sample of
potential employers (n=50) will complete a survey focused on challenges related to hiring and retaining
individuals with a range of minority identities. A second sample (n = 20) of potential employers will complete an
interview with project staff, where they will respond to vignettes focused on successes and challenges a hiring
manager could encounter when trying to hire and retain employees who are YBSMM living with HIV. These
data will inform the adaptation of W2P+. Next, a series of focus groups will be conducted with members of the
population (n = 40) to identify what they most need in a career readiness intervention. More specifically, this
phase will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to ensure the adapted intervention addresses the range of concerns
associated with employment for YBSMM irrespective of HIV status. Next, the research team will conduct a
theater test with 8 YBSMM aged 18-29 years old and 10 stakeholders serving YBSMM, wherein stakeholders
will observe the administration of content from the existing interventions to identify which content should be
retained, adapted, or replaced. Next, 3 to 5 experts on employment and treatment barriers will be asked for
additional feedback for intervention revision. The feedback will be used for additional revision of W2P+. Finally,
a computerized readability test will ensure that language used in the revised intervention manual and activities
is accessible to a 6th grade reading level. After the intervention manual and delivery procedures with the
ADAPT-ITT model are finalized, 40 YBSMM, ages 18-29, will be enrolled in a single arm pilot trial, with follow-
up assessments at 6 and 12 months. The primary research outcomes for the pilot study are feasibility and
acceptability. Additional outcomes include hours worked per week, job seeking self-efficacy, and proportion of
missed HIV care visits.
Further, we will use implementation science measures to identify the best approach for delivering the
intervention in a CBO setting. Primary implementation outcomes are relative advantage of the intervention and
implementation climate. Secondary outcome is readiness for implementation."

Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are ubiquitin E3 ligases that function in development and innate immunity. TRIM5a and
TRIMCyp proteins (collectively termed TRIM5) recognize and deactivate the incoming cores of retroviruses such as HIV-
1. Indeed, human TRIM5a is an important component of interferon-mediated control of HIV-1 infection. Previous work
from our group suggested an unprecedented lattice-to-lattice mode of pattern recognition, in which TRIM5a dimers use
the viral capsid surrounding the viral core as a template for higher-order assembly, ultimately forming a cage around the
core. In the current funding period of this R01 project, we solved the first structure of the TRIM5a/capsid superlattice,
developed and optimized a recombinant assembly and ubiquitination system for TRIM5/capsid complexes, and
collaborated in studies that reconstituted the early events of HIV-1 replication in a cell-free system. In this renewal
application, we now propose to: Aim 1, extend the resolution of our TRIM5a/capsid superlattice structure, in order to
visualize contacts between the arrayed TRIM5a protein dimers and their bound viral CA protein hexamer subunits. Aim
2, utilize our novel in vitro ubiquitination and HIV-1 replication systems as experimental platforms to elucidate how
TRIM5 deactivates its caged viral core. Aim 3, understand a novel mechanism of TRIM5 recognition, in which the
homologous TRIM34 protein directs human TRIM5a to bind and inactive HIV-1 capsids bearing the N74D mutation.
Collectively, these studies will fill in important missing gaps in our understanding of how TRIM5 proteins inhibit HIV-1
replication. Our developing understanding of TRIM5 has been giving important insights on HIV-1 capsid vulnerabilities
and efforts to develop drugs that exploit these vulnerabilities."

Homologous recombination, i.e., homology-directed repair (HDR), is a major repair pathway for double-strand
breaks (DSBs), including lesions arising during DNA replication. HDR mutants are characterized by genomic
instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as interstrand cross-linking agents like cisplatin and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, both of which are used in cancer treatment. Several proteins central to
the HDR pathway are tumor suppressors, notably the breast and ovarian cancer suppressor BRCA2, which
promotes the function of RAD51, the critical protein for homologous strand exchange. RAD51 paralogs are
also key HDR proteins and have also been identified both as tumor suppressors and as proteins that affect
therapy response. These HDR proteins are essential. Individuals with germline mutations are constitutionally
heterozygous, but tumors typically have somatic undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH), losing the wild-type
allele, presumably as an early step in tumor initiation.
 This proposal has an overarching goal of integrating our understanding how HDR proteins act to
maintain genomic stability and cell and tissue homeostasis, how they come to be “lost” in cells, and how their
function can be restored. Thus, this broad goal impacts tumor initiation, therapy response, and therapy
resistance. It incorporates molecular analysis of HDR protein function, with a particular focus on BRCA2, and
delineates how cells respond to HDR protein loss, including how they escape cell death to allow tumor
formation. Within this goal is understanding tumor initiation from the standpoint of determining mechanisms of
LOH that lead to HDR protein loss, as well as uncovering factors that affect LOH frequencies. While HDR
protein loss sensitizes tumors to targeted therapies, HDR function is often restored by secondary mutations,
leading to therapy resistance. Understanding which mutations are susceptible to reversion and how therapy
impacts reversion is of major interest. Finally, HDR within tissues is also part of this integrated goal, in
particular, within the fallopian tube epithelium, which is considered the tissue of origin of high-grade serous
ovarian cancers."

 Cardiogenic shock is a devastating problem that has had a relatively stagnant in-hospital mortality around
30-40% in the last decade. Consequently, an array of mechanical support strategies has emerged to mitigate
the multi-organ hypoperfusion. Among them, percutaneous veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is increasingly being used to treat cardiogenic shock due to its capacity to be
instituted rapidly in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and provide large volume complete hemodynamic
and respiratory support. However, this strategy has notable disadvantages, namely high cost associated with
its programmatic development and the potential for introducing iatrogenic complications in a very sick
population.
 Prior invasive hemodynamic data from animal models have suggested that there is deterioration of LV
performance due to increased stroke work within minutes of the commencement of VA-ECMO hemodynamic
support. There is also observational clinical data showing that LV distension may worsen with VA-ECMO
support. Conversely, human data from our group’s prior experience have suggested that VA-ECMO support in
patients with minimal pulsatility after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can dramatically improve cardiac recovery
and rates of neurologically favorable survival.
 These conflicting data have led to the emergence of diverse management strategies including VA-ECMO in
patients with cardiogenic shock either due to AMI or cardiac arrest. In the context of the rapidly increasing
usage of VA-ECMO usage there is a critical need to identify the manner in which VA-ECMO affects cardiac
hemodynamics in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
 To that goal we will pursue the following specific aims:
1. Define the LV pressure volume area (PVA) and stroke work at different levels of VA-ECMO support in
patients cannulated for CS. 2. Define the temporal changes of LV stroke work with prolonged VA-ECMO
support over the course of the hospitalization. The temporal recovery patterns will be associated with clinical
hard endpoints of decannulation or transition to permanent cardiac assist devices/transplant or death.
3.Validate the accuracy of non-invasive reconstruction of PV-loops compared to invasively collected data to
help establish an easier way to assess LV stroke work for every day practice.
 The expected outcome of this research proposal is to define the physiologic effect of VA-ECMO support on
the left ventricle energetics and provide objective scientific clinical proof derived from a high mortality and
morbidity patient population. Additionally, we expect that our data will be useful to establish normative

Among men who have sex with men (MSM), there is an urgent need to optimize the unprecedented clinical
and public health benefits of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV with those who use stimulants
(i.e., methamphetamine, cocaine, and crack-cocaine). Stimulant-using MSM display 3-6 fold faster rates of HIV
seroconversion, and one-in-ten MSM with newly diagnosed HIV infection report recent stimulant use. Findings
from our team and others also demonstrate that stimulant use is a key obstacle to PrEP adherence and
persistence. Stimulant-using MSM have a 3-fold greater rate of disengagement from PrEP care and 5-fold
greater odds of sub-optimal PrEP adherence. The proposed multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) will
leverage a promising intervention model of delivering a positive affect intervention during contingency
management (CM), which we have recently demonstrated achieves durable and clinically meaningful
reductions in viral load among HIV+, methamphetamine-using MSM. In the proposed multi-site RCT, we plan
to test whether delivering an Affect Regulation Treatment to Enhance Medication Intervention Success
(ARTEMIS) positive affect intervention during smartphone-based CM for directly observed PrEP doses
achieves more durable reductions in HIV acquisition risk over 12 months. HIV acquisition risk (the primary
outcome) will be operationalized as tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels <700 fmol per punchand self-
reported recent condomless anal sex (CAS). Up to 300 MSM on PrEP who report stimulant use and CAS in the
past 3 months as well as any PrEP non-adherence in the past month will be recruited from social networking
applications as well as PrEP clinical services in South Florida and San Francisco. Participants who meet the
inclusion and exclusion criteria at an in-person baseline assessment will provide a dried blood spot (DBS)
specimen that will be stored to measure TFV-DP levels and begin 3-months of smartphone-based CM that
includes financial incentives for completing up to four directly observed PrEP doses per week (48 doses total
over the 3 months). Participants will complete a run-in period (waiting period) where they will complete 4
directly observed smartphone-based CM PrEP doses prior to randomization. At a separate randomization visit,
240 participants (120 South Florida and 120 San Francisco) will be randomized to receive their first individually
delivered ARTEMIS positive affect intervention or attention-control session. All 5 individually delivered
intervention sessions will be delivered during the 3-month CM intervention period. Follow-up assessments will
be conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning CM, with DBS collected to measure TFV-DP at 6 and 12
months. Consistent with the NIH OAR high priority area of “reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS,” this clinical
research will meaningfully inform the targeted deployment of limited public health resources to optimize the
unprecedented clinical and public health benefits of PrEP in stimulant-using MSM, one of highest priority
populations for decreasing HIV incidence."

The goal of this R01 application is to determine the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction in obese
asthma exacerbates airway inflammation. Nearly 40% of asthmatics in the U.S. are obese. Obese (vs. lean)
asthmatics experience more frequent exacerbations, poorer response to inhaled corticosteroids and worse
asthma control. There is an unmet need to study the novel pathogenesis of obese asthma. We have found
mitochondrial dysfunction in obese asthma airway epithelium, including increased respiration, glycolytic rates,
reactive oxygen species, and greater numbers of dysfunctional mitochondria. We discovered up-regulation of
Parkin (Park2) in obese asthma airway epithelium. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates mitophagy by
degrading defective mitochondria. We further observed increased levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and
palmitic acid (PA) levels in obese asthma bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum samples. Moreover, type 2
cytokine IL-13, type 1 cytokine IFN-g and palmitic acid (PA, a saturated fatty acid increased in obese asthma)
increased airway epithelial Parkin levels. Parkin is essential to IL-13-mediated mtDNA release and airway
neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation in mice and in human airway epithelial cells. We hypothesize that
Parkin is up-regulated in obese asthma airways with dysfunctional mitochondria, which is amplified by
the type 1 or type 2 cytokine milieu, enhancing mitochondrial DNA release and exaggerating airway
inflammation. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms by which Parkin is up-regulated in obese asthma by
measuring Parkin, PA, mitophagy, type 1 and type 2 cytokines, and nitric oxide (NO), and performing human
airway epithelial cell and precision-cut lung slice cultures to determine if IFN-g, IL-13 and PA increase Parkin in
part by reducing transcriptional repressor THAP11. We then test if restoring NO bioavailability reduces Parkin
activity. In Aim 2, we will determine how Parkin enhances airway mtDNA release and neutrophilic inflammation.
By using Parkin, TLR9 and STAT1 knockout human airway epithelial culture and mouse models, we will test if
excessive Parkin in a type 1 cytokine setting of obese asthma promotes mtDNA release, and amplifies
neutrophilic inflammation through the TLR9/STAT1 signaling axis. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanisms
by which Parkin enhances airway eosinophilic inflammation. We will test if Parkin-mediated mtDNA release in a
type 2 cytokine setting amplifies STAT6 signaling and pro-eosinophilic cytokine (e.g. eotaxin) production.
Research findings from our proposed studies will likely provide several key targets (e.g. Parkin, TLR9) to treat
obese asthma, a heterogenous disease currently without specific therapies."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with blocking anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) have induced durable clinical responses in patients with solid tumors, including melanoma, non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and HPV+ cancers. However, the majority of cancer patients still fail to respond to
ICB, supporting the need to identify predictive biomarkers of response, and develop novel therapies to
overcome the mechanisms of resistance to ICB. Multiple studies have reported that a human beneficial gut
microbiome is associated with response to anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 mAbs in cancer patients. Strikingly, there
is limited concordance among species identified across different studies, which included small number of
patients and used different analytical approaches. In addition, the administration of certain gut commensals or
responder-derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) promotes efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 mAbs
in melanoma-bearing mice. Reintroduction of beneficial organisms and/or fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) from responding mice restores sensitivity to ICB in tumor-bearing mice. Responder-derived FMT
resensitized melanoma patients to anti-PD1 mAbs in two separate studies. In a first-in-human phase II study,
we reported that R-FMT provided clinical benefit primary refractory melanoma patients, induced rapid and
durable microbiota perturbation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the FMT-induced changes of the gut
microbiome in treated patients governed the observed immunological and metabolomic changes in the
periphery and at tumor sites. Our novel preliminary findings in melanoma support that baseline beneficial and
detrimental enterotypes predict clinical outcome and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in PD1-treated
melanoma. They also support the hypotheses that FMT exhibiting a beneficial enterotype may :1) improve
clinical outcome upon ICB, and 2) impede the occurrence of serious irAEs. Whether these findings in patients
with advanced melanoma are relevant to large cohorts of cancer patients with melanoma, NSCLC or HPV+
cancer in distinct geographic locations has not been determined yet. These important questions are addressed
in the present translational research proposal. This collaborative project in response to PAR 18-951 between
the University of Pittsburgh and the NCI will take advantage of the NIH Clinical Center's unique access to a
large cohort of patients with HPV+ cancers treated with cancer immunotherapy."
10898855,"The pharmaceutical industry is in a crisis; unfortunately the post-genomic era has not significantly changed
the number of proteins pursued by drug companies. This dearth of new cancer drug targets has resulted
in too many ‘me too’ drugs and wasted effort. To address this need, my lab has focused on developing
the new field of ‘Controlled Proteostasis’. Our initial efforts focused on inhibiting protein turnover; we
developed a novel proteasome inhibitor, YU101, which served as the basis of a new oncology-based
biopharma, Proteolix, Inc. from my lab. Ultimately, YU101 became carfilzomib/Kyprolis®, which was
approved by the FDA in 2012 for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. More recently, my lab has been
focused on the flipside of protein turnover, i.e., developing a small molecule analogy to siRNA to induce
protein knockdown. We have shown that this strategy, known as Proteolysis Targeting Chimerae
(PROTACs) can effectively recruit targeted oncoproteins to E3 ubiquitin ligases for induced degradation,
both in cell culture and in vivo. Over the past six years of the current R35, I have worked closely with
another biopharma that I founded, Arvinas, Inc., to apply this approach to nuclear hormone receptors in
oncology. Arvinas’ two PROTAC-based drug candidates (targeting AR and ER, for prostate and breast
cancers, respectively) have been shown to decrease their target proteins in first-in-human clinical trials,
thus validating our PROTAC technology. In the next R35 phase, I propose to develop this technology
further through the identification of key degradable oncogenic driver proteins and through the development
of tumor-selective PROTACs. Moreover, the clinical validation of PROTACs supports the development of
additional novel therapeutic modalities based on heterobifunctional compounds that co-opt various
intracellular machineries. These innovative approaches have the potential to be new drug development
paradigms that could have a significant impact by dramatically expanding the protein classes one can
target pharmaceutically. Finally, for the past 26 years, I have focused on translating research from my lab
into both new oncology-focused ventures and a FDA-approved drug, thus demonstrating truly ‘bench-to-
bedside’ research that is not common in academia today. This track record of innovation and execution
within translational cancer research are strong predictors of continued future success."

Aedes aegypti is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. The global incidence of
dengue has increased dramatically in recent decades. The first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia®, is
recommended for a very limited population. Current prevention depends mainly on effective vector control,
which is hindered by increasing insecticide-resistance. Novel genetic strategies for vector control are
actively explored, including both population suppression and population replacement. Recent field
releases of either transgenic and Wolbachia-infected sterile male mosquitoes show promising results for
suppressing Aedes populations in areas of modest size. Given the biological, geographical, economic
and cultural complexity facing global mosquito-borne infectious disease control programs, diverse
measures that can be integrated to address various challenges are urgently needed. Female to male sex
ratio distortion is an attractive concept for developing new control measures, as females are responsible
for disease transmission and population growth. Aedes and Culex mosquitoes contain homomorphic sex-
determining chromosomes and maleness is conferred by a dominant male-determining factor (M factor)
within an M locus that is on one of a pair of chromosome 1. Male-biased sex-ratio distortion occurs in
natural populations in Ae. aegypti, which is associated with m-chromosome breakage during meiosis at
a few sites. The Distorter locus is linked to the M-locus on the M-chromosome, conferring a meiotic drive
as it increases the probability of its own inheritance. We recently discovered the M factor, an RNA-binding
protein named Nix and identified the M and m locus in Ae. aegypti. By analysing male and female Illumina
reads across a few strains, we found a number of m-specific repeats that can be targeted for breakage
by CRISPR/cas9 during male meiosis, potentially leading to a male-biased sex ratio distortion. We will
pursue the following specific aims: 1) Systematically characterize components to develop m-shredders.
Research performed here will also improve our understanding of the male germline and the homomorphic
sex chromosomes and facilitate any future genetic manipulations involving the male germline. 2) Develop
m-shredder lines with various degrees of M-linkage to optimize effective population suppression. 3)
Model various applications of m-shredders in population suppression and transgene recall. In summary,
innovative technologies will be used to gain fundamental insights into male germline expression and the
differentiation of the homomorphic sex chromosomes of Ae. aegypti. m-shredders with various levels of
efficiency and transmissibility will be developed and modelled for population suppression and transgene
recall, expanding the tool box for integrated vector management.

The overarching goal of this award is to prepare the applicant for an independent, sustained program of
research that incorporates psychosocial, behavioral, and clinical concepts and methods to understand and
design interventions to guide clinical translation of uncertain and reclassified genomic variants. Variants of
uncertain significance (VUS) introduce uncertainty and can confuse clinical decision making for patients and
providers. VUS are also frequently reclassified, especially in racial/ethnic minority populations, and can inform
clinical decision making. However, insufficient evidence around the influences and outcomes of uncertain and
reclassified variants presents a challenge for more diffuse clinical translation of these genetic variants. Such
understanding is particularly important in clinical oncology, as identification of mutation carriers can
significantly alter cancer prevention, screening, surgery recommendations, and treatment. The K99 phase is
designed to augment the candidate's prior research experience though coursework, apprenticeships and
directed readings with specific training in: 1) clinical health informatics, 2) psychometrics and survey
methodology, and, 3) advanced qualitative methods. The proposed research will collect patient reported and
electronic medical record data from six healthcare systems that provide clinical genetic services to a
racially/ethnically diverse patient population. Aim 1 (K99 phase) surveys a national sample of oncology
providers to understand their practices related to variant reclassification and recontact. Aim 2 (K99 phase)
interviews patients to identify dimensions of reclassification associated psychosocial well-being. Aim 3 (R00
phase) uses data from aim 2 and existing literature to develop and pilot an instrument to measure genomic
uncertainty in patients. Aim 4 (R00 phase) evaluates the clinical utility of variant reclassification. This work will
generate evidence to inform institutional and professional practice around variant reclassification. Taken
together, the findings from this study will contextualize, and provide tools for a future longitudinal study to
determine the behavioral, psychosocial, and clinical consequences of receiving uncertain genetic test results.
This project is a critical building block for the applicant's long-term research goal to develop and test
interventions (at the levels of provider, patient and healthcare system) to facilitate the clinical translation of
genomics into diverse health systems and into underserved populations. The proposed award will provide
training, mentorship and research experience that will serve as the foundation for the applicant's career as an
independently funded clinical investigator dedicating to improving health outcomes in translational genomics
for underrepresented minority populations."

 Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and impactful public health problem, which can have severe
and lasting consequences for the mother and infant, and sometimes the entire family. The Reach Out, Stand
Strong, Essentials for New Mothers (ROSE) program is an evidence-based intervention that prevents half of
cases of postpartum depression and was one of two interventions recommended by the US Preventive
Services Task Force in 2019. All effectiveness trials of ROSE and of the other recommended PPD prevention
intervention included only low-income women a single risk factor that doubles incidence of PPD. Thus, the
existing evidence base for PPD prevention consists primarily of women at increased risk for PPD. Based on
data from the PIs’ current implementation study of ROSE (R01 MH114883), many healthcare and community
agencies in this implementation trial (78%) find it is more feasible for them to provide or offer ROSE to every
woman as part of their standard work flow (i.e., provide it as universal prevention), than it is to create a
screening and referral process for at risk women (i.e., an indicated or selective prevention approach). In
addition to being more feasible for agencies, universal prevention may also be advantageous because the cost
of a screening false negative (resulting in a preventable case of PPD; $32,000) far exceeds the cost of ROSE
delivery ($50-$300/woman). Effectiveness of ROSE among low-income women at risk for PPD is known
(ROSE prevents ~50% of PPD cases). To inform a recommendation about using ROSE as universal vs.
selective or indicated prevention, we need to determine the effectiveness of ROSE among general populations
of women, including women screening negative for PPD risk (defined in various ways). Thus, this project will
assess ROSE effectiveness across PPD risk levels and across prevention approaches in a sample of 2,320
women from a large regional health system (based in Detroit, MI). Each proposed aim gathers a piece of
information missing that is needed to guide decision-making about ROSE as universal prevention.
 We will assess ROSE as universal, selective, and indicated prevention in terms of: (1) ROSE effectiveness
relative to a control for each prevention approach in preventing PPD and improving functioning; (2) cost-
outcome, (3) equity, and (4) scalability of each prevention approach; and (5) mechanisms of ROSE effects
across PPD risk levels. We will integrate results to advise about ROSE as universal prevention. This definitive
PPD prevention trial will show how best to get an evidence-based program to those who need it in settings
where they receive perinatal care by addressing a pragmatic and novel question (should ROSE be universal
prevention?) and by examining equity and cost-outcome of universal vs. other prevention approaches."

 Optical recordings of activity are critical to probe neural systems because they provide high-resolution,
non-invasive measurements, ranging from single neurons to entire populations in intact nervous systems, and
are readily combined with genetic methods to provide cell type-specific recordings. Nevertheless, the limited
penetration depth, spatial scale and temporal resolution remain major challenges for optical imaging. Cellular-
resolution imaging in scattering brains is typically achieved with multiphoton microscopy (MPM). Because of the
nonlinear excitation process, the development of multiphoton imaging depends critically on ultrafast technologies,
particularly femtosecond sources. From the first demonstrations of second harmonic generation (SHG) and 2-
photon fluorescence (ruby laser), the first 2-photon imaging (mode-locked femtosecond laser), to the deepest 3-
photon imaging so far (long wavelength optical parametric amplifiers), advances in multiphoton imaging have
been largely propelled by the innovations in laser technologies. This research proposal aims to continue this
trend. We will develop and disseminate a new generation of ultrafast lasers and multiphoton imaging tools that
will enable deep, fast, and large-scale imaging of structure and function with cellular and subcellular resolution.
To approach the fundamental limits defined by the “photon budget”, we will develop an adaptive excitation source
(AES) at 1300 nm for deep tissue 3-photon microscopy (3PM). By feeding the structural information of the sample
to the laser source, the AES generates on-demand pulses only within regions of interest (ROIs) and transforms
a conventional multiphoton microscope into a “random-access” microscope for the ROIs. We will integrate the
AES with high speed scanners and optimize the photon budget and scanning systems. We will further test and
validate the performance of the new imaging technology in three proof-of-concept experiments in animal models.
The research involves close interactions between the PI (Chris Xu) and Co-investigators (Alex Kwan, Frank Wise,
Nilay Yapici, and Rafael Yuste). Furthermore, we will work with industry partners to explore commercialization
of the technology, which will provide a direct path to broad dissemination. The combination of 1300 nm AES and
3PM will transform our ability to image deep and fast and will have a broad impact on neuroscience where high-
resolution, high speed imaging deep within an intact brain is required. The team members are active proponents
of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in their institutions, and will integrate the goals of this research program
with advancing DEI."
10904861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological disorder affecting up to 10 million people worldwide with
symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity that severely limit the quality of life of patients. Deep brain
stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment used in patients who demonstrate symptoms that are inadequately
controlled by medications. This treatment involves the delivery of continuous high frequency stimulation to either
the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the globus pallidus interna (GPi), two modulatory nuclei in the basal ganglia
(BG). DBS improves motor symptoms acutely but does not differentiate between neuronal circuits, and its effects
decay rapidly when stimulation is turned off. The need for constant stimulation increases the risk of side effects
and the frequency of battery replacement. Hence the investigation of alternative patterns of stimulation that
produce long-lasting recovery is critical. Such stimulation paradigms could minimize adverse outcomes caused
by constant current delivery while also inducing therapeutic plasticity in the form of reversal of the aberrant
synchronous activity of the BG seen in PD patients. Since the cellular mechanism of action of DBS is unknown,
the clinical advances in identifying these patterns have been limited. Recent findings in the Gittis lab suggest
that optogenetically manipulating distinct neuronal subpopulations (specifically, activating PV neurons and
inhibiting Lhx6 neurons) in the external globus pallidus (GPe), a central nucleus of the BG, provides long-lasting
reduction in immobility in dopamine-depleted mice that show bradykinesia or akinesia at baseline. In an effort to
make this finding translatable, using insights from the synaptic features of these cell-types, we identified that
electrical stimulation delivered in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, rodent homolog of the GPi) as bursts can
produce the same cell-type modulation described above. Such a DBS protocol when tested in vivo produced
motor recovery that lasted for hours after stimulation was stopped. These findings could hugely impact the
standard of care for Parkinson’s disease patients that show a narrow therapeutic window, by maximizing their
therapeutic duration, minimizing side effects, and potentially altering their pathological circuitry. The goal of this
proposal is to demonstrate a clinically translatable optimized burst DBS protocol which can produce long-lasting
motor recovery by reversing the underlying pathological activity in the BG. In an effort to optimize burst DBS
from a translational standpoint, Aim 1 will establish the combination of stimulation frequency and duration
required to see prolonged therapeutic benefits. To potentially accelerate the translation to PD patients with DBS
implants in the STN, the effect of burst DBS in the STN will be compared to burst DBS in the EPN. Since patients
show motor vs. non-motor symptoms at varying stages of the disease, Aim 2 will characterize the behavioral
effects of burst DBS on symptoms at varying levels of dopamine depletion. Finally, in an effort to understand the
underlying mechanism of the long-lasting motor rescue, Aim 3 will evaluate whether burst DBS induces
therapeutic plasticity by attenuating the pathological firing of Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons."

Bone marrow aspirates are critical to the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of hematologic conditions and
cancers (e.g., leukemia, aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and metastasis of solid tumors), but 8-50% of
aspirations are unsuccessful due to operator technique, hemodilution, or underlying pathology. Because this
process is manual and error-prone, there is an opportunity to improve patient outcomes by providing real-time
and automated feedback on the sample quality. Cellia Science will enable improved quality and reliability of
bone marrow aspiration procedures by developing a point-of-care screening instrument. Our approach is
based on a recently developed label-free, deep-ultraviolet (UV) technique for cell imaging and analysis.
Preliminary data has shown that the spicules present in a bone marrow aspirate are easily identifiable by their
characteristic deep blue hue in the unstained pseudocolorized UV image—a result of strong light attenuation at
255nm by bone spicules. The resulting deep-UV images can be generated in under 3 minutes, making the
technique suitable for real-time use during aspiration procedures, and are nearly identical to the Giemsa-
stained slides, which take over 45 min to process. Label-free deep-UV imaging can be combined with machine
learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, which will enable automated quality assessment of
aspirate smears without a pathology technician. We will leverage this technology to develop a bone marrow
aspirate quality screening device for use during aspiration procedures. Towards this goal, we proposed in the
parent grant to quantify sensitivity and specificity of spicule detection by deep-UV microscopy and evaluate
concordance of deep-UV aspirate assessment with visual assessment by trained technician, with Giemsa-
stained samples serving as the ground truth. We also proposed the development of a prototype instrument for
automated spicule adequacy assessment to enable adoption of this technique without a specially trained
pathology technician. In this supplement, we propose to evaluate a single-step object detection approach for
spicule identification by creating a customized analysis pipeline based on the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once)
architecture. We will also perform customer discovery interviews to identify user needs and develop design
input specifications. Finally, we propose to perform further optimization of the optical train and user interface of
the instrument. Successful implementation of this device is expected to increase the fraction of successful
procedures, which will drastically improve the quality of care for the patient. The proposed work will also help
enhance the diversity of the research and entrepreneurial workforce through the support and training of an
early-stage investigator from an underrepresented group."

 This proposal describes a 5-year plan to achieve the candidate’s goal of becoming an independent physician-
scientist studying interactions between the airway epithelium and the type 2 immune system. With a
comprehensive plan of coursework and hands-on training, guided by a skilled scientific advisory and mentoring
team, and situated within the exceptional intellectual environment at UCSF, Dr. Kotas will utilize established,
specialized tools and techniques from her mentor’s lab and become newly proficient in primary airway epithelial
culture, translational studies using human tissues, and state-of-the-art transcriptional techniques. By the end of
this project, she will possess a unique toolset that will differentiate her from her mentor and will have sufficient
data to launch an independent research group while contributing new knowledge to the scientific community.
 The investigative purpose of this proposal is to elucidate how tuft cells—specialized epithelial cells with poorly
understood function—influence the behavior of nearby epithelial and immune cells during chronic type 2 airway
inflammation. As chronic allergic inflammation is the underlying cause of morbidity and mortality in millions of
patients with diseases such as nasal polyps and type 2 high asthma, an improved understanding of the cells and
molecules that contribute to these pathologies is needed to design new therapies. In preliminary data, Dr. Kotas
finds that tuft cells in the chronically allergic upper airway environment adopt a distinct “allergic” phenotype
characterized by increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This is concurrent with a transcriptional
signature of PGE2 on the neighboring epithelium, while in vitro, PGE2 stimulates epithelial fluid secretion.
Transcriptional signatures of allergic tuft cells and PGE2 activation are also observed in the bronchus in type 2
high asthmatics, suggesting similar pathology throughout the allergically-inflamed respiratory tract. These
findings urge further examination of tuft cells and tuft cell-derived PGE2 in allergic airway disease.
 In this proposal, Dr. Kotas will build upon her preliminary data to probe the effects of tuft cells and PGE2 on
airway homeostasis. Aim 1 will use mouse cells in vitro and whole animal modeling in vivo to examine tuft cell-
dependent alterations mucociliary movement and airway surface liquid composition. Aim 2 will examine the
effects of tuft cells and PGE2 on the type 2 immune system in mouse models of allergic airway disease. And
Aim 3 will return focus to human subjects and determine the phenotype and activation state of tuft cells in the
lower airway in type 2 high asthma. Together, the proposed experiments will improve our fundamental
understanding of how tuft cells contribute to allergic airway disease, and may identify new molecular and cellular
targets for future therapy."

 The primary objective of the proposed trial is to examine the feasibility of testing the effect of a
potent vitamin D analogue, paricalcitol, on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and imaging and liquid
biomarkers in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). If determined feasible, subsequent trials will be
developed that focus on the efficacy of paricalcitol in improving outcomes in CP. Tragically, pain has
the most important influence on diminished HRQoL and increased resource utilization in pancreatitis
patients. Development of clinical trials in CP patients to improve treatment options, attenuate symptoms,
and prevent exocrine function failure, diabetes and pancreatic cancer is widely considered an area of
enormous unmet need. There is a substantial body of preclinical evidence that potent vitamin D
analogues have significant and beneficial effects on both pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer by blocking
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) signaling and reducing pain.
 We hypothesize that paricalcitol treatment will improve symptoms, as measured by patient reported
HRQoL, and normalize imaging and liquid biomarkers of the pancreatic fibro-inflammatory process in
this high-risk patient population. Because surrogate biomarkers of response to therapeutics have not
been developed for CP, early trials such as this one are needed to assist with biomarker discovery for
future validation. We propose a pilot randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the
feasibility and safety of a 12-month paricalcitol intervention versus placebo administration. We will
collect measures of HRQoL, and changes in measures (imaging and liquid) of the fibro-inflammatory
response. We will randomize 24 CP patients 1:1 to paricalcitol vs placebo with a 21-month recruitment
period and a one-year follow-up period. Importantly, our efficient study design will enroll patients who
are participants in our ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study, PROCEED (PROspective
Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for EpidEmiologic and Translational StuDies), which is conducted
under the auspices of the US Consortium on Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer
(CPDPC). Nesting in the PROCEED study provides a well-defined clinical cohort of patients who are
under frequent medical surveillance allowing us to harmonize patient recruitment, collection of biological
specimens, and follow-up with routine clinical and research appointments and tests, ensuring high rates
of recruitment and retention. Feasibility will be met if the proportion of patients who enroll and complete
the 12 months of paricalcitol therapy is ≥75% of planned. Importantly, this trial will provide a platform
for study design and measurements needed for implementation of potential treatment agents for CP."

forms of diabetes, is not clear. Considering diabetes is a major health disparity in our country, understanding
AP-driven diabetes is needed in racially diverse populations. Additionally, the risk factors or the mechanisms
lead to AP driven diabetes is also unclear. Importantly, the gut microbiota is a novel factor linked to the genesis
of both T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet its role in AP driven diabetes is not known. Moreover, in our diverse
patient population, the compositional profiles of gut microbiota are not well defined. Our proposal leverages our
extensive, multiple institutional, cohort of patients which is predominantly African American (AA) and Hispanic
and our broad, multidiscplinary team with a range of expertise in clinical pancreatology and diabetes, gut
microbiome, diet and health disparities research. In sum, the goal of our proposal is three-fold: 1) to define in
our diverse patient population that is predominantly AA and Hispanic, the relationship between AP to T1D, and
other forms of diabetes, and the factors associated with development of diabetes, and to mechanistically define
2) how diet, specifically enriched in animal protein and fat (DH-APF), through its interaction with the gut
microbiota, impacts AP-driven diabetes, and 3) how fiber from the diet, through the generation of short chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), a recently recognized factor identified in the genesis of T1D and T2D, mediates AP-driven
T1D."

 Heavy and high-intensity alcohol use often results in negative outcomes such as blackouts, social
mistakes, increased vulnerability to alcohol use disorder, and long-term health problems. Social influences
have a seemingly paradoxical relationship with alcohol use, serving as a risk for alcohol misuse in some cases
(e.g., heavy alcohol use in peer group) and a protective factor in others (e.g., emotional support). Precisely
characterizing which aspects of social influence increase short and long-term risk for alcohol misuse
will be a vital step in defining more specific intervention targets. To that end, we propose to evaluate links
between social influences and alcohol misuse development across individuals (e.g., person-specific variation),
social contexts, and timescales (e.g., longitudinal and moment-to-moment). Data will be drawn from real-time
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from a cohort-accelerated longitudinal burst study of
psychopathology and alcohol use supplemented with rich social network interviews (i.e., PEARL study, PI:
Foster) and from a large, nationally representative longitudinal dataset of adolescents (i.e., Add Health). The
PEARL study uses EMA (smartphone surveys 3 times daily for at least 100 days) to measure reported
momentary and daily alcohol use (e.g., quantity, drunkenness) and social interactions (e.g., duration, quality,
type of engagement, and person with whom they interacted), among a larger battery of questionnaires.
Supplementary information will be gathered from a subset of participants (n=90) from the PEARL study to link
features observed in the social network (e.g., perceptions of long-term relationships with others and their
involvement in the target participant’s drinking) and their influence on momentary dynamics between alcohol
use and social interactions. Add Health (n=14,600) includes four waves of longitudinal assessments spanning
adolescence (i.e., age 12-17) through adulthood (i.e., 21-32). Using longitudinal, EMA, and social network
data, we will determine how social influences impact participant alcohol use across developmental
periods, social contexts, and person-to-person variation. We hypothesize that changes in social influences
(i.e., drinking peers, closeness with family and friends who drink) will predict changes in alcohol misuse (i.e.,
binge drinking, alcohol-related consequences) across development and in daily life. Results from this work will
inform future prevention efforts designed to reduce alcohol use using social support across development,
which aligns well with NIAAA’s mission. The proposed project will serve as the author’s primary line of
research supporting multiple manuscripts. Consequently, the NRSA award would ensure the student is
provided with a critical opportunity to build a career as an independent clinical scientist by establishing a
research record focused on social influences on alcohol misuse and to obtain training in advanced statistical
techniques and developmental psychopathology."

 Metabolism is essential for normal cellular function and dynamically changes to meet organism and tissue
needs. Cardiac function and metabolism are closely intertwined. Fatty acid oxidation serves as the primary
means to provide energy in normal conditions. In heart failure, cardiomyocytes lose this metabolic flexibility and
become more reliant on glycolysis. Despite extensive work to understand the metabolic underpinnings of heart
failure, more investigation is needed to dissect the underlying mechanisms of this disease.
 A class of metabolic diseases collectively known as inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) provide a window
into pathophysiology, including heart failure, due to their well-defined causes. Pathology arising from IEMs can
be tracked back to a single mutation, providing a direct and tractable method of studying the disease. Lipoic acid
deficiencies are a novel class of IEMs that cause metabolic decompensation, severe neurodevelopmental
delays, and early death. Lipoyltransferase-1 (LIPT1) catalyzes the final step in de novo lipoic acid synthesis by
transferring the lipoate moiety to 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH).
 The Genetic and Metabolic Disease Program (GMDP) at UT southwestern has unique access to patient
samples and clinical data. A LIPT1 deficient patient presented with neurodevelopmental delays and numerous
unexpected metabolic phenotypes, including elevated serum 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a metabolite with wide
ranging impacts on cell signaling and epigenetic regulation. The patient also displayed altered cardiac function,
including impaired systolic function and tachycardia secondary to atrial fibrillation, worsened by acute episodes
of metabolic decompensation. We intend to characterize the underlying causes of cardiometabolic distress using
novel mice to model cardiac LIPT1 deficiency. Mice lacking LIPT1 in the heart die within 6-7 weeks with severe
systolic dysfunction and elevated levels of 2HG. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that LIPT1
deficiency pathologically limits cardiometabolic flexibility leading to deleterious metabolite
accumulation, including 2HG, and impaired cardiac development and function.
 If successful, this proposal will generate a definitive assessment of cardiac LIPT1 deficiency in mice
providing a detailed understanding of the metabolic consequences of this specific IEM. More broadly, this
proposal will increase our understanding of the consequences of limited metabolic flexibility in cardiac tissue, a
hallmark of heart failure. The appropriate usage of both patient data and mouse models will increase the disease
relevance of the work discussed in this proposal."
10904476,"Somatic variants that arise during embryonic corticogenesis and result in brain mosaicism are increasingly
recognized as significant contributors to the genetic risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions.
The discovery of disease-causing somatic variants in the brain has not only contributed to the identification of
novel genes and refined our understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of a range of neuropsychiatric
diseases, but they also provide powerful research tools that can be used to understand how cell-type-specific
changes contribute to disease pathophysiology. In this study, we seek to use single-cell genomic approaches in
mosaic human brain tissue to establish which cell types harbor the disease-causing somatic variants and to
determine cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes associated with the variant. While single-cell genomics
approaches have been used to inform many novel aspects of pathophysiology across a range of diseases, no
studies to our knowledge consider genotype and use deep single-cell RNA sequencing to study variant-
associated transcriptomic changes in specific cell types from mosaic human brain tissue. Here, we propose to
perform a proof-of-concept study to establish the extent to which genotype-informed comprehensive single-cell
RNA sequencing of mosaic human brain tissue is reproducible and can inform novel aspects of disease
pathophysiology. We will accomplish this goal using hemimegalencephaly, a severe brain malformation causing
overgrowth of one cerebral hemisphere that is caused by a single highly penetrant, brain tissue-specific somatic
variant in either AKT3, MTOR, or PIK3CA, as our prototype. We will isolate both DNA and RNA from single nuclei
from therapeutically resected mosaic brain tissue of each individual, genotype the DNA to classify each isolated
cell as variant-positive or variant-negative, and then perform RNA sequencing to determine cell-type-specific
variant burden and define the transcriptomic changes associated with the variant in specific cell types. We will
analyze three individuals with genetically diagnosed hemimegalencephaly caused by the same pathogenic
somatic variant for each of the three known disease genes to allow for comparisons across individuals and
genes. Comparisons of variant-positive to variant-negative cells in hemimegalencephaly cases, along with
variant-negative cells from age-matched neurotypical control brain tissue, within like cell types, will allow us to
identify cell type-specific cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptomic changes associated with the
variant. We hypothesize that these studies will reveal reproducible convergent and divergent cell-type-specific
disease mechanisms across individuals with the same pathogenic variants and across genes implicated in the
same brain malformation. If successful, we will establish a powerful research approach that leverages somatic
mosaicism to inform cell types involved in disease, identify pathophysiologically relevant specific cell-type
specific transcriptomic changes involved in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, and illuminate novel
therapeutic strategies in hemimegalencephaly and related conditions."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant public health problem with opioid-associated overdoses and deaths
reaching epidemic levels in recent years. Methadone and buprenorphine are widely used and generally effective
medications for OUD (MOUDs). However, relapse and nonadherence rates remain high and average treatment
retention is suboptimal (e.g., <6 months in 30-50% of cases). As risk of overdose is highest following relapse
and treatment dropout, improved mechanistic understanding of risk and resilience factors in individuals in early
MOUD (i.e., <6 months) is urgently needed. This application uses network-based analysis, with built-in cross-
validation, to identify brain networks associated with (i) patterns of illicit opioid use during early MOUD and (ii)
medication adherence during early MOUD in a diverse sample of individuals (N=240, 50% female, 50% male,
50% receiving methadone, 50% receiving buprenorphine). This is critical to improve understanding of
mechanisms and predictors of MOUD response and is an essential precursor to development of improved,
evidence-based interventions grounded in known neurobiology. This work builds on our prior work identifying
brain connections prospectively associated with future relapse to illicit opioids during sustained MOUD. The
identified ‘opioid abstinence network’ included connections between frontoparietal, salience, sensorimotor and
default mode regions and was robust to analyses controlling for relevant clinical variables (e.g., MOUD dose,
years of opioid use). In AIM 1, we seek to externally validate and extend this finding via collection of
neuroimaging data from a larger, more diverse sample of individuals early in MOUD treatment. In AIM 2, we
propose to collect additional, multi-task neuroimaging data to determine the impact of different, task-induced
brain states on network identification. Finally, in AIM 3, we will use our recently developed approach, in which
variation in model accuracies are assessed as a function of core sources of clinical diveristy (e.g., sex,
medication dose, co-occurring disorders), to identify sources of model bias and neurobiological heterogeneity.
Assessing sources of model bias and neurobiological heterogeneity embraces the clinical complexity that is
inherent to the current opioid epidemic. These clinical sources of variance have typically either been excluded
for or ignored (e.g., treated as covariates of no interest) in prior neuroimaging studies of MOUD. All acquired
data will be shared via the NIMH Data Archive."

Abnormalities in cardiac structure and function, such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and reduced ejection
fraction (EF), are associated with increased risk of heart failure (HF) and other cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. Echocardiography provides an in-depth and low-cost assessment of multiple aspects of cardiac
structure and function. Both clinical and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that African Americans are
at higher risk for hypertensive related cardiac abnormalities than Whites; however, there have been no
population-based studies to assess cardiac structure and function in African Caribbeans. Risk factors for
cardiac dysfunction, such as hypertension and obesity, are more common in African Caribbeans than African
Americans, suggesting that African Caribbeans may have even greater cardiac dysfunction than African
Americans. Over the past 20 years, we have been studying population-based cohorts of African Caribbean
men and women from Tobago in whom we have extensive measures of medical history, blood pressure,
subclinical cardiovascular measures, adiposity distribution, and biospecimens. We noted an exceptionally high
rate of uncontrolled hypertension and elevated blood pressure in Tobago men and women, which puts them at
high-risk for further CVD comorbidities. We have strong evidence that these participants have a high burden of
non-atherosclerotic vascular disease; however, to this point, we have not assessed cardiac muscle health,
which is a major limitation in comparing them to African American or White U.S. epidemiologic cohorts.
Therefore, we propose to expand our cardiovascular research in Tobago by performing an echocardiography
exam in participants aged 50 and older from the Tobago Men’s Study and the Tobago Women’s Study (N=500
each, 1000 total: The Tobago Heart Study [THS]), in order to describe the burden of and identify risk factors for
cardiac dysfunction and structural abnormalities in African Caribbeans. Specifically, we aim to 1) characterize
and describe the cardiac structure and function of the THS; 2) use the wealth of existing data in the Tobago
Men and Women’s Studies to identify traditional and unique correlates of cardiac structure and function in
African Caribbeans, including measures of demography, medical history, behaviors/lifestyle, adiposity
distribution, and subclinical cardiovascular disease; and 3) comprehensively assay circulating cardiac
biomarkers to identify which facets of cardiac biology are most strongly associated with cardiac structure and
function measures in African Caribbeans. Completion of these Specific Aims will provide the first assessment
of cardiac structure and function in African Caribbean men and women, add to the existing cardiovascular
assessments in the Tobago studies, and allow for future comparison to U.S.-based CVD cohorts that include
African Americans. Importantly, this will yield unique insight into the underlying biologic process(es) associated
with cardiac structure and function in Tobago, which can be harnessed in future efforts to improve prediction,
prevention, and treatment of cardiac disease in these high-risk individuals."
10902596,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While cocaine use disorder (CUD) is often studied in the context of dysregulated drug taking, less often studied
is how chronic drug use alters the processing of non-drug stimuli within the brain. One prominent example is
the fact that individuals suffering from CUD have deficits in responding to aversive stimuli. It is hypothesized
that these deficits influence a range of behaviors and render these individuals insensitive to negative
consequences associated with specific actions. Importantly, these deficits in stimulus processing are
associated with worse treatment outcomes in individuals suffering from CUD. Thus, understanding how drug
use alters the neural encoding of non-drug, aversive stimuli is critical to better treating individuals with CUD.
 At the center of drug-induced neural dysfunction is the mesolimbic dopamine system. Importantly, the
ability of aversive stimuli to evoke dopamine release is the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is necessary for
both conditioned and unconditioned aversive stimulus responses. Importantly, a hallmark of prolonged cocaine
use in both human and animal models is deficits in both basal and aversive stimulus-evoked dopamine
release. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to understand how dopamine release regulates the cellular
responses of genetically-defined cell types in the NAc and define how this relationship is disrupted by
cocaine use.
 The first aim seeks to define the temporal parameters under which dopamine release modulates the
activity of D1 or D2-containing MSN populations in the NAc, at baseline and in response to an aversive
stimulus. Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter that does not induce action potential firing on its own, but
rather acts to modulate the activity patterns of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that are characterized by their
expression of D1 and D2 type dopamine receptors. While nearly all of our understanding of this relationship
has been defined in acute slice preparations, here we will employ single-cell calcium imaging with
simultaneous optogenetic manipulation of dopamine terminals in behaving animals to establish the precise
temporal conditions during which dopamine modulates MSN activity at baseline and in response to a range of
aversive stimuli (aim 1). Next, I will establish how cocaine self-administration disrupts the capacity for
dopamine to modulate MSN activity during aversive stimulus processing (aim 2). The present proposal will
provide training in integrating traditional addiction models (self-administration) with cutting-edge
microdendoscopic tools, which I intend to employ towards defining how drug-induced dysfunction in the brain
gives rise to phenotypes associated with CUD."
10902942,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, claiming more than
3 million deaths globally (Liangpunsakul, Haber et al. 2016). The pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury is
characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer
(Gao and Bataller 2011, Williams, Manley et al. 2014, Nagy, Ding et al. 2016). Despite major progress in
understanding mechanisms for ALD, no successful treatment is available. Cells can adapt and protect
themselves in response to stress by activating cellular protective mechanisms such as autophagy, a cellular
catabolic process that degrades cellular proteins and subcellular organelles. Additional protective mechanisms
that are activated due to stress, such as the unfolded protein (UPR) and integrated stress (ISR) responses aid
in eliminating stress affecting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Autophagy and ER stress are tightly integrated
as ER stress can activate autophagy to regulate ER homeostasis and relieve ER stress. Our lab has been
studying autophagy in ALD and our previous work shows that alcohol consumption impairs hepatic autophagy
resulting in ALD. We demonstrated that alcohol activates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) and impairs transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Aging is
a well-known risk factor associated with ALD. Alcohol consumption has increased in age groups older than 60
leading to an increased susceptibility to developing ALD in these groups. There is a lack of research that
focuses on alcohol consumption in older adults as the mechanisms by which alcohol and aging cooperatively
contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD in this age group remain incompletely understood. It is known that
autophagy and lysosomal functions decline with aging as well. Increased stress and impairment to the ER are
associated with chronic alcohol consumption as well as aging. My preliminary data showed impaired hepatic
TFEB function in aged mice, which is associated with altered mitochondria metabolic changes, hepatic
inflammation, and activated ER stress response systems in alcohol-fed aged mouse livers. However, how
autophagy and ER stress as well as aging regulate liver metabolism and contribute to ALD in aging population
is unknown. The overall goal of this project is to identify and understand the mechanisms in which aging and
alcohol consumption cooperatively contribute to the overall decline in liver function and the subsequent
development of ALD."
10902943,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB play essential roles in the central
regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, mice with BDNF depletion throughout the brain
(BDNF2L/2LCk-cre) are hyperphagic and severely obese and exhibit metabolic disturbances, including insulin
resistance and hyperglycemia. These findings have significant clinical implications as the BdnfVal66Met
variant, which interferes with BDNF signaling, is highly prevalent among the human population. Energy and
glucose balance control results from coordinated appetitive and physiological responses to nutrient and
hormonal signals informing the caloric status of the animal. Complex neural networks, including those
involving the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), are critical in orchestrating these responses. It is now
recognized that feeding circuits are not hardwired but highly plastic and remodel in response to caloric status
signals to meet the energy demands of the animal. Our recent studies indicate that this plasticity takes place
in the adult VMH, resulting in increased excitatory tone onto and activity of anorexigenic VMH neurons in the
fed state. Notably, this plasticity is absent in BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice, which always exhibit a fasted-like pattern of
diminished excitatory drive in the VMH independently of feeding status. This exploratory project seeks to test
the hypothesis that BDNF facilitates synaptic plasticity in metabolic circuits in the VMH via regulation of
perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs consist of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins surrounding the cell
bodies, dendrites and axon initial segments of selected neuronal subpopulations in the brain. Although their
understanding is limited, they are thought to limit synaptic plasticity by stabilizing synapses and impeding
access of new afferents to post synaptic sites. Our pilot data suggest that density of PNNs-like structures in
the VMH is increased in mice with depletion of central BDNF. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling in VMH of
BDNF2L/2LCk-cre mice indicates altered expression of several genes known to regulate the structure and
degradation of PNNs. To follow up on these findings, we will test the idea that BDNF negatively regulates
PNNs to facilitate synaptic plasticity, rewiring of excitatory inputs onto VMH neurons, and energy and glucose
balance control."
10903136,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign emphasizes the critical need to provide sepsis survivors
with patient education tailored to their self-care management after hospital discharge. This includes education
on their diagnosis, treatment, infection prevention and early recognition, timely treatment of infection, and post-
sepsis syndrome management. Many sepsis survivors are unaware of their diagnosis nor its implications for
post-discharge self-care, leading to knowledge deficits contributing to delayed follow-up care, poor health
outcomes, and frequent rehospitalizations. Sepsis survivors often experience long-term morbidity symptoms and
are twice as likely to be rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge compared to the general in-patient population.
Most of these rehospitalizations are due to new or recurring sepsis or infection and are considered preventable
with early post-discharge self-care. By providing high-quality sepsis patient education, nurses can empower
sepsis survivors to increase symptom monitoring, recognition, and early intervention to prevent poor health
outcomes. However, research on sepsis patient education interventions is limited and significant knowledge gaps
have yet to be addressed. For instance, it is necessary to understand how sepsis survivors’ perception of their
sepsis patient education quality relates to several education and health outcome indicators to inform future
individualized and high-quality interventions. Nurses are primarily responsible for delivering patient education
but often experience inadequate staffing and time constraints. This results in patient education being missed or
deprioritized. Thus, nurses may need to prioritize delivering high-quality patient education to those likely to have
poorer health outcomes, such as those with low health literacy and/or a higher comorbidity burden. Exploratory
research is needed to support this investiture. By addressing these knowledge gaps, my study will form the
foundation for future high-quality sepsis patient education interventions dedicated to improving sepsis survivor
outcomes. The specific aims are 1.) Determine the relationship between sepsis patient perception of education
quality compared to their self-care knowledge and self-care self-efficacy, 2.) Examine the relationship between
self-care knowledge (predictor), self-care self-efficacy (predictor), perception of patient education quality
(predictor), and 30-day rehospitalization (outcome), and 3.) Explore whether sepsis survivors’ perception of their
education quality on 30-day rehospitalization is contingent on health literacy and comorbidities levels. As a
training mechanism, this fellowship provides opportunities to enhance knowledge on current patient education
interventions, develop content expertise on sepsis survivor health outcomes, apply rigorous primary data
collection and statistical methodologies, and professional development towards developing my own program of
research. This study addresses the NINR mission “to lead nursing research to solve pressing health challenges
and inform practice and policy-optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future” through addressing
1.) Prevention and Health Promotion, 2.) Systems and Models of Care, and 3.) Health Equity."
10929560,"ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a powerful and innovative mode of cancer therapy, believed to be
partially responsible for the largest single-year drop in cancer mortality from 2016 to 2017. Their use has
increased dramatically over the past 3 years. However, little data has been collected about ICI treatment
response among patients of African ancestry (AA). In addition, little is known about the toxicities,
treatment patterns, long-term outcomes, and post-treatment quality of life associated with ICIs outside
the clinical trials setting. A prospective cohort study with a focus on racial differences between AA patients
and patients of European ancestry (EA) in community oncology settings could address these knowledge gaps.
Focusing on racial differences in ICI impact is important for three reasons. First, at the population level, AA
patients are more likely than EA patients to have advanced cancers, an important disease group ICIs are
intended to treat. Second, due to racial differences in host immunity, AA individuals tend to have a stronger
pro-inflammatory response than EAs. This could lead to a higher risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs)
while on ICIs. Third, as a result of immune differences, AA patients who manage irAEs and continue ICI
treatment may be more likely to benefit than EA patients. However, AA populations may experience multiple
barriers while accessing healthcare (e.g., discrimination, financial toxicity) that may lead to discontinuing ICIs.
We have a unique opportunity to assess the treatment, disease, individual, lifestyle, and quality of life factors
that contribute to differential experiences of AA patients on ICIs, by accruing a prospective cohort through the
nationwide NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) network. We will include all patients
receiving anti-PD-1/-L1 therapy regardless of cancer site and enroll a total of 600 AA and 1,200 EA patients,
with 1:2 match of AA to EA patients on cancer type within NCORP site. Our Specific Aims are:
1. To examine racial differences and predictors of irAEs, comparing AA and EA patients on incidence and
 severity of irAEs and assessing disease, individual, and lifestyle factors as predictors of these differences.
2. To examine treatment delay and discontinuation between AA and EA patients and assess racial
 differences in irAEs, healthcare barriers, and other factors as potential causes of treatment interruptions.
3. To examine short- and long-term treatment outcomes, comparing AA and EA patients on objective
 response rate (ORR), recurrence, death, and HRQOL after ICIs, and assessing treatment, disease,
 individual, and lifestyle factors as predictors of patient outcomes and potential causes of racial differences.
We envision this to be the first large cohort study of diverse AA and EA patients treated with ICIs. We will gain
valuable knowledge of the usage, effects, and challenges of ICIs in community oncology settings. Our findings
may inform use of ICIs, management of irAEs and reduction of healthcare barriers across populations."

I am an environmental epidemiologist and microbiome researcher with a primary research interest in the role of
the human microbiome between environmental exposures and human health, including neurological outcomes.
The goal of this proposal is to obtain training and acquire the skills needed to continue to build my academic
research career by linking early life metal exposure, the gut microbiome and metabolome in childhood, and
neurodevelopmental measures of attention.
 For this proposal, I plan to train with an expert team of mentors, collaborators, and advisors with
transdisciplinary expertise in exposomics, exposure biology, neurodevelopment, biostatistics, metabolomics,
epidemiology, and microbiome research. The proposed training plan includes clinical and laboratory rotations,
coursework, seminars and meetings, conferences, and 1-on-1 tutorials with mentors and advisors, covering
research and career development topics. This training will provide skills and knowledge in the areas of
neurodevelopment, and exposomics, including exposure biology and multi-omics analysis. Upon completion of
this training plan, I will be able to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent researcher
focused on the inter-relationships among environmental exposures, the microbiome, and neurodevelopment.
To that end, I propose leveraging the use of the established Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth,
Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) birth cohort, based in Mexico City, and adding microbiome
analysis. Specifically, I will: 1) train with Dr. Arora in exposure biology and analysis of baby teeth as a
biomarker of early life metal exposure; 2) train with Dr. Wright, in collaboration with Dr. Shamesh, in
neurodevelopmental assessment, principals of neurotoxicology, and their use in epidemiologic studies; 3) train
with Dr. Faith in metagenomic analysis, 4) integrate biostatistical assessment of mixtures and high dimensional
data, guided by Dr. Gennings; 4) learn about stool metabolomic analysis methodology with Dr. Walker; 5) work
with Dr. Tellez-Rojo to facilitate stool sample collection and data analysis in PROGRESS. I will use these
training and research activities to integrate the microbiome into an exposomic analysis of neurodevelopment. I
will use the research and career development training I receive to establish myself as an independent
investigator with a tenure track faculty position, able to secure R01 funding.
 This research proposal combines innovative measures of exposure, novel data analysis approaches,
and high resolution omics analysis to address gaps in the understanding of timing and potential mechanisms
by which metal exposures, and the gut microbiome and metabolome, are associated with neurodevelopmental
measures of attention. The proposed research and training plan builds the foundation for an independent
research career that aims to clarify the links between environmental exposures and neurodevelopment, via the
human microbiome."

The goal of this proposal is to validate glycated CD59 (GCD59) in human urine as a novel diabetes
biomarker. The validation of urine GCD59 as a diabetes biomarker will be conducted across several
hyperglycemic conditions including pregnancy-induced glucose intolerance/gestational diabetes. The proposal
is highly translational and addresses major Public Health priorities because: 1) women with pregnancy-
induced glucose intolerance and their fetus are at an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes and perinatal
complications, 2) the frequency of pregnancy-induced glucose intolerance is increasing at alarming rates, 3)
appropriate treatment reduces the associated risks for the mother and newborn, and 4) glucose load tests,
currently the gold standard identifying pregnancy-induced glucose intolerance, are expensive, time consuming,
non-physiologic and unpleasant, have poor reproducibility on repeat testing. These facts highlight why
there is agreement that a simpler, shorter, easier-to-use, cost-effective, sensitive and specific test would be a
much better tool to screen for pregnancy-induced glucose intolerance. Similar considerations apply to the
general field diabetes in the general population, whose frequency is also increasing at alarming, almost
epidemic, rates.
The applicants have 1) discovered that human CD59 is inactivated by glycation, 2) provided evidence for a
link between the complement system and the pathogenesis of the complications of diabetes, and 3)
developed key reagents and established specific and sensitive assays that allows quantification of GCD59
in blood. With this assay, we have conducted several published studies including ≈4,000 subjects with
diabetes, pre-diabetes or gestational diabetes. Based on the robust preliminary data from these studies and
available resources, we now propose the highly focused aim of assessing the clinical utility of urine GCD59
as a simple, easy-to-use test for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes.
All necessary tools and expertise to accomplish our aims are available in the laboratory of the applicant and
expert collaborators, including monoclonal antibodies specific for GCD59 and assay calibrators, access to
urine and plasma samples from a large and diverse population of individuals seeking medical care at
the two main Partner’s Healthcare Hospitals, diagnostic tools, equipment and expertise necessary to
conduct all studies proposed in the application.
Successful accomplishment of our aim will provide a clinically useful and independent biomarker that could
simplify the screening, diagnosis and management of conditions characterized by hyperglycemia."
10883604,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteosarcoma is an aggressive malignancy of the bone that effects children and young adults. The current
treatment standard for osteosarcoma utilizes the same chemotherapy that has been used for 30 years and
outcomes have remained unchanged. Efforts to improve therapy for this disease with novel agents and treatment
intensification have been largely unsuccessful. One potential reason for this is the lack of reliable prognostic
biomarkers for this disease. As a result, most new candidate treatment approaches are tested in patients with
relapsed or metastatic disease, excluding patients with newly diagnosed localized disease who may be at high-
risk of treatment failure.
Despite intensive research efforts to understand the biology of osteosarcoma, most studies have been
underpowered to correlate recurrent genomic features at diagnosis with clinical outcomes. Patterns of tumor
evolution that give rise to relapse have remained unstudied. Serial tumor biopsy samples for research are
unavailable for evolutionary studies due to the safety concerns associated with anesthesia and surgery in
children. Therefore, little is known about the genomic features of osteosarcoma that give rise to relapse.
Newly available liquid biopsy technologies enable the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of
patients with cancer. In some malignancies, ctDNA levels correlate with prognosis and changes in ctDNA levels
correspond to disease response and progression. In this project, a large collection of blood samples from patients
with osteosarcoma will be used to study the correlation between ctDNA levels and outcomes in newly diagnosed
localized osteosarcoma and validate ctDNA as a new prognostic biomarker.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can also be isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with osteosarcoma and
provides an alternative source of tumor cells for profiling when tumor samples are not available. In this study,
CTCs from patients with osteosarcoma will be captured for single-cell profiling of tumor cells. Together with deep
sequencing of ctDNA, serial samples will be used to identify recurrent patterns of tumor heterogeneity and
disease evolution in osteosarcoma. These studies will fundamentally broaden the understanding of the
osteosarcoma genome, the natural history of the disease, and validate novel biomarkers of outcome that could

plasticity, is essential for experience-dependent adjustments of brain function. A widely expressed mechanism
of synaptic plasticity in the CNS involves long-term changes in neurotransmitter release. Dysregulation of
presynaptic plasticity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of neuropsychiatric conditions,
including cognitive disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual developmental disabilities, mood
disorders, schizophrenia, epilepsy and drug addiction. Despite significant advancements in the molecular basis
of neurotransmission, exactly how transmitter release is modified in a long-term manner remains largely
unknown. Here, we hypothesize that local presynaptic translation is a highly regulated, activity-dependent
process that mediates functional and structural presynaptic plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses
in the mature mammalian brain. To test our hypothesis we will utilize a number of complementary approaches
that specifically target the presynaptic neuron. As a model system, we will focus on rodent hippocampal synapses
that express mechanistically similar forms of presynaptic plasticity. We seek to determine the identity of
presynaptic mRNAs that undergo translation and demonstrate their presence in axons, as well as visualize local
protein synthesis in axon terminals (Aim 1). In addition, we will determine the requirements and main properties of
activity-dependent presynaptic remodeling implicated in long-term presynaptic plasticity, including the translational
pathways involved and the role of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Aim 2). Though mRNA transcripts can be found in
axons, how their translation is controlled remains poorly understood. We will test the hypothesis that presynaptic
FMRP regulates both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity presumably by controlling local presynaptic
protein synthesis (Aim 3). Lastly, we will visualize and characterize BDNF release from axon terminals and test the
hypothesis that BDNF/TrkB signaling mediates structural and functional plasticity and promotes local protein
synthesis in axons. Successful completion of these aims will likely provide substantial insights and may establish
general principles into the mechanisms underlying presynaptic plasticity and its dysregulation in brain disorders."
10883756,"Pathogenic variants in the gene SCN3A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel subunit
Nav1 .3, cause SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-NDD), a recently identified condition
defined by treatment-resistant epilepsy, severe to profound intellectual disability (ID), and, surprisingly,
malformation of cortical development (MCD; abnormal structural development of the cerebral cortex). There is
no known role for Na+ channels in structural brain development nor any basis for brain malformation caused
by Na+ channel variants, and it remains unclear how genetic variants in SCN3A lead to MCD, epilepsy, and/or
ID. This proposal seeks to define the mechanistic underpinnings of this poorly understood disorder in order to
define the normal physiological role of Nav1 .3 and to inform therapeutic discovery or preventative measures for
SCN3A-NDD, a devastating disease which currently has no treatment or cure.
The prominence of MCD among our uniquely large patient cohort combined with known high embryonic
expression of SCN3A in the brain motivates my central hypothesis that pathogenic variants in SCN3A cause
epilepsy and MCD in SCN3A-NDD by producing pathological Na+ currents in developing cortical neurons
leading to perturbed excitability and altered neuronal migration. Proposed experiments will functionally assess
specific patient variants in SCN3A in our cohort and establish the relationship between individual genetic
variant, channel dysfunction, neuronal excitability, structural development, and clinical presentation. Aim 1 will
ascertain the link between genetic variation in SCN3A and Na+ channel dysfunction by determining the
biophysical properties of wild-type versus variant Nav1 .3 in a transiently transfected (HEK-293T) cell system.
Aim 2 will assess how altered channel activity impacts neuronal electrical excitability, anatomy, and maturation
via generation of human excitatory cortical neurons derived from control or SCN3A variant-expressing induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. A novel Nav1 .3-selective compound PF-6651385 will be employed to
determine potential to pharmacologically correct dysfunction at the level of the channel (Aim 1) and/or neuron
(Aim 2).
This proposal using advanced model systems to interrogate pathogenic mechanisms of SCN3A-NDD will
advance my training towards a career in translational neuroscience while providing novel insight into a
potentially fundamental role for a Na+ channel in brain development and elucidating pathomechanisms
underlying SCN3A-NDD to progress towards targeted therapies for patients suffering from this disorder."
10883765,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this Summer Research Training Program is to identify and facilitate the career progression
of veterinary students who have the ability and motivation to become a veterinarian scientist. The
veterinary perspective has high value in biomedical research and there is a relative shortage of
veterinarian scientists. Stimulating greater interest in research careers among veterinary students is
key to filling these needs. It is also critically important to ensure that students who are already
determined to pursue a veterinarian-scientist career have experiences that promote their goals. Short-
term research training programs, such as the one described in this proposal, are one means of
accomplishing these objectives. The focus of this training program is translational biomedical research,
broadly encompassing the research areas of infectious diseases, reproductive biology, epidemiology,
neuroscience, oncology, toxicology, nutrition, and behavior. The program faculty includes 40 mentors
from 12 different academic departments in 4 colleges. The program is 10 weeks in length and is open
to veterinary students who have completed either one or two years in the professional curriculum. Ten
trainee positions are available each program year. Trainees are matched with a faculty mentor who
shares similar research interests. In collaboration with the faculty mentor, trainees formulate a testable
hypothesis, design the experiments, collect and analyze the experimental data, and report the
conclusions. Reporting of results includes authoring an abstract that is submitted to a national meeting,
preparing a poster presentation of the work, and writing a short manuscript formatted for a scientific
journal appropriate for publishing the results. Extensive instruction in the Responsible Conduct of
Research is provided through orientation week activities and a seminar series. The seminar series also
features presentations that highlight career opportunities available to veterinarian scientists, as does a
field trip to companies that hire veterinarian scientists. Scientific writing sessions are provided to assist
trainees with preparation of the abstract, poster, and manuscript. At the conclusion of the program,
trainees present their work at an in-house poster session and at the National Veterinary Scholars
Symposium. Follow-up engagement over the course of the student’s DVM training and beyond provides
support and mentoring to continue to develop research experience and the potential to pursue a
veterinarian-scientist career."
10879261,"The underdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) has significant
consequences, including missed intervention opportunities, increased healthcare costs, and an
underestimation of the disease burden. In addition, current studies relying on diagnoses and medications for
defining cognitive impairment (CI) in electronic health records (EHR) are limited by biases and inaccuracies in
these data. To address this critical need for accurate identification of cognitive impairment in EHR, this study
proposes the development and evaluation of a deep learning algorithm that utilizes EHR data from three large
healthcare institutions: Mass General Brigham (MGB), University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA).
 We seek to leverage the wealth of information in EHR including clinical notes, patient health history,
and health system interactions that often contain signs of cognitive decline. Deep learning algorithms can
leverage and learn from these complex text and data patterns in EHR. In this proposal, we aim to develop and
evaluate a deep learning algorithm, Decipher-AI, to improve the detection of CI due to underlying ADRD
pathophysiology (including cognitive concerns, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia). Decipher-AI is a two-
level hierarchical model consisting of a note-level natural language processing (NLP) model that predicts the
probability of CI for a clinical note and a patient-level model that combines structured data and aggregated
NLP outputs to predict the probability of CI for a patient. For training and evaluation, we will use a “seed”
reference standard set with detailed chart review and adjudication of cognitive diagnosis by an expert clinician
(n=1,000), and then apply active learning strategies to iteratively increase sample size to n=20,000
(oversampling to include 50% from minority populations). Specifically, the study aims to develop Decipher-AI
for identifying any indicators of cognitive impairment and detect ADRD subtypes (Aim 1); validate its
performance at two other healthcare institutions (Aim 2); and examine biases and differences in predictors of
CI across race/ethnic, sex, and socio-economic subgroups (Aim 3).
 While previous research has demonstrated success in identifying cognitive dysfunction in patients
without dementia diagnoses or medication, further efforts are required to build inclusive reference datasets,
integrate structured and unstructured data, and evaluate the algorithm in diverse healthcare settings across
multiple institutions. Cutting-edge deep learning algorithms have been applied to many real-world tasks but in a
limited manner to ADRD. We anticipate that our state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm will more efficiently
and accurately detect signs of CI, and after validation be deployed in primary care to screen for patients with
undiagnosed cognitive impairment. In addition, improved screening of cognitive impairment in EHR will
enhance dementia research studies and enable large-scale pragmatic trials."
10884182,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Recent studies by our group and others have identified MEKK3-KLF2/4 signaling as the
direct target of CCM complex function, and showed that loss of CCM function confers
lesion formation through gain of MEKK3 signaling and elevated KLF2 and KLF4
expression in brain endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, we have also found that endothelial
TLR4 activation by lipopolysaccharide derived from gram negative bacteria in the gut
microbiome plays a central, upstream role in the activation of MEKK3-KLF2/4 signaling
and CCM formation in both mice and humans. These findings have culminated in a now
widely accepted model of CCM disease, but the downstream effectors by which KLF2
and KLF4 drive lesion formation remain unknown. Our preliminary studies reveal two
new insights into the downstream events that drive CCM formation: 1) PI3K gain of
function synergizes with CCM loss of function to drive lesion formation in mice and a
majority of surgically resected human CCM lesions, and 2) ADAMTS cleavage of peri-
vascular versican drives the CCM phenotype in mice. Project 3 will define the roles of
PI3K signaling and versican proteolysis during CCM pathogenesis using established and
newly developed mouse genetic models. These studies will strongly complement those
in Project 1 and Core A that examine the PIK3CA mutations in human CCM lesions and
a cell non-autonomous mechanism by which wild-type endothelial cells contribute to
CCM lesions. Most importantly, we expect these studies to be rapidly translated to the
clinic by providing support for the use of FDA-approved agents such as the PI3K
pathway inhibitor rapamycin to treat CCM disease."

 RNA plays a central role in nearly every biological process, acting in turn as a messenger,
catalyst, signaling molecule and more. Many of these roles require RNA to fold into specific
structures, and a given RNA species can often adopt multiple structures that modulate properties
such as protein interactions, ligand binding and catalytic activity. Research in the Widom Lab
focuses on developing and applying new spectroscopic methods to study RNA structure and
dynamics. We combine bulk, single-molecule and ultrafast spectroscopy in order to obtain a
comprehensive picture of RNA folding and interactions over length-scales from Angstroms to
microns and time-scales as short as picoseconds. We are currently using these methods to study
RNA-protein interactions during pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing, the process in which
segments of RNA that do not code for protein are excised, and ligand binding by riboswitches,
which regulate gene expression in bacteria.
 Single-molecule measurements offer a unique window into the heterogeneous and
dynamic nature of RNA folding, and ultrafast spectroscopy probes very rapid processes that are
inaccessible by other means. However, these are notably low-throughput techniques, with
measurements typically being performed on only a single RNA sequence at a time. An entirely
new class of scientific questions could be addressed if these techniques could be applied in a
high-throughput manner. We will bring this goal to realization by developing a process for
performing single-molecule fluorescence measurements on hundreds of different sequences
simultaneously. A library of RNA sequences will be prepared containing random bases at sites of
interest and the mixture will be subjected to single-molecule fluorescence measurements to
monitor structural rearrangements and response to stimuli in real time. Each molecule will then
be sequenced in situ in order to determine what sequence gave rise to its single-molecule signal.
Our goals for the next 5 years are to optimize this method and to use it to answer questions that
can only be addressed via high-throughput approaches. We will investigate the mechanistic
impacts of key sequences on pre-mRNA splicing, including variable sequences that fine-tune
splicing and conserved sequences that lead to disease when disrupted. We will also measure the
folding thermodynamics and kinetics of hundreds of RNA sequences and use the results to
benchmark and improve RNA structure prediction algorithms. This research program will greatly
increase the throughput of single-molecule fluorescence measurements, enabling detailed
biophysical insights to be achieved rapidly across a vast sequence space."
10900593,"ABSTRACT
More breast cancer patients are treated with anti-estrogen agents, such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs), than
with any treatment other than surgery. Due to their effectiveness, recent guidelines for postmenopausal women
advise extending AI therapy to 10-years duration. Therefore, exposure to AIs among the more than 3.5 million
breast cancer survivors will soon increase. A major concern of breast cancer survivors is therapy-induced
cognitive dysfunction. About 75% of women suffer cancer-related cognitive impairment during chemotherapy
treatment, which persists for months to years. There are theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that
cognitive impairment may also occur with estrogen deprivation. Surprisingly, there are few empirical human
studies of AI effects on cognition; none with cognition measured pre-cancer. Leveraging 18 years of data from
the Health and Retirement Studies―a nationally-representative, longitudinal survey augmented by Medicare
medical and pharmaceutical claims, we propose a longitudinal study designed to: (1) Characterize breast
cancer survivors’ cognitive functioning post-initiation of adjuvant AI therapy over a 60-month period using a
validated neuropsychological measure and compare their performance to those of (i) women with incident
breast cancer who did not receive AI therapy and (ii) non-cancer controls. Cross-sectional analyses
corresponding to roughly one-, three-, and five years post-AI therapy initiation will provide estimates of early
and late effects of AIs; (2) Contrast the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive functioning preceding and following
cancer diagnosis and treatment among women treated with an AI to those of (i) cancer survivors who did not
receive AI therapy and (ii) cancer-free controls, over an 18-year span. We anticipate a gradual decline in
cognitive functioning among cancer-free women over the study period. The AI group, however, is expected to
exhibit a steeper downward slope after AI initiation, indicating an adverse AI effect on cognition above and
beyond normal cognitive aging; and (3) Quantify the tradeoff between overall and disease-free life years and
cognitive functioning among women with incident breast cancer undergoing different adjuvant therapies. Using
findings from Aim 2 combined with parameter estimates from analyses of time to disease recurrence and time
to death, we will calculate overall and disease-free life years by cognitive functioning for various scenarios of
patients’ sociodemographic characteristics and cancer treatment(s). Results from these analyses will provide
rigorous evidence regarding the potentially adverse effects of AI exposure on cognition that may serve as the
basis for clinical interventions. They will also generate population-level estimates of survival and cognitive
decline attributable to AI and other cancer-treatments (beyond normal cognitive aging) that could be used to
better inform patients about “real world” tradeoffs of different breast cancer treatments. Finally, our results will
be important for all interested in the challenges of better understanding cancer-related cognitive impairment
and improving the functioning and quality of life of the large and growing number of breast cancer survivors."

Genetic discovery for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lags behind that in other areas of medicine, where the
identification of mutations responsible for familial forms of major disorders has yielded extraordinary biological
insights. However, recent successes in gene identification from both rare and common variant analyses indicate
what the field needs to do to catch up: expand the size, diversity and scope of genetic studies. Indeed, NIMH
recognized this need, issuing PAR-20-027, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in Ancestrally Diverse
Populations.” In response to this call, we will create the Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness
Association Studies (PUMAS) Project, an international collaboration of investigators from the US, South America
and Africa with the strongest track record of large-scale psychiatric genetic research in Latino and African
populations, along with several of the field’s leaders in genetic data generation and analysis. PUMAS will be well
powered to discover new genes for schizophrenia and bipolar; it will dramatically increase the diversity of genetic
discovery efforts, an important step towards reducing health disparities; and it will expand the scope of psychiatric
genomics by generating low-pass whole genome sequencing for 120,000 samples (which we will analyze
together with 22,500 samples already sequenced by our team). Through these efforts we will also discover
similarities and differences in genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and
environments. The Aims of the PUMAS project are to: 1) Build the PUMAS sample bank of schizophrenia cases,
bipolar cases and controls from Africa and from admixed populations in the Americas, achieving a total sample
of 183,500 (88,600 cases and 94,900 matched population controls) by recruiting 17,000 new cases and 16,500
controls. 2) Generate low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and variant calls on 40,000 cases of
schizophrenia, 40,000 cases of bipolar disorder and 40,000 matched controls from African, Native American and
admixed ancestries b) perform extensive sample and variant quality control. 3) a) Systematically analyze the
combined dataset to power discovery of the genetic basis of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries
and down the allele frequency spectrum; and b) through portals and browsers, share the data and results of the
genetic studies with the world. The PUMAS 120,000 sample WGS dataset, together with data for 22,500
previously sequenced admixed (AA+EA) samples, provides sufficient statistical power for genetic discovery for
SZ, BP, and combined across diverse ancestries. Our study will identify new genes and loci, increase the
precision of fine-mapping of known loci, and form the foundational knowledge base for polygenic risk scores
(PRS) of global value."
10900700,"There is an urgent need to conduct high impact multidisciplinary research for patients with chronic pain
(CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD)in the settings where they receive care and in collaboration with
stakeholders and persons with lived experience (PWLE). We propose to create the Integrative
Management of chronic Pain and OUD for Whole Recovery– Yale and Organizations United (IMPOWR-
YOU). IMPOWR-YOU is a multidisciplinary center led by established investigators with expertise
studying CP and opioid use disorder/misuse (OUD/misuse) and working in partnership with
stakeholders and PWLE. We conduct research in general medical settings (primary care, hospital) and
specialty (opioid treatment programs (OTPs)) with a focus on supporting the career development of
early stage investigators and those from groups traditionally underrepresented in research (URG).
IMPOWR-YOU is comprised of 5 cores (Operations, Stakeholder/PWLE, Career Development and
Diversity, Pilot Projects, Data and Measurement), 2 research projects, and annual Pilot Projects. Our
research, built on previous work of our investigators and stakeholders, addresses critical issues that
face practitioners across the healthcare system. Proposed studies include: 1) In primary care, compare
the effectiveness of a pharmacist led collaborative care approach for patients prescribed long-term
opioids who have CP and OUD/misuse vs. the pharmacist program plus patient referral to a phone-
delivered, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based pain self-management program; 2) In an OTP to
compare the effectiveness of a stepped care multimodal interdisciplinary CP management that includes
CBT, exercise and stress management to treatment as usual in patients receiving methadone or
buprenorphine; 3. In Year 1 conduct a pilot to modify an opioid stewardship program to address the
needs of hospitalized patients with CP and OUD and evaluate its preliminary efficacy. All studies
include outcomes related to pain, OUD, alcohol use, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep problems
and some assess stress, stigma and recovery capital. Our Pilot Project Core will oversee the selection
of pilots in Years 2-5 to support early stage investigators and collaborations with stakeholders/PWLE.
IMPOWR-YOU is built on long-standing multidisciplinary research collaborations among diverse
stakeholders, including PWLE, early stage investigators, URG, health systems, and organizations that
produce guidelines for CP and OUD/misuse. IMPOWR-YOU has the ideal mixture of investigators,
including leaders in primary care, addiction medicine/psychiatry, psychology specialty care, clinical
trials, qualitative research and implementation science; established relationships with stakeholders and
PWLE; a track record of innovation, leadership, collaboration, and outstanding productivity to create a
leading Center that will contribute to addressing the unique needs of patients with CP and OUD/misuse."
10900701,"Project Summary
Older adults living with chronic conditions and diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) experience substandard
cancer care, declines in care for their chronic conditions, and increased mortality relative to CRC patients with
no additional chronic conditions. Given compounded disparities in care for racial/ethnic minority patients, non-
white older adult CRC patients with comorbid chronic conditions experience even more disparate care and
outcomes. Yet, little has been done to systematically seek to improve care and outcomes for this vulnerable
patient group. One relatively simple solution may be to seek to optimize patients’ experiences with their care.
Patients reporting better experiences with their care have greater adherence to care, improved outcomes, and
decreased mortality amenable to healthcare. This research seeks to use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) data to study the
associations between patient experiences and health care, outcomes, and costs in a racially and ethnically
diverse sample of older adult CRC patients with comorbid chronic conditions. Our specific aims are to
determine racial/ethnic differences in: 1) associations between patient experiences with care and changes in
chronic condition care use following CRC diagnosis in older adult patients; 2) effect modification of patient
experiences with care in the relationships between comorbidity status and receiving guideline CRC care and
CRC survivorship; and 3) associations between patient experiences with care and overall costs of care
following CRC diagnosis in patients with and without comorbid chronic conditions. We hypothesize that, in a
population-based and nationally representative cohort, older adult CRC patients with comorbid chronic
conditions will have better outcomes when experiences with care are highly-rated, and that there will be
disparities in these effects for racial/ethnic minority patients. Data for this research will come from the SEER-
CAHPS linked dataset, using a sample of Medicare fee-for-service CRC patients with comorbid congestive
heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or type 2 diabetes who
responded to a CAHPS patient experience survey. The findings of this research will inform how we might
optimize care for this vulnerable patient group and for the growing group of older adults with multimorbidity.
Completion of this project will be aligned with a fellowship training plan with the goals of: 1) training in
epidemiologic, health services, and health disparities research; 2) understanding multimorbidity in older adults
and health disparities in later life; and 3) integrated longitudinal clinical training in primary care for medically
underserved patients. This training will be conducted at the University of Southern California Keck School of
Medicine (KSOM) with the support of skilled research and clinical mentors, ample research and clinical training
resources, and involvements in structured training programs (such as the KSOM MD/PhD program; the Cancer
Research, Education and Engagement Health Equity Center (CaRE2); and the KSOM Primary Care Program)."

This is the first application for renewal of T32 CA193111 to continue funding the training of next generation of
physician-scientists in gastrointestinal oncology. We believe that physician-scientists armed with rigorous
research training are necessary to discover and translate new advances in GI oncology as well as to investigate
critical issues facing delivery of cancer care to patients. Our trainees are drawn from NYU’s renowned clinical
fellowship programs in Medical Oncology or Gastroenterology or top-notch residency programs in Radiation
Oncology or Surgery. Trainees take a 2-3 year hiatus from clinical activities to engage in intensive full-time
training in GI cancer research. Our program is composed of (i) a Basic/Translational Science track aimed at
individuals who wish to direct their own basic science laboratory in GI oncology or individuals who want to lead
translational research programs that comfortably interface between the pre-clinical laboratory and clinical
investigation and (ii) a Population Sciences tract for trainees who seek careers in the diverse fields of population
sciences including cancer epidemiology, comparative effectiveness, disparities, health services, or outcomes
research. The program for our Basic/Translational Science track consists of two years of individualized mentored
research in faculty laboratories, enhanced by a strong parallel didactic program in cancer biology. The Population
Sciences track is centered on a rigorous Masters-level curriculum that teaches clinical trial design, epidemiology,
comparative-effectiveness, and outcomes research methodologies along with a mentored research project
based in population sciences. The two tracks are united through a weekly 2-hour core curriculum covering
essential topics in GI cancer and critical lessons for cancer physicians embarking on independent investigative
careers. We plan to continue to have a steady-state of 4 trainees at any given time. Our first group of graduates
have been very successful in acquiring the research skills and credentials to eventually lead their own research
groups. We are proud that our first graduates have obtained academic positions in oncology and submitted highly
scored K grants. Our trainees are nurtured by a cadre of mentors with substantial accomplishments in cancer
research and stellar training records. The aim of our training program is to continue to graduate physician-
scientists armed with the intellectual capacity and tools to lead their own research programs and become leaders
and role models in investigative GI oncology."
10902021,"Less than one-half of U.S. children age 6–11 are reaching recommended levels of physical activity, a health
behavior that tracks into adulthood and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.
Significant investment has been directed towards creating healthy environments for school-age children
including Safe Routes to School (SRTS), a national program that includes improvements to sidewalks,
crosswalks, and bicycle lanes. SRTS has been shown to increase the percentage of children active commuting
to school; however, high ambient temperatures may serve as a barrier to engaging in outdoor physical activity
due to thermal discomfort. Understanding the impact of SRTS on children's heat stress as measured by wet
bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and physical activity levels is critical for health equity, especially in Texas
where children in low-income communities and communities of color live in areas less supportive of physical
activity and disproportionately higher ambient temperatures due to discriminatory policies and ongoing
disinvestment. The proposed research leverages the STREETS study—a pre- and post-assessment of SRTS
in Austin, Texas, on child physical activity—to propose three specific aims: 1) construct ambient exposure
estimates of WBGT on school routes pre- and post-intervention and in home neighborhoods using spatially-
and temporally-refined modeling and GPS units; 2) determine how ambient temperatures and the built
environment are associated with active school commuting; and 3) identify methods to measure and document
how children and their parents experience and perceive ambient environmental exposures. Using
spatiotemporal modeling within GIS and formulae in the literature, WBGT will be estimated for all school routes
taken by 462 students enrolled in the STREETS cohort (320 students from 23 schools receiving SRTS; 142
students from 10 schools not receiving SRTS) who were tasked with wearing accelerometers and GPS units
for seven consecutive days over four periods (2018–2022) before and after SRTS implementation. Linear
mixed-effects modeling will be used to determine the relations between WBGT, built environment, and child
physical activity. To learn how children and their parents experience and perceive ambient environmental
exposures, participatory methods (surveys, mapping, sensors) will be tested with 40 third grade students and
their parents recruited by purposive sampling from schools enrolled in the STREETS study. To become an
independent investigator specializing in climate equity, the candidate developed a career development plan
with three training objectives: 1) to become proficient in working with ambient environmental data, in particular
downscaled model outputs; 2) to develop expertise in conducting advanced statistical analyses commonly
applied in exposure and health studies; and 3) to acquire familiarity with the design and techniques of
community-based participatory research. Career development will mainly take place at the Michael & Susan
Dell Center for Healthy Living at UTHealth School of Public Health in Austin."

Over the course of life, chronic stressors contribute to multi-organ aging and dysfunction and, ultimately, the
development of clinical disease. Sex remains a critical determinant of the nature and pace of aging and ultimately
longevity. Among mammalian species, it is even more clear that females fundamentally age differently from
males. With advancing chronologic age in humans, differences in biological aging between women and men
become even more pronounced, culminating in the female predominance for a number of important morbid
disease conditions, including notably Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in turn systemic frailty.
Mechanisms underlying the female predominance for these major morbidities remains unknown and are not
explained by variations in sex hormones or survival bias. Our preliminary work supports that sexual dimorphism
in inflammatory eicosanoid mediators contribute to sex differences in microvascular dysfunction and, in turn, to
sex differences in age-related multi-organ disease, including for ADRD, HFpEF and CKD. Elucidating a common

We propose a center called Telehealth Research and Innovation for Veterans with Cancer (THRIVE), and we
will use the entire Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system as our Clinical Practice Network.
The overarching goal of the Administrative Core is to ensure the smooth functioning of each aspect of THRIVE
and the seamless integration of its components.
Specifically, the function of the Administrative Core breaks down into five aims: (1) Project management – The
Administrative Core will provide centralized project management and research assistance for all THRIVE
projects including the Pragmatic Trial, the Research and Methods Core, Pilot Studies and the Clinical Practice
Network. Project management responsibilities will include hiring and management of project staff; project work
plan development and management; monitoring initial and renewal submissions to the IRBs; oversight of the
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan; scheduling and meeting management; and communication across projects
and externally. (2) Scientific planning and integration – The Administrative Core will lead the timing and roll-out
of the Pragmatic Trial and pilot studies, as well as coordination and integration across projects and THRIVE
components. It will also coordinate feedback from the national External Advisory Board and coordinate an
Annual Project Meeting. (3) Fiscal management – THRIVE will take place within a national health system and
will involve several consortium agreements. The Administrative Core will manage all Center budgets and
oversee the Consortium Agreements, as well as monitoring compliance with fiscal regulations. (4) Training –
The Administrative Core will oversee training and mentoring of junior faculty in research on virtual care,
oncology and health equity. (5) Dissemination – In conjunction with the Research and Methods Core, the
Administrative Core will oversee dissemination of Center results and deliverables to both internal and external
stakeholders."

The aim of the Cell Biology (CB) training program is to develop a diverse pool of well-­trained scientists 
through high quality research training and mentored research experiences. The program has three overarching 
goals. 1. Academic goals. To train a ‘complete cell biologist’ who has the skill sets to identify critical questions 
and design original and impactful experiments. This is achieved by providing an intellectually diverse and 
rigorous research environment that emphasizes the basic principles of cell organization and function. Students 
will be trained to be versant in scale-­crossing experimental approaches used in cell biology from molecules, to 
cellular organization and tissue morphogenesis and will be exposed to training in an array of disciplines  
including molecular biology, genetics, genomics, cell imaging, biochemistry, structural biology, proteomics, 
bioinformatics, and computational and systems biology. Multi-­scale and multi-­disciplinary learning will be 
supported by encouraging students to collaborate, to effectively lead or integrate in teams and to share 
knowledge and resources. 2. Educational Goals. To foster a training environment that encourages student 
participation. This is achieved by equipping trainees with the technical, operational, and professional skills  
required for a career in biomedical research and other science-­related fields. Through interactive learning, the 
program will foster skills to think critically and independently, and will provide a strong foundation for scientific 
reasoning and rigorous experimental design, analysis, and interpretation. 3. Personal Development Goals. 
To train responsible scientists who can productively engage and lead. This is achieved by a training program 
that emphasizes the importance of reproducibility and rigor in the experimental approach, and ‘lives’ a code of 
conduct among trainees and teachers that stresses mutual respect and values integrity and diversity. Through 
individually tailored and personal development studies, students will learn to be aware of their strengths and 
weaknesses and develop presentation skills to communicate their work across disciplines and effectively 
address audiences of varied backgrounds. These goals will be accomplished with strong programmatic 
leadership and guidance, engaged faculty mentors, a strong and diverse trainee pool, a structured, yet 
individualized training program and evaluation plan, and an outstanding research environment with critical

Loss of synapses is the strongest neuropathological correlate for clinical cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) patients. In AD mouse models, synapse loss is dependent on neuroinflammatory glial cells and their
phagocytic cell surface receptors, many of have been found to interact with extracellularly exposed
phosphatidylserine (PS). PS is a plasma membrane phospholipid that is maintained on the cytosolic leaflet but
can be flipped to the extracellular leaflet following cellular stress. These interactions led to the hypothesis that
glial synapse removal in AD may require synaptic PS exposure. Recent studies have shown that disruption of
glial receptor-PS interactions ameliorate synapse loss, electrophysiological deficits, and behavioral phenotypes
across several models. While there have been numerous investigations into the mechanisms regulating glial
phagocytic receptors, there has yet to be a systematic investigation into mechanisms regulating synaptic PS
exposure. I have developed a novel pooled CRISPRi screening platform to systematically elucidate mechanisms
of synaptic PS exposure. This initial screen has revealed potential roles for IL-6 and IL-11 signaling in regulating
synaptic PS exposure. In my first aim, I propose to determine how the IL-6 and IL-11 signaling pathways
differentially affect synaptic PS exposure, glial synaptic engulfment, and in vivo synaptic function both at baseline
and within AD model systems using a combination of pharmacological, genetic, and electrophysiological
approaches. In my second aim, I propose to identify other novel genetic regulatory mechanisms of synaptic PS
exposure in AD. To do this, I will expand my initial functional genomics screen to cover the entire protein-coding
genome and conduct differential phosphoproteomic analysis on synapses exposing high and low levels of PS
both at baseline and within the context of an in vitro AD model. Finally, I will validate these newly discovered
regulators using similar pharmacological, genetic, and electrophysiological approaches as I propose to use in
my first aim. Finally, I will study how these validated pathways are differentially expressed within AD patient
brains using immunohistochemical techniques. My sponsor, Dr. Martin Kampmann, who co-developed the
CRISPRi screening technology, and my cosponsor, Dr. Robert Edwards, who is a physician-scientist and an
expert in synaptic biology and neurotransmitter release, are ideally positioned to support my proposed research.
In addition to my two sponsors, I will also receive clinical mentorship from Dr. Bruce Miller, a behavioral
neurologist who specializes and the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases with a particular
focus on AD and other tauopathies. Overall, the proposed work will uncover novel mechanisms regulating an
understudied aspect of AD pathophysiology and identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.
Furthermore, this work will provide me with essential expertise for my future as a physician-scientist studying the
intersection of neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction."
10903865,"ABSTRACT. Haitians comprise one of the fastest growing subgroups of immigrants in the US. These
immigrants experience high levels of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain),
contributing to progressive functional impairment, disability, economic burden, and poor long-term health
outcomes. Knowledge of factors contributing to psychological distress early in the post-migration period and
longitudinally will help inform type and timing of interventions to reduce the disabling effects of psychological
distress and improve quality of life for this underserved population. Yet no studies have examined
psychological distress and its underlying biobehavioral, psychosocial, and cultural characteristics in Haitian
immigrants within the first few months of residence in the US or over time. While multiple biological processes
may be associated with psychological distress, rising evidence suggests that gut microbiome (GM) diversity
and composition play an important role via the bidirectional microbiome-gut-brain axis. After migration,
changes in GM composition and diversity embody changes in the social determinants of health ([SDoH]; e.g.,
stress, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, dietary patterns, acculturation, environmental and
sociocultural conditions) that also contribute to risk for psychological distress. With more time in the US, the
GM of recent immigrants becomes more Westernized, with reductions of microbial phylogenetic diversity and
native GM species as well as genera-level shifts in microbiota abundance. The SDoH that drive these GM
changes are modifiable through culturally responsive interventions. The GM thus has the potential to serve as
both an early indicator of risk for psychological distress and a tool to mitigate its effects. The overall goal for
this longitudinal pilot cohort study is to investigate associations between psychological distress, GM
composition/diversity, and post-migration SDoH in recent Haitian immigrants to the US. Specific aims are to 1)
Characterize the GM in 60 recent Haitian immigrants by analyzing self-collected stool samples at T1 (< 6
months in the US) and T2 (6 months after T1) and describe changes in composition/diversity over time and 2)
Examine longitudinal associations between post-migration SDoH, GM composition/diversity, and psychological
distress among recent Haitian immigrants. I hypothesize that, in recent Haitian immigrants, a) migration to the
US is associated with changes in GM composition and diversity over time, and b) changes in GM composition
and diversity are associated with changes in post-migration SDoH and psychological distress. The PI has
assembled an interdisciplinary mentoring team of senior scientists with expertise in symptom science, GM,
biocultural approaches, immigrant health disparities, genomics, and bioinformatics. This project will provide the
foundation for the PI to build an independent translational research program focused on developing culturally
responsive targeted interventions that mitigate psychological distress, improve long-term health outcomes,
reduce health disparities, and increase health equity in ethnic-minority immigrant populations."
10903741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food insecurity, “lack of access to enough food for an active, healthy life”, affects over 20% of the 30 million
Americans with diabetes. Food insecurity is more common in racial/ethnic minorities and those with lower
socioeconomic status. Moreover, food insecurity is associated with worse diabetes control and increased
complications, even after adjusting for other risk factors. Food insecurity is a major contributor to disparities in
diabetes outcomes.
 Medically tailored meal (MTM) delivery programs are a promising intervention for individuals with diabetes
and food insecurity. MTM programs deliver fully prepared food, tailored by a registered dietitian nutritionist to
the specific medical needs of the individual, and provide education to help optimize disease self-management.
Food insecurity is typically addressed with food subsidies—offering additional financial resources that can be
spent on food. While both food subsidies and MTM can increase healthy food access, MTM can help
overcome other barriers to diabetes management including lack of time, ability, knowledge, and skills needed
to prepare appropriate meals. The use of these programs is often called ‘food is medicine’, as the purpose is to
provide exactly the foods needed to help prevent diabetes complications. MTM are receiving increasing public
attention, but there are, as of yet, no full-scale trials to test its effects on diabetes outcomes when compared
with other food insecurity interventions.
 Our research team has developed a medically tailored meal intervention that combines provision of healthy
food, tailored to the specific nutrition needs of the individual, with an evidence-based lifestyle intervention that
uses the period of meal delivery as springboard to improve diabetes self-management, both while receiving
meals and after meal delivery is completed. MTM was highly successful in improving diet quality in a pilot
randomized clinical trial. What is missing is an explanatory (efficacy) randomized trial testing whether this
medically tailored meal intervention can lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes such as Hemoglobin A1c,
and in patient-reported outcomes such as diabetes distress, quality of life, and hypoglycemia.
 Thus, we propose a randomized trial to assess a community-based medically tailored meals intervention
(n=200). It will be conducted among diverse participants referred for medically tailored meals. Adults with type
2 diabetes, Hemoglobin A1c between 7.0% and 12.0%, and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (≥ 23 kg/m2 for those with Asian
ancestry) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to intervention or usual care + food subsidy. The intervention
group will receive meal delivery and its attendant lifestyle intervention for 6 months, while the usual care + food
subsidy group will receive a $30/month healthy food subsidy, along with usual diabetes care. Outcomes will be
assessed at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is Hemoglobin A1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes
include change in physiologic, behavioral, and psychosocial measures."
10903742,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurodegeneration underlies many major neurological diseases. Cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration is a
hallmark of ataxia, a disorder that entails poor motor coordination. However, a growing consensus argues that
conditions traditionally thought of as circuit disorders, such as tremor and dystonia, may also involve cerebellar
degeneration. This debate is due in part to technical limitations. Current human imaging techniques lack the
single-cell resolution necessary to reveal localized cell loss, and postmortem studies only inform the end-state
of disease and suffer from a scarcity of tissue samples, particularly from dystonia patients. Meanwhile, rodent
work suggests that Purkinje cell loss has diverse effects on behavior, although these studies often involve the
disruption of multiple cell types and prolonged developmental deficits, which make directly attributing behavioral
outcomes to Purkinje cell death difficult. To address these challenges, we use a genetic mouse model that
initiates Purkinje cell-specific death with temporal precision. Preliminary data suggests that adult-onset Purkinje
cell death causes progressive motor dysfunction that transitions through ataxia, tremor, and dystonia. This
proposal tests the hypothesis that Purkinje cell loss drives progressive functional changes that uniquely impact
motor behavior. Different regions of the cerebellum control distinct behaviors. Therefore, the first aim tests
whether adult-onset Purkinje cell loss causes behavioral defects depending on the region affected. A battery of
behavioral tests will track how motor dysfunction emerges, and immunohistochemistry and neural tracing will
reveal how cerebellar circuit architecture changes with degeneration and motor function deterioration. The
second aim tests how progressive Purkinje cell loss impacts the firing activity of the cerebellar nuclei, which
receive Purkinje cell input and project to other parts of the motor circuit. In vivo electrophysiological recordings
from the cerebellar nuclei of awake mice experiencing degeneration-induced motor defects will be used to
determine how Purkinje cell loss dynamically shapes neuronal dysfunction. In addition, this aim will determine
whether the beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation to the cerebellar nuclei in motor dysfunction hold true
during Purkinje cell loss. The completion of these aims will define the impact of Purkinje cell death in ataxia,
tremor, and dystonia and the mechanisms by which a single insult to a circuit can exert diverse consequences
on motor function. The fellowship training plan includes designing and performing these experiments, analyzing
the data, and writing and presenting the work in a supportive, resource-filled training environment."
10903872,"Impaired fertility is a highly distressing, under-addressed, late effect of cancer and cancer treatment among
female adult survivors of childhood cancer. Many female survivors are uncertain about their fertility status and
report unmet fertility information needs and fertility-related distress. For those who desire biological children,
overestimation of risk for impaired fertility may cause unnecessary emotional and relational distress.
Underestimation may lead to a missed opportunity to pursue having biological children due to factors such as
premature ovarian insufficiency. Yet, to date, fertility-related information needs and distress remain largely
unaddressed in this population. Following the ORBIT Model for behavioral intervention development, the
proposed study seeks to design and refine a behavioral intervention to address unmet fertility-related information
needs and fertility-related distress among female adult survivors of childhood cancer (aged 18-44). Phase I of
the study will involve conducting individual interviews with female adult survivors of childhood cancer (N=20) and
medical providers who care for this population (N=10) to inform the development of a preliminary, manualized,
intervention. Based on existing literature and feedback from experts in behavioral interventions for cancer
survivors, adult survivors of childhood cancer, and infertility, it is anticipated that an intervention combining
strategies from Patient Activation Theory and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy will be developed.
Intervention development is flexible and will be tailored based on feedback received from stakeholders. In Phase
2, preliminary intervention content will be delivered to a small sample of the target population (N=30). Feasibility
and acceptability, as well as examination of pre- to post-intervention patterns of change in intervention targets
(primary: fertility health knowledge, fertility-related distress; secondary: psychological flexibility, patient
activation, and self-efficacy), will be assessed and utilized to further refine the intervention (e.g., intervention
strategies, intervention length, and delivery modality). In line with the National Cancer Institute's priority research
area focused on cancer survivorship, the overall goal of the fellowship is to support Dr. Stalls to develop expertise
that will enable her to become a leading clinical researcher in the development and evaluation of behavioral
interventions to address reproductive and sexual health late effects among cancer survivors. To do so requires
a unique combination of knowledge and skills in the areas of, 1) Reproductive and Sexual Health, 2) Behavioral
Intervention Development and Evaluation, and 3) Professional Development. Training in these areas will be
accomplished through guidance from expert sponsors and collaborators as well as the many resources and
training opportunities offered at Duke University. Completion of this fellowship would not only advance the
survivorship literature in this area and propel Dr. Stalls toward her career goals, but help address the significant
gap in well-trained clinical researchers who are equipped to address these highly personal and time-sensitive
reproductive and sexual health late effects of cancer and cancer treatment."
10899924,"Project Summary/Abstract
Negative affect and stress experienced during alcohol abstinence can be a major factor contributing to relapse
in alcohol use disorder, yet underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain ill-defined. Corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF)-expressing neurons in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) are involved in anxiety and
stress responses, and they play a major role in the withdrawal. A subcommissural population of CRF neurons
in the BNST (vBNSTCRF) is heavily innervated by hindbrain noradrenergic neurons that co-express prolactin
releasing peptide (PrRP). Because these PrRP neurons are sensitive to both stress and interoceptive state,
they are likely involved in the development of stress hypersensitivity following withdrawal. However, the role of
PrRP neurons in alcohol-related behaviors has not been studied. I hypothesize that signaling of PrRP neurons
to vBNST during acute ethanol withdrawal contributes to the development of negative affective behaviors, and
that ethanol withdrawal potentiates vBNSTCRF responses to stress and PrRP neuronal activation. In the
proposed project, mice will undergo chemogenetic silencing of PrRP+ neurons projecting to vBNST during
acute ethanol withdrawal to examine the necessity of the circuit in the development of negative affective
behaviors (Aim 1). Then, the influence of ethanol withdrawal on in vivo calcium responses of vBNSTCRF
neurons to stress and chemogenetic activation of PrRP+ neurons will be explored using fiber photometry (Aim
2). Finally, monosynaptic tracing and whole brain imaging will be used to define additional brain regions
innervating vBNSTCRF neurons that may be modulated concomitantly during ethanol withdrawal (Aim 3). The
results of these studies will provide an improved understanding of neurobiological mechanisms impacting
affective behavioral changes during ethanol abstinence. This project also provides a strong platform to expand
and strengthen the trainee’s expertise in modern behavioral neuroscience approaches, including intersectional
viral strategies for chemogenetic manipulation of neural circuits, observation of cell-type specific in vivo
calcium signaling, and characterization of monosynaptic inputs to specific cell populations."

Loss of proteostasis and unresolved senescence are two drivers of aging, however, little is known about their
possible interplay in aging. Although senescent cells are of transient nature, abnormal tissue accumulation of
senescent cells occurs with age and contributes to functional loss and increased vulnerability to disease in old
organisms. Research on the relation between senescence and proteostasis is still limited and lacks systematic
studies on the impact of proteostasis loss in the different steps of senescence. This proposal focuses on
chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a component of the cellular proteostasis network that facilitates selective
removal of proteins. Both, senescence and CMA are part of the cellular responses to damage and malfunction
with age, but the contribution of reduced CMA activity in aging to unresolved senescence has not been explored
before. Engagement and resolution of senescence require major proteome changes to modulate translation
attenuation, energetic switches, and changes in protein secretion, all of them functions that CMA modulates in
other cellular conditions. Therefore, we propose that 1) CMA may contribute to part of the proteome remodeling
required for transient senescence and that 2) the decline in CMA with age impairs senescence clearance
and leads to persistence of unresolved senescence and its long-term detrimental effects. We aim to understand
1) if CMA activity changes upon induction of senescence, 2) if CMA modulates senescence’s kinetics of and if
so, by which mechanism(s), 3) if CMA is required for senescent cells immunoclearance and 4) if restoring CMA
activity in aged mice reduces their organ senescent cell overload. We will use novel photoswitchable reporters
to track CMA after different pro-senescence stimuli, and will genetically downregulate CMA to mimic its change
in aging. Using targeted proteomics, we will study the impact of reduced CMA on senescence-triggered
translational attenuation and in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We have generated
mice defective in CMA in immune cells to explore the role of CMA in immunoclearance of senescence cells.
Lastly, we will undertake both genetic and pharmacological approaches to enhance CMA in old mice and analyze
the impact on the senescence cell overload of different organs. During this training period, I will be co-mentored
by Drs. Ana Maria Cuervo, Susmita Kaushik and the collaborators in this project. This excellent mentoring team
will allow me to 1) expand my technical abilities; 2) acquire a strong background on proteostasis, biology of aging
and pharmacological interventions; 3) formulate and test scientific hypothesis; 4) improve my oral presentation
and scientific writing skills; 5) consolidate a network of collaborators in biology of aging and 6) prepare me for a
postdoctoral position as the next stage of my career in aging research.
Significance: Our studies will advance understanding of the mechanism behind unresolved senescence in aging
and, if successful, will provide proof-of-concept of the value of targeting CMA in age-related conditions related
to unresolved senescence such as tissue fibrosis, chronic inflammation, cancer, and degenerative conditions."

TAR DNA-binding ~43kDa (TDP-43) inclusions are the pathological hallmark of frontotemporal lobar
degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite shared pathological
features, ALS and FTLD-TDP can present with heterogenous clinical features including cognitive/behavioral
impairments (i.e., FTLD-TDP), motor neuron dysfunction (i.e., ALS), or both (i.e., ALS-FTD). Moreover, certain
genetic mutations typically only result in ALS or FTLD-TDP, but other mutations can cause FLTD-TDP and/or
ALS within the same family. Together, the shared and disparate pathological, clinical, and genetic features of
FTLD-TDP, ALS, and ALS-FTD support the notion that they are part of a clinicopathologic spectrum. However,
the vast majority of ALS and FTLD-TDP cases are considered sporadic and have no known causal mutation.
The underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to the observed clinical heterogeneity across sporadic
TDP-43 proteinopathies are not well understood. Supporting evidence for a genetic component to sporadic
cases, common genetic variants have been associated with disease risk for either ALS or FTLD-TDP.
However, combined studies across TDP-43 proteinopathies are rare. Thus, the extent to which risk alleles are
shared or disparate across these phenotypes is unclear. While there is mounting evidence of shared genetic
factors that explain the biological mechanisms that drive susceptibility to both diseases, considerably less effort
has focused on the disparate genetic features across TDP-43 proteinopathies. Identifying disparate variants
may contribute to our understanding of disease-specific drivers. The first aim of this proposal is to identify both
the shared and disparate genomic features that drive individual-level cognitive/behavioral and/or
neuromuscular presentations of these syndromes. TDP-43 pathology and neurodegeneration are observed in
characteristic neuroanatomical regions that correlate with the clinical presentations of ALS and FTLD-TDP, but
it is unclear what contributes to this regional selective vulnerability. Previous work has demonstrated clear
regional differences in gene expression within the same individuals. Gene expression quantitative trait loci
analyses can identify genomic loci that explain variation in gene expression. However, these associations are
highly tissue and cell type specific, which may obscure important differences. This is especially true within
neurodegenerative disorders, as observed gene expression differences may reflect cell type composition
differences rather than true transcriptional regulation. The second aim of this proposal is to investigate genetic
contributions to regionally specific differential gene expression, including cell type specific expression, in ALS
and FTLD-TDP. Overall, this proposal leverages genotype and transcriptomic approaches to understand
molecular contributions of regional selective vulnerability in ALS and FTLD-TDP. In disentangling this
heterogeneity, it may be possible to inform efforts to develop therapeutic targets that attenuate the course of
these neurodegenerative diseases."

The central mission of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at Columbia University's Vagelos
College of Physicians and Surgeons (VP&S) is to train clinician-scientists to become leaders in biomedical
research. Growing complexity of medicine and science has made it challenging to sustain a robust pipeline of
clinician-scientists into the biomedical workforce. The VP&S MSTP has implemented efficiencies to integrate
medical and PhD research training that keep pace with the interdisciplinary, quantitative, collaborative, and
diverse nature of biomedical scholarship. The VP&S MSTP has evolved a flexible curricular model, providing
outstanding and efficient training and mentorship to support the output of committed, clinically fluent,
biomedical researchers. Trainees undertake an 18-month preclinical medical curriculum followed by 2 clinical
clerkships, then PhD research for 3.5-4.5 years, and finally the major block of clinical clerkships. Because of
MSTP's emphasis on integration, preclinical students are engaged in PhD courses and lab rotations; and PhD
students are engaged in a unique clinical competence program. After the 7 or 8 year MD-PhD program,
trainees emerge as creative, rigorous, diligent, resilient scientists who are also exceptional and compassionate
clinicians. Specific missions of VP&S MSTP include: 1) Enhancing reproducibility of biomedical research
results through training in scientific rigor and transparency; 2) Promoting a training culture with highest
standards to ensure the safety, ethics, and well-being of all; 3) Imparting appreciation and ability to work in
diverse teams and cultivate inclusivity; and 4) Nurturing superb skills to communicate scientific findings to a
wide range of audiences. Critical enhancements to the VP&S MSTP include abundant career mentoring to
promote successful transition into dual-degree careers; training in rigorous research design, as well as
quantitative, computational and statistical methods; and nurturing of ethics, responsibility, diversity, and
inclusivity in biomedical research and clinical practice. The trainee cohort is superb and increasingly diverse.
More than 130 outstanding investigators act as thesis mentors. Program leadership has decades of graduate
and medical education experience. The duration of trainee appointments would be for the first 2 years of PhD
research, and the projected number of trainees across all cohorts would be 116 students. Measurable
objectives that VP&S MSTP intends to achieve are: 1) Maintaining or improving high levels of dual-degree
attainment (98%) and rapid time to completion (7.7 years); 2) Increasing the frequency of rigorous, impactful,
first-authored papers from 93% up to 100%; 3) Bettering the 5-yr average of underrepresented racial and
ethnic minority trainees (23%) to a steady 30%; and 4) Inspiring post-grad training that will increase long-term
alumni retention in research careers (70%) up to 80%. VP&S MSTP graduates genuinely learn how to discover
new knowledge, translate discoveries to the clinic, and then guide others through this critical mission."
10899961,"Project Summary and Abstract
Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive, toxic molecule that is produced non-enzymatically during central
metabolism by virtually all cells. Some microorganisms, including enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, also
enzymatically produce MGO during metabolic shifts in order to mitigate phosphorylated sugar toxicity. Although
its production serves to protect E. coli, MGO also directly damages cells, in part through targeted modification
(glycation) of proteins. In Eukaryotes, glycation has been shown to modulate the enzymatic activity of certain
proteins, which in some cases increases cellular protection from MGO-induced stress. Whether glycation serves
a similar function in bacteria is not known. It has been shown, however, that E. coli protects itself from MGO via
detoxification to lactate, a process that also activates a potassium (K+)/proton (H+) antiporter, leading to
cytoplasmic acidification. In addition to these known mechanisms, my preliminary data suggest a role for the
Nitrogen-Related Phosphotransferase System (PTSNtr) in protection from MGO exposure. The PTSNtr protein
PtsN regulates activity of several K+ transporters in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. My preliminary results
show that deleting ptsN confers a survival advantage during MGO exposure, while knocking out PtsO, the protein
that phosphorylates PtsN, decreases survival. However, the pathway and underlying mechanism for this
behavior are not known. I hypothesize that post-translational modifications (phosphorylation of the PTSNtr
and protein glycation) mediate novel mechanisms of MGO protection in E. coli. Aim 1 will delineate the
mechanism underlying the MGO survival advantage of a ΔptsN mutant and determine the contribution of PtsN
phosphorylation to this phenotype, revealing a new role for this conserved phosphotransferase system. Aim 2
will characterize protein glycation targets and changes in protein expression in response to MGO. This will
provide, for the first time, a global view of proteins glycated by MGO in bacteria, the effects of glycation on
protection from MGO stress, and the bacterial regulatory response following exposure to MGO. Completion of
this project will elucidate a new role of posttranslational modification – both phosphorylation of PtsN and glycation
of select proteins – in E. coli survival during MGO stress. It may also reveal novel protective pathways that can
be modulated to combat bacterial infection and inflammation and modulate the host microbiome."

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, often recurrent mental health problem associated with
an increased likelihood for several common physical health problems and a decreased lifespan. A history of
experiencing childhood maltreatment is considered a major risk factor for the development of MDD in
adulthood, as well as an overall worse course of illness. Dysregulation of the immune system and associated
inflammation has emerged as a leading theory in helping to explain the association between childhood
maltreatment and MDD in adulthood. Unfortunately, two pressing problems have persisted throughout this
field. First, studies are highly heterogeneous in their designs or are not representative of the U.S., despite the
U.S. having the highest incidence of MDD among all high-income nations. Second, many studies poorly assess
the role of sex, implementing it as a covariate despite recognition that sex affects the associations between
childhood maltreatment, inflammation, and MDD systemically. Even fewer studies account for the roles of
both sex and gender. The research agenda outlined in this F31 proposal will utilize data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative U.S. sample
following adolescents to midlife. Aim 1 will model the associations between different types of childhood
maltreatment, inflammation, and MDD symptoms in the U.S. using a multi-wave design. Aim 2 will explore
how both sex and gender may affect the associations between childhood maltreatment, inflammation, and
MDD symptoms. During the completion of these outlined aims the applicant will achieve three training goals.
Training Goal 1 will focus on developing the applicant’s abilities in conducting longitudinal path modeling
with large multi-wave data sets. Training Goal 2 will focus on developing the applicant’s ability to explore
sex-differences as they pertain to MDD, childhood maltreatment, and inflammation, while also gaining
experience with propensity score matching. Training Goal 3 will focus on professional development through
readings, lab meetings, peer review trainings, and presenting at several academic venues."

 Children learn language in the context of complex and multidimensional social interactions. Affective
information is a prominent yet, underexplored feature of children's early learning context despite its effects on
infants' attention and memory systems.1–3 Understanding how children’s affective environments shape learning
is an important public health issue, as approximately a third of mothers in the US experience depression in the
first three years of a child’s life.4 The proposed research aims to fill this knowledge gap by capturing
theoretically important dimensions of affect (such as valence and arousal5) in children’s real-world early
environments, with the ultimate translational goal of understanding the genesis of variation in language and
well-being. Central to this goal will be evaluating how children adapt their use of affective information in
families with depressed caregivers. We will quantify the affective context of learning events using multiple
methods, including experimental studies and descriptive computer vision and machine learning analyses of a
large dataset of egocentric-view videos of children’s home environment.
 In Aim 1, we will ask whether the structure of affective information in caregiver input predicts the age at
which children produce different types of words (Aim 1a) and how children adapt to the affective cues of
caregivers with depression symptoms (Aim 1b). We will use automatically coded affective features from videos
across three modalities (facial, vocal, and semantic) to predict the age at which children produce different
words depending on the severity of their caregivers’ depression symptoms. In Aim 2, we build on the
correlational, naturalistic evidence from Aim 1 by taking an experimental approach, allowing us to uncover
causal links between affect and word learning. Specifically, in three novel word-learning studies, we will
disentangle which dimensions of affect (e.g., valence and arousal) are most impactful.
 Together, this research will provide insight into the affective mechanisms that promote word learning in
child-caregiver interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving resilience and language development in
households with atypical affective dynamics. Through these aims, the applicant will build on her background in
affective development and gain training in computational methods and theoretical knowledge in understanding
clinical variation in affect across households. The sponsor, Dr. Michael Frank, has deep expertise in early
learning and extensive mentorship experience in developmental and computational methods. The co-sponsor,
Dr. Ian Gotlib, is an expert in the study of caregiver depression. The unique training environment at Stanford
University provides the resources necessary to successfully complete the proposed work, as well as additional
opportunities for mentorship and professional development. In sum, the proposed project and training plan will
support the applicant’s career goal of becoming a professor at a research university and enable her to develop
a rigorous and novel research program at the intersection of cognitive, affective, and developmental science."
10904882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Shigella infection is a leading cause of diarrheal illness in young children in resource-limited settings,
and results in tens of thousands of deaths each year. Protection against shigellosis is associated
with antibodies targeting O-specific polysaccharide (OSP), but immune responses against other
antigens have also been noted to correlate with protection. Functional attributes of anti-shigella
antibodies have also been noted to correlate with protection, including complement activation and
ability to induce host cell phagocytic activity. Despite this, a shigella OSP-conjugate vaccine failed to
protect young children in a field trial, despite providing protection in older children and adults. We
propose that such issues may reflect differences not only in antibody magnitude (titer) following
vaccination, but also differences in antibody functional effector attributes, including Fc interactions
with the innate immune system. Such differences have been noted to correlate with protection
against a range of infectious pathogens. To address this, we propose to define antibody functional
and biophysical attributes associated with protection against shigella infection, including in young
children, using a household contact study design approach in an informal settlement area in Dhaka,
Bangladesh. We propose to complement this analysis with data from North American vaccine and
Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs) and related studies. We anticipate that we will identify a
profile of antibody attributes that correlates with protection against shigellosis, that this knowledge
will critically guide vaccine development and evaluation efforts, and that this knowledge will focus
future mechanistic studies."

The Hershey Conference on Developmental Brain Injury was started in 1997 and has grown to a high-quality
program that attracts international attendees that include physician-scientists, basic scientists, and trainees. The
conference is held every other year, and the site alternates between international and US locations. Sessions
include invited speakers who are luminaries in the field, as well as sessions in which more junior investigators
share their work. This conference offers an amazing opportunity for trainees and young investigators to meet
and interact with senior investigators in the field in a relaxed environment. The scientific presentations are always
outstanding. The 2024 14th Hershey Conference organized by Drs. Henrik Hagberg and Carina Mallard (together
with an international scientific committee) will be held in Marstrand close to Gothenburg on the Swedish west
coast, at the Marstrands Havshotel. We are applying to NIH for support primarily to fund attendance for junior
investigators and trainees from the US. The overall goal of the proposed meeting is to bring together an
international group of scientists whose focus is on neonatal brain injury and repair. This year's overarching theme
will be: Perinatal Brain Injury including mechanisms, experimental models, neuroprotection,
biomarkers/machine learning and long-term outcome. This three-day meeting will include the following
sessions: Long-term outcome and retinopathy of prematurity; Experimental models of perinatal brain injury;
Neuroprotection; Mechanisms of brain injury; biomarkers and machine learning. The meeting has four objectives:
1) To identify clinical paradigms that inform basic science concepts and translate those new basic concepts into
 more refined clinical application
2) To explore areas of gaps in our current knowledge, and to include experts in tangential fields to provide new
 perspectives on these gaps
3) To promote novel collaborations
4) To promote trainee and junior faculty participation and to identify trainees/junior faculty from racial/ethnic
 minorities and underrepresented institutions to attend this conference and develop new collaborations.
In summary, the objective of this R13 is to provide the necessary continued support for trainees and junior faculty
from US to attend the 14th Hershey Conference on Developmental Brain Injury in Europe. Extensive participation
of trainees, both from US and abroad, has been a hallmark of the Hershey Conference. Trainees, both MD and
PhD, constitute 30-40% of all participants. This meeting provides an excellent opportunity for informal interaction
between trainees and the leaders in the field as well as a mechanism for post-doctoral and visiting scientist
recruitment. Past meetings have been an inspiration for young researchers to pursue the field of developmental
neuroscience."
10901190,"ABSTRACT
The proposed project will lead to an understanding of how common caregiver interaction strategies facilitate
moment-to-moment changes in reciprocal communication and how child characteristics are associated with
this relationship. Acquiring spoken language by age 5 is a key predictor of lifelong communication outcomes
and an estimated one-third of autistic children who have not met this benchmark, also commonly classified as
minimally verbal, experience significant difficulties that impact daily living and quality of life long-term. Because
reciprocal communication sets the stage for successful social interactions and language learning, promoting
reciprocity is an important goal for both development and intervention in nonspeaking children. While many
intervention approaches leverage parent-child synchrony and turn-taking to support communication, our
understanding of how specific behaviors influence reciprocity is primarily limited to summary-level measures
and often uses third-party subjective ratings. In contrast, the key innovation in this proposal is investigating
interaction dynamics on two timescales – at the interaction level and at the moment-to-moment level.
Analyzing the interaction at the moment-to-moment level allows for a more direct temporal link between
commonly used caregiver strategies and changes in reciprocity than summary-level measures can provide.
 The proposed study will utilize a cohort observational design and a sequential analysis approach to
address two specific aims: to evaluate the influence of caregiver strategies on moment-to-moment changes in
reciprocal interaction in nonspeaking autistic children and to determine the impact of individual child
characteristics on the relationship between caregiver behavior and reciprocal interchanges. These aims will
test the working hypothesis that caregiver imitation and multimodal communication are more likely to elicit
communication interchanges with their child than expected by chance, and that child receptive language is
associated with the relationship between these strategies and occurrence of interchanges. Multimodal
communication and imitation strategies are commonly employed by caregivers and recent work has shown that
they lead to increased engagement in younger autistic children. This highly quantitative approach builds on
prior work by addressing the influence of timing and coordination during interaction, which are known to be
impacted in autism. By analyzing the play interactions of 4–6-year-old children, we will gain more insight into
the nature of reciprocal communication dynamics at a critical juncture in children's communication
development – during the shift from preverbal to minimally verbal status. This knowledge will move the field
toward identifying specific mechanisms of social interaction in nonspeaking children and refine intervention
strategies for this population. Future work can extend this approach to increase our understanding of how
caregiver strategies influence behavior and for whom they are most effective."

Infantile epileptic encephalopathy (IEE) is a severe form of early-onset epilepsy and has been associated with
de novo and inherited mutations in HCN1 (hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic-nucleotide gated) channels.
Current drugs available to treat IEE are nonspecific. To create specific pharmaceuticals for IEE, disease-related
polymorphisms have been cataloged and pathology has been attributed to aberrant trafficking to the cellular
membrane or alteration of gating properties of HCN1 channels. The overall goal of this application is to develop
a novel targeted approach to uncover druggable HCN1 allosteric sites using genomic, functional, and structural
approaches. We propose to utilize both an allosteric inhibitor and an allosteric activator of HCN1 to uncover their
mechanism of action by structural determination of complexes and investigation of their functional effects on WT
and mutant channels. We will then determine the association of allosteric trajectories predicted by coevolution
models with the mechanisms of action of these small molecules as well as pathogenic mutations in HCN1.
Together with determining structures of other gating states, this will allow generation of a model of ion channel
allostery and will provide a testable framework for structure-function relationships. Allosteric modulation of HCN
channels will thus be predicted and exploited for rational design of candidate therapeutics. Our first and second
specific aims are to determine the structures by single-particle cryo-EM of HCN1 in complex with an allosteric
inhibitor, propofol, and in complex with an allosteric activator, PIP2, respectively. The candidate binding sites will
be validated by mutagenesis followed by electrophysiology. Clues into the molecular reasons for the HCN1
selectivity for propofol despite strong sequence conservation across all HCN family members, will be provided
by a bioinformatic co-evolution analysis. Statistical coupling analysis will identify and predict HCN1 allosteric
pathways and we will determine their association with pathogenic missense mutations and propofol binding.
Candidate positions will be tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology. Our third specific aim is to obtain
structures of distinct conformers of HCN1 channels by adjusting the sample conditions (e.g. liposomes with an
established electrochemical gradient) as well as by targeting disease-associated HCN1 polymorphisms. This
aim will not only aid in understanding the basics of channel gating by determining physiologically-relevant
channel conformations, but also will facilitate structure-based drug design to modulate aberrant, disease-specific
ion channel activity."

10904771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Platelets are a blood component critical to hemostasis, i.e. the prevention of blood loss at sites of
vascular injury. For hemostasis, platelets must activate their primary integrin (aIIbb3) through the small
GTPases Rap1 and downstream protein Talin. Integrin activation is essential to platelet adhesion and
aggregation. Activated platelets can also release their granule contents and undergo phospholipid scrambling
to support the formation of a stable hemostatic plug. The mechanisms of platelet activation must be tightly
controlled as hypoactive platelets cause prolonged bleeding while hyperactive platelets are associated with
thrombotic disease.
 Platelets which undergo phospholipid scrambling expose a negatively charged phospholipid,
phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), to their outer membrane surface. These so called procoagulant platelets recruit
and activate coagulation factors resulting in the generation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin, an integral
component of stable hemostatic plugs. Loss of PtdSer exposure or coagulation factors results in bleeding
complications; conversely, excessive PtdSer exposure is associated with increased thrombotic risk. Despite
the negative outcomes associated with dysregulation of PtdSer, there exists a gap in knowledge on the
mechanisms regulating PtdSer exposure following platelet activation.
 The small GTPase Rap1 is a well-established regulator of platelet integrin activation and aggregation.
Loss of Rap1 in vitro also results in decreased PtdSer exposure; however, the mechanism and in vivo
significance of Rap1-dependent PtdSer exposure are unknown. Interestingly, Rho family GTPases
(RhoA/Rac/Cdc42) also modulate PtdSer exposure in platelets, and studies in multiple cell types, including
platelets, have demonstrated crosstalk between Rap1 and Rho GTPases. Therefore, I hypothesize that
Rap1-dependent PtdSer exposure occurs through crosstalk with Rho family small GTPases, and that
Rap1-dependent procoagulant activity is critical during hemostatic plug formation. Preliminary data
supports my hypothesis as inhibition of RhoA signaling leads to increased PtdSer exposure in platelets lacking
both Rap1 isoforms, Rap1A and Rap1B. I have also established a novel imaging platform which allows for the
study of platelet-dependent procoagulant response during hemostasis in vivo. In aim 1 I will characterize the
crosstalk between Rap1 and Rho Family GTPases during platelet activation leading to PtdSer exposure. In
aim 2 I will use my novel 4-D imaging model of hemostasis to characterize how Rap1 signaling affects platelet-
coagulation interplay in vivo. This work will expand our understanding of the regulation of Rap1 mediated
platelet PtdSer exposure and its consequences in vivo."
10892886,"ABSTRACT
Our long-term goal is to generate a complete understanding of how the cerebellum learns to improve movement
in response to motor errors. Climbing fibers are thought to play an essential role in this process because they
fire during erroneous movement. Their activity reliably excites Purkinje cells, eliciting calcium spikes in their
dendrites that can trigger long-term synaptic plasticity at coactive parallel fiber inputs. Plasticity induction
ultimately leads to corrective behavior by altering the cerebellum’s response to sensorimotor stimuli that predict
mistakes. Importantly, inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) that target Purkinje cell dendrites
suppresses climbing-fiber-evoked calcium signaling, opposing or ‘gating’ plasticity induction. Because MLIs are
activated by movement, this suggests Purkinje cell disinhibition is required during motor learning. As MLIs inhibit
other MLIs, their interconnections could support a circuit for Purkinje cell disinhibition during behavior. The
objective of this proposal is to examine the possibility that MLI circuits are structured to support a context-
dependent engagement that allows climbing fibers to instruct plasticity and learning in response to motor errors.
To accomplish this, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach using cutting-edge molecular-genetic techniques,
functional recordings, circuit mapping, and behavioral analysis. In the first aim, we will test whether ablating MLI-
to-MLI connections that normally support Purkinje cell disinhibition affect the ability of climbing fibers to evoke
full-blown calcium signals in response to motor errors, and whether loss of MLI-MLI circuit function affects
cerebellar-dependent motor learning. In the second aim, we will establish an MLI taxonomy and use it to survey
for previously unknown MLI subtypes. We will also use functional recordings to test whether there is evidence
for bias connectivity within the MLI network that supports a dedicated circuit for Purkinje cell disinhibition. In the
third aim, we will use anatomical tracing to ascertain the MLI connectome. In this way we will determine if there
is a structural basis for the independent actuation of MLI subtypes through their afferent inputs and the cell-type
selectivity of their efferent outputs. Completion of these aims will lead to an unprecedented understanding of the
organizational logic of the molecular layer. In particular, we expect to reveal how circuits within the molecular
layer control the induction of climbing-fiber-mediated learning. This knowledge will not only help develop
theories/models of cerebellum function but will also provide insight into the processes underlying learning in
general."
10892888,"Metastatic prostate cancer is the second largest cause of cancer-related death in American men. A major
obstacle to their treatment and to developing new drugs for this disease is the lack of reliable quantitative
treatment monitoring methods. Fluid-based tumor monitoring using circulating tumor cells (CTC) has
recently proven valuable for prognosis and predicting response to treatment. Current imaging methods for
treatment monitoring in prostate cancer involve lesion-counting of new bone metastases or selected index
lesions of soft tissue disease; both focus on progression only and cannot assess the full disease burden.
This proposal deploys two validated methods, automated bone scan index (aBSI) and lymph node
segmentation, to quantify standard imaging results so that a measure of total disease burden on imaging
can be integrated with CTC data in a predictive model. The hypothesis that this model will outperform
current methods for monitoring response to therapy will be tested via these specific aims: 1) Correlate
quantitative post-treatment changes in tumor burden as assessed by imaging and CTC’s; 2) Determine
whether a combination of fluid-based tumor monitoring (liquid biopsy) and an imaging assay is more
powerful than either assay alone in prognosticating for survival; 3) Identify the optimal combination of liquid
biopsy and imaging for different therapies. Models will be built to predict overall survival using imaging,
CTC, and prognostic factor data from phase III clinical trials of first-line treatments, docetaxel, docetaxel +
radium-223, and abiraterone + prednisone, for an advanced stage of disease, metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Clinical trials including this data are available for analysis due to the
recommendations for serial imaging (CT and bone scintigraphy) and CTC assessment as endpoints in the
Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) 3 guidelines, co-authored by the study team. The results of this
study will create the first reliable, multiparametric, and fully quantitative biomarker that captures clinically
meaningful indices of both response and progression in mCRPC; generate evidence to support its inclusion
in future PCWG guidelines; and develop methods applicable to new imaging modalities."

The error-related negativity (ERN) is a biomarker of error processing that can predict future onset and worse
outcomes of anxiety disorders in young children and is therefore a potential target to offset the development of
anxiety disorders. Therapeutic interventions can reduce the ERN in a single session, but a number of factors
make the ERN difficult to measure, such as requiring participants to spontaneously make mistakes on a small
fraction of hundreds of trials in simple computer games that are far removed from daily life. Further, the ERN is
quite sensitive to interpretation of the task instructions. The balance N1 is a comparable biomarker of error
processing that can be evoked by a sudden disturbance to standing balance. Unlike the ERN, the errors that
evoke the balance N1 are encountered in daily life, are under full experimental control, and evoke an
involuntary behavioral reaction that requires no prior instruction, eliminating many of the problems with
measuring the ERN. Further, the balance N1 is substantially larger in amplitude than the ERN and can be
robustly observed in single trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that the balance N1 and ERN amplitudes are
correlated within younger and older adult populations, suggesting the balance N1 may provide a robust
measurement of the same underlying neural system. In the proposed project, the balance N1 and ERN will be
measured in 128 children (ages 9-12, N=64 with anxiety disorders and N=64 without). While replicating prior
findings that the ERN is enhanced in clinically anxious children, this project will be the first to test whether the
balance N1 is similarly enhanced in anxious children (Aim 1). Then, this project will test whether the balance
N1 and ERN amplitudes are correlated within and across both groups of children, and assess whether they
account for unique or overlapping variance in anxiety status (Aim 2). The anxious children will then be
randomized into a single-session computer-based intervention targeting hyperactive error monitoring or a
control condition focused on healthy lifestyle choices. Our goal is to demonstrate that an intervention targeting
hyperactive error monitoring can reduce the ERN—and test whether this effect transfers to a similar reduction
of the balance N1 to test for shared underlying mechanisms (Aim 3). The proposed study may yield a
biomarker of anxiety that is more robust and easier to measure than the ERN. Transfer of the intervention
effect to the balance N1 would provide insight into prior work demonstrating that balance training can alleviate
anxiety in young children, and well-documented benefits of psychotherapy to balance disorders. Collectively,
these data may facilitate the development of multidisciplinary interventions for anxiety in children that target
activity of the brain’s error monitoring system. This project will provide training in the use of event-related
potential based biomarkers to study developmental psychopathology in a clinical research project to support
the applicant’s long-term goal of investigating overlapping neural mechanisms of motor, cognitive, and
psychiatric problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."

“buckets” of cells of a given lineage (T, B, ILC, myeloid) that encompass the range of phenotypic variation
within a lineage, internally validated by using F1 intercross mice as donors, relating genetic variation in TF-
binding motifs with chromatin activation. These multilayered data will serve as input for ongoing Artificial
Intelligence decoding of regulatory networks underlying immunocyte differentiation. 3: From Data to Public

Meiosis is the cell division process that is essential for sexual reproduction because it creates haploid gametes
from diploid precursor cells. Chromosome segregation during meiosis I (MI) is unique because replicated sister
chromatids remain attached to one another while homologous chromosome pairs segregate. In humans,
mistakes in MI occur are strikingly high in female gametes (oocytes), resulting in infertility, miscarriage, or birth
defects, yet the molecular mechanisms that control MI are poorly understood. Work in our lab has been
instrumental in dissecting the signaling mechanisms used to control MI to explain this phenomenon.
The Aurora protein kinase family is comprised of three members: AURKA, AURKB and AURKC. The AURKs
are essential regulators of chromosome segregation in mitosis, and their activities are required for completing
MI chromosome segregation. AURKC expression is limited to gametes and is aberrantly expressed in some
cancers. Yet, because AURKC shares high sequence homology with AURKB standard approaches to
understand their MI-specific functions were not sufficient. Our expertise in creating and evaluating oocyte-
specific AURK knockout mice has afforded us the ability to unravel the mystery of why oocytes contain two
kinases that are similar to one another. Not only have we identified AURKB and AURKC functions that are
distinct from one another, we have discovered that the three AURKs regulate one another. In this proposal, we
aim to continue to dissect the requirements for each AURK during MI, and to determine how and why the
AURKs regulate one another. By studying the functions of all three AURK family members, we will uncover the
evolutionary benefit and the consequences of expressing three AURKs. To do so we will: 1) Elucidate how
AURKA and AURKC counter-acting activities are required to build an MI spindle, 2) examine cell lines that
aberrantly express AURKC to determine if these counter-acting activities drive aneuploidy in mitosis, and 3)
determine how AURKB regulates proteins required for the spindle assembly checkpoint during MI.
Information gained from our studies will help us fully understand how these kinases operate during MI while
highlighting distinct differences between how mitosis and MI are controlled. Importantly, these data will shed
light on how MI chromosome segregation is controlled in oocytes and why it commonly goes awry in women
leading to aneuploidy."

This application brings together the clinical strengths and large acute pancreatitis patient population of Virginia
Mason Medical Center's Digestive Disease Institute and Benaroya Research Institute's expertise in
autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes to understand the incidence, clinical course, and potential mechanisms of
autoimmune mediated diabetes after acute pancreatitis. The underlying theme of this application is that
knowledge gained from studying autoimmune diabetes after pancreatitis will provide key insights as to
mechanisms of disease in typical type 1 diabetes.
Review and meta-analysis data suggest that almost 40% of individuals will eventually develop diabetes or pre-
diabetes post-acute pancreatitis. There is, however, inconsistency as to populations included, definitions of
endpoints, and duration of follow-up across studies evaluating acute pancreatitis and diabetes. Thus, the true
incidence and natural history of diabetes post-pancreatitis is not clear. Moreover, while generally considered to
be a consequence of necrosis resulting in beta cell injury or destruction, the relationship between acute
pancreatitis necrosis and incidence of diabetes has recently been questioned and there is limited mechanistic
data from either animal or human studies. Thus, the etiopathology of diabetes post-acute pancreatitis is not well
understood.
In contrast, the natural history of typical type 1 diabetes is well described; autoantibodies are seen in genetically
at-risk individuals, some of whom over time develop beta cell death leading to asymptomatic, followed by
symptomatic dysglycemia eventually requiring exogenous insulin therapy. Evidence for the clear role of the
adaptive immune system in this process include the strong genetic association with class II HLA type, the
presence of cellular infiltrates in cadaver specimens, and the ability of adaptive immune therapy to alter disease
course. What is not clear in typical type 1 diabetes is what underlies the initial triggering of the adaptive immune
system. The increasing incidence of disease over time suggests gene-environment interactions leading to beta
cell injury, yet it remains challenging to identify specific triggers. Since pancreatic damage and innate activation
are known components of acute pancreatitis, the development of diabetes in this setting can allow for
investigation as to how acute tissue injury results in autoimmunity and thus serves as a model system to
understand mechanisms resulting in typical type 1 diabetes. In this proposal, we will determine the incidence
and describe the natural history of diabetes and autoimmunity in individuals after acute pancreatitis (Aim 1), test
the hypothesis that acute pancreatitis resolves to an altered immune state in a subset of individuals that
predisposes them to develop islet autoimmunity (Aim 2), and determine if acute pancreatitis associated
autoimmunity results in immune phenotypes similar to that seen in typical type 1 diabetes (Aim 3)."

OVERALL: Project Summary/Abstract
Mayo Clinic is one of the largest not‐for‐profit, academic health systems, top-ranked for quality more often than
any other health care organization. It has integrated operations in 5 U.S. states, and more than 1 million people
came to Mayo Clinic for care last year. Clinical and translational science (CTS) is a fundamental and highly
valued element of Mayo Clinic; indeed, all research at Mayo Clinic is directed towards translation of scientific
knowledge to improve patient care, with almost 60% of our NIH funding base classified as clinical research or
trials. In recognition of the importance of continued advances in CTS to the Mayo Clinic mission, our
institutional leadership has entrusted the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCaTS)
to be the engine of translational innovation and the institutional advocate for CTS and translational research.
CCaTS has served as a CTS innovation incubator for numerous efforts that were created with CCaTS funding
and are now supported by the institution. The overall vision of CCaTS is to enable high-quality, team-based
multidisciplinary research that accelerates clinical trial innovation, facilitates digital health transformation, and
partners with our stakeholders and communities to improve patient care and health for all people. Our team-
based culture has been described as one of “boundarylessness,” wherein organizational barriers are removed
to enable talent, innovation, and knowledge to converge where needed. In this context and that of our
longstanding commitment to patient-focused research, we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the following
Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will simplify and accelerate the work of translation to improve health for all by
advancing clinical trial innovations and digital health transformations, streamlining methods and processes,
and developing novel informatics solutions that increase efficiency and drive implementation of discoveries that
improve health and promote health equity. In Aim 2, we will enhance our education programs through the
expanded reach of competency-based, learner-focused solutions, training a diverse, inclusive, multidisciplinary
CTS workforce to be prepared to address the urgent health care needs of all communities in a rapidly changing
environment. In Aim 3, we will engage local community members and patients to be active partners in
translational teams, expanding research capabilities of underserved communities, including rural populations.
Our goal is to improve health and reduce health inequities by helping these communities realize the benefits of
CTS. In Aim 4, we will expand national and regional partnerships and strengthen collaborative CTS networks
in all aspects of CTS and education, focusing on sharing innovative approaches and prioritizing diversity,
equity, and inclusion, with the goal of improving human health and advancing health equity. In summary,
sustained investment in CCaTS will enable us to continue to meet ongoing and emergent challenges in health
care for all, as exemplified by our response to support communities through the COVID-19 crisis.

10897990,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy is a painful, debilitating, and chronic tendon pathology. Rehabilitation
exercises are the first treatment option for patients, but clinical studies have reported 20-60% of patients
continue to experience pain and symptoms 5-years later. Despite these poor outcomes, rehabilitation protocols
remain standardized because of insufficient evidence to support precision care. Our Parent R01 project will
determine similarities in tendon loading and biomechanics in patients with mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy
and how these similarities affect tendon healing, pain, and functional outcomes. In this Ancillary R01, we will
leverage our innovative High-Density surface ElectroMyoGraphy (HDsEMG) interface to measure the plantar
flexor neuromechanics during isolated ankle testing using dynamometry and functional tasks during walking on
differing grades. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the relative contributions of the primary plantar flexor
muscles can be modified by changing the knee angle during isolated and functional tasks. We will use this
experimental model system to test the mechanistic link between plantar flexor neuromechanics, Achilles
tendon loading biomechanics, and patient outcomes. In Aim 1, we will define neuromechanical profiles across
Achilles tendinopathy disease progression. In Aim 2, we will link neuromechanical profiles with Achilles tendon
loading profiles and stress imaging. By leveraging our large and well-characterized cohort of individuals with
Achilles tendinopathy, this Ancillary R01 will establish how neuromechanical mechanisms (Ancillary R01)
mediate complex biomechanical loading profiles of pathologic Achilles tendinopathy (Parent R01). This is a
necessary next step to develop precision rehabilitation that factor patient-specific neuromechanics and Achilles
tendon biomechanics. After successfully completing our proposed aims, we will test the clinical efficacy of
precision neuromechanical rehabilitation in a randomized clinical trial."
10897991,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading neurodegenerative disease of aging with devasting effects on all
cognitive functions of patients and a great toll on caregivers and the health system. Given the recent failures of
disease-modifying drugs, the current focus is in preventing or mitigating synaptic damage that correlates with
cognitive decline in AD patients. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive, non-
painful electrical stimulation of the brain that is shown to act as a primer at the synaptic level when administered
along with behavioral therapy, mostly involving language, learning and memory. Previous studies have shown
that tDCS over the left angular gyrus (AG) improves language associative learning in the elderly through changes
in functional connectivity between the AG and the hippocampus. Our previous, double-blind, sham controlled,
clinical trial on the effects of tDCS in neurodegenerative disorders has also shown augmented effects of lexical
retrieval for tDCS. With regard to the mechanisms of tDCS effects in the brain, tDCS modulates the functional
connectivity between the stimulated area and other task-related areas, as well as the inhibitory neurotransmitter
GABA. In the present study we will compare the effects of active vs. sham tDCS over the AG—an area that is
part of the default mode network (DMN) but also a language area, particularly important for semantic integration
and event processing—in two predominant AD variants: probable AD with amnesic phenotype and probable AD
with non-amnesic (language deficit) phenotype also described as logopenic variant PPA with AD pathology
(aphasic AD). We aim to: (1) determine whether active high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the left AG
combined with a Word-List Learning Intervention (WordLLI) will improve verbal learning; (2) identify the changes
in functional connectivity between the stimulated area (AG) and other structurally and functionally connected
areas using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), i.e., areas of the default mode network
(DMN); (3) identify changes in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the stimulation site and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Furthermore, in order to determine whether the new neuromodulatory
approaches are effective in alleviating AD symptoms, we need to determine the characteristics of the people that
benefit from it. For this reason, to identify responders, we will evaluate neural (functional and structural
connectivity), cognitive (memory, executive and language) functions, and physiological characteristics such as
sleep, and we will analyze their moderating effects on verbal learning outcomes. A complementary group of
experts in neurorehabilitation, clinical trials methodology, imaging methodology and statistics (rsfMRI and MRS)
and sleep who have already published together will be collaborating in this comprehensive study. Study results
can help: (i) optimize future intervention in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders by providing treatment
alternatives; and (ii) provide better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory effects of tDCS in AD,
to impede neurodegeneration and improve patients' and caregivers’ quality of life."

10897999,"Abstract
This project aims to develop and commercialize the Volumetric Calcium Imaging 2-Photon Activity Microscope,
vCAm™, a revolutionary new 2-photon microscope based on a technological breakthrough called Light Beads
Microscopy (LBM) that was recently developed by Dr. Alipasha Vaziri and co-workers (Lab. Neurotechnol.
Biophys., Rockefeller Univ., New York, NY). The game-changing innovation in the vCAm is the ability to perform
unparalleled in vivo calcium imaging of individual neurons at cellular resolution nearly simultaneously in one or
more cytoarchitectonic regions of the mouse cerebral cortex, and nearly simultaneously in 30 imaging planes
each ~16 µm apart (i.e., up to a total depth of 500 µm, encompassing layers I-V) at a full-frame rate of at least
12 Hertz. These capabilities are crucial for ultimately correlating stimuli and/or behavioral states of an animal
discretely, in a context-dependent manner, with the activity of all neurons in the brain of the animal that are
involved in this process, which requires simultaneous recording of the activity of hundreds of thousands of
neurons in a multi-regional and multi-layer manner. However, contemporary 2-photon microscopy suffers from
a fundamental limitation. Neuroscience researchers need to record simultaneous interactions between the
sensory, motor and visual regions of the brain, but it is difficult to capture the activity in such a broad volume of
the brain without sacrificing resolution or speed. The LBM technology pushes the limits of imaging speed to the
physical nature of fluorescence itself by eliminating the “dead time” between sequential laser pulses when no
neuroactivity is recorded and at the same time the need for scanning. With this approach, the only limit to the
rate at which samples can be recorded is the time that it takes the tags to fluoresce, meaning wide volumes of
the brain can be recorded within the same time it would take a conventional two-photon microscope to capture
a much smaller number of brain cells. Other technology, such as miniaturized 2-photon microscopes that can be
carried on the head of freely moving rodents, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting electrodes into
the brain, or fiber photometry do not fulfill this need. This project will improve upon the original LBM invention to
create a commercial product for disseminating this important new technology. Based on pilot work performed at
Dr. Vaziri's laboratory, it is clear that the vCAm will make a significant impact on the field of neuroscience
research, including advancing studies focused on alterations in the circuitry of the central nervous system
associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will
result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain
diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware
and software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the vCAm for commercial release.
We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of the vCAm in close
collaboration with Dr. Vaziri. A competing technology is not commercially available."

HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) is a significant comorbid condition for people living with HIV/
AIDS (PLWH). HAND is associated with HIV-induced neurotoxicity that dysregulates, injures, and in severe
cases, causes death of neurons in the key brain regions that regulate neurocognition. Combined antiretroviral
therapy (cART) inhibits active HIV-1 replication; but it has not reduced the prevalence of HAND, as it occurs in
30~50% of PLWH and is expected to increase as PLWH age. Notably, Cocaine (Coc) Use Disorders (CUD) are
comorbid with HAND in many cases and worsen it severely. Ironically, although cART is absolutely necessary
for treating HIV/AIDS, emerging data point to cART as a potential contributor to HAND through cART-induced
neurotoxicity. This raises key questions regarding if chronic cART contributes to neurological/neurocognitive
deficits linked to HAND; and how it alters brain neuron activity in the context of neuroHIV and CUD; both are the
focus of this proposal. Our studies suggest that cART induces neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC, a key regulator of neurocognition and addiction), similar to that well-described in
neuroHIV and CUD mediated by overactive voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (L-channels) and NMDA
receptors (NMDARs). Dysfunction of mPFC pyramidal neurons is linked to HAND, CUD and many other neuro-
degenerative diseases. Thus, we hypothesize that cART-induced mPFC neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation worsens
similar dysfunction caused by neuroHIV and Coc; and that is reduced by combined antagonism of L -channel/
NMDAR overactivation. We will determine the effects of cART, neuroHIV and Coc on mPFC pyramidal neurons,
and elucidate their underlying mechanism. Specifically, we will use three combined rat models of (i) cART
(chronic Triumeq, a 1st-line cART regimen consisting of 3 antiretroviral drugs - abacavir, dolutegravir and
lamivudine), (ii) neuroHIV (HIV-1 transgenic rats), and (iii) Coc abuse (Coc self-administration, Coc-SA), to
elucidate the long-term effects of cART in vivo on mPFC neuronal activity and their mechanism in the context of
neuroHIV and CUD (Aim1); define the effects of chronic cART on interactive astrocyte/neuron dysfunction in the
mPFC under neuroHIV and CUD conditions (Aim2); and identify the effects of combined antagonism of
excessive Ca2+ influx/ [Ca2+]in that alleviate neuronal activity and cognitive behavior in the context of neuroHIV/
CUD (Aim3). Further, we will also define HIV/cART/Coc-induced neuron/astrocyte dysfunction in post-mortem
HIV+ human brains (Exploratory Aim) to provide additional support for the principal concept and hypothesis of
this proposal. Together, the proposed research will elucidate the mechanism by which neuroHIV, chronic cART
in vivo and Coc-SA, individually and jointly, alter mPFC neuronal activity, and in such process identify the key
mechanistic targets that will inform therapeutic intervention for HAND and CUD in the era of cART."

In this K23 proposal, I outline a comprehensive 5-year training program that will support my transition towards an
independent investigator focused on the development and rigorous testing of interventions for dyads (i.e., pairs) of persons
living with dementia (PWDs) and their informal care-partners, with an emphasis on early intervention. In this application,
I propose a significant and innovative proposal that is directly tied with my proposed training and career development
goals. Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) produce a host of stressors for PWDs and their
spousal care-partners (SPs), who both experience substantial emotional distress after diagnosis. Emotional distress is
interdependent within dyads and – without treatment—becomes chronic and negatively impacts both partners' health,
quality of life, and their ability to navigate the short and long-term challenges associated with ADRDs. Addressing
emotional distress early, when PWDs can still meaningfully participate, is an unexplored opportunity to prevent chronic
emotional distress and preserve quality of life for both partners. Specific aims and research design: I aim to develop the
first version of the live video Resilient Together for Dementia (RT-D) intervention and methodology via 1) interviews and
quantitative surveys (N=20) of PWD-SP dyads, with additional feedback from 2) focus groups with ADRD medical
stakeholders (N=4) (Aim 1). Next, I will explore, via an open pilot (N=5 dyads) with exit interviews and pre-post self-
report assessments, the initial feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of the live video RT-D and procedures, and to
further refine RT-D as needed (Aim 2). Finally, I will establish, via a pilot feasibility RCT of the RT-D versus control (N=
up to 50 dyads), the feasibility, acceptability and credibility of RT-D following predetermined benchmarks (Aim 3).
Findings will inform a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial through the R01 mechanisms and future studies extending this
work to include additional family members and other care-partners. Training and mentoring: My aims are supported by
3 training goals to develop expertise in: 1) qualitative and mixed methods assessment to inform intervention adaptation; 2)
specialty training in geriatrics and ADRD clinical care; 3) clinical trial methodology to facilitate dyadic intervention
development and refinement. I will obtain mentorship from an exemplary team led by my primary mentor Dr. Ana-Maria
Vranceanu, a clinical health psychologist with expertise in mixed-methods research and live video dyadic intervention
development, and my co-mentor Dr. Christine Ritchie, a geriatrician and palliative care physician with decades of work
improving the treatment of ADRD. My training goals are supported by 1) a team of expert mentors, 2) a rich institutional
environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and 3) targeted coursework, scientific
meetings, seminars and planned publications. Relevance to the NIA mission. This K23 is in line with NIAs priorities to
develop interventions to the maintain health and wellbeing and reduce the burden of ADRDs. Impact: I am a clinical
psychologist with expertise in couple and family interventions for neurological populations. The experience gained will
serve as the foundation for an independent career in dyadic interventions for ADRDs, with a focus on early intervention."

Genetic studies, first done in model eukaryotes and more recently in mammals, have revealed that
homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) plays a critical role in the elimination of DNA double-strand
breaks and in the preservation of stressed or injured DNA replication forks. HDR is reliant on the tumor
suppressors BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2, and PALB2, mutations in which cause breast, ovarian, and other
cancers. Progress in understanding how these tumor suppressors help mediate HDR and how their
mutational inactivation impacts upon genome integrity has been hampered by the challenge of purifying
them for mechanistic studies. Our research team has overcome this challenge, which uniquely
positions us to decipher the mechanisms by which these tumor suppressors support HDR. In
conjunction with a growing research team in the NCI-designated Mays Cancer Center at the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and with external collaborators who are leaders in
structural biology and single-molecule biophysics, we will dissect the underlying mechanisms of
different stages of HDR, to specifically furnish insights regarding the roles of the aforementioned tumor
suppressors therein. We will also pursue chemical screens and synthesis with the Cancer Prevention
and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)-supported Center for Innovative Drug Discovery to develop
inhibitors of HDR to use as a chemical biology tool and for preclinical studies. We are confident that our
holistic approach to deciphering HDR mechanisms will provide the foundation for developing targeted
cancer diagnostics and therapeutics."

The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism(s) by which PD-L1 reverse signaling in dendritic cells
(DC) initiates DC trafficking, T cell priming and T cell programming during cutaneous infection. Our studies
have outlined a major role for PD-L1 reverse signaling in the control of DC migration from the skin to the
draining lymph node. Intriguingly, this loss of migration appears to be dependent on TLR stimulation or
infections that initiate type 1 IFN signaling. These findings are consistent with PD-L1 acting to mitigate type 1
IFN signaling events. We also outline a requirement for PD-L1 reverse signaling in chemokine, but not S1P,
responsiveness demonstrating a new role for PD-L1 in regulating chemokine signaling. Finally, we find T cell
priming in the lymph node is significantly decreased in the absence of PD-L1 reverse signaling. However,
these defects in T cell priming only occur when DC trafficking is required, and not when antigens drain directly
through the lymphatics and to the LN nor following systemic infection. Therefore, in this proposal we aim to
better understand the requirements for PD-L1 reverse signaling in dendritic cell transmigration through the
lymphatic capillaries. We also aim to understand how the extracellular and intracellular domains of PD-L1 may
control responsiveness to chemokines. Finally, we aim to address the contribution of DC retention in the skin
caused by loss of PD-L1 signaling to tissue resident memory responses established after vaccinia scarification."

10904548,"Many high-resolution structures of the cross-β core of amyloid ﬁbrils have been solved using solid-state NMR and cryo-electron microscopy in recent years. However, most ﬁbrils important in neurodegenerative diseases, as for example α-synuclein (aSyn) ﬁbrils found in in Lewy body dementia (LBD) and other synucleinopathies, have sizable intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) surrounding their ordered cross-β ﬁbril core. These IDRs are part of the ﬁbril surface, where they can interact with ﬁbril-speciﬁc binders and be important for ﬁbril toxicity. Therefore, determining the residual structure and dynamics of these IDRs, how they interact with other cellular components, and how they relate to ﬁbril toxicity is the next logical step in the LBD and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (ADRD) ﬁeld. The goal of this proposal is to determine the conformational ensemble and dynamics of the IDRs from aSyn ﬁbrils important in LBD, ADRD and other synucleinopathies. The N and especially the C-terminus of aSyn are intrinsically disordered in the ﬁbril. These IDRs are binding sites for ﬁbril-speciﬁc interactors such as the co-chaperone DNAJB1. Our central hypothesis is that a speciﬁc ﬁbril core structure (polymorph) will determine the residual structure and dynamics of these IDRs and consequently the interaction with ﬁbrils-speciﬁc binders. The rationale of this research is that only complete molecular models of amyloid ﬁbrils that include their IDRs will allow us to determine polymorph-speciﬁc binding partners, which can explain the diﬀerence between LBD and other synucleinopathies. These complete molecular models will not only point to natural interactors, but also to disease-speciﬁc biomarkers and therapeutics for LBD as well as ADRD and other synucleinopathies. We will use a combination of solid-state NMR, EPR, and molecular dynamics simulations to test our hypothesis using three speciﬁc aims. Aim 1 is to determine the change in residual structure and dynamics of IDRs upon ﬁbril formation. Based on the known core structure and our conformational ensemble of the IDRs, we will create a model of the entire ﬁbril. Aim 2 is to determine the eﬀect of ﬁbril polymorphs on residual structure and dynamics of IDRs. We will show to what degree a speciﬁc cross-β core determines the conformational ensemble of its adjacent IDRs and determine the cytotoxicity of diﬀerent aSyn polymorphs and chimeras. Aim 3 is to determine the eﬀect of the ﬁbril core on aSyn-DNAJB1 interaction. Here, our hypothesis is that ﬁbril formation increases the accessibility of the DNAJB1 binding site and that some ﬁbril cores found in LBD and other synucleinopathies do this better than others. These aims will (i) determine the changes in the IDRs outside the ﬁbril core upon ﬁbril formation and result in a whole ﬁbril model. We will (ii) learn how speciﬁc cross-β core structures found in LBD and other synucleinopathies change the conformational ensemble and dynamics of the IDRs, and (iii) we will understand how these changes inﬂuence the interaction of speciﬁc binders, in our case DNAJB1. Together these advances will facilitate the development of new approaches to diagnose and treat LBD and ADRD."
10904528,"Surgical repair of congenital heart defects is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most pediatric open-
heart surgeries involve cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A core challenge for these patients is the systemic inflammation
and resultant multi-organ dysfunction that occurs in response to CPB. This issue remains an intractable problem despite
changes to surgical techniques and corticosteroid administration. Our long-term goals are to understand how the
physiological insults present during CPB promote post-CPB inflammation and translate this knowledge into new CPB
designs and treatment strategies. The scientific premise for this project is that red blood cells (RBCs) contribute to CPB
associated inflammation by activating innate immunity responses. An emerging body of literature suggests that RBCs can
actively modulate innate immunity responses. The non-physiologic stimuli present during CPB, particularly elevated shear
stress, can induce significant phenotypic changes in the RBCs. For neonatal and pediatric patients, CPB typically involves
exposure to exogenous RBCs in the form of “blood priming” of the CPB circuit that may contribute to systemic
inflammation after CPB. Current clinical efforts to perform CPB with “clear prime”, filling the circuit with crystalloid fluids,
provide a unique opportunity to examine how exposure to exogenous RBCs propagates CPB associated inflammation.
Thus, we hypothesize that endogenous and exogenous RBCs injured by supraphysiological shear stress, contribute to the
activation of innate immunity responses that drive the post-CPB systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction.
Aim 1. Determine the RBC phenotype changes caused by exposure to the supraphysiologic shear stresses present in the
CPB circuit. We postulate that supraphysiologic shear stress injures the RBCs, inducing phenotypic changes that cause
them to become pro-inflammatory. We will perform computational simulations and in vitro experiments to uncover the
shear thresholds (both intensity and duration) and molecular mechanisms involved in the CPB-associated pro-
inflammatory RBC injury, which will be validated using samples from pediatric CPB patients.
Aim 2. Does CPB promote erythrophagocytosis that exacerbates myeloid cell activation? We postulate that the
interactions between RBCs and circulating leukocytes exacerbate the shear- mediated activation of inflammatory
phenotypes of the circulating myeloid cells. This aim will will use in vitro experiments, patient samples, and a piglet model
of CPB to determine if CPB increases erythrophagocytosis and if erythrophagocytosis activates myeloid cells.
Aim 3. Determine if clear priming of CPB circuit reduces CPB associated inflammation. We postulate that the exogenous
RBCs used to prime the CPB circuit activate myeloid cells during CPB. In vitro experiments and a pilot clinical study in
pediatric patients will determine if using “clear prime” can ameliorate CPB-associated inflammation. Furthermore, we will
study if there are differences in clinical outcomes between the clear primed and blood primed patients.
This research is novel and significant – the proposed mechanistic and clinical experiments could give rise to a new
treatment paradigm for CPB patients, improve outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs by identifying potential molecular
targets and supporting the shift towards “clear prime” for CPB to limit the contributions of RBCs to inflammation."

The Nutrition to Optimize, Understand, and Restore Insulin Sensitivity in HIV for Oklahoma (NOURISH-OK)
Study uses a cross-cutting research design that is widely-applicable to the prevention and treatment of many
chronic co-morbidities in HIV disease. It uses a community-based participatory orientation to maximize inclusion
of minorities and other underrepresented populations, which also ensures study findings will be relevant,
actionable, and yield the greatest potential for reducing health disparities. Broadly, NOURISH-OK will elucidate
nutritional and non-nutritional behavioral risk pathways linking food insecurity to insulin resistance among low-
income people living with HIV. Its primary focus will be rigorous evaluation and manipulation of dietary intake as
an influential pathway, which is complemented by secondary investigation of additional biological pathways,
including chronic inflammation and microbiome. The study will be conducted in Oklahoma, and include HIV-
positive individuals living in urban and rural communities. It is comprised of three aims. First, the research team
will test and refine a conceptual integrated framework of food insecurity and insulin resistance to identify
significant structural, social, behavioral, and biological pathways as candidate intervention points. This aim will
be accomplished using a cross-sectional survey (n=500) and a one-month observational sub-study from the
main study sample (n=100) to collect intensive measures of dietary intake and gut microbiome samples. Data
analysis will adjust for measurement error in dietary intake using replicate recalls from the sub-study. Structural
equation modeling will be used to test the study’s overall conceptual multi-level framework of food insecurity and
insulin resistance. Second, the research team will then adapt a home-delivered grocery and cooking self-care
NOURISH-OK intervention to address key nutrition disparities and other health risk behaviors identified as
significant path contributors to insulin resistance among people living with HIV. This adaptation will be informed
by findings from the first aim, and further refined and finalized through a series of interviews and focus groups
with people living with HIV who are food insecure (n=56 qualitative study subjects). Third, the research team will
implement the 12-week NOURISH-OK intervention and assess it for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
impact using a randomized wait-list control design (n=270). This study will use a simple randomized wait-list
control trial design with stratification by geography (urban/rural) and further stratification in the urban group by
low and very low food security status. Primary study outcomes include insulin resistance, along with multiple
secondary outcomes that are also strongly relevant to the mission of NIDDK. These secondary outcomes include
dietary intake and nutritional status, chronic inflammation, health risk behaviors, including tobacco use, physical

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are vital for maintaining immunological self-tolerance and restraining overreactive
immune responses against infection. Aberrant Treg cell activity is associated with autoimmune diseases and
unproductive immune responses against tumors. An insufficient understanding of the molecular mechanisms
that govern Treg cell biology is one of the critical barriers hampering development of effective Treg cell-based
therapies for autoimmunity and cancer. Post-transcriptional control of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs)
has recently emerged as an essential genetic element for Treg cell differentiation and function. Thus, the objective
of this proposal is to gain better understanding of how individual miRNAs control central aspects of Treg cell
biology. Closing of this knowledge gap may allow us to develop novel, targeted immunotherapies for treatment
of Treg cell-mediated diseases. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate the function of miR-142 in Treg cells. Our
results using genetic knockout mouse models indicate that miR-142 is an indispensable regulator of Treg cell-
mediated immunosuppression. We uncovered two distinct roles for miR-142 in Treg cells: it promotes thymic Treg
cell differentiation and positively regulates mature Treg cell homeostasis and suppressive activity. Moreover, we
mechanistically linked the impaired function of mature miR-142-deficient Treg cells with excessive IFNg production
and signaling, and identified several IFNg-associated genes as direct molecular targets of miR-142. Thus, our
overall hypothesis is that miR-142 plays a crucial role in thymic Treg cell development and controls Treg cell
abundance and functional activity. Furthermore, we posit that miR-142 regulates mature Treg cell homeostasis
and suppressive function by attenuating production of and responsiveness to IFNg. We will test our central
hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of miR-142 in thymic Treg cell
development and define its mode of action. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of inducible miR-142 depletion
on Treg cell homeostasis and suppressive function in the context of antitumor immune response. Finally, in Aim
3, we will identify the molecular mechanism of miR-142-mediated control of Treg cell activity. To that end, we will
determine how dysregulated IFNg signaling impacts the immunosuppressive activity and homeostasis of
miR-142-deficient Treg cells. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our
understanding of miRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying the control of Treg cell function and immune
tolerance. Additionally, this study may potentially lay a foundation for developing a novel miR-142-based
therapeutic strategy for modulating Treg cell activity in cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease settings."

This proposal seeks to test a novel hypothesis and approach towards a vaccine to prevent HIV. We recently
demonstrated efficacy against infection against pathogenic SIVmac251 challenge using an accessory antigen
vaccine and MHC-II presentation system. Initially we proposed that by using a novel and innovative vaccine
design based entirely on conserved accessory antigens, and a novel MHC vectored system that we could
achieve protection from pathogenic SIV infection. Our success using these accessory antigens alone was
remarkable, but not total, as 4/6 animals eventually became infected despite vaccination. However, we now
have amassed evidence that our only mistake was to include tat in the original vaccine, which we now suspect
is (like HIV env and gag) produced in abundance in acute infection to “decoy” and thwart the initial immune
responses to infection, as well as induce pro-inflammatory and type 1 immune response which actually serve
to benefit primary and sustained chronic HIV infection by amplifying the target cells necessary for successful
HIV transmission, and to exhaust or eliminate the most sensitive structural antigen specific T cell
precursors. Not only does this hypothesis explain how HIV infection occurs and is closely followed by a
massive T cell activation, it also explains why the infection results in chronic immune activation, why vaccine
responses to Gag, Tat, or Env are inevitably ineffective, and also why the immune system cannot regain the
control of HIV infection either naturally or after prolonged antiretroviral treatment. If our hypothesis is correct,
this may have dogma changing implications and may lead to an effective vaccine. Our scientific premise is that
prior vaccine candidates have failed mainly because immune responses directed against early and abundantly
produced Gag, Env, and Tat are detrimental to the host, and in fact supportive of viral replication, as they
promote proinflammatory responses that support infection with this CD4+ T cell tropic virus, and induce
primary immune responses to irrelevant antigens. Here we propose that a vaccine designed entirely using
subdominant antigens and antigen fragments that are not “cross presented” (Rev, Vpr, Vif, and a conserved
Env region) presented using an innovative MHC-II presentation strategy, and therefore not exhausted or
contributing to excessive inflammation during acute infection, may overcome these viral mechanisms, resulting
in a protective vaccine that could be effective against all HIV clades and strains."

 Young skeletal muscle displays remarkable resilience following an acute injury event, evidenced by a
robust regenerative response and functional recovery. In contrast, even a relatively minor injury to aged
muscle can result in significant functional impairments owing to compromised regeneration. Numerous studies
have identified muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a major culprit in the failed healing response of aged muscle.
MuSCs represent a reserve cell population that play a primary role in muscle regeneration. However, with
aging, MuSCs display a myogenic-to-fibrogenic conversion, resulting in fibrosis at the expense of myofiber
regeneration. Although cell-autonomous deficits play an important role in cellular declines with aging, the
contribution of biophysical cues from the surrounding microenvironment has been increasingly appreciated.
 Tissue regeneration involves a tightly-regulated and bi-directional communication between stem cells and
their biophysical microenvironment. Elegant in vitro studies have demonstrated that substrates engineered to
mimic the elasticity typical of young, healthy muscle promoted stem cell myogenicity, whereas stiffer substrates
drove stem cell chondrogenic/osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, compositional and physical changes in the
extracellular matrix (ECM) similarly exert deleterious effects on stem cell function. We and others have shown
that age-related alterations in ECM biophysical features contribute to disrupted MuSC lineage specification.
Whereas the bulk of studies to date, including our own, have focused on the direct effects of the ECM on stem
cell responses through mechanotransductive signaling cascades, our latest data suggest a novel role of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in mediating the effect of the ECM on stem cell responses. We have found that
substrates engineered to mimic the stiffness of aged skeletal muscle promoted the cellular release of EVs that
inhibited MuSC myogenicity. In contrast, EVs released by cells seeded on substrates designed to mimic the
stiffness of young skeletal muscle induced robust myotube formation. Aim 1 studies will investigate whether
and how aging of the skeletal muscle ECM shifts the molecular cargoes of muscle EVs, resulting in
compromised MuSC myogenicity and functional regeneration.
 While aging is associated with ECM stiffening, mechanical loading increases tissue elasticity and promotes
ECM remodeling. Exercise has also been associated with enhanced muscle regeneration, though many
questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying these benefits. Our data suggest that muscle activity
shifts EV cargoes in favor of enhanced MuSC myogenic lineage specification, effects we hypothesize to be
responsive to ECM remodeling. Aim 2 studies will mechanistically interrogate the ability of muscle
activity to rejuvenate ECM biophysical features and the biomolecular signatures of EVs in support of
MuSC myogenicity and functional muscle regeneration."

This proposal seeks to improve our understanding of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) by
developing a more comprehensive view of its genetic architecture. It aims to leverage large-scale biobanks and
Electronic Medical Records (EMR) to systematically study the genetic structure of AD/ADRD over time across a
broad spectrum of phenotypes, and in diverse populations.
 The proposal emphasizes several key areas. First, it underscores the need to integrate age dependency
and cross-phenotype dependency into the genetic architecture for AD/ADRD. The motivation comes from the
increasing evidence that genetic expression changes throughout an individual's life, and co-morbid conditions
may inﬂuence the progression of AD/ADRD as individuals age. To facilitate this goal, we will curate a compre-
hensive set of age-dependent phenotypes and develop a new network-based approach to uncover genetic links
to complex disease networks and their interactions with AD/ADRD throughout the life course.
 Second, the proposal capitalizes on using large-scale biobanks and EMR, important data resources for
AD/ADRD research. The proposal aims to enhance the use of these richly phenotyped and longitudinal data
resources to deepen our understanding of the genetic architecture of AD/ADRD, and consequently provide in-
sights on potential therapeutic targets and early prevention strategies. That includes a new deep-learning-based
imputation algorithm to handle the informative missing data in EMR, and semi-supervised learning algorithms to
enhance statistical power.
 Third, the proposal aims to address methodological gaps in Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS).
This includes proposing new phenotyping algorithms to curate age-related phenotypes, formulating an innovative
statistical framework, high-dimensional Dynamic Exponential graphical model (DEG), for a more comprehensive
and dynamic view, and handling missing data imputation to integrate lab values into the methods, and developing
analytical strategies to enhance the robustness and power of such analyses.
 By targeting these key areas, this proposal has the potential to signiﬁcantly advance AD/ADRD research, offer
deeper insights into its genetic architecture, and improve early prevention and treatment strategies."

Patients with a history of acute pancreatitis (AP) are at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus (DM),
affecting about 1 in 4 patients after AP. Clinical risk factors are poorly understood, and mechanisms leading to
development of DM after AP are unknown. We propose to study risk for and mechanisms underlying
development of DM after AP; specifically we will study the contributions of beta cell autoimmunity, defects in
insulin secretion, and insulin resistance to DM after AP.
In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) insulin deficiency results from targeted autoimmune destruction of the islet
β-cells; this autoimmunity is triggered by unknown environmental exposures in genetically susceptible
individuals. We hypothesize that tissue injury combined with an altered inflammatory milieu during AP activates
β-cell autoimmunity (T1DM) in a subset of patients with AP-related DM. Our preliminary data collectively
suggests an increased signal of β-cell autoimmunity in patients with recurrent AP or chronic pancreatitis and
DM. We hypothesize that patients who develop DM after AP will have reduced insulin secretion (due to
pancreatic injury), reduced insulin sensitivity, and a subset will have β-cell autoimmunity.
Our overall goal is to establish a carefully phenotyped multi-center longitudinal cohort of adults diagnosed with
AP to determine clinical risk factors for DM, define metabolic dysfunction in AP-DM, and determine the
immunologic contributions to AP-DM. The University of Minnesota-Clinical Center investigators are leaders in
the fields of AP, DM, and T1DM immunology and are ideally suited to address the consortium objectives. In
Aim 1, we will identify, recruit, and enroll adults (N=1250) consortium-wide at 0 to 3 months after a first
episode of acute pancreatitis for a longitudinal study to advance our understanding of progression to DM after
AP. We will determine clinical risk factors for DM after AP. In Aim 2, we will define mechanistic mechanisms of
AP-related DM by studying 250 patients after AP (from Aim 1) with mixed meal tolerance and frequent sample
intravenous glucose tolerance tests to measure insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. In Aim 3, we will
define immunologic mechanisms of disease by determining the contribution of β-cell autoimmunity in
development of DM after AP. We will perform HLA-typing and β-cell autoantibodies in the entire cohort from
Aim 1 and assess cellular autoimmunity with T-cell and B-cell tetramers in a subset of 60 subjects selected by
DM and AAb status. A separate tissue biobank will be used to evaluate islet infiltrates in recurrent AP.
This work will contribute significantly to both our understanding of pancreatogenic DM and T1DM. In the setting
of AP, better defining the pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease is critical to improving treatment and
delaying or preventing progression to DM. For T1DM, this work provides an avenue to better identify an
important role for islet β-cells as a key trigger for the self-reactive immune cells causing autoimmunity."

This K23 proposal describes a five-year research and training plan to facilitate Dr. Katherine Bell’s transition
into an independent physician-scientist in the field of neonatal nutrition. Dr. Bell is a neonatologist with a strong
foundation in patient-oriented research. Nutrient deficits occurring during the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) hospitalization impair preterm infants’ growth and maturation during a critical period for development of
the body and brain, adversely impacting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The essential micronutrient
zinc is crucial for infant growth and brain development, but the optimal zinc intake for preterm infants is
unknown and current fortification strategies may be insufficient. Accurate assessment of nutritional status in
preterm infants is facilitated by distinguishing lean mass—which reflects organ growth and maturation—from
fat. The goal of this proposal is to determine the association between zinc intake in the NICU and lean mass
accrual (as a marker of nutritional status) and to evaluate the clinical impact of variabilities in zinc intake on
concurrent brain development and later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The hypothesis that greater zinc intake
results in greater lean mass accrual, improved brain growth and maturation, and improved neurodevelopment
will be tested through 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the association of zinc intake in the NICU with lean mass
at term equivalent age. 2) Determine the association between zinc intake in the NICU and brain growth and
maturation. 3) Determine the impact of neonatal zinc intake on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years. This
research is significant for the field of neonatal nutrition, as knowledge gained from this study will help
determine optimal zinc intake for preterm infants and inform the design of nutritional strategies to ensure
adequate micronutrient provision to all preterm infants. Dr. Bell’s mentoring team—Dr. Belfort (primary mentor)
and Dr. Duggan (co-mentor)—provide complementary expertise in preterm infant nutrition and micronutrient
requirements in children, respectively. Dr. Bell will also receive mentorship from distinguished scientists with
expertise in key areas related to this work, including micronutrient biochemistry, breastmilk composition,
neurodevelopmental assessment in childhood, and the developmental origins of disease. The training
opportunities and resources at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science,
and Harvard Medical School are an ideal environment for the candidate’s career development. The candidate’s
institution is strongly committed to her success. Dr. Bell’s detailed career development plan includes mentored
research, didactic coursework including a formal degree in nutrition science, seminars, and presentations at
scientific meetings. She presents a timeline for completion of the research aims and preparation of a future
R01 application. The knowledge and training gained from this K23 award will enable Dr. Bell to develop the
skills and expertise required to launch an independent research career focused on designing micronutrient
interventions to optimize growth and long-term health outcomes for preterm infants."

The Computational Social Science Training Program (CSSTP) at UC Berkeley provides training in advanced
analytics to predoctoral students in the social and behavioral sciences studying health topics covered by the
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child and Human Development. CSSTP is a new program that
combines Berkeley's long-standing strength in quantitative social and behavioral science with its nationally-
recognized campus programs in data science education, practice, and research. It will serve five entering
trainees per year over five years. The training faculty includes 22 social scientists who have exemplary records
of developing and applying novel statistical methods to health-related social/behavioral science problems, as
well as 13 data scientists who are leading figures in the foundations of mathematics, statistics/biostatistics, and
computer science. Trainees, who will be drawn from a diverse pool of students in six social science doctoral
programs, are provided with a rigorous and tailored program designed to teach a team science-based approach
to problem solving and to emphasize the analysis of intensive or voluminous longitudinal data and high-density,
large sample or population level agency databases. Each trainee is supported by a dual-preceptor model in
which s/he is provided with a social sciences faculty mentor and a data science mentor who help to facilitate the
trainee's progress through the program. CSSTP trainees are provided with community space at the Berkeley
Institute for Data Science (BIDS), a dynamic multi-disciplinary data science research center, where trainees
work alongside other data science fellows in residence. After completing their first-year course requirements in
their home departments, trainees formally enter the program in their second year of graduate school, devise an
individual development plan, and take a core two-semester course in computational social science, team-taught
by training faculty. This course introduces students to essential data science methods and tools, including
Python programming, data management, natural language processing, machine learning, causal inference, and
responsible conduct and reproducibility of research, through lectures, in-depth discussion of social science
applications, and small group learning exercises. In the following year, students apply these skills through
placements on collaborative health-related research teams or labs on campus and/or with external industry
partners, thus developing skills in advanced analytics through research practice involving the development and
implementation of new methods. Additional training tailored to student needs and interests is provided through
elective courses, a weekly computational social science workshop series, and ongoing working groups at the
Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the Social Science D-Lab, a campus hub for data science training and
research for social scientists. CSSTPs benefits will ripple out to the greater campus and beyond by stimulating
new faculty collaborations and by creating a critical mass of rigorously trained computational social science
students who will be competitive and qualified for jobs in rapidly changing and evolving data intensive fields."

Early life is a critical period for the proper development of the immune system. As mammalian hosts have co-
evolved with their symbiotic bacteria, signals from the commensal microbiota are crucial for the prevention of
allergy, inflammatory disorders, and protection against enteric pathogens. Our lab has recently uncovered that
commensal antigens are trafficked to the thymus by dendritic cells, where they are presented to developing
thymocytes. Rather than inducing deletion or Treg development, this results in an expansion of naïve microbiota-
specific T cell populations, which are functional and egress to populate the peripheral tissue. This process is
limited to early life, suggesting that it is critical for the establishment of the commensal-reactive T cell repertoire.
Analysis of thymic 16S sequencing from mice at weaning reveals a stark enrichment of select taxa, such as
members of Escherichia. When considering the vast diversity of the intestinal microbiome, these data imply an
antigenic filter through which only select microbes are trafficked to the thymus. This proposal seeks to understand
how the unique environment of the early-life intestine promotes commensal ferrying to the thymus, and the
microbial and host factors that curate specific taxa for sampling by sub-epithelial dendritic cells. My central
hypothesis is that this process has evolved to prioritize the generation of naïve T cell clones capable of
recognizing antigens associated with epithelial invasion. We posit that the signals promoting commensal antigen
trafficking to the thymus are 1) adherence to the intestinal epithelium and 2) opsonization by maternal IgG. As
recent publications have identified commensal-specific IgG as targeting microbes with the ability to translocate,
both of these signals indicate the capacity for epithelial invasion – whether defined by the neonate or by maternal
cues. Preliminary data indicate that non-adherent commensals are significantly underrepresented in the thymic
tissue. I have also found increased expression of the IgG receptor FcRn in migratory thymic DCs in early life,
indicating their enhanced ability to recognize and process IgG-opsonized commensals. In Aim 1, I will quantify
the epithelial adherence of a model commensal E. coli throughout early development. I will genetically target
adhesins in this commensal to determine how these factors impact epithelial adherence and thymic trafficking in
vivo. I will utilize 16S sequencing to compare the mucosa-associated microbiome with that of the thymus. Aim 2
will focus on the role of maternal IgG opsonization, and will quantify thymic trafficking in B cell- and antibody-
deficient mouse models throughout early life development. I will manipulate maternal IgG titers through transfer
of commensal-specific IgG into IgG-deficient dams, and the impacts on thymic trafficking in offspring will be
examined. The proposed experiments will reveal crucial elements of how the commensal-reactive T cell
repertoire is curated in early life, and will have important insight into how the microbiome affects the development
of the mucosal immune system."

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are a group of highly prevalent conditions that affects 1-10% of children
in the United States. These disorders are highly heterogenous and present with a wide range of cognitive, social,
and behavioral deficits. One of the most commonly mutated genes in NDD is ARID1B, which encodes a subunit
of the BRG1/BRM-Associated Factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. BAF complexes establish regions
of accessible chromatin at non-coding cis-regulatory elements (cREs) in the genome, which initates gene
transcription. ARID1B is one of the most enriched genes for de novo mutations in NDD patients, and ARID1B
mutations cause NDDs with a variety of phenotypic manifestations. However, it is not well understood how de
novo coding mutations in ARID1B impact the gene regulatory networks during neuronal development that lead
to NDDs. While de novo mutations in ARID1B lead to NDDs, many NDD patients do not present with a coding
mutation in ARID1B. Genomic studies have shown an excess of de novo mutations in putative cREs in NDD
cohorts, implicating non-coding mutations in the pathogenesis of these disorders. While there is a strong
indication of mutations in cREs in NDDs, the location of cREs that direct the translation of ARID1B are not known,
nor looked at for de novo mutations that can cause NDDs. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, I will investigate
the impact of coding and non-coding mutations in ARID1B on neuronal development. To this end, I will
characterize Arid1b halpoinsufficient mice at the single-cell level that are known to exhibit behavioral and
morphological deficits reminiscent of those seen in NDD patients. This will allow me to identify patterns of
dysregulation to chromatin accessibility and gene expression at multiple timepoints of development. I will also
identify putative enhancer regions of ARID1B using chromatin interaction and single-cell(sc) co-accessibility
datasets. With these data I will be able to characterize enhancers that regulate ARID1B expression. Moreso,
with these data I will identify an enrichment of de novo mutations in enhancers of ARID1B that lead to NDDs.
This work will provide a better understanding of how mutations in coding and non-coding regions of ARID1B and
dysregulate critical molecular mechanisms necessary for normal neuronal development during embryogenesis
that leads to NDDs."

 A quarter of the global population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of
tuberculosis (TB). TB and other mycobacterial diseases are difficult to fight with immune responses or antibiotic
therapy, largely due to the unique structure and composition of the mycobacterial cell envelope. The
mycobacterial cell envelope contains more layers and more diverse lipids than other bacterial cell envelopes,
which provides intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics that can treat other bacterial infections. To fight TB,
we need therapeutic strategies that can overcome the unique barrier properties of the mycobacterial cell
envelope. We therefore need to understand how to rationally disrupt that barrier. My project will address this
need by using Rv3802c as an archetype to study the connection between biological function and the
phenotypes of membrane properties and antibiotic susceptibility. Rv3802c is an essential protein with a
putative role in cell envelope biosynthesis. I hypothesize that Rv3802c remodels the cell envelope to allow for
the deposition of new cell envelope material, and that depletion of Rv3802c will decrease membrane fluidity
and permeability to solutes and antibiotics. The goals of my project are to (1) characterize the biological
function of Rv3802c and (2) determine Rv3820c’s role in regulating membrane barrier properties and antibiotic
resistance. Connecting cell envelope biosynthesis to membrane barrier properties and antibiotic susceptibility
will help fill in a vital gap in knowledge, ultimately paving the way for rational design of novel drugs and
synergistic drug combinations."
10902602,"Treatment of parasitic nematode infections in humans and livestock relies on a small arsenal of anthelmintic
drugs that have historically reduced parasite burdens. However, anthelmintic resistance is increasing, and little
is known about the molecular and genetic causes of resistance to most drugs. The free-living roundworm
Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a powerful model to identify and characterize the molecular targets of
the three major anthelmintic drug classes (i.e., benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor agonists), demonstrating its value as a model to understand mechanisms of resistance
(MoR). Despite this knowledge, resistance against all anthelmintic drug classes is widespread. Thus, a new
approach to combat nematode infections is needed. Emodepside is a “resistance-breaking” anthelmintic with a
distinct mode of action (MoA) not found among commonly deployed anthelmintics. Studies in the C. elegans
laboratory-adapted strain, N2, have shown that SLO-1 is essential for emodepside sensitivity and that SLO-1
loss-of-function mutations are resistant to emodepside. Further, biochemistry showed that the drug opens
SLO-1 channels. However, variation in slo-1 has not been linked with resistance in natural populations, where
the MoR remains unknown, highlighting this critical moment to focus on emodepside resistance before it
becomes a burden. Preliminary data using C. elegans genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown
that additional genes, beyond slo-1, are involved in emodepside resistance across natural populations. First, to
identify genetic variation in candidate genes, I will introduce variants using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, use
established high-throughput assays (HTA) and competition assays to test the effects of genetic variants in each
strain and identify emodepside resistance genes. Second, gene expression patterns, drug metabolites, and
conjugates involved in the biotransformation of emodepside will be measured in the emodepside-resistant
C. elegans slo-1 deletion strain, to understand how slo-1 contributes to emodepside’s MoR. We must uncover
the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) involved in modulating the biological activity and behavior of
emodepside. The proposed research provides a unique opportunity to use an integrative approach to obtain
novel data about emodepside’s MoR and encourage appropriate use of emodepside before resistance is
widespread. The proposed training plan will bridge my graduate experience in metabolomics with my interest in
host-parasite biology and genetics. Completing this research and training will aid my development as an
independent scientist and allow me to create a neglected tropical disease (NTD) research program using
integrative omics approaches. My focus will be on making discoveries to improve our understanding of parasite
biology, host-parasite interactions, and our ability to treat parasite infections."

The field of human neuroimaging has long been suffering from a problem of low power, in which low signal-to-
noise ratio, multiple comparisons, and small sample sizes result in insufficient statistical power for many studies.
For studies attempting to reveal brain-behavior relationships via functional and structural connectomes, which
are a matrix representation for statistical and physical relationships between brain regions, the story is the same.
From a scientific perspective, this issue reduces the number of findings presented in the literature while also
lowering the replicability of any findings. Since connectomics research strives to ultimately be clinically relevant
by, for example, predicting risk for mental health conditions or informing personalized treatment approaches for
those with existing illness, this problem of low power greatly hinders progress. Fortunately, recent work has
introduced a framework shift in statistics whereby an emphasis on brain networks, rather than individual
connections or edges, improves overall statistical power in functional connectivity analyses. Further work has
shown that using information of the relationships between edges in the connectome to construct the networks
results in even greater power increases, but it is not yet known whether deriving networks within-dataset is more
effective than using independent networks. Therefore, this proposal will investigate whether using within-dataset
networks in network-level statistical procedures results in further power increases. It will also test these network-
level approaches that were developed in functional datasets on the structural connectome. In Aim 1, I will use
data from 3 large functional connectivity datasets spanning several phenotypes to examine if creating the
networks in the same dataset that undergoes statistical testing will offer power improvements over deriving
networks from an independent dataset. In Aim 2, I will evaluate the utility of network-level statistical procedures
in the structural connectome, and in Aim 3, I will extend the methodology from Aim 1 to the structural connectome
to comprehensively determine whether the results seen in the functional connectome extend to the structural
connectome. This work will improve understanding of which variables we can manipulate to achieve higher
statistical power in human connectivity studies and lead the field towards eventual clinical relevance by improving
the neuroimaging tools available to mental health researchers."

Across our lifetimes we have an infinite number of experiences that are stored in our memories. As we age our
capacity to reuse this information to influence our future learning decreases, leading to impaired cognitive and
behavioral flexibility. Cognitive decline is a major concern for an increasingly large and aging population, and
these cognitive deficits will directly impact quality of life for countless individuals. It is essential to understand the
neuronal coding deficits underlying cognitive decline to provide the necessary groundwork for developing
therapeutic interventions that can spare people from cognitive decline. It has been postulated that the brain uses
cognitive maps, or internal neural representations, to enable flexible behavior and relate items in our memory.
The discovery of neurons in the hippocampus that fire action potentials in specific locations within an
environment, termed place cells, provided initial support for the cognitive map hypothesis, as these cells create
a neural representation of the environment. Both the engram and spatial navigation literatures have shown that
distinct cognitive maps are used to encode two different environments, which would presumably reduce
interference between maps during recall. However, recent work suggests that linking two distinct memories
neuronally can enhance memory strength by sharing neural resources. Due to this linking, recall of one memory
leads to a higher probability of recalling the other. This implies that some aspects of the two cognitive maps have
increased in similarity and are no longer distinct. Others have hypothesized that increased similarity between
cognitive maps may link experiences across environments and provide a mechanism to increase learning rates.
Indeed, more recent evidence showed that neuronal representations in dCA1 became more similar as mice
increased their speed of learning novel problems, suggesting that, under certain conditions, cognitive maps in
the hippocampus may become increasingly similar, impacting learning. I will utilize in vivo calcium imaging with
miniature microscopes as young adult and middle-aged mice navigate four distinct circular tracks for water
rewards to ask the question of whether the similarity between neural representations underlying cognitive maps
changes as mice increase their learning rates in novel environments. By using separate measurements of
representational similarity, I can provide a detailed account of how the brain encodes new cognitive maps and
whether the brain relates cognitive maps to alter learning rates. By using young adult and middle-aged mice, I
can determine if these mechanisms change during aging. All results from this proposal have the capability to
inform us on how the brain uses stored information to influence our future learning and, ultimately, how these
mechanisms change during the early stages of cognitive decline."

Sunlight, while essential for life on earth, also produces harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that penetrates the
ozone layer. UVR, particularly UVB, is known to damage organelles and DNA. A variety of UVR-protective
mechanisms have arisen during metazoan evolution. Until recently, melanin was believed to be the only
vertebrate sunscreen. Recently, our lab discovered a novel vertebrate sunscreen named gadusol. Gadusol is
maternally deposited from the ovary to the egg to protect against UV damage during the earliest stages of
development, prior to the production of melanin. We do not yet know the function of zygotically produced
gadusol, after maternally provided gadusol is depleted and fish have developed other UV protective
mechanisms including melanin, skin, and scales. Here, I will investigate both the zygotic function and
evolutionary origins of gadusol. First, I will determine if zygotically produced gadusol acts as a spatially
organized sunscreen and characterize the response to UVR exposure in mutants lacking gadusol and wildtype
controls with single cell RNA sequencing. Second, I will determine if UVR exposure upregulates gadusol
production as a form of protection against future exposures and the mechanism by which this occurs. Third, I
will investigate the evolutionary origins of gadusol, identifying the source and conservation of the gadusol
producing enzymes, eevs and MT-Ox, from algal to metazoan species and identify extant species in which
eevs and MT-Ox are co-expressed with the melanophore master regulator mitf. This project will provide
insights into how this novel vertebrate sunscreen, gadusol, is synthesized and used in vertebrates. My
research project will leverage the strong community of zebrafish researchers, developmental biologists, and
evolutionary geneticists at the University of Utah to learn techniques and develop skills I will take with me to my
own independent research lab."

Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne viruses that can cause arthritis and fatal encephalitis in humans with no
approved therapeutics. Encephalitic alphaviruses, like Sindbis (SINV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, must
cross the barriers protecting the central nervous system and therefore are neuroinvasive. The central nervous
system is primarily protected by tightly connected brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), pericytes, and
astrocytes, which together constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Genetic determinants of neuroinvasion reside
in the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein and host factors that interact with the E2 glycoprotein have been identified.
However, the relationship between neuroinvasive residues on E2 and the cell-specific expression of host
interactors are not well characterized in the context of neuroinvasion. Our lab models the BBB by using
pluripotent stem cell derived BMECs (iBMECs) that recapitulate the in vivo neuroinvasive phenotypes of
alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Using this model, we have demonstrated that alphavirus neuroinvasion correlates
with the ability to efficiently infect BMECs. Therefore, we hypothesize that the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein must
interact with a BMEC-specific host factor to efficiently infect BMECs and cross the BBB. We will first determine
how previously identified neuroinvasive E2 residues on SINV and CHIKV confer the ability to efficiently infect
BMECs. Furthermore, we will identify the host factor that neuroinvasive alphaviruses hijack for efficient BMEC
infection and characterize its interactions with E2. This work will elucidate virus-BBB interactions that
facilitate neuropathogenesis, providing a foundation for therapeutic research.

Elevated plasma LDL cholesterol is the main risk factor in cardiovascular disease (CVD), the
leading cause of death in the United States. Cholesterol levels are regulated by complex feedback
mechanisms that help maintain cellular and plasma cholesterol levels in check. While
transcriptional mechanisms that control cholesterol homeostasis, such as SREBPs and LXRs are
well described, here we describe a novel post-transcriptional mechanism that is involved in
controlling the mRNA stability of Ldlr mRNA. We have identified a family of RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) that target specifically mRNAs and are important in cholesterol homeostasis. We show
that hepatic loss of one or more of these RBPs in the liver results in increased levels of LDLR
mRNA and protein. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify the direct mRNA targets in vivo using CLIP-
Seq and we will perform functional genomics to determine the effect of human variants in the
LDLR 3’UTR. In Specific Aim 2, we will extend our preliminary data showing that loss of one of
our RBPs in the liver profoundly protects from atherosclerosis. Using a ‘humanized’ lipoprotein
mouse atherosclerosis model, we have developed the hypothesis that loss of our RBP in the liver
promotes uptake of LDL particles, thus protecting from atherosclerosis. Further, we hypothesize
that the internalized cholesterol is then preferentially catabolized to bile acids. Thus, our mouse
model will allow us to better understand how the liver channels cholesterol taken up from LDL
particles to ultimately protect from CVD."
10905990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposed research is to develop a biomarker that prognosticates and correlates with
the clinical expression of pain in sickle cell disease (SCD). Severe, debilitating pain is the most common
complication of SCD, an inherited hemoglobinopathy affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United
States. Despite the known genetic defect, there is significant variability in pain expression in patients with SCD.
Clinically, some patients experience frequent and recurrent pain while others experience pain only
occasionally. Currently, there is no plasma biomarker, linked to pain biology, that can prognosticate patients
who are likely to experience more pain than other patients. The lack of a prognostic biomarker for pain is a
barrier to targeted, personalized pain treatment. SCD is associated with chronic inflammation with elevated
inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines, chemokines, lipids) at baseline that increase further during acute pain.
However, the degree of inflammation is likely highly variable among patients. Multiple factors, including
ongoing effects of recurrent vaso-occlusion, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and hemolysis contribute to SCD
inflammation and pain. This project is centered on the concept that pain in SCD is heterogeneous and driven
by a complex milieu of inflammatory effectors and immune regulators. A prognostic biomarker that
quantitatively and comprehensively assesses the combination of these immune effectors and regulators and
correlates with pain in SCD will fill a significant gap in SCD pain research. Ideally, such a biomarker could
provide prognostic data and define inclusion criteria for pain clinical trials of immunomodulatory drugs. The
following aims are proposed for the R61 Phase: 1) Derive the inflammatory index (I.l.com) for pain in patients
with SCD by identifying inflammatory and immune regulatory gene probe sets that will optimally distinguish
healthy controls, patients with SCD in baseline health, and patients with SCD in acute pain and 2) Determine
whether co-expressed gene modules from patients with SCD correlate with clinical pain data and are
concordant with genes included in the I.I.com. Subsequently, the following aims are proposed for the R33
Phase: 1) Determine the reliable and clinically meaningful changes of the I.I.com in patients with SCD and 2)
Investigate the preliminary clinical validity of the I.I.com as a prognostic biomarker for pain in patients with SCD.
Our collaborative and multidisciplinary team brings research expertise in SCD pain biology, inflammation, and
SCD patient-reported outcomes. Our proposed work will refine, replicate and validate the I.I.com as a prognostic
biomarker for SCD pain."
10906008,"The identification of forkhead transcription factors of the Foxo sub-family as effectors of insulin action on gene expression has filled a yawning gap in our knowledge of insulin signaling, and identified a cellular biological mechanism linking hormone signaling to regulation of the cell's transcriptional response through sub-cellular redistribution of transcription factors. Key advances of the past funding cycle include: i, identification of SIN3a as the FoxO co-repressor of glucokinase in liver; ii, discovery of FoxO1 inhibitors as selective insulin sensitizers; iii, discovery of miR205 as an integrator of insulin signaling in liver; iv, demonstration of a role of G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr17 as a FoxO1 target that modulates neuropeptide processing and energy balance. This application for competing renewal marks a conceptual break from prior work: the PI will narrow his focus on the liver, and depart from a candidate gene approach to embrace genome-wide methods of transcription factor analysis and answer three key questions relevant to diabetes pathophysiology. (i) Known FoxO1 target genes cannot account for of the entirety of its metabolic effects, prompting investigations of the unaccounted FoxO1 regulome. (ii) How does the gamut of hepatic FoxO1 targets change with insulin resistance and diabetes? (iii) Can selective hepatic insulin resistance, resulting in combined abnormalities of glucose and lipoprotein metabolism, be explained by the topology of FoxO1 DNA binding? The PI proposes to address these questions by 3 aims. In Aim 1 the PI will use a newly developed reporter mouse to determine the FoxO1 cistrome and analyze its alterations during the development of insulin-resistant diabetes, with a focus on hepatic super-enhancers as well as long-distance chromatin interactions analyzed by Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques. In Aim 2, he will use comparative cistrome analyses with CREB, GR, and Ppara to delve into the interaction of FoxO1 with other hormone-regulated transcription factors in the nutrient response. In Aim 3, the PI will integrate ChIPseq with RNAseq data in a FoxO1 regulome to study the paradox of “selective” hepatic insulin resistance of glucose vs. lipid/lipoprotein metabolism. He hypothesizes that insulin resistance results from selective modulation of different FoxO1 DNA binding sites, and proposes to use DNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to isolate components of the FoxO1 regulatory complex. The combined approach should yield actionable information to design disease-modifying diabetes treatments."
10906010,"The telomere biology disorder (TBD) dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and its severe variants are childhood onset,
multisystem disorders caused by impaired maintenance of the ends of chromosomes known as telomeres. Bone
marrow failure (BMF) is a major threat to life, occurring in 50-80% of affected individuals by age 30. The long-
term objectives of this project are to elucidate the mechanisms by which mutations in the genes associated with
the TBDs lead to telomere shortening and to discover how this shortening can be slowed or, better yet, reversed.
With this knowledge, we will meet our long-term goal of identifying novel treatment avenues that target telomeres
for these life-threatening disorders. To date, 15 genes have been associated with the TBDs, a number that poses
a challenge to developing general therapeutic targets. Mutation of the TINF2 gene, which encodes the TIN2
protein, is the second most common cause of DC in children. How mutations in TINF2, which cluster, lead to
marked telomere shortening is ill-defined. Our preliminary data suggest the TIN2-DC mutant protein has a new
or more robust function than the normal protein, however, many critical gaps in knowledge remain as to the
molecular aspects of this gain-of-function. In addition to the complex genetics, a second major challenge in the
field is the lack of preclinical model systems to develop and test interventions. Through a collaboration
established in 2018, the Bertuch and Hockemeyer labs have developed pluripotent and hematopoietic stem cell
culture disease models as well as a humanized mouse model that reproduce the telomere shortening associated
with TINF2-DC mutations. Here we propose to use these unique stem cell-based systems to examine the impact
of TINF2-DC mutations on the maintenance of telomere length and hematopoiesis, and test therapeutic
approaches to treat the associated-BMF. Overall, we will undertake two complementary Aims: Aim 1 will
investigate the molecular determinants by which TIN2-DC mutant protein leads to short telomeres, such as how
it interacts with the telomere shelterin complex proteins TRF1 and TRF2, and telomeres. We will determine if
TIN2-DC mutant protein’s toxic effect on telomere length requires interaction with TRF1 and the role of TIN2-
TRF2 interaction in the telomere shortening it induces. Lastly, we will determine if critical binding events are
altered by mutation of DC cluster region. In Aim 2, we will determine pharmacologic and genetic mechanisms to
restore telomere length and rescue the impaired fitness of TINF2-DC mutant cells. We will establish the gene
expression signature of telomere shortening in our stem cell models to derive insight into the pathways impairing
fitness. We will test the effect of danazol, which is a treatment for DC BMF, to assess the relationships between
impacts on telomere length, TERT, and hematopoietic potential. Lastly, we will develop a genetic strategy to
elongate telomeres in TINF2-DC mutant patient hematopoietic stem cells. The two Aims build upon data
developed independently by the Bertuch and Hockemeyer labs as well as through their collaborative efforts and
bring to bear the complementary expertise to bring a sustained impact on the TBD field."
10906261,"Rickettsia felis was originally identified in the United States as a human pathogen in 1991 and is now
associated with human infection in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Our
ultimate goal for this research is to elucidate the biological and molecular mechanisms that are critical to
rickettsial transmission by fleas in order to better understand the epidemiology of flea-borne rickettsial
diseases and identify novel points of intervention. Recent discoveries including transmission of R. felis in
the absence of a rickettsemic host and the identification of multiple flea-borne rickettsial agents
cocirculating in flea populations have guided the research to determine if sympatric rickettsial agents
circulating in flea populations influence the transmission one another. Additionally, the assembly of the
cat flea genome now allows for investigation of the flea-derived factors that facilitate or prevent Rickettsia
transmission. The experimental focus of this proposal is to delineate horizontal transmission mechanisms
through comparative analyses of coinfections using three distinct rickettsial strains in cat flea transmission
bioassays. The flea-derived molecules associated with the transmission of Rickettsia by flea hosts are not
known. Studies will also employ gene-editing in fleas to identify transmission determinants in a flea
transmission system. Two limiting factors for vector/disease management and the barriers to advancing
the field are the scant knowledge of 1) basic transmission biology of R. felis and other rickettsial
pathogens in the context of coinfections and, 2) the flea-derived determinants of transmission. The need
to overcome these barriers is evident as field collected fleas in areas of flea-borne rickettsioses outbreaks
have multiple rickettsial agents circulating in the vector population and the fleas are known to be vectors
of a number of pathogens, thus providing knowledge with a broad impact. Through completion of the
specific aims outlined in this proposal, these studies will overcome the hurdles by delineating the role of
coinfections in the transmission of R. felis (Specific Aim 1) and through identification of flea-derived
molecules regulated in response to rickettsial infection relates to vector competence (Specific Aim 2).
Thus, this is a multifaceted approach to decipher the vector and pathogen-associated factors essential to
transmission and will provide a platform to examine other flea-borne bacterial pathogens."
10879897,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Approximately two million people in the U.S. suffer from acquired language disorders, known as
aphasias. These patients can present with strikingly different patterns of semantic language impairments.
For example, they can be more impaired at processing concrete than abstract concepts or vice-versa, and
particular categories of concepts such as animals or artifacts can be differentially affected. One major obstacle
to understanding the mechanisms underlying semantic language disorders is a larger theoretical gap in our
understanding of semantic word processing in the healthy human brain, particularly in terms of how it
relates to perceptual, motor, and memory processes.
 The main goal of this project is to develop a generative model of how semantic representations are encoded
in the brain based on interpretable, neurologically plausible dimensions. Our approach is based in part on
human ratings of the relevance of several neurally-grounded features of phenomenal experience to the meaning
of each word, including perceptual, motor, and affective components. Starting with a set of 48 features, we will
identify the subset of features (and their respective weights) that best predicts human performance in
semantic tasks, as well as the similarity structure of neural activity patterns associated with individual word
meanings. Aim 1 will generate empirical norms of pairwise semantic similarity for a set of 640 English nouns
and for a set of 300 English verbs, including both implicit (priming) and explicit (ratings) measures, and will
identify which model features are essential for predicting those similarity measures for each word set. It will
also determine whether taxonomic and distributional information contribute to semantic representation
independently of experiential information. Aim 2 will characterize the similarity structure and information
content of the neural activation patterns encoding the meanings of individual nouns and verbs. Finally, Aim 3
will use resting-state connectivity, at the individual participant level, to identify the cortical subnetworks that
make up the semantic representation system and characterize their information content. The project will result
in a quantitative, feature-based model of word meaning that will provide a theoretically principled approach
to decoding semantic representations directly from brain activity, enabling the development of accurate and
computationally efficient speech prosthetic devices via brain-computer interface."
10879217,"Radiographic surgical indicators for pediatric orbital abscess
Abstract
 As the most common sequela of acute sinusitis, pediatric orbital cellulitis is the most common cause of
inpatient ophthalmic admissions. Unmitigated infection can lead to devastating consequences, such as blindness
and death, requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. Treatment options include the initiation of intravenous
antibiotics and the drainage of discrete orbital abscess formation. Unfortunately, the exact role and timing of
drainage remain controversial. There is an acute need for a reliable method to rapidly and unambiguously identify
pediatric patients who require immediate surgical intervention or just conservative management with medical
therapy. Prioritizing patients for surgical intervention will prevent further orbital or intracranial complications of
orbital cellulitis and decreased potential morbidities and mortality associated with late interventions. While
several radiographic indicators have been associated with surgery, none has been proven satisfactory in clinical
practice. In contrast, the size of the abscess (e.g., volume) demonstrates a more robust performance among the
identified factors. However, there is no tool available that can consistently and accurately measure the volume
of an abscess. Manual delineating an abscess is always time-consuming and associated with high inter- and
intra-variability, resulting in different cutoff values and thus widely diverse recommendations for treatment
guidelines. In this project, we propose to (1) develop a novel computer tool for automatically, accurately, and
consistently quantifying orbital abscess depicted on orbital computed tomography (CT) by leveraging the
emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology; (2) use this tool to comprehensively analyze the radiographical
characteristics of the orbital abscess and identify those that are closely associated with the outcome of the
therapy; and (3) integrate the radiographical findings with patient demographics as a computer model for
predicting the response to medical treatment, by which we expect to identify patients who would benefit from
early surgical intervention. We believe the availability of such a tool will be a novel and essential addition to the
practice of oculoplastic and orbital surgery. Its availability will facilitate precise diagnosis and decision making,
ameliorate a significant portion of these complications associated with prolonged medical treatment, and
ultimately decrease the health care burden of pediatric orbital cellulitis."
10891736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging-related changes to the structure and function of the heart increase vulnerability to cardiovascular
disease (e.g., heart disease, stroke), frailty, falls, dementia, and Alzheimer disease. Exercise-based cardiac
rehabilitation (CR) slows these processes, reduces risk of mortality, and improves physical function and quality
of life. However, most patients who enroll in CR fail to gain the full benefits of treatment due to poor attendance
and adherence, and few maintain independent physical activity when CR treatment ends. Exercise anxiety is a
novel mechanism related to non-adherence to exercise and lifestyle physical activity that is characterized by
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological underpinnings. Exercise anxiety is particularly elevated in patients
enrolled in CR given that physical sensations of exercise often feel similar to sensations attributed to
cardiovascular disease (e.g., shortness of breath, racing heart). Heightened awareness of these bodily
sensations can promote fear and worry about what could happen during exercise (e.g., “What if I have a heart
attack?”), even though it is both safe and recommended for patients to engage in aerobic exercise. Patients may
avoid exercise and/or rely on false safety behaviors to manage fears (e.g., checking pulse frequently,
restricting speed on treadmill). While these behaviors relieve anxiety in the moment, they exacerbate and
maintain anxiety long-term. Through repeated use, individuals learn to attribute “safety” to their avoidance and
safety behaviors, developing false beliefs that safety is contingent upon certain actions (e.g., “It’s only safe for
me to exercise when someone is monitoring my heart”), which maintain their fears and unnecessarily limits
their activities (e.g., “I can’t go for a brisk walk unless someone is keeping an eye on me”). Despite theoretical
and clinical relevance, there is currently no reliable and valid measure to identify and track these exercise
avoidance and false safety behaviors for targeted treatment, which leaves patients vulnerable to the
misperception that it is only safe to exercise under a restrictive set of circumstances and results in limited
physical conditioning and functioning. This study will fill this critical assessment gap through the two following
aims. Aim 1: To characterize exercise avoidance and safety behaviors in CR via comprehensive literature
review, expert focus groups, and clinical behavioral observation for generation of an initial item bank to be
used for development of a self-report scale. Aim 2: To refine and evaluate the psychometric properties of scale
items in a sample of patients enrolled in CR through exploratory factor analysis and item reduction, followed by
confirmatory factor analysis and tests of item reliability and validity in a subsequent sample. This study will
have an immediate impact on efforts in promotion of CR adherence and fearless aging by developing a self-
report measure of exercise avoidance and false safety behaviors for use in both research and intervention
efforts. This measure will facilitate systematic identification and treatment of fear-avoidance and false safety
behaviors that undermine CR adherence and active independent living."
10891592,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Recent evidence put forth by our group and others suggests that the pancreas of patients with recent-onset type
1 diabetes (T1D) contains a significant number of “empty” beta cells that have lost the ability to secrete mature
insulin but retained other hallmark features such as proinsulin expression. The mechanisms that underlie
formation of such cells and their fate remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that empty beta cells, which
are invisible to standard insulin immunostaining and potentially also to the immune system, play important roles
in the pathophysiology of T1D while holding therapeutic potential for reversion of diabetes. We propose in depth
experiments to characterize empty beta cells, using MACSima ultra high-content immunofluorescence imaging
to assess in situ expression of 78 immune and pancreas cell markers, including vascular and lymphatic
annotation with signatures of inflammation, extravasation/trafficking, and immune cell residency in autoantibody
positive (AAb+) and T1D donors as compared to donors with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-diabetic controls
available through the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) repository. We will compare
insulin containing versus insulin negative islets, within and across donors, to identify empty beta cells and
determine how they correlate with islet, acinar, and immune cell phenotypes. These data will serve as a template
for a serial section to undergo laser capture microdissection (LCM) of insulin containing islets, insulin negative
islets, and acinar tissue regions, which will be subjected to bulk RNAseq as well as our novel method for
quantifying beta cells based on DNA methylation patterns. In addition, we will use a novel mouse model (beta
cell-specific, tamoxifen-inducible Adar1-mutant) and cultured human pancreas slices to functionally interrogate
molecular pathways underlying the formation of empty beta cells. Specifically, we propose to leverage these two
model systems to test therapeutic candidates— including an incretin mimetic (GLP1), an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress inhibitor (ISRIB), and multiple biologics targeting specific immune subsets— for their ability to
modulate empty beta cells, their insulin content and insulin secretion. We will then correlate these functional data
with molecular and cellular features of hormone negative islet cells via MACSima, RNAseq, and DNA
methylation. These studies are expected to yield insights into a fundamental yet little understood process taking
place in human T1D. We anticipate that empty beta cells can be re-functionalized, paving the way for therapeutic
development to restore endogenous beta cell function in T1D. Ultimately, when combined with effective
interventions to constrain autoimmunity, it is our hope that the metabolic modalities explored here could provide
a means to reduce insulin requirements or even achieve insulin independence after T1D onset, dramatically
improving longevity and quality of life for these patients."

10898298,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus asymptomatically colonizes 30% of the human population. However, the bacterium can
breach innate host defenses to gain access to deeper tissues and vasculature allowing it to infect diverse tissue
sites such as the heart, lungs, blood, bones, and skin. Despite distinct nutritional limitations at these sites, we
know comparatively little about how S. aureus adapts its metabolism to survive and cause infection. To better
combat infections caused by S. aureus, it is imperative to understand how the bacterium changes metabolic flux
to adapt to nutritional restrictions imposed by host tissues. Several metabolic enzyme complexes involved in S.
aureus central metabolism are activated via the covalent linkage of the cofactor lipoic acid to E2 subunits. The
transfer of lipoic acid to E2 subunits is mediated by the amidotransferase, LipL. Notably, LipL transfers lipoic
acid to a critical enzyme used in glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase use pyruvate to
generate acetyl-CoA, a molecule that is crucial for several downstream metabolic pathways. Our prior studies
and preliminary data established that LipL is genetically and functionally coupled to the phosphotransacetylase,
Pta. Pta catalyzes the generation of acetyl-phosphate from pyruvate dehydrogenase-derived acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-
phosphate is subsequently delivered to acetate kinase, AckA, to generate ATP during overflow metabolism. We
recently demonstrated a potential interaction between Pta and LipL and found that a ∆lipL mutant produces
negligible acetate in culture. Furthermore, the loss of either the pta or lipL gene results in significant attenuation
in the host. Thus, we hypothesize that a functional link is established between Pta and LipL that enhances
glycolytic flux by coupling pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (lipoylation) to acetogenesis (Pta-AckA) to promote
energy balance and survival during infection (Aim 1). Additionally, we found that acetate production still occurs
in a ∆pta mutant, suggesting compensatory enzymes - such as the pyruvate oxidase CidC - could be promoting
acetogenesis and might affect virulence. Furthermore, we found that expression of lipL under the control of high
and low expressing promoters regulated the transition from acetogenesis to TCA cycle activity. These results
led us to hypothesize that LipL levels/activity establish a metabolite signature that controls (i) acetogenesis via
CidC and (ii) TCA cycle activity to promote energy balance and S. aureus survival during infection (Aim 2). In
Aim 1, we will determine how LipL interfaces with Pta to control energy balance during overflow metabolism. In
Aim 2, we will investigate how LipL governs metabolic flux through CidC and the TCA cycle. Together, these
Aims will lead to a better understanding of how LipL promotes metabolism, energy balance, and virulence in Sa."

Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is a Gram-negative oral commensal that is quickly attracting attention of the
medical and research community. It is an opportunistic pathogen implicated in periodontal disease as well as in
infections at numerous extra-oral sites, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal cancer. FadA is
a novel adhesin and key virulence factor from Fn. It is required from Fn to bind and invade epithelial and
endothelial cells and to colonize the placenta and colorectal carcinoma. FadA binds to VE-cadherin on
endothelial cells and E-cadherin on epithelial and colorectal cancer cells, inducing varying responses from
different host cells. Our recent study reveals that FadA is differentially regulated and secreted. The secreted
FadA exhibits amyloid-like properties and correlates with increased virulence. As Fn is considered a primarily
commensal organism, the question arises how it switches from a commensal to a pathogen. Our central
hypothesis is that the commensal and pathogenic states are determined through regulation of FadA. In
this application, we propose to characterize the amyloid-like properties of FadA, identify components involved
in its secretion, and determine its role in biofilm formation and periodontal infection. This study is highly
significant because it characterizes a novel and critical virulence component from a pathogen involved in
multiple debilitating human diseases. Results from our study will identify therapeutic targets for prevention and
treatment of a series of human diseases within and beyond the oral cavity."
10900717,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are a group of age-related diseases
affecting cognitive function for which no treatments are available. Neuroinflammation and
neurovascular dysfunction have emerged as crucial drivers of disease progression in ADRDs. In
particular, cerebral endothelial cells and microglia, brain resident innate-immune cells, have been
implicated in the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule associated protein and
a key feature of ADRD’s pathology. Dysregulation of the peripheral immune system could also
play a role and may influence endothelial and microglial function contributing to cognitive
impairment. However, how the peripheral immune system communicates with the cerebral
microvasculature and microglia to alter cognitive function remains to be fully established.
 IL17-producing T-helper lymphocytes (Th17 cells), a subset of T-helper lymphocytes, and
their signature cytokine, IL17, have been implicated in the mechanisms of cognitive impairment.
Previous data indicate that circulating Th17-derived IL17 acts on cerebral endothelial cells to
induce a deficit in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) promoting tau accumulation and cognitive
impairment. Due to their abundance in the gut, Th17 cells are particularly sensitive to gut bacteria
and alterations in the gut flora are associated with dysregulation of Th17 cells. Segmented
filamentous bacteria (SFB) are commensal bacteria which potently induce gut Th17 cells in mice
and alter the course of models of Th17 cell-associated diseases. Therefore, gut Th17
dysregulation induced by SFB could be used as a model to gain a better mechanistic
understanding of how gut Th17 cells alter brain health. On these bases, we propose to test the
central hypothesis that dysregulation of gut Th17 cells, induced by colonization of the small
intestine with SFB, promotes an IL17-mediated inflammatory response in cerebral endothelial
cells which, in turn, activates microglia, leading to tau accumulation and cognitive impairment. To
this end, the present grant application will examine endothelial function, tau pathology and
cognitive function in a mouse model of SFB colonization to test the following hypotheses in male,
female and aging mice: (1) Gut SFB colonization promotes gut Th17 differentiation, increases
circulating IL17 and induces cerebrovascular and cognitive impairment; (2) Circulating IL17
mediates cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment through activation of brain
endothelial IL17 receptors; (3) IL17-induced endothelial pro-inflammatory mediators activate
microglia leading to tau accumulation and cognitive impairment. The proposed studies fill an
obvious gap in the understanding of the effects of gut microbiota on cognition and of the role of
circulating IL17, endothelial cells and microglia in mediating these effects. Furthermore, these
findings may unveil a novel link between microbiota-induced dysregulation of intestinal Th17 cells,
brain tau accumulation and cognitive impairment, with potential public health implications."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to both motor and non-motor symptoms.
While there is as yet no cure for PD, medical and surgical therapies have been developed that effectively target
the motor symptoms of PD. Non-motor symptoms are far more disabling for patients, precede the onset of motor
symptoms by a decade, are more insidious in onset, have been less apparent to clinicians, and are less
effectively treated. Sleep dysfunction is oftentimes the most burdensome of the non-motor symptoms—both to
patients and to their caregivers—is pervasive in patients with PD, and includes sleep fragmentation, insomnia,
excessive daytime sleepiness, REM behavioral disorder, and restless leg syndrome. There are limited options
for treating sleep dysfunction in PD, and the mainstay of therapy is the use of agents that mask the sleep
disturbance—such as the sedative-hypnotic drugs—without addressing the underlying mechanisms.
Although much attention has been devoted to PD motor symptoms, sleep dysfunction in PD has largely been
ignored. Sleep is vital to homeostasis, cognition, and nervous system repair, and the dysfunctional sleep
accompanying PD adversely affects both motor and non-motor symptoms, resulting in diminished quality of life,
impairments in mood and behavior, and increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with PD who demonstrate
significant motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are considered for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain
stimulation (DBS) surgery. Although STN-DBS is routinely used to treat PD motor symptoms, several studies
have reported that STN-DBS also provides benefit for sleep dysregulation through normalization of sleep
architecture. Additionally, local field potentials recorded from STN DBS electrodes implanted for the treatment
of PD, have led to the identification of unique spectral patterns in STN oscillatory activity that correlate with
distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into sleep dysregulation. Building on this work, and in response to RFA-NS-
18-023, this proposal will leverage novel investigational DBS battery technology (RC+S Summit System;
Medtronic) that allows the exploration of sleep biomarkers and prototyping of closed-loop stimulation algorithms,
to test the hypothesis that STN—a highly interconnected node within the basal ganglia—contributes to the
regulation and disruption of human sleep behavior and can be manipulated for therapeutic advantage.
Specifically, in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS, we will determine whether STN oscillations correlate with
sleep stage transitions, then construct and evaluate sensing and adaptive stimulation paradigms that allow
ongoing sleep-stage identification, and induce through adaptive stimulation an increase in duration of sleep
stages associated with restorative sleep. This work will lead to findings that address a currently unmet
clinical need, and relevant to the mission of NINDS and the BRAIN Initiative, will evaluate the use of
adaptive stimulation of the STN in PD patients for the treatment of sleep dysfunction."

Multicellular development requires extensive cell-cell interactions and transcriptional reprogramming
accomplished at the level of chromatin remodeling. These processes are classically understood to entail the
transmission of information from outside a cell to its nucleus, however this paradigm largely overlooks the fact
that biology involves the movement of biochemical information across spaces beyond the plasma membrane and
the nuclear envelope. Unlike prokaryotes, in which transcription and metabolism occur in the same membrane-
bound compartment, multicellular eukaryotes partition their metabolism and biochemistry at multiple layers:
amongst the organelles within a cell, between cells within a tissue, and throughout the organ systems that compose
a host. We hypothesize that the spatial partitioning of biochemistry, through cellular metabolism, regulates cell
development and function by controlling histone epigenetics and coordinating interacting cells within tissues.
We have recently shown that metabolic crosstalk between the mitochondria and cytosol is an essential component
of cell differentiation and set out to extend this paradigm to explore how the movement of metabolites across
between cellular and tissue compartments dictates their biology. We seek to explore this at two levels: 1)
elucidating the molecular mechanism explaining how mitochondrial-cytosolic crosstalk controls histone
epigenetics; 2) investigating how cell-cell metabolite exchange influences development and coordinates responses
between interacting populations of cells. We will explore these concepts in the context of the hematopoietic
system, as its development requires extensive epigenetic remodeling, with each lineage and functional program
now understood to be supported by a unique metabolic signature, making it an ideal model system for us to pursue
these studies. This will be accomplished by taking advantage a CRISPR screening system we have developed that
is compatible with nearly every population of primary hematopoietic cells. We will conduct both in vitro and in
vivo unpooled and pooled, barcoded CRISPR screens evaluating all 77 genes encoding mitochondrial transporters
as well as all plasma membrane transporters, to investigate how these metabolic transport systems impact
epigenetic remodeling and development. These studies will be furthered by tandem sgRNA studies that will allow
us to test the epigenetic remodeling enzymes downstream of the metabolic processes we are studying as well as
a combinatorial reverse genetic approach in which different genes in the same network will be targeted in different
populations of interacting cells, allowing us to map metabolic flow in trans. Altogether these studies will not only
help establish a novel paradigm with which to approach molecular biology, but also provide fundamental
mechanistic insights into gene regulation and development."

study transcriptional regulation, work with immunocompetent mouse models of neuroblastoma, and analyze the
tumor immune microenvironment. His mentors for this award are Dr. Chi Dang, an eminent cancer biologist with
expertise in studying transcriptional regulation, and Dr. Michael Hogarty, a world-wide leader in neuroblastoma
research. To add broad scientific expertise and provide additional career guidance, he has assembled a
Mentoring Committee composed of scientists from diverse and complementary fields. Dr. Wolpaw will benefit
from the rich resources and opportunities available at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of
Pennsylvania, and the Wistar Institute.
 The proposed research focuses on investigating the regulation of the inflammatory sensing cGAS-STING
pathway in neuroblastoma to promote immune-targeting of mesenchymal state neuroblastoma (NBLMES).
Neuroblastomas are composed of cells in an adrenergic (NBLADR) state that predominate at diagnosis and a
NBLMES state that is initially a minor subpopulation but is a driver of relapse. Dr. Wolpaw's prior work shows that
NBLMES cells have higher levels of inflammatory signaling at baseline in vitro and in vivo and are more responsive
to some inflammatory stimuli, suggesting a unique immune vulnerability of this critical population. His current
proposal capitalizes on these findings by focusing on the clinically relevant inflammatory sensing cGAS-STING
pathway. This pathway responds to cytosolic DNA by broadly activating inflammatory signaling and is required
for an immunogenic response to radiation therapy, including synergistic and systemic effects when local radiation
is combined with immune checkpoint blockade. His preliminary data support the hypothesis that restoration of
cGAS-STING will render NBLMES cells vulnerable to immuno-radiation therapy. To test this hypothesis, Dr.
Wolpaw will purse two specific aims: 1) Elucidate the impact of NBLADR/NBLMES state on the transcriptional
regulation of cGAS-STING and 2) Define the effect of restored cGAS expression on the response to radiation.
Together, these aims will advance our understanding of how inflammatory sensors like cGAS-STING are
regulated in neuroblastoma and how their manipulation can promote tumor-immune interactions. This will lay the
foundation for improved immunotherapies in neuroblastoma and provide the training and experience needed to
transition Dr. Wolpaw into an independent physician scientist."

Detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria from raw
retail meat and seafood in Iowa: A NARMS Retail Food Surveillance Project
 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health threat affecting the well-being of
humans, animals, and the environment worldwide. Robust and comprehensive surveillance
systems emphasizing the “One Health” approach are necessary for effectively combatting AMR.
In the United States, the retail arm of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
(NARMS) under the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-
CVM) performs surveillance of AMR in select enteric bacteria (non-typhoidal Salmonella,
Campylobacter, Enterococcus and Escherichia coli) from retail raw meats (chicken, ground
turkey and beef, and ground/chop pork) in 18 states. Recently, surveillance of AMR in retail
seafood (tilapia, shrimp, salmon) for select bacteria (Vibrio, Aeromonas, E. coli, Enterococcus,
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaciae) has also been started in at least 8 states. The
NARMS program has contributed significantly to monitoring the sources and trends of AMR in
the food chain. To enhance the effort on combating AMR, FDA launched a cooperative
agreement program to expand the NARMS surveillance network throughout the U.S in 2016.
Under the initiative, Iowa State University (ISU) became a NARMS network laboratory in late
2016. Since then, the ISU site has contributed substantially to strengthening the capacity and
effectiveness of the national AMR surveillance program in retail food. In this application, we
propose to continue the collaborative partnership with NARMS to address the updated goals of
the Retail Food Surveillance Program as described in FOA PAR-20-124 “NARMS Cooperative
Agreement Program to Strengthen Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance in Retail Food
Specimens”. Specifically, we will continue to collect and process raw meat samples and seafood
samples from grocery stores in Iowa and culture them for isolation of bacteria of interest as
defined by NARMS, and ship the isolates to FDA on a monthly basis. In addition, we will
continue to perform whole-genome sequencing of Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli
isolates from the meat samples and share the sequences with FDA via GenomeTrakr. This
application is built on existing experience and is a natural extension of our current effort with
NARMS. Trained personnel and logistic infrastructure required for successful completion of the
planned work are already in place. We strongly believe that ISU’s continued participation in this
collaborative network will contribute significantly to mitigation of AMR in the food chain and
ultimately to enhancement of food safety and public health."
10902028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Embryogenesis from a fertilized egg into an individual is a precisely controlled process. One of the critical aspects
of embryogenesis is developmental patterning, which determines organ size and shape by orchestrating many
developmental and cellular events. Any abnormality from this patterning process will lead to congenital diseases
in humans. However, understanding the mechanisms that pattern embryos remains a central challenge in
developmental biology. The status quo of embryonic developmental patterning centers on the conceptual
framework that development is governed predominantly by morphogenetic proteins that activate transcription
factor networks in responding cells. The roles of bioelectricity in regulating embryonic developmental patterning
have just started to be recognized as a new mechanism of cellular signaling. Given many ion channels and
solute carriers are frequently involved in human congenital diseases, there is a critical need to understand ion
channel-mediated bioelectricity in developmental patterning. The lack of information about this bioelectric
patterning mechanism is a significant obstacle to understanding fundamental biological sciences and developing
therapeutic strategies for many human congenital diseases.
To address the demanding need, we will investigate the embryonic patterning mechanism of bioelectricity in the
zebrafish model using newly developed technologies for neuroscience, such as chemogenetic tools and
genetically encoded voltage indicators. Aim1. To elucidate the roles of bioelectricity in regulating zebrafish fin
patterning. Aim 2. To reveal the roles of bioelectricity in pigment cell patterning. With this long-studied pigment
system, we will further demonstrate bioelectricity as a general patterning mechanism in vertebrate
embryogenesis.
The expected outcomes will elucidate a less recognized developmental patterning mechanism by bioelectricity
in both zebrafish fin and skin pigment. This knowledge will establish a new concept for patterning in
developmental biology, provide the foundation for understanding vertebrate morphological diversity in evolution,
and principles for developing prevention or therapeutic strategies for congenital diseases."
10903869,"The Veterans Affairs Health Administration (VA) is the largest integrated health care system in the US, caring
for nearly 50,000 veterans with newly diagnosed cancer annually. Equitable, quality care for all veterans is a
tenet of the VA healthcare mission. We hypothesize that three particular factors – race, poverty and rurality –
are critical in determining access to healthcare, especially telehealth; we refer to these 3 factors as the social
determinants of telehealth (SDTH). Approximately 25% of veterans live in rural areas where there may not be
adequate local VA cancer care facilities. Unfortunately, these same communities often lack specialized
community-based cancer care services as well, making telehealth a necessary option to reduce geographic,
economic and racial barriers to quality, timely cancer care. However, little is known about how telehealth delivery
for veterans with cancer impacts equitable delivery of quality care, clinical outcomes and experiences of care.
As a national integrated health care system focused on quality and equity of cancer care, VA provides an
outstanding national laboratory to examine how use of telehealth affects access, quality and equity of care. We
will be able to examine how interventions targeting SDTH affect the use of telehealth and how use of telehealth
affects quality and equity. We will disseminate this information broadly to help other health care systems
understand how best to integrate telehealth into the continuum of cancer care. Using principles of
implementation science, Telehealth Research and Innovation for Veterans with Cancer (THRIVE) will leverage
Health Disparities Research Framework (HDRF) to advance the science of health equity: building a new model
of cancer care delivery addressing SDTH and fulfilling the promise of access to excellent cancer care for
veterans regardless of communication format. The Research and Methods Core primarily focuses on health
equity, particularly understanding how SDTH impact access to and quality of care.
Our multidisciplinary team will achieve THRIVE’s vision by focusing on lung, colorectal, prostate and breast
cancers and accomplishing five specific aims: (1) Assess stakeholders’ perspectives of contextual factors
impacting cancer telehealth implementation and sustainment at multiple levels; (2) Measure the use of in-
person and telehealth communication formats for cancer care throughout VA; (3) Evaluate how the use of
telehealth for cancer care, controlling for social determinants of telehealth – specifically race/ethnicity, poverty,
and rurality – are associated with cancer care quality; (4) Oversee the selection, development, implementation
and evaluation of 10 rapid-cycle pilot studies (2/year) at the intersection of health equity, implementation
science and telehealth cancer care; and (5) Frame the affordability of scaling up effective interventions that are
identified from the pilot studies."
10903871,"Four cancers – lung, colorectal, prostate and breast – account for nearly half of all cancer deaths among men
and women in the United States. Social determinants of telehealth (SDTH), such as race/ethnicity, poverty and
rurality, individually and in additive or synergistic combinations play an important role in access to and
outcomes from cancer care, often accounting for the observed cancer care disparities. Veterans Health
Administration (VA) is the largest integrated provider of cancer care in the US and provides state of the art
cancer care to millions of veterans. Yet even within VA, routinely praised for its equal access to care model,
disparities in cancer care persist. However, while VA serves a population at risk for SDTH driven healthcare
disparities, it also leverages the advantages of an integrated national single-payer system, such as care
coordination and telehealth, to improve health equity.
Widespread use of telehelath in oncology creates both challenges and opportunities to expand access and
improve care. In some cases, however, reliance on telehealth may widen the “digital divide” for those with
limited ability to access it. A major knowledge gap exists regarding the optimal way to integrate telehealth into
oncology practice across the care continuum. Our overarching aim is to improve the quality and equity of
cancer care across the United States by leveraging lessons learned applying telehealth treating veterans with
cancer in VA’s integrated health care system.
The objective of the pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of an existing, ongoing clinical service, the VA
National TeleOncology program (NTO), a multilevel telehealth population health management program. We
propose a stepped wedge, cluster randomized, hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of NTO among
veterans diagnosed with prostate, lung, colon and breast cancers in VA. Using the NIMHD Health Disparities
Research Framework, we will employ mixed methods to explore the association across SDTH between NTO
and 1) service delivery outcomes, 2) hierarchical cancer outcomes, and 3) implementation outcomes.
Specifically, the aims of the pragmatic trial are to: (1) Evaluate the effect of a comprehensive multilevel virtual
oncology program to promote telehealth engagement on stakeholder (patient, provider, administrator) cancer
care experience across SDTH; (2) Evaluate the effect of a comprehensive, multilevel virtual oncology program
on quality of cancer care in veterans diagnosed with lung, colorectal, prostate and breast cancer across SDTH;
and (3) Determine the impact and cost of a comprehensive multilevel teleoncology program.
Our proposed hybrid effectiveness implementation trial to evaluate a comprehensive virtual oncology program
to promote telehealth engagement and health equity has high potential for scalability and public health impact
both within and outside of VA."
10903873,"SUMMARY
The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States,
providing care at 1,293 health care facilities, including 171 medical centers and 1,112 outpatient sites and
serving approximately 9 million enrolled Veterans. It is also one of the largest educational systems, with 70% of
physicians having received some of their training in VA. Reflecting its tripartite mission of patient care,
education and research, VA also funds more research than any other US health care system. While most
honorably discharged veterans are eligible to use VA for care, it is disproportionately used by those without
other health insurance. As a result, VA acts in part as a national “safety net” health system for veterans. For
this reason, and many others, health equity has always been an important goal for VA healthcare.
Oncology care in VA is multidisciplinary, with care coordinated between primary care, hematology/ oncology,
surgical oncology, radiation oncology and others. Primary care is based on the patient-centered medical home
model, so the primary care team typically includes nursing, pharmacy, social work and psychology. This
multidisciplinary care is facilitated by a uniform national electronic health record (EHR) system and a common
platform for all virtual care in VA. With its continual focus on quality improvement, patient-centered care and
health equity, VA health care system will serve as the setting for the innovative tele-oncology research
proposed by this center, Telehealth Research and Innovation for Veterans with Cancer (THRIVE).
The Clinical Practice Network Core will act as the Clinical Coordinating Center for THRIVE. It will be
responsible for: 1) organizing patient recruitment and identification; 2) serve as the “tech center” for
coordinating all technology-focused activities related to the center projects; and 3) serve as the care
coordination center such that all care across the sites are coordinated via the network. We already have
longstanding relationships with VA National Oncology Program Office and VA Office of Connected Care, which
respectively oversee all oncologic care and all virtual care. The Clinical Practice Network Core will further
strengthen our connections by serving as liaison with both national VA program offices and with individual
study sites. Our specific aims are to: (1) Create a virtual, decentralized clinical practice network; (2) Leverage
informatics for the equitable recruitment and enrollment of cancer patients across social strata; and (3) Create
a learning research environment that incorporates assessments and iterative process improvement."

10903894,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity are highly prevalent chromosome aberrations caused by sister-
chromatid segregation errors during mitosis. Aneuploidy is especially common in triple-negative breast
cancers, where outgrowth of aneuploid cells is permitted by the near-universal loss of TP53 that normally
surveils genomic integrity. Prior work from our team has connected the aneuploid phenotype in breast cancer
to network-level abundance changes in genes induced by mitotic transcription factors, which are chronically
elevated in tumors. The target genes of these transcription factors reside upstream and downstream of the
chromosome passenger complex (CPC), a four-protein sensor of proper spindle assembly and a mediator of
repair. The CPC must localize to the inner centromere and auto-activate when microtubules are incorrectly
attached. We recently found that the CPC accumulates during metaphase to a critical concentration causing it
to phase separate as a liquid condensate. CPC phase separation likely confers robustness of function, yet
cancers manage to bypass this checkpoint by changing the abundance of multiple regulators and effectors that
together cause cells to enter a state of chromosome instability. Our objective is to unravel how the complex
abundance imbalances of network regulators found in tumors stress the robust localization of the CPC to the
inner centromere and generate chromosome instability in breast cancers or precursor lesions. The leading
hypothesis is that phase-separated CPC acts as a “phenotypic capacitor” during mitosis by buffering small to
moderate imbalances (storage) and unleashing dramatic rearrangements when a threshold imbalance is
reached (discharge). We will test this hypothesis using biochemical reaction-diffusion models of spatially
regulated CPC phase separation, which will be tailored to primary mammary organoids derived from a mosaic
GEMM of triple-negative mammary cancer and extended to clinical samples through standard diagnostic
assays. The specific aims are to 1) develop and validate a spatial systems model of CPC recruitment that
isolates phase separation and predicts critical network imbalances in cancer-predisposed mammary organoids;
2) test the instability-generating potential of critical network imbalances by quantitatively perturbing triple-
negative mammary premalignancies in vivo; and 3) leverage routine clinical diagnostics to predict druggable
chromosomal instability signatures in any primary breast cancer. Patient-specific, systems-level models of
aneuploidy susceptibility will nominate kinase inhibitors in the network that are predicted to shift cells from
robust to fragile states of segregation fidelity."
10903896,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
During tumorigenesis, mitochondrial function is altered by fusion/fission dynamics that control organelle
structure and impact overall cell metabolism. Signaling from oncogenic RAS fragments mitochondrial tubules
and causes metabolic changes that support tumor growth. However, the precise role of these oncogene-
driven mitochondrial changes on cancer metabolism is unclear, especially when considering the diverse
metabolic environments in which tumors develop. For example, colorectal cancer (CRC) initiates in the gut
where the microbiota produces high quantities of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are metabolized by
normal colonocytes. During CRC tumorigenesis, mutations in the KRAS oncogene occur at the transition to
adenomas, suggesting that mitochondrial adaptation in the gut may be critical for progression of primary
tumors. And yet, the primary site of CRC metastasis is the liver, which provides a very different set of nutrients
for metabolism and growth. Recognizing the complexity of metabolic networks both inside and outside a
developing tumor, we propose a systems biology approach to examine the role of RAS-induced mitochondrial
fission in CRC. Specifically, our objective is to identify metabolic adaptations that permit mitochondrially
fragmented CRC cells to grow in the unique metabolic environment of the gut and metastatic CRC cells to
grow in the liver. While the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network can impact tumor metabolism in
multiple ways, we hypothesize that RAS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation leads to hyper-
compartmentalization of specific metabolic reactions within the mitochondrial matrix that depend on low-
abundance mitochondrial proteins. We predict that these adaptations create unique vulnerabilities in CRC
cells as they switch from normal SCFA metabolism to promote biosynthesis and energy generation. The
specific aims are to 1) curate a metabolic model of human CRC cells that incorporates the system-wide impact
of mitochondrial fragmentation and the availability of microbe-derived SCFAs; 2) instantiate metabolic models
of CRC with data characterizing in vivo metabolic states to assess impacts of gut microbiota metabolism and
mitochondrial fragmentation; and 3) evaluate the impact of metabolic adaptations to mitochondrial organelle
stress on CRC colonization and growth as liver metastases. Successful completion of this project will provide
a better understanding of CRC metabolism that may one day point to dietary interventions or shifts in the gut
microbiota that predictably influence organelle adaptation."

10903899,"SUMMARY
The most common genetic alteration in glioblastoma (GBM) is amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinase
EGFR. In GBM, some amplified EGFR further mutates to yield exon-deleted EGFRvIII, which is constitutively
active and endocytosis impaired, thereby signaling to effector pathways that favor survival over proliferation. It
is not clear why EGFRvIII is specifically selected for in this disease, but GBM cells poorly tolerate unbridled
signaling from the EGFR effector RAS. Chronic RAS signaling places an oncogene-induced stress on cell
membranes that gives rise to excessive micropinocytosis and vacuolization, concluding with an alternative
form of cell death called methuosis. The objective of this work is to reconcile EGFR amplification and
EGFR/RAS-induced membrane stress through EGFRvIII and the signaling intermediates they share.
Preliminary evidence suggests that EGFRvIII may achieve stress-relieving signaling adaptations by rewiring
the network of protein-protein interactions at different subcellular locations within GBM cells. Our hypothesis is
that EGFRvIII is a GBM-specific adaptive mechanism for overcoming methuosis. We will build a computational
model of EGFR/EGFRvIII signaling that tests this hypothesis by accounting for the network of protein
interactions and signaling relevant for the methuosis phenotype. The specific aims are to 1) define the key
intermolecular interactions in the EGFR signaling network and mechanistically predict the consequences of
network adaptations to EGFRvIII expression; 2) map differential EGFR signaling network activation among
glioblastoma cells to the methuosis phenotype through a hybrid mechanistic and data-driven computational
model; and 3) test model predictions about signaling control of methuosis in vitro and in vivo using new tools to
monitor RAS-ERK and AKT activities concurrently and noninvasively. This project brings together a team of
investigators with complementary expertise in mechanistic and data-driven computational models of receptor-
mediated signaling, protein-protein interactions, in vivo transplantations of GBM, and treatment of GBM
patients using investigational approaches. By quantitatively testing the hypothesis about EGFRvIII as a key
regulator of oncogene-induced plasma membrane stress in glioblastoma, our collaborative project holds
promise for identifying conceptually new approaches for driving alternative cell-death phenotypes in a highly
chemotherapy-resistant cancer for which durable therapies are desperately needed."

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic (functional) constipation have a worldwide prevalence of 11.2% and
14%, respectively and are more common in women than men. However, the pathophysiology of IBS and
normal transit constipation (the largest subtype of chronic constipation) is incompletely understood and this
likely contributes to the fact that treatments are only efficacious in a subset of patients. Significant sex-related
differences include increased severity of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in women compared to men and
during menopause and in the premenses and menses phase of the menstrual cycle which are states of
depleted or declining estrogen. Based on previous studies and our preliminary data, our general hypotheses
are: 1) IBS symptom severity in female IBS increases during times of low or declining estrogen states, namely
in menopause and mid to late-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and is due to reduced estrogen-dependent
corticolimbic inhibition of emotional arousal networks, resulting in enhanced visceral perception. Alterations in
circulating gut microbial metabolites, in particular tryptophan, estrogen, and bile acids affecting brain stem
nuclei may play an additional role, and 2) The increased prevalence and severity of normal transit constipation
in women (in the absence of changes in transit or defecation), is due to altered perception of normal, non-
noxious afferent signals from the colon resulting from altered central processing. This is due to widespread
changes in sensorimotor, salience, and emotional arousal networks and is in part related to increased input
from ascending arousal systems originating in brainstem nuclei. Changes in the activity of and ascending
projections from these brainstem nuclei may be related in part to the influence of gut microbial metabolites and
of estrogen. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims in which we will measure the relative
abundance of gut microbial taxa (16S rRNA), total microbial gene content (shotgun metagenomics), plasma
and fecal metabolites (commercial metabolomic platform), and multimodal brain MRI (functional resting state
connectivity and pain threat evoked responses) in female subjects: 1) Compare GI symptoms and BGM
interactions in premenopausal and postmenopausal female IBS and healthy controls (HCs) and 2) Compare
BGM interactions in premenopausal females with normal transit constipation with slow transit constipation and
HCs. We anticipate that our findings will identify novel endophenotypes that can lead to the development of
novel treatment approaches."
10903908,"ABSTRACT
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent intestinal disorder characterized by chronically recurring
abdominal pain and altered bowel habit. Despite extensive research efforts over the past few decades, there is
no general consensus about the pathophysiology, the role of SABV in pathophysiology, nor are there been any
reliable biomarkers for guiding treatment decisions. This lack of progress is reflected in the continued
excessive direct and indirect health care costs generated by these conditions, largely due to unnecessary
diagnostic procedures and lack of effective therapies. Increasing evidence supports a role of dysregulations
within the brain-gut microbiome (BGM) axis in IBS. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to
determine the sex-specific role of distinct brainstem nuclei and their bidirectional interactions with several brain
networks, of the gut, and of gut microbial metabolites and female sex hormones in symptom generation in IBS.
To address this goal we will first characterize sex-specific functional and structural changes in the brain and
brainstem using multimodal MRI (structural, DTI, functional MRI) in IBS patients and healthy control subjects
(HCs). We will use machine learning and neural network approaches to identify a CNS signature from the
imaging data for IBS by leveraging both the newly enrolled IBS subjects and our large existing database of
functional and structural MRI scans in IBS and HCs. We will identify sex differences in cross sectional
associations between functional and structural imaging measurements, gut microbial measures (RNA
sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, metabolomics) and behavioral characteristics of IBS patients, with an
emphasis on estrogen and tryptophan metabolites and short chain fatty acids. The information garnered from
this study is expected to identify biologically based male and female patient subgroups, to reveal novel insights
into the involvement of BGM interactions in IBS pathophysiology, in particular about the involvement of the
brainstem and gut microbial metabolites, and to aid in the development of more effective treatment strategies
in IBS."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death among Chinese in the US. CRC
screening prevents cancer and reduces mortality through the removal of precancerous polyps. However, CRC
screening is severely underutilized by Chinese in the US with only 47% of Chinese Americans over age 50
reporting having ever completed a CRC screening compared to 73% of non-Hispanic whites. Given these
disparities, it is critical to increase Chinese immigrants' participation in cancer prevention efforts. Research
indicate community engaged interventions, such as narrative education and patient navigation are promising
strategies for increasing CRC screening in vulnerable populations. In this study, we propose to develop and
pilot test CoLorectal Cancer Narrative Education and Navigation (CLEAN), a community-engaged intervention
consisting of narrative education and patient navigation to improve CRC screening in Chinese immigrants. To
develop CLEAN, we will culturally and linguistically adapt Witness CARES, a theory-driven, evidence-based
narrative group education program. We will also enhance the program with patient navigation to further
promote CRC screening in this vulnerable population. Thus, our specific aims are to: (1) Develop CLEAN by
culturally and linguistically adapting and enhancing Witness CARES to support CRC screening among Chinese
immigrants; and (2) Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of CLEAN for supporting
CRC screening in Chinese immigrants. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve prevention
and early detection of CRC in Chinese immigrants and other underserved groups with the ultimate objective of
reducing cancer disparities. The proposed research is directly relevant to Dr. Vang's career goals and

and randomized controlled trials design and analysis. Given the institution's high quality research environment
and resources, and with the guidance of the experienced mentoring team, Dr. Vang will have the support and
resources necessary to successfully pursue the proposed research and training aims. Over the course of the
5-year funding period, she will participate in ongoing meetings with her mentors, complete formal coursework
and interactive training activities offered at her institution and elsewhere; submit a minimum of 5 first author
manuscripts for publication; and attend scientific research conferences to foster national networks with
researchers in cancer health disparities. This multimodal training plan will provide Dr. Vang with the
comprehensive skills needed to achieve her research aims and professional goal of becoming an independent

10900356,"Project Summary:
Goal-directed behaviors aim to maximize rewards in changing environments. Abnormalities in goal-directed
behavior are a feature of a range of neuropsychiatric diseases and are functionally impairing. The dorsomedial
striatum (DMS) is critical for the execution of goal-directed behavior. Within the DMS, the role of sparse
GABAergic interneurons in behavior is of increasing interest. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking
interneurons (FSIs) exhibit sensory-guided choice- and action initiation-related activity, while somatostatin-
positive (SST+) low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs) exhibit novel reward-related activity that decays
throughout operant learning. However, the role of FSIs and LTSIs in value-based goal-directed behavior is not
known. Both subtypes receive cortical inputs that guide value-based choice and signal unexpected outcomes.
FSIs are soma-targeting, allowing them to directly control principal neuron spiking and optimize ensemble
recruitment, while LTSIs are dendritic-targeting, allowing them to modulate excitability of principal neurons in
response to cortical inputs. Using this framework as a starting point would suggest striatal FSIs mediate updating
of actions by silencing previously active SPN ensembles, while LTSIs may facilitate reward-history integration
by decreasing SPN excitability and attenuating sensitivity to incoming cortical information biasing choice. LTSIs
additionally exert inhibition onto midbrain dopaminergic afferents to the DMS, which play a role in the modulation
of motor vigor. My preliminary data demonstrate that LTSIs exhibit unexpected outcome-related activity, and that
constitutive inhibition of LTSIs increases motor vigor. I therefore hypothesize that DMS FSIs exhibit pre-choice
activity to refine action selection and inhibit competing actions, especially as contingencies change. Conversely,
I hypothesize that DMS LTSI activity is higher in the setting of unexpected rewards, and thus helps constrain
vigor and facilitate integration of evidence when contingencies change. To test these hypotheses, I have
developed a head-fixed two-alternative forced choice behavioral paradigm in mice that assays the effect of
varying relative reward values, reward probabilities, and net reward environment on value-based goal-directed
choice and motor vigor. With this task, I aim to elucidate FSI and LTSI activity patterns during value-based
behavior using fiber photometry and 1-photon miniscope recordings, and causally manipulate their
activity using optogenetics. These findings will contribute to a growing evidence base on the role of striatal
microcircuitry in striatal function and goal-directed behavior, with potential translational relevance suggested by
evidence implicating striatal interneurons in a range of neuropsychiatric disease presentations."
10900017,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myofibroblasts generate scar tissue in wound healing and most forms of organ fibrosis. Aberrant wound healing
produces a large clinical burden, including deficient wound healing (dehiscence and chronic non-healing wounds)
and excessive wound healing (keloids and hypertrophic scars). During wound healing, quiescent fibroblasts are
activated to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are critical for proper wound healing.
After the wound is closed, SMApositive myofibroblasts disappear from the skin. Where do they go? Recent studies
show that many myofibroblasts revert to deactivated myofibroblasts or post-contractile fibroblasts. This project
begins with preliminary data showing that many PostnMerCreMer labeled skin myofibroblasts revert to a deactivated
SMAnegative phenotype and persist in the lower scar long after wound closure, suggesting that survival is
regulated rather than stochastic. Myofibroblasts in the lower scar express higher levels of the Hippo-regulated
transcriptional cofactors YAP and TAZ compared to myofibroblasts in the upper scar. This project will create a
molecular map of the myofibroblast life cycle and will test the hypothesis that myofibroblasts convert to a
deactivated phenotype in late wound healing through YAP/TAZ-dependent survival. To generate a molecular
map of the myofibroblast life cycle (Aim 1), the NuTRAP system will be used to isolate nuclei and translating
mRNAs in vivo, specifically from cells of the fibroblast-myofibroblast lineage, at each stage of the life-cycle. Then,
ATAC-seq and RNA-seq will be performed and data sets integrated to create a map of how chromatin and gene
expression coordinately change as fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts and then convert into deactivated
myofibroblasts. scRNA-seq will also be used to characterize deactivated myofibroblast heterogeneity and to map
the lineage of PostnMerCreMer labeled cells. Second, this proposal will use genetic approaches to investigate the
role of Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling in myofibroblast deactivation and survival (Aim 2). The results of this project
will move the field forward by characterizing the myofibroblast life cycle in the skin and exploring the latent
fibrogenic potential of deactivated myofibroblasts. This will be significant to human health because it may open
the way to precisely modulate these signals as a treatment for skin fibrosis and regenerative medicine."
10900016,"Weight status differences are present upon entry into kindergarten, indicating that the origins of
overweight/obesity (OWOB) develop before elementary school. Preschoolers (3-4-yr-olds) may also
experience accelerated weight gain (i.e., increased zBMI) during the summer and lose weight (i.e., decreased
zBMI) during the school year – indicating that summer may play a key role in developing OWOB. Preschoolers
from low-income households (i.e., 185% or less of poverty level or Medicaid eligible) are at the greatest risk for
accelerated summer weight gain. In general, we don’t know the places preschoolers go, who they are with, and
what they do during the summer that may influence their health behaviors and weight status. In the US, many
center-based childcares operate on an academic/school calendar (Aug-May), and 60-80% of preschoolers
attend center-based care. Preschoolers who attend formal center-based childcare are less likely to develop
OWOB by 1st grade compared to preschoolers who receive home-based care. We believe attending center-
based childcare lowers the risk of OWOB through daily rules/routines that promote healthy behaviors (e.g.,
PE/recess, healthy meals, consistent sleep schedules at home). Center-based care facilitates the acquisition of
motor skills and fosters executive functioning/self-regulation – key factors in the development of OWOB.
During summer, fewer than 30% of preschoolers attend center-based childcare. For many preschoolers,
especially those from lower-income households, summer may be an extended period away from formal center-
based childcare that promotes unhealthy behaviors, loss of motor skills, and loss of executive functioning,
which could lead to excessive weight gain. We will conduct an observational cohort, enrolling 3-4-yr-old
children attending needs-based (185% or less of poverty level or Medicaid eligible) center-based childcare
during the academic/school year and follow them for 2 years (2 school years and 2 summers) as they transition
from preschool into elementary school. Measures of anthropometrics, motor skills, and executive function will
be collected before school ends and upon return from summer vacation. Health behaviors (i.e., activity,
screentime, diet, and sleep) will be collected during April/May (school) and July (summer) along with
information about social- and setting-specific influences. The following aims will be addressed: Compare
longitudinal changes in anthropometrics (primary outcome), health behaviors (secondary outcomes), and
motor skills and executive function (tertiary outcomes) during school and summer; Identify individual,
family/home, neighborhood, and school/community influences that moderate changes in anthropometrics,
health behaviors, motor skills, and executive function during school and summer; and Qualitatively interview
parents about their child’s school and summer experiences and health behaviors."
10900018,"SUMMARY
Recent revolutionary advances in RNA-based therapies have been made possible due to decades of research
on basic mechanisms of RNA regulation. An untapped level of RNA control with wide-ranging clinical relevance
relates to targeting of mRNAs to subcellular compartments and local mRNA translation. Indeed, such
mechanisms play a major role in controlling protein expression and function from unicellular organisms to
humans. By favoring on-site and on-demand protein production, they contribute to numerous cellular,
neurobiological, and developmental processes including the generation of cellular asymmetry, synapse growth
and plasticity, axon pathfinding, and patterning and differentiation in embryos. Highly polarized and long-lived
neuronal cells are particularly reliant on this mechanisms and defects in RNA transport and translational
regulation are increasingly associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The FASEB
Science Research Conference on RNA Localization and Local Translation is the premier international meeting
dedicated to this promising branch of RNA biology and it has been key to the continuous development of the
field. Importantly, this conference provides a unique venue for bringing together investigators who share
interests in RNA transport, translation, stability and decay, but use a complementary experimental systems and
approaches to understand how cells harness RNA regulation to achieve tight spatial and temporal control of
protein expression. Other RNA-focused conferences are typically large, which limits interactions, and offer only
a handful of talks on RNA regulation in cellular systems. The overarching goal here is to promote interactions
among scientists at different career stages and from different backgrounds in order to identify key challenges in
the field, generate new ideas and technologies, and foster collaborations that will drive the field forward.
 Participation in conferences by early-career scientists and trainees is crucial to their network
establishment and future career opportunities as well as to innovation and growth of the field. In this proposal,
we request funds to support these groups, with an emphasis on individuals from underrepresented
communities, to attend the 2024 FASEB conference on RNA Localization and Local Translation. A draft
program has been outlined around a small number of speakers and session chairs, who have enthusiastically
accepted our invitation. Apart from those, the majority of talks will be allocated to speakers who will be selected
from submitted abstracts, to promote participation by newly minted PIs, post-doctoral fellows, and students –
groups that include higher numbers of underrepresented researchers. Informal interaction between more
senior members of the field and junior scientists and trainees will be also facilitated by planned events
including an ‘Outstanding Questions’ workshop, ‘Meet-the-experts’ sessions, and ‘Career Development’
roundtable discussions. The mix of attendees will further participate to the conference goals to spawn
collaborations and stimulate innovative research on the biology of RNA localization and local translation."
10875824,"The broad objective guiding our research is to conduct analyses that will inform health care providers and
policy makers on how to deliver equitable, value-based care for patients with knee OA, particularly those who
experience challenges related to social determinants of health (SDoH).
Symptomatic knee OA is a prevalent, disabling and costly disease that affects over 14 million Americans and
accounts for $27 billion/year in healthcare expenditure. The SDoH have been shown to contribute to worse
outcomes of knee OA, and these challenges are further exacerbated by the gap between ‘what we know’ and
‘what we do’. Strong evidence suggests that exercise is efficacious for pain control, but adequate
implementation of exercise programs is hindered by a lack of funds and infrastructure. Telemedicine (TM),
potentially a paradigm-shifting tool in many facets of OA management, improves convenience, but its adoption
depends on patient’s digital literacy, and requires careful consideration of how to integrate it in the continuum
of OA care. The armamentarium of intraarticular injections is growing rapidly, but concerns regarding efficacy,
lack of standardization, and high cost raise concerns among providers, while aggressive advertising campaigns
lead to increased demand for these injections from patients with knee OA. In 2018, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services moved total knee arthroplasty (TKA) off the inpatient-only list, opening opportunities for
outpatient/ambulatory TKA delivery. This shift presented potential economic savings for payers but raised
questions about patient selection and its impact on patients with knee OA living in rural areas and for patients
with less social support.
We propose to enhance the capabilities of the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model to examine the value of
prioritizing knee OA management strategies based on their potential to reduce inequities in health care
delivery and outcomes. We focus on three major aspects of OA management with sizeable gaps between
evidence and current practice: 1) optimizing the value of TM-based OA management and promoting its use
among persons with challenges related to SDoH; 2) establishing the value of alternative intraarticular
injections with various formulations and reducing inequities in uptake; 3) assessing the value of
outpatient/ambulatory TKA and comparing resulting health gains to impacts on disparities. We propose to use
innovative modeling methods to assess the value of TM, orthobiologics and outpatient TKA and to identify
strategies to reduce inequities in the delivery of these treatments in persons with SDoH-related challenges.
This study will guide clinicians in optimizing their efforts to promote care that is cost-effective and equitable."
10900125,"Project Summary
 Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting 1 in 8 adults in the United States. It is
characterized by pain, stiffness, and swelling in the hands, hips, or knees, significantly impacting daily
functioning and overall quality of life. Current treatment approaches primarily focus on pain management rather
than addressing the underlying cause of OA: the degradation of articular cartilage (AC). AC is a smooth and
protective layer of hyaline cartilage that covers the ends of bones in synovial joints that is actively maintained
by long-lived articular cartilage chondrocytes (ACC). However, ACCs have limited regenerative capacity and
fail to repair AC after damage. Ultimately, AC damage leads to improper joint loading and further pathological
remodeling of the synovial joint, including AC ossification.
 AC ossification occurs through the inappropriate activation of endochondral ossification-like programs,
similar to the development of growth plate chondrocytes (GPC) during embryogenesis. Interestingly, both
ACCs and GPCs originate from chondrocyte progenitors (CPs) in the developing limb. As skeletal elements
mature, CPs can differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which eventually form bone. In contrast, at the
prospective synovial joint site, CPs undergo a process of ""dedifferentiation,"" downregulating Sox9 and Col2a1
to form a structure called the interzone (IZ). Cells within and around the IZ later develop into ACCs and other
components of synovial joints.
 To investigate the critical decision between GPC and IZ/ACC fate, we employed gene regulatory
network (GRN) analysis and identified the transcription factors PITX1, ATF4, and SOX4 as regulators of CP
cell fate before interzone development. Notably, PITX1 and ATF4 have each been shown to bind the Sox9
promoter, but PITX1 and ATF4 are associated with different lineage biases (ACC and GPC, respectively). The
mechanisms underlying the maintenance of CP multipotency and the reprogramming of CPs to commit to ACC
differentiation remain unclear.
 In our proposed project, we will utilize murine Sox9 lineage tracing models to characterize changes in
cell identity during differentiation. The objectives of the study are to determine: 1) the extent to which candidate
CP transcription factors, such as PITX1 and ATF4 exhibit mutually antagonistic effects and promote the
expression of ACC and GPC genes and 2) the requirement of CP reprogramming during IZ development for
ACC fate. We foresee that the completion of this project will reveal novel properties of synovial joint
development for potential therapeutic targeting."

10901499,"Abstract: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder affecting up to 25% of people who
have been exposed to a traumatic event characterized by maladaptive anxiety with increased risk for suicide
and cognitive impairment. In rodent models of PTSD microglia-mediated synaptic loss has been shown to be a
significant contributing factor to disease. In humans, magnetic resonance imaging illustrates reduced activity in
the frontal cortices among PTSD patients and reports indicate PTSD confers an increased risk for inflammatory
and autoimmune disorders with elevated T-cell activity and cytokine levels in the blood. However, little is known
about the neuroinflammatory changes in human PTSD brains. Moreover, our brain banks have found that
individuals pathologically diagnosed with the degenerative tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE),
have an increased incidence of antemortem PTSD. CTE is an Alzheimer’s Disease related dementia (ADRD)
that heavily impacts the frontal cortices and there is a significant gap in knowledge of how comorbid ADRD may
affect PTSD pathology. Based on previous literature we hypothesize that neuroinflammation may result in
synaptic loss in the frontal cortex leading to anxiety and memory impairment in PTSD. We also suspect that
comorbid CTE will further exacerbate these changes. To address our hypotheses, we will use the frontal cortex
of postmortem tissue from clinically confirmed cases of PTSD for histological and genomic analysis, as well as
corresponding clinical data. The role of CTE comorbidity in the development of PTSD pathologies will be
established through the inclusion of controls, PTSD subjects, individuals with comorbid PTSD and CTE
(PTSD+CTE), and those with only CTE. In Aim 1 we will define microglia-mediated synapse loss and its
association with clinical symptoms in PTSD and CTE compared to controls and PTSD+CTE via multiplex
immunofluorescence (IF) and high-resolution confocal microscopy. In Aim 2 we will quantitate CNS T-cell
infiltration and activation in PTSD and CTE compared to controls and PTSD+CTE using multiplex IF and in-situ
hybridization. In Aim 3, we will utilize single nucleus RNA sequencing, a powerful genomic technique, to
characterize inflammatory signatures of immune cells and their clinicopathological significance in PTSD and CTE
compared to controls and PTSD+CTE."

 Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are major cause of death worldwide. Various immune-mediated
mechanisms are implicated in CVD pathogenesis. While microbiota regulates immunity, and altered microbiota
composition had been linked to CVD; the mechanisms regulating host-microbiota interactions during
atherosclerosis development and progression remain poorly understood. Cytokines are key mediators of
inflammation and multicellular cross-talk in the aortic wall and emerging players in atherosclerosis. However,
how cytokines regulate intestinal barrier and microbiota to distantly control atherosclerosis is unknown.
Furthermore, the role of microbiota in the regulation of neuronal expansion and neuroinflammation in aorta has
not been proposed.
Interleukin (IL)17 had been implicated into the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Its role had been
also investigated in atherosclerosis, however studies utilizing global IL17A or IL17R “gain- “or “loss-of-function”
approaches came to conflicting conclusions, and cell type specific role of IL17 signaling had never been
addressed. To determine if intestinal IL17RC signaling can distantly control atherosclerosis via microbiota- and
immune-dependent mechanisms, we generated a new atherosclerosis-prone mouse model (Ldlr-/- Il17rcfl/fl
VillinCre+). We found that IEC-specific ablation of IL17RC heightened intestinal inflammation, altered microbiota
composition, and accelerate atherosclerosis accompanied by accumulation of activated immune cells and
upregulation of neuronal signature in aortas of Ldlr-/- Il17rcfl/fl VillinCre+ mice, while these changes were abrogated
by microbiota depletion. In this proposal, supported by a wealth of unexpected preliminary data, we will
determine: 1) how IL17RC-dependent control of IEC metabolism and barrier function affects microbiota
composition and function; and 2) determine the mechanistic link between IL17RC-dependent alteration of
microbiota, metabolites and neuronal expansion and neuroinflammation in the aorta in atherosclerosis. We will
use novel mouse models with cell type specific cytokine signaling inactivation, intestinal organoids, “gain-of-
function” and “loss-of-function” experiments with microbiota and metabolites coupled with integrated array of
cutting-edge transcriptomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging, immunological and molecular biology analyses.
Overall, these studies will allow to investigate novel role of IL17RC signaling in regulation of host-microbiota
interactions and neuroinflammation in atherosclerosis and shed light on previously underappreciated cell type
specific IL17 functions."

The objectives of DIVINCI are to study influenza infection from birth to examine the effect of first
influenza exposure and subsequent exposures on the immune response. In this U01, we address
fundamental questions about how initial and repeated influenza exposures through natural
infections and/or vaccination shape infant and childhood immunity to influenza. The COVID-19
pandemic has created two main issues affecting DIVINCI: 1) reducing circulation of other
respiratory viruses across the world creating uncommon exposure histories for babies born during

therefore increasing rates of influenza-like illness in these communities and the need for clinical
testing of respiratory specimens. To address the above problems, we propose to continue to
enroll participants into the New Zealand and the Los Angeles cohorts for the next two years. In
total, we propose to enroll 150 additional infants in the New Zealand cohort and
continue enrollment efforts in Southern California. Additionally, the Supplement will cover

10901746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 ASXL1 is one of the most mutated genes in hematological disorders. ASXL1 mutations occur in all types of
myeloid malignancies, including 45% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cases where they are associated with
poor prognosis; and ASXL1 is the third-most mutated gene in clonal hematopoiesis, a condition defined by
aberrant expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and
other hematological disorders. Despite the prevalence and significance of ASXL1 mutations, it is poorly
understood how they are mechanistically linked with these hematological disorders as very little is known about
the protein itself.
 ASXL1 is a scaffolding component of the Polycomb-Repressive Deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, which
antagonizes Polycomb-mediated repression to regulate critical gene expression programs. Many ASXL1
mutations are frameshift or nonsense mutations in the final exon that result in truncated protein products. While
early work focused on the effects of knocking out ASXL1, recent work has shown that truncated ASXL1 is actually
present at higher levels than the wild-type protein. This stabilizes and hyperactivates PR-DUB, ultimately leading
to epigenetic dysregulation. However, the molecular basis of how ASXL1 truncation increases its abundance
and whether this drives its disease function remain unclear.
 In my preliminary studies, I discovered a degron in the last exon of ASXL1 that is necessary and sufficient
for its degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. This proposal will test my hypothesis that the highly
recurrent ASXL1-truncating mutations remove this degron to aberrantly stabilize the protein, leading to
formation of hyperactive PR-DUB complexes, de-repression of Polycomb-target genes, and HSC
expansion. To test this hypothesis, I will use a fluorescence-based cellular reporter of protein stability to further
characterize this degron and perform a CRISPR screen to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes the
degron. Then I will establish the relevance of this mechanism to the clonal expansion phenotype in primary HSCs
by CRISPR mutagenesis paired with single-cell RNA sequencing (i.e., Perturb-seq). In the long term, this
knowledge will advance our fundamental understanding of ASXL1’s role in primary hematopoiesis, how clinical
mutations disrupt that process, and propel the development of new therapeutic strategies for a wide array of
hematological disorders."
10901747,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heritable and debilitating progressive neurological disease and the most
common form of dementia. Among the AD risk loci identified by decades of AD genetics research, the APOE
locus encoding for Apolipoprotein E, specifically the APOE4 isoform, is the strongest known genetic risk factor
for sporadic AD (sAD). Thus, APOE4 represents a prime therapeutic target. However, APOE4 is differentially
penetrant across genetically-defined ancestral populations, increasingly so across African (AFR), Non-Finnish
European (NFE) and East Asian (EAS) ancestries. This suggests that other common genetic factors may modify
its penetrance and therefore protect or predispose certain individuals to its pathological effects. Yet, the definitive
sources of these differences remain undefined. This highlights a crucial gap in our understanding of sAD
heritability that will be essential to effectively prognosticate, stratify, and treat diverse patient populations.
 Recent trans-ancestry transcriptional profiling suggests that APOE4 expression in the AD brain differs
across ancestries and thus could be a key modifier of AD risk from APOE4. These expression differences could
be attributed to noncoding genetic variants within the APOE locus that influence cis-regulatory element activity,
leading to context-specific transcriptional dysregulation of APOE that drivies cell type- and state-specific
molecular phenotypes. Indeed, increased APOE expression has been linked to sAD phenotypes. Further
supporting this, reporter assays in cell lines suggest a subset of variants nearby APOE are functional. However,
it is yet to be definitively confirmed which, if any, of these APOE locus noncoding variants underlie differential
penetrance across AFR, NFE and EAS ancestries. This work aims to pinpoint functional ancestry-specific
genetic modifiers of APOE4 penetrance in human cells. Massively parallel reporter assays in iPSC-derived brain
cell types will functionally prioritize from a comprehensive set of 10,661 analytically-nominated variants (Aim 1).
Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of ancestry-diverse iPSC-derived brain cell types will create ancestry-
and cell type-specific gene-regulatory maps of the APOE locus necessary to functionally interpret prioritized
variants (Aim 2). In turn, employing scarless genome editing in iPSC-derived models will determine the
sufficiency of analytically nominated high-priority variants to alter gene expression in the APOE locus (Aim 3).
 This proposed work will accompany training goals centered around structured coursework in
bioinformatics, leadership and management training, and improving science communication towards leading an
independent research group in the future. Presenting this work at both broad and specific meetings will foster
interdisciplinary crosstalk core to these goals. All experiments and training will be jointly guided by sponsors Dr.
Ryan Corces and Dr. Yadong Huang in the Gladstone Institute for Neurological Disease. The unique combination
of relevant scientific expertise, structured training environment, and core resources at both UCSF and the
Gladstone Institutes will provide the necessary groundwork for successful training and research."
10901344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Monoaminergic systems in the brain play critical roles in the regulation of a wide variety of neural processes,
and are heavily implicated in the etiology of numerous mood-related disorders in humans, including major
depressive disorder (MDD). While mood disorders are highly heritable, it is clear that environmental factors also
contribute significantly to disease, with chronic stress representing one of the most common precipitating
factors for mood-related diagnoses. In recent years, persistent stress-induced alterations in gene expression
have been demonstrated to promote physiological alterations implicated in mood disorders, and more recently,
histone mechanisms affecting cell-type and regional specific chromatin structures have been causally linked to
the regulation of transcriptional programs that contribute to stress-mediated behaviors in preclinical rodent
models, as well as their responses to antidepressants (ADs). However, our understanding of how these
mechanisms mediate neural dysfunction in response to stress remains limited, and mechanistic connections
between altered monoaminergic signaling and resulting chromatin regulatory phenomena have remained
elusive. Our lab recently identified and mechanistically characterized histone proteins as novel substrates for so-
called monoaminylation in brain, a novel class of post-translational modification that contributes significantly to
gene expression in the central nervous system. In addition, we have observed that H3 monoaminylation states
are perturbed in postmortem brains of individuals diagnosed with certain psychiatric disorders related to
monoaminergic dysfunction (e.g., MDD), as well as in brains of pre-clinical rodent models for the study of these
disorders, phenomena that contribute importantly to transcriptional, physiological and behavioral deficits in these
models. We have also recently identified the protein NQO2 as the bona fide “reader” of H3 serotonylation
(H3Q5ser) in vivo. Since our previous data indicated aberrant roles for H3Q5ser accumulation in brain of
chronically stressed male and female mice as an important contributor to stress-mediated transcriptional and
behavioral plasticity (an effect completely reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatments), we now hypothesize that
NQO2 recruitment to loci displaying elevated H3Q5ser enrichment in response to stress may contribute
importantly to transcriptional programs that result in persistent stress susceptibility. These phenomena, when
attenuated by blockade of NQO2’s ability to bind to H3Q5ser, may then result in therapeutic outcomes, and may
further help to explain the mechanistic actions of traditional ADs. Here, we thus aim to: (1) mechanistically
characterize NQO2’s biochemical/molecular impact on H3Q5ser function in vitro (within a nucleosomal context)
and in cells; (2) rigorously characterize the cell-type specific impact of NQO2-H3Q5ser interactions on stress-
mediated transcriptional and behavioral plasticity in mice; and (3) elucidate the diversity of the neural
monoaminylome via implementation of novel, monoaminylation specific probes to biorthogonally label and
interrogate the full repertoire of serotonylated proteins in brain impacted by chronic stress and AD exposures."
10901345,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Flaviviruses are small, enveloped viruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes of about 11
kilobases. Upon cell entry and uncoating, the vRNA traffics to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is
translated as a single polyprotein that is then post-translationally processed by the viral and cellular proteases
into 10 functional subunits, consisting of three structural proteins and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. Among
the NS proteins are NS2B and NS3. NS3 consists of a serine protease and a helicase domain while NS2B is
anchored to the ER and has a cytoplasmic loop that serves as a cofactor required for the catalytic activity of the
NS3 protease domain. The NS2B3 complex is responsible for all cytoplasmic cleavage events of the viral
polyprotein, making it an essential protein complex with functions required for the viral lifecycle. Many studies
have reported on the structure, function, and importance of the NS2B3 protease; However, the molecular
determinants for flavivirus protease cleavage of intracellular substrates and how these factors affect viral fitness
is unknown. Using an intracellular protease activity reporter developed by our laboratory, we found that a soluble
form the reporter was not cleaved whereas an ER-anchored reporter was efficiently cleaved, suggesting there
are multiple determining factors within a substrate required for protease cleavage. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that there are other molecular determinants for flavivirus protease cleavage of substrates outside of primary
cleavage sequence. This will be addressed through manipulation of the intracellular localization of the reporter
substrate and the distance of the cleavage site from organelle membranes. Although the typical cleavage motif
of substrates is known, there is still some variability in the primary sequences cleaved by the protease at different
junctions within the viral polyprotein. We were interested in understanding the variability in cleavage efficiency
between the different sequences present in the viral polyprotein junctions of DENV, ZIKV, WNV, and YFV. Our
preliminary data showed that each flavivirus protease has its own unique cleavage profile and that each flavivirus
protease tested processed the sequence located at the junction between NS4A and the 2K peptide of its
polyprotein least efficiently. Further, we determined that introducing a more efficient cleavage site into the
NS4A/2K junction of a DENV infectious clone leads to the complete loss of viral recovery. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that aberrant cleavage at the NS4A/2K junction of the flavivirus polyprotein causes detrimental effects
to viral fitness. Using multiple genetic tools, we will assess the effect of this mutation on different stages of the
viral lifecycle, including replication, polyprotein stability/processing, and replication organelle formation. Together,
the results produced from this proposal will advance our understanding of the molecular determinants of flavivirus
protease cleavage and the role that sequence specificity plays in infection. Understanding the infectious role of
flavivirus protease specificity will aid in the development of antiviral therapeutics targeting this viral protein."

skills. Boston College was selected as the environment for me to carry out this proposal and achieve my training goals due
to its accessible and expert behavioral neuroscience faculty, wide range of available techniques and equipment, and access
to the large neuroscience network within the greater Boston area. The research objective is to identify and describe a
dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to insula tract responsible for responding to danger signals and executing appropriate
behavioral responses in males and females. Hyperactivity of the DRN and effects of 5-HT released in the forebrain are
closely related to anxiety-related behaviors. Similarly, the insula integrates interoceptive and exteroceptive cues and
contributes to motivated behaviors that are influenced by anxiety. Although both the DRN and insula have been
implicated separately in anxiety-related behaviors, it is not yet known how 5-HT influences this system. The aims of this
proposal are designed to describe how insular 5-HT modulates the appropriate behavioral responses to danger signals.
Aim 1 will utilize a viral-genetic anterograde tracing method to describe and compare insular DRN projections and
serotonergic receptors colocalizations between insular rostral-caudal subregions, insular subregions, and laminar layers. It
is expected that DRN projections will target both inhibitory and excitatory neurons in all insula subregions and colocalize
on 5-HT2C receptors expressing neurons in the insula. Aim 2 will next seek to visualize insular serotonergic activity in
response to a social and directly experienced danger cue using GRAB5-HT, a sensor for 5-HT activity, and in vivo fiber
photometry. It is expected that there will be greater insular 5-HT activity in response to a stressed conspecific and danger
cue than a naive conspecific and safety cue, respectively. Finally, Aim 3 uses a chemogenetic approach to inhibit or
stimulate insula-projecting DRN neurons to determine if the DRN-insula tract is necessary and sufficient for the
appropriate behavioral response to a social and directly experienced danger cue. Inhibiting the DRN-insula tract should
increase sociability while decreasing fear, while stimulating the DRN-insula tract should trigger 5-HT release, therefore
decreasing sociability but increasing fear. Completion of these three complementary aims will result in the most thorough
understanding of this circuitry’s composition and function in response to danger signals to date and inform development
of more effective treatments for anxiety-related disorders."
10904965,"The prevalence of myopia has rapidly increased over the last 30 years, becoming epidemic in many countries.
Myopia occurs when the eye’s focal plane falls in front of the retina due to excessive ocular axial length. High
myopia increases the risk for multiple sight-threatening ocular conditions. Developing interventions to halt myopia
is an important unmet public health need hampered by our poor understanding of the key molecular signaling
pathway(s) in myopigenesis.
It is well-established that refractive eye growth is modulated by visual input which stimulates local retinal signaling
and leads to scleral extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, an obligate step in axial elongation. Although several
molecules are known to participate in myopigenic signaling, here the focus is on all-trans retinoic acid (atRA)
due to: 1) its bidirectional role in scleral remodeling, 2) preliminary data showing that when atRA levels are
modulated in ocular tissues in the mouse, myopia develops and the scleral ECM remodels, and 3) our ability to
measure atRA in relevant ocular tissues to gain novel insights into the role of atRA in myopigenesis in mammals.
The overall objective is to develop innovative approaches to determine the role of atRA in myopia, focusing on
temporal and regional effects on the fundal layers. The proposal will use direct experiments and engineering
modeling tools to assess how myopigenic signaling molecules, specifically atRA, transverse the choroid, thereby
testing the hypothesis that atRA acts as a “master modulator” of scleral ECM remodeling in myopia.
To test this hypothesis 3 aims are proposed. First, atRA levels in mice will be experimentally modulated by
delivering, singly or in combination: (i) monocular form deprivation (FD, a myopigenic stimulus); (ii) oral atRA; or
(iii) an oral inhibitor of atRA synthesis. Key myopia-associated outcomes will then be measured across time. We
predict that exogenous atRA will induce myopia, choroidal thinning and scleral remodeling, similar to FD, while
inhibition of atRA production will attenuate the myopigenic effects of FD. Second, atRA levels in retina,
RPE/choroid, and sclera will be measured over time using mass spectrometry, and the amount and distribution
of the atRA receptor RARβ will be determined. We predict that atRA concentrations over time in key ocular
tissues will correlate with other myopia-associated outcomes. Third, transport characteristics for scleral
remodeling signals in myopia will be established by using engineering mass transfer modeling to determine
transport of signaling molecules through the ocular layers, thereby identifying how molecular characteristics
(size, charge, etc.) affect transport of myopigenic signaling molecules across the RPE, choroid and sclera.
Thanks to the combined expertise of a team with unique expertise in myopia biology/physiology, animal models,
biomechanics and modeling, and retinoid biochemistry, this project has the potential to elucidate the role of atRA
signaling in myopigenesis. Further, this study will determine the feasibility of treating myopia by intervening in
atRA-mediated scleral ECM remodeling, a translationally feasible approach."
10872661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year, at least 20% of women who give birth vaginally sustain an avulsion of the pubovisceral muscle
enthesis (PVME) at the pubic bone, substantially predisposing to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and associated
disorders later in life. POP, a chronic disease unique to women, represents a major public health burden since
12.6% of US women will undergo a major surgical repair of POP by age 80, at an estimated cost of > $10 billion
annually. Currently, our inability to repair PVME avulsions, either at the time of injury or later in life when POP
has occurred, severely undermines the outcomes of current POP surgeries. PVME injuries are rarely recognized
at vaginal birth, and given that there is no viable treatment, there is little incentive to change this standard of
care. Lack of fundamental and longitudinal data on the pathophysiologic events that follow PVME avulsion and
the related biomechanical consequences further hinders the design of interventions. Bridging this knowledge
gap, the current proposal will first investigate the structure and function of native PVME and the pathophysiologic
events following injury, so as to inform the design of a composite scaffold that orchestrates an integrative repair.
We hypothesize that a surgically placed bioinspired composite scaffold with pre-engineered biomimetic
spatial cues in structure and composition will enable enthesis regeneration that will be superior to suture
repair. To test this, we develop a comprehensive framework for defining PVME injury and repair based on
transperineal ultrasound to 1) improve the identification of patients who will have persistent levator avulsion and
are candidates for repair; and 2) guide the development of design parameters for an effective repair using a
bioinspired graft. Statistical shape models derived from 3D MRI models will be used as a gold standard to inform
the diagnostic interpretation of corresponding shape models established from transperineal ultrasound (TPUS)
in women with and without PVME injury. These analyses will be further informed by finite element simulations
predicting functional deficits after PVME injury and subsequent parametric studies of enthesis repair to enable
the establishment of basic design criteria for a scaffold based repair. In parallel, we perform cell culture and small
animal studies (Aim 2) to investigate matrix attributes, cell populations, and molecular and mechanical cues
involved in enthesis repair to further refine scaffold design and define needs for durable repair. With its high
capacity for biomimicry, a nanofiber-based bilayer scaffold with a mineralized component for osteointegration
and a nonmineralized portion for tendon formation already established to regenerate a functional tendon-bone
interface in rotator cuff repair will be adapted for PVME. Fiber diameter, alignment, and mineral content will be
readily optimized in Aim 2 to guide the cell response and direct enthesis healing. Finally, a nonhuman primate
model will be employed in a preclinical study that compares scaffold to suture repair and uninjured enthesis (Aim
3). We firmly believe that development of this bioinspired composite scaffold for PVME repair will lead to a
paradigm shift in the treatment of traumatic childbirth to the benefit of women world-wide."

Gaps and misconceptions in patient knowledge can contribute to poor care adherence, decreased quality of life,
and even negative outcomes, especially in underserved populations. There is an urgent need to systematically
capture, characterize, and develop mechanisms for breast cancer patient knowledge sharing. The objective of
the proposed feasibility and acceptability pilot study is to capture lived experiences of breast cancer patients and
characterize their knowledge types, levels, and gaps longitudinally. Topics include comprehension of illness
(type, stage, prognosis), treatment decision making, navigating emergent events resulting in deviations from
treatment trajectory (e.g. hospitalization for neutropenic fever). In a collaboration between human factors
researcher, medical oncologist, and a patient partner, we will conduct semi-structured Cognitive Task Analysis
interviews to elicit breast cancer patient experiences longitudinally (prior to first treatment, 6 months and 1 year
after diagnosis). We recruit ~35 adult breast cancer patients. We will analyze interview data using thematic
analysis and develop taxonomy of patient knowledge across the care continuum. The expected impact is: 1)
understanding patient knowledge and gaps as a function of time/experience and 2) gaining insight into designing
human-centered and culturally sensitive patient education."
10881899,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
West Nile virus (WNV) is a highly virulent human pathogen of the central nervous system (CNS) and the
most common cause of epidemic encephalitis in the United States. There are no vaccines or specific
antiviral treatments available for WNV-infected individuals, and development of such an arsenal requires a
more complete understanding of its pathogenesis. WNV is primarily transmitted through the bit of an
infected mosquito. Once deposited into the skin, the virus replicates in a local draining lymph node prior to
viremia, which allows the virus to spread to various organs, including the CNS, where neurons are the
major targets of infection. Currently, it is unclear which cells are infected outside of the CNS, but numerous
in vitro studies suggest that myeloid cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, are likely the primary targets.
To begin understanding this in a more physiologically relevant model, we utilized an ex vivo human
lymphoid tissue model, where WNV replicates robustly. We immunophenotyped the WNV-infected cells
and found that a significant proportion were CD4+ T cells. To further validate these findings, we generated
WNV mutant strains that contain cell-specific microRNA (miR) targets (miR-Ts) to restrict WNV replication
in a cell-specific manner. We engineered lymphoid- or myeloid-specific miR-Ts into the genome of WNV
and found that WNV strains unable to replicate in myeloid cells were able to replicate nearly identically to
wild-type WNV strains, while WNV strains incapable of replicating in lymphoid cells were unable to
replicate in this same model. Therefore, we hypothesize that lymphoid cells are essential initial
cellular targets for WNV replication in the periphery. In this application, we seek to identify the cells
that are essential for WNV replication in the human lymphoid tissue ex vivo (Aim 1) as well as in mice
(Aim 2)."

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common and devastating immune-mediated disease in which the
mucosal immune system abnormally recognizes the intestinal bacterial flora leading to chronic inflammation.
Approximately, 1% of the US population is affected. The causes of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC) lie in the interplay between host response genes and a microbiome with pathogenic properties. IBD
incidence has leveled off in the developed world and rising in the newly industrialized world. In the US, we are
witnessing a rising incidence in immigrants from low-risk parts of the world, particularly Hispanics. This provides
an opportunity for discovery of disease pathogenesis towards a goal of prevention and improved therapies.
Unfortunately, most genetic studies of IBD, including from the IBDGC, have focused on individuals of European
ancestry from North America and Europe. Moreover, most clinical trials of IBD medications include too few
Hispanics or Blacks and thus do not represent the totality of the affected population.
 Our group has a dedicated research interest on IBD in Latin-American immigrants and American-born
Hispanic patients. We have published highly-cited studies of the genotype and phenotype of IBD in the Hispanic
population of South Florida. We have also described disparities in medication usage and surgical rates. Important
for the notion that IBD is caused by a gene-environment interaction, we have found that IBD is occurring faster
in the last 20 years in immigrants from Latin-America. We have been very successful in our collection efforts
because of our location and our commitment and engagement in the Hispanic community. We have a unique
opportunity and obligation to study this disease within the Hispanic population. Miami-Dade County is over 50%
Hispanic. The state of Florida has the 3rd largest Hispanic population and the most diverse in terms of countries
of origin. We are poised with the support of an IBDGC grant to expand our collection efforts to the broader state
of Florida. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have facilitated the discovery of previously unrecognized
genes and pathways in IBD and provided the opportunity for unbiased exploration of the genomes of patients
with IBD. We will explore genetic variation in a large set of US-born and foreign-born Hispanic IBD cases by
focusing on targeted genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic differences between immigrant and first-generation
Hispanic-Americans with IBD. We will edify how genes and environment interact to result in diverse phenotypic
manifestations of IBD. Our group has particular expertise and interest in methods to fine-map previously
identified risk loci and access the impact of local genetic ancestry on genotype-ancestry interactions in relation
to phenotypic characteristics, with the goal of identifying genetic variation of functional significance. Our
proposed studies will expand knowledge of disease phenotype and genetic underpinnings in IBD in this growing
Hispanic cohort in the hopes of developing prevention and improved treatment approaches.
 We will use the complementary strengths of the two PIs to catapult discoveries and meet the goals of the
NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) to expand the collection of Hispanic IBD patients in the US."

Macrophages infiltrate the site of inflammation and polarize to either antiangiogenic M1-type macrophages or
proangiogenic M2-type macrophages, depending on the presence of various cytokines and other external
factors. Proangiogenic M2-type macrophages are major contributors to inflammatory angiogenesis in many
common diseases, in part by secreting proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A or IL-1b. Notably, M2-type
macrophages accumulate in areas of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with neovascular AMD. The
increase in M2-type macrophage-derived cytokines in eyes of patients with neovascular AMD has implicated this
cell population as a major driver of CNV pathogenesis. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation
of an accumulation of M2-type macrophages in laser-induced CNV or in a genetic VEGF-A-induced mouse
model of neovascular AMD. Ablation of macrophages in laser-induced CNV, which are predominantly M2-type
macrophages, blocked CNV, whereas administration of M2-type macrophages in the eye promoted CNV. Based
on these findings we propose that pharmacologic therapies that prevent M2-type polarization of macrophages
can serve as a novel approach to potently inhibit CNV progression in patients with neovascular AMD. The limited
understanding of the signaling mechanisms that are regulating M1- versus M2-type polarization of macrophages
has hindered the identification of molecular targets and pharmacologic inhibitors to selectively block M2-type
macrophage polarization. To address this unmet need, we have performed global quantitative time-course
proteomics and phosphoproteomics and identified kinase activation events that are associated with M1- versus
M2-type macrophage polarization. Furthermore, we identified in chemical screens pharmacologic inhibitors of
M2-type polarization that selectively block M2- but not M1-type polarization. Thus, the combination of these two
approaches provides us now with a unique resource to establish novel therapies that selectively block
proangiogenic M2- but not antiangiogenic M1-type macrophages in CNV. In proof-of-principle experiments we
can show that two of the identified inhibitors, the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat,
blocked M2-type macrophage polarization in CNV lesions and potently inhibited CNV lesion formation in laser-
induced CNV experiments. Our proposed experiments will test identified kinase and non-kinase inhibitors in a
systematic manner for their ability to selectively block M2-type polarization in detailed in vitro experiments as
well as in three well-established mouse models of neovascular AMD. Our proposal is based on extensive
preliminary data that provide a strong scientific premise. The proposed experiments have high rigor and
important clinical relevance and will likely lead to novel therapeutic approaches for neovascular AMD."

 Metabolites generated by the gut microbiota provide multiple health benefits. However, the
mechanism via which the gut microbiota utilizes substrates from the host and generates beneficial
products are not well understood. Additionally, information regarding the role of secretome i.e., a
collection of extracellular proteins secreted by the gut microbiota on health is minimal.
 Currently, no model system for the study of Type 9 protein Secretion System (T9SS) of gut microbes
exists. Our preliminary bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of functional T9SS in several
human gut isolates of the genus Bacteroides. We predict that the T9SS of gut Bacteroides secretes
pectate lyase and other enzymes that breakdown dietary fibers and subsequently ferment them to short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Reduction of SCFAs results in metabolic disorders. We predict that the
relatively understudied, yet important, human gut isolates that include Bacteroides intestinalis,
Bacteroides nordii, Bacteroides fluxus, Prevotella copri, and Parabacteroides distasonsis secrete many
proteins via T9SS. We are developing a genetically tractable species B. intestinalis as a model organism
to fill knowledge gap regarding studies of T9SS secretome in the gut. We hypothesize that the T9SS
secretome of the gut microbiota might create a common pool of oligosaccharides that enrich SCFA
producing species. Additionally, we aim to find controllers of a putative Bacteroides sensory transduction
network that senses the abundance of dietary fibers and regulates production of SCFA producing
enzymes. Our preliminary data also predicts the secretion of immune-suppressive cysteine proteases by
the T9SS of B. intestinalis. The proposed experiments to test our predictions and hypothesis will
significantly enhance our understanding of interspecies cooperation, resource optimization, and
immunomodulation by the gut microbiota.
 T9SS is a recently discovered protein export pathway of bacteria of the Gram-negative
Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes superphylum. Thus far, the model organisms for the study of T9SS
are from the human oral microbiota, environmental isolates, and pathogens infecting aquatic animals.
With this proposal, we are using our expertise with T9SS to push the barriers that impede our
understanding of secretome of the gut microbiota. The nuts and bolts of T9SS machinery are composed
of nineteen different proteins but their structure and functional properties are unclear. In future, this
information can help us control T9SS of the gut microbiota. At the core of T9SS is a rotary motor that
powers gliding motility of microbes. This motility enables cargo transportation and shapes the spatial
organization of a microbial community. We propose experiments to fill the gap regarding the mechanism
via which T9SS enables bacterial motility and protein secretion. Two important knowledge gaps: (a) the
role of T9SS in the gut microbiota, and (b) the structure and function of T9SS will be filled via a multi-
pronged experimental approach that uses genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, and murine models.
Together, we aim to gain a mechanistic understanding of T9SS machinery, its secretome in the gut
microbiota, and their impact on health."

Although acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and associated with adverse consequences, no specific AKI
therapy has emerged. This has been attributed to the heterogeneity of human AKI, which is poorly modeled by
animal experiments. The Kidney Precision Medicine Program (KPMP) was established by the NIH/NIDDK in
2016 to study human kidney tissue during an AKI event in order to discover pathogenic pathways and novel
therapeutic targets. The combined Johns Hopkins University (JHU)/Yale University site was funded in the first
phase of the KPMP to recruit AKI participants. During this first phase, the JHU/Yale site enrolled over one-half
of all AKI participants in KPMP, performed kidney biopsies with a strong commitment to safety and ethics,
retained all participants, and played an important role in the initiation and execution of study protocols through
committee leadership and participation. Enrollment was successfully restarted after a several-months-long
pause in recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and protocols were established to monitor participant
and staff safety. This is an application to continue to serve as an AKI recruitment site for the Kidney Precision
Medicine Program (KPMP) to create a high-quality, well-represented resource of tissues and biosamples from
hospitalized participants with AKI. The JHU/Yale center’s experience from the first phase of the study will be
invaluable as the consortium attempts to increase enrollment in the second phase. The specific aims are: 1) To
recruit a total of 150 diverse participants with AKI due to various etiologies and of varying severities in a
research study that safely and ethically performs protocol research biopsies to collect kidney tissue and obtain
concurrent biosamples and clinical data; 2) to retain participants in a longitudinal study using a hybrid approach
of active and passive follow-up that prioritizes participant convenience and obtains high-fidelity follow-up
information; and 3) to contribute biosamples from participants with various biopsy-proven etiologies of AKI from
larger cohorts with broader enrollment criteria to externally validate KPMP findings. In Aim 1, 30 diverse
participants with AKI per year will be enrolled across two academic medical centers while maintaining. high
safety and quality standards. In Aim 2, close to 100% follow-up of study participants will be obtained through
various approaches to garner information on objective measures of kidney health and patient-reported
outcomes. In Aim 3, to provide external validation of the KPMP findings, blood, urine, and DNA from over 500
participants who underwent routine clinically-indicated kidney biopsies for AKI will be contributed to the study.
Successful completion of these aims will result in the contribution of kidney tissue, biosamples, and data from
participants with AKI to the KPMP consortium to help achieve the broader goal of understanding the
pathogenesis of human AKI. This will lead to the identification of novel molecular targets and potential
therapies, as well as newer diagnostic tools for patients with AKI."

the many biomedical informatics training models that have come before us. Our
program is designed to produce graduates with depth in both computational methods
and biomedicine, an intimate familiarity with the science and technology that synergizes
the two, and the skills necessary to pioneer novel computational approaches to

short period. The program is tightly focused on transforming already strong students
and recent Ph.D.'s into mature and productive scientists. Our program is structured
around a set of four categories of educational goals and objectives: knowledge,
communication skills, professional behavior, and self-directed life-long learning. Our
graduates demonstrate the knowledge of core concepts and principles of biomedical
informatics, and have the ability to apply computation to gain insight into important
biomedical problems. Their knowledge includes mastery of the fundamentals of
biomedicine, clinical and translational research, statistics, and computer science, as well
as proficiency in the integration of these fields. Our graduates have contributed to the

 Retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration
(AMD), affect more than 10 million Americans. Unfortunately, many patients eventually suffer vision loss due to
no available therapeutic cure for these diseases. Retinal prosthesis is the only available option to make
artificial interfaces to restore a damaged neural path. Electrical stimulation-based retinal prostheses have been
most widely used due to their conceptual simplicity. However, it faces many hurdles due to complex signal
interfaces, especially for high spatial resolution. A novel approach based on the principle of stimulating
neuronal cells with a direct optical-induced thermal signal is introduced to potentially offer more advantages
over the electrical stimulation approach. However, the concept is relatively new, and necessary engineered
means should be developed to translate this approach to retinal prostheses. The goal of the proposed

 This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence application would provide me with the training necessary to
achieve my career goal of establishing an independent research laboratory that investigates the relations
between stress, functional brain development, and later neurocognitive and socioemotional outcomes in
racially and ethnically diverse populations. My training in developmental cognitive neuroscience provides me
with the foundation necessary to pursue this goal. However, to lead a laboratory, I require additional training in
culturally sensitive research practices, stress theory, multivariate stress assessment, advanced infant EEG
analysis methods, infant eye tracking, and laboratory management. The protected training period of the K99
phase of this award would allow me to enter the independent stage of my career with the theoretical,
methodological, and management skills necessary to establish a research team ready to study the role of
stress–brain interactions in the development of neurocognitive and socioemotional skills. Research Project:
Chronic stress has detrimental effects on neurocognitive development. However, the neural mechanisms
underlying stress-neurocognition relations are not well understood – particularly in infancy. Emerging evidence
implicates stress-related alterations in functional brain development as a possible pathway by which stress
impacts long-term neurocognitive and socioemotional functioning. While studies have independently identified
links between chronic stress, infant brain activity, neurocognition, and socioemotional outcomes, the testing of
these relations in a mechanistic, longitudinal framework has not yet been conducted. The proposed project
aims to leverage longitudinal data from a diverse population of mothers and infants to examine the relations
between maternal stress, infant resting brain activity, neurocognitive skill, and socioemotional skill. Consistent
with my preliminary data, I will examine whether maternal stress-related alterations in infant brain activity exist
at 1 month and 1 year of age (Aim 1), and whether stress-related alterations in brain function are related to
future and concurrent measures of neurocognitive and socioemotional functioning (Aim 2). In the R00 phase, I
will determine how a child’s own physiologic stress is related to alterations in brain activity and prospectively
predicts deficits in neurocognitive and socioemotional functioning by school entry (Aim 3). Elucidating the direct
influence of chronic physiological stress on alterations in brain development and the functional significance of
such alterations in a diverse sample of participants is not only novel, but it provides important insights for early
identification and invention of future long-term cognitive and socioemotional outcomes."

The adverse health impact of cigarette smoking on persons living with HIV is profound and effective treatments
for long-term abstinence remain elusive. There is an acute need for interventions that address patient barriers
to quitting and clinical barriers to effectively treating a broad heterogeneous population of smokers living with
HIV (SLWH). This study’s long-term goal is to improve clinical outcomes among SLWH by providing optimized
smoking cessation interventions in HIV clinical care. This proposal will use the Multiphase Optimization STrategy
(MOST) to test four intervention components aimed at barriers to quitting among SLWH, with the objective of
selecting the set that constitutes a cost-effective, sustainable, scalable smoking cessation package for HIV
clinical care. Components include: Motivational Interviewing (Off/On); Peer Mentoring (Off/On); Text-messaging
(Off/On); Varenicline or Combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (Off/On). These components have shown
promise in research but are under-utilized to help SLWH quit and have not been tested in an optimization trial.
The proposed MOST factorial optimization trial is a highly efficient method for estimating the main effect
contribution of each intervention component and all interactions between components. This approach addresses
weaknesses in prior studies, which are not able to assess the contribution of individual components of
multicomponent interventions. The proposal will also include a rigorous evaluation of the implementation process
and theory-driven assessment of barriers to and facilitators of intervention implementation, sustainability and
scalability in HIV clinical care. Aims include: (1) Assess the effectiveness of four smoking cessation intervention
components on long-term abstinence among SLWH by conducting a highly efficient factorial optimization trial
(i.e., MOST) with 500 SLWH in HIV clinical care. (2) Assess costs and the implementation process, including
factors that affect the potential for sustainability and scalability of cessation treatment in HIV care settings serving
SLWH. Guided by Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework and the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research, we will collect mixed methods data on reach, fidelity, acceptability and
appropriateness among SLWH, stakeholders and study interventionists. (3) Identify the optimized intervention
by conducting an innovative multi-criteria decision analysis to select the subset of the four components that
achieves the highest level of cost-effectiveness and is both scalable and sustainable in HIV clinical care. Working
in collaboration with New York City Health and Hospitals (H+H), the largest municipal public healthcare system
in the U.S., and a team with unparalleled expertise in intervention optimization, smoking cessation and HIV/AIDS,
the proposed study responds directly to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) call for smoking research that
“optimizes intervention effectiveness, implementation and sustainability.” The optimized intervention will have a
significant public health impact and add to scientific knowledge by providing a clear basis for further improvement
of cessation interventions for SLWH in future research."
10898866,"Approximately 48 million people in the US are served by private, and frequently untreated, wells. Our best
estimate is that 1.3 million cases of gastrointestinal illnesses (GI) per year are attributed to consuming
water from untreated private wells in the US, but in reality, there are no robust epidemiological data that can
be used to estimate cases of GI attributable to these sources. It is likely that well water-associated GI causes
significant healthcare costs and lost work/school days, as well as increased risk for long term health
complications. This impact is magnified when accounting for vulnerable populations such as children under the
age of 5, the elderly, and the immunocompromised.
We propose the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to estimate the burden of GI associated with
private well water. We will test if household treatment of private well water by ultraviolet light (UV) vs.
sham (placebo inactive UV device) decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5. At present, there
are no prior RCTs or studies that have sought causal links between GI and the consumption of untreated water
from private wells despite the fact that pathogens have been recovered in groundwater, including deep
aquifers.
Under the guidance of an interdisciplinary advisory committee we will execute the following aims:
Aim 1- Quantify the incidence rate of endemic childhood GI associated with consuming untreated private well
water and compare that to the incidence rate of consuming well water treated by UV.
Aim 1a- Construct a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) using water quality data we collect to
estimate the risk of childhood GI associated with consuming untreated private well water and compare the
incidence from the risk model to the incidence we calculate in Aim 1.
Aim 2- Identify, quantify and compare viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens in stool of children consuming
UV treated or untreated (sham) private well water (including both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases).
Aim 3- Explore the presence of pathogens in untreated well water and stool samples of children consuming
untreated private well water (sham group only).
These data will fill a knowledge gap on sporadic GI associated with federally-unregulated private water
supplies in the US. Our results will test an affordable water treatment intervention and inform GI burden
estimates and policy decisions for managing well water in the US and globally. Policy changes will help better
protect rural families, especially children who are at highest risk for sporadic enteric infections."

multiple exposures concomitantly contribute to increased HIV vulnerability among Black MSM: 1 in 2 Black
SMM will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 11 for White MSM, if current trends remain
unchanged. There is increasing interest in understanding an individual's ability to adapt to or resist life's
adversities or stressful events (i.e., minority strengths framework). Thus, an integrated minority social-structural
stress and minority strengths theory model will be tested in the proposed application to delineate the multilevel
discrimination predictors of HIV prevention outcomes, and understand how resilience moderates these
associations. First, we hypothesize that greater anticipation and experiences of discrimination are predictive of
infrequent testing for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and lower pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
use, retention in care, PrEP adherence, and PrEP protection over a 36-month follow-up period among Black
MSM in the Deep South. Next, we hypothesize that differing levels of resilience will moderate the associations
between discrimination and HIV prevention. Finally, we will conduct qualitative focus groups with social
mapping to validate the quantitative results in Aims 1&2 and to identify and/or adapt effective social-structural
and/or strengths-based interventions to mitigate the effect of SRD on PrEP outcomes among Black SMM.
 Three integrated specific aims are proposed to test these hypotheses.
In Specific Aim 1, to evaluate the relationships between SRD factors and PrEP continuum outcomes among
Black SMM in two Southeastern U.S. cities over a 36-month follow-up period, using multilevel modeling
techniques. In Specific Aim 2, to determine the moderating effects of resiliency factors on the relationships
between SRD factors and PrEP continuum outcomes among Black SMM in two Southeastern U.S. cities
through moderation analyses. And finally, in Specific Aim 3, to a. gain contextually-grounded explanations of
the quantitative results via focus groups; b. “geo-narratives” of the geographical landscape of Black SMM
using social mapping; and c. synthesize the quantitative and qualitative results via data triangulation methods.
 Broadly, this research will enhance our understanding of how SRD discrimination contributes to inequities
in HIV and provide insight into three long-standing questions in the field of HIV epidemiology: (1) minority
stress mechanisms that contribute to HIV prevention outcomes, (2) intrapersonal traits that buffer the
associations of minority stressors with HIV prevention, and (3) identification and/or adaptation of social-
structural or strengths-based interventions to mitigate HIV among Black SMM."

Oklahoma
Project Summary
The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), a surveillance
system established in 1996, tracks antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria from humans,
retail meats, and food animals, and its different programs on emerging bacterial
resistance promote and protect public health. The goal of this study is to determine the
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Salmonella, Campylobacter, E.
coli and Enterococcus isolated from retail samples of chicken, turkey, beef and pork and
from Enterococcus, Vibrio, Aeromonas and lactose fermenting bacteria from seafood
purchased from grocery stores in Texas and Oklahoma using standardized methods so
comparisons can be made to other national locations participating in the NARMS food
surveillance program. Achieving this goal will contribute to our understanding of the
burden and magnitude of antibiotic resistant bacteria in retail meat, poultry and seafood
products distributed and sold to consumers in this region that comprises approximately
10% of the population of the United States. Specifically, the results of this project will
provide the FDA-CVM with isolates and sequencing data (whole genome sequencing)
from important public health enteric bacteria, helping to conduct informed risk
assessments on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animal products. During each year of
the Cooperative Agreement, the Texas Tech University food microbiology laboratory will
obtain food samples as follows: 120 bone-in, skin-on chicken, 120 ground turkey, 120
ground beef, 120 ground pork or pork chops, 24 shrimp, 36 salmon, and 36 tilapia, all
produced under either conventional, organic or natural production systems. Samples
will be collected monthly within 400 miles (6-hour drive) of Lubbock, Texas, including
small metro, urban, suburban and rural cities and towns as well as large, medium and
small grocery stores, supermarkets, and independent grocers throughout the region that
will add representativeness to the diverse sampling region. Collected samples will be
processed using approved FDA-NARMS protocols for bacterial detection, and isolates
will be shipped monthly to FDA-CVM for AMR testing, while sequencing data will be
used for further analysis and molecular determination of antimicrobial resistance. The
results of this project will improve and increase educational activities and knowledge on
antibiotic resistance as well as improve laboratory capacity on testing methodologies
and protocols used by government laboratories."
10898717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dr. Pamela Weiss, with the support of this proposal, seeks to expand and improve her research program and
her training, mentoring, and career development of greatly needed physician scientists pursuing patient-
oriented research (POR) in pediatric rheumatology. Successful mentoring requires both an effective mentee
and a skilled mentor, both of which are reflected in the training goals of this application and include building
skills to 1) train junior faculty and peers to build and effectively manage their mentoring relationships, and 2)
teach trainees how to effectively work with their mentoring team and navigate the research environment. The
premise of this application is to leverage existing studies to improve the everyday clinical care of children with
spondyloarthritis and to contribute to the design of studies of emerging targeted therapies. Three major
obstacles block advancements in juvenile spondyloarthritis care. First, there is variability in the interpretation of
diagnostic imaging studies because distinguishing immature structural bone from subchondral bone marrow
edema at the sacroiliac joints in children is challenging. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-
weighted imaging (DWI) holds unique promise for the pediatric population as a tool to distinguish maturational
changes from pathologic inflammation. Second, there are no pediatric diagnostic imaging criteria for sacroiliitis.
Improved criteria is needed not only in the clinical setting to prevent overdiagnosis, but also in the research
setting to accurately identify those who would benefit from clinical trials. Third, although there is a juvenile
spondyloarthritis disease activity (JSpADA) index that is widely used in clinical research, the cut-off values for
defining clinically important disease states are unknown. Since inactive disease remains unattainable for many
with juvenile spondyloarthritis, there is a critical need to determine minimal clinically important improvement
(MCII) and well-defined states of disease activity using the JSpADA index for use not only in clinical care but
also studies of emerging therapies. The proposed research addresses these challenges and leverages existing
studies conducted by the candidate at a world-renowned pediatric tertiary care center with expertise in
spondyloarthritis and innovative imaging. Aim 1 will test ADC from DWI as a diagnostic biomarker for the
presence of sacroiliitis in children. Aim 2 will determine candidate lesion-based criteria for defining a positive
sacroiliac joint MRI. Aim 3 will determine the MCII and cut-off values for defining minimal disease activity and
high disease activity for the JSpADA index. These aims will simultaneously provide significant added value to
ongoing studies, aid the applicant to develop new research and mentoring skills, and offer a clinical research
platform in which to mentor young physician scientists in POR and promote their transition to independence."
10898718,"Abstract
Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a
pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue
homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger
acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely
recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While
finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and
invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity
is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and
hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g.,
cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been
reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution
of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from
tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to
analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene
expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably
seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive
to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently
stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse
and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene
cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation
studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by
altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative
approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims:
Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage
polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages
(Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human
organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is
gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple
organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets
that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.”"
10898719,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) often experience high-intensity,
potentially burdensome care near the end-of-life that may not align with their values and goals. Patients with
ADRD and their families often face complex decisions about the most appropriate intensity of care. Goals-of-
care discussions with clinicians are associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced
intensity of care at the end of life. Although goals-of-care discussions can facilitate delivery of goal-concordant
care, they currently occur infrequently or too late in the illness. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key
opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet
few prior interventions have used the EHR for this purpose. To address this gap, we propose an NIH Stage III
hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial of a communication-priming intervention, called Jumpstart, to increase the
occurrence and quality of goals-of-care discussions with patients with ADRD and their family caregivers in the
outpatient setting. We will use EHR data to identify patients and facilitate implementation of the intervention. In
Aim 1, we will conduct a NIH Stage III hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial of the adapted Jumpstart intervention
compared to usual care to assess effectiveness for promoting occurrence and improving quality of goals-of
care discussions and improving patient- and family-reported outcomes. The primary outcome is EHR
documentation of a goals-of-care discussion by 3 months after enrollment. We will enroll 1200 patients with
ADRD and their family caregivers. Aim 2 examines the mechanisms of action of the intervention on important
patient- and family-centered outcomes including patients’ palliative care needs and the intervention’s effect on
healthcare utilization, and monitors for unintended consequences of the intervention in terms of psychological
distress and one-year all-cause mortality. In Aim 3, we will conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore
further intervention improvements and identify barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation.
 Our team is well-positioned to accomplish these aims. We have experience conducting large,
randomized trials with patient- and family-centered outcomes, biostatistics, qualitative and mixed methods
analyses, ADRD research and policy, and implementation science methods. We have used informatics
integrated with the EHR to identify patients with ADRD and measure quality of care similar to the methods
proposed here, including measurement of the primary outcome. This study will provide important data for
patients with ADRD, their family caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare systems on the efficacy of the Jumpstart
intervention to improve communication and facilitate goal-concordant care and will provide insights for
implementation of similar EHR-based interventions designed to improve communication and patient outcomes."
10898746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that
link translation initiation inhibition to apoptosis and tumor suppression triggered by Interleukin-24 (IL-24).
Clinical testing of IL-24 as a gene-based therapeutic for the treatment of solid tumors demonstrated that IL-24
is efficacious and is safe. This proposal is consistent with the current view that modern anti-cancer therapy
must be target-specific, inhibit the growth of cancer with minimal effect on normal cells, and that effective anti-
cancer agents of low toxicity can be achieved by targeting the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the
genesis, maintenance, and/or progression of cancer. We have shown that IL-24 inhibits translation initiation by
inducing phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a), depletion of the ternary complex,
upregulation of expression and activity of ATF4, and inhibition of eIF4F complex in vitro. The working
hypothesis of this application is that restoration of physiological restrains on translation initiation by
Interleukin 24 (IL-24), an inhibitor of translation initiation, represents a new paradigm in cancer
therapy. We have conducted pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and in vivo efficacy studies on IL-24, which established
not only its anti-cancer activity, but also that IL-24 translationally down-regulates the expression of PD-L1, a
critical anti-tumor immunity factor. In this application we propose to continue our efforts to characterize the
cancer cell-specific actions of IL-24 as an inhibitor of translation initiation. Specifically, we will 1) test IL-24 anti-
cancer translation initiation inhibition-mediated mechanism of action in vivo (Specific Aim 1), 2) determine the
role of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) on IL-24-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and
apoptosis, (Specific Aim 2), and 3) investigate for the first time the role of PD-L1 down-regulation in the anti-
cancer effect of IL-24 and its potential utility as an immune checkpoint inhibitor (Specific Aim 3). For these
proposed studies, we will collaborate with Dr. Bertal H. Aktas, from Harvard Medical School, and expert on
targeting translation initiation for cancer therapy and Dr. Juan Lafaille, from New York University School of
Medicine, and Immunology expert."
10898766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis affects up to 3% of children from all ethnicities. African Americans present with
larger curves, report greater pain, and have more surgical complications. Healthcare disparities also increase
the risk for curve progression and serious, life-threatening neurologic and cardiac complications, many of which
can be prevented with early diagnosis. In the initial funding period, we identified several important risk factors for
severe scoliosis, including rare variants in fibrillin-1 (FBN1), musculoskeletal collagen genes, and distal
chromosome 16p11.2 duplications that confer >10-fold increased risk. However, it is not yet known whether risk
factors are generalizable to diverse patient populations. Even when genes are known, precisely determining the
pathogenicity of individual human genetic variants remains a bottleneck because of the high frequency of
variants of uncertain significance, meaning that there is insufficient clinical or functional data to assign them as
either pathogenic or benign. In an era of Precision Medicine, there is an unmet need to change the clinical
practice paradigm for scoliosis, however, our ability to interpret genetic data in underserved populations remains
limited. Our central hypothesis is that genetic data, when combined with functional analysis, improves the
diagnostic precision of variant interpretation for scoliosis and related conditions. To accomplish these goals, we
will study a cohort of 1000 African American scoliosis patients recruited during the initial funding period in order
to determine whether known risk factors are generalizable to African Americans, and to identify risk variants that
can only be identified by studying individuals of African ancestry. Second, we will identify phenotypes associated
with scoliosis risk variants in an older population using a gene-first approach that leverages the Geisinger
DiscovEHR dataset consisting of >175,000 participants with linked electronic health record and exome sequence
data. Finally, to test the hypothesis that knowledge of functional effects improves genetic variant classification,
we will utilize high-throughput assays developed in our laboratory for deep mutational scanning. The effects of
every possible coding variants in three genes associated with scoliosis and life-threatening aortic aneurysm
(COL3A1, SMAD3, and FBN1) will be quantified. Computational classifiers to predict pathogenicity of variant
alleles will be built based on our functional data. Variants will be validated in zebrafish models of scoliosis.
Renewal of this multicenter study of scoliosis will speed up the pace of gene discovery and its clinical application
for patients of all ages and ethnicities. By comprehensively and quantitatively determining the effects of genetic
variants on protein function, as well as their impact on diverse individuals across the lifespan, we move closer to
the goal of precision medicine for scoliosis."
10898767,"Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea
In many ways human vision is like a camera, with a lens that forms an image on a spatially
arranged sensor (the retina). However, it is unlike a camera because the sensor has uneven
sampling and is constantly moving with the eyes. Recent behavioral and theoretical work suggest
these eye movements serve a faciliatory role in high acuity vision – where the eye movements
are part of the computations and enhance spatial resolution. However, the neurophysiological
mechanisms to support this facilitation remain unknown. More broadly, little is known about the
neural mechanisms that integrate across the retinal motion generated by eye movements,
especially in the central visual field (the fovea). This is particularly important because over 8
million Americans suffer from central vision loss due to retinal disorders. Even if the retinal signals
could be repaired, it is imperative to understand how the brain reads out foveal signals to ensure
recovery of high-acuity visual processing, and fixational eye movements are a part of that process.
The proposed career development plan aims to address these questions by measuring visual
processing in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex (V1) during natural visual
behavior. This proposal uses custom high-resolution eye-tracking, a novel visual foraging
paradigm, largescale neurophysiology, and state-of-the-art machine learning to make these
measurements possible. The proposed research will not only generate fundamental
understanding of how eye-movements facilitate visual processing, but also will integrate the
experimental and theoretical tools required to support neurophysiological studies of active visual
processing without a loss of rigor or detail. The candidate has extensive expertise in awake-
behaving neurophysiology and computational modeling and the training plan is designed to
support his further training in statistical modeling, high-resolution eye-tracking, and modern
machine-learning techniques for analyzing neural population data. The primary mentor, Dr. Daniel
Butts, is a world expert in statistical models of neural activity during active vision; Co-mentor, Dr.
Michele Rucci, is a world leader in high-resolution eye tracking and theoretical approaches to
active vision; and Co-mentor, Dr. Jude Mitchell, is a pioneer in establishing the marmoset model
of visual neuroscience and an expert in neurophysiology of visual attention. Together, they will
provide the guidance to establish the candidate’s transition to a successful independent research
career."

10905981,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common forms of chronic liver injury in the United States.
Chronic ethanol consumption results in toxic metabolites in the liver and increases endothelial senescence
and dysfunction leading to inflammation and liver damage. Aging is linked with the severity and poor
prognosis of various liver diseases including alcoholic liver diseases and is associated gradual alteration of
structure and function in liver tissues and cells including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Endothelial
dysfunction is an early pathophysiological hallmark in the development of liver disease. Senescence, the
cellular equivalent of aging, was proposed to be involved in endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, enhanced
cellular senescence was associated with a poor outcome in alcohol-related fatty liver disease, while
increased hepatic senescence mediators such as p21 and TNF-α that were related to liver/endothelial
dysfunction in ALD cirrhosis. Increasing evidence supports that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a central
role in various cellular pathways by regulating gene expression. Indeed, there is a strong link between
ethanol metabolism and endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced cellular senescence and endothelial
dysfunction in ALDs. Hepatic sinusoids, connected directly to the portal circulation, serve as the first barrier
against these inflammatory and noxious stimuli. We have novel preliminary data showing that selective
ncRNA/microRNA genes are aberrantly expressed in liver specimens from ALD animals and are regulated
and involved in ethanol metabolism. In particular, we have found: (a) intra-gastric ethanol feeding
significantly increased the expression of cellular senescence initiators EGR1, PAI-1 and Id1 and silenced
p53 effectors E2F1 and IGFBP3; (b) ethanol enhanced microRNA-34a and p53 expressions and altered
their target genes such as SIRT1, PPARα and HNF4α, which leads to senescence phenotypes in liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs); (c) Inhibition of miR-34a/p53/TLR4 by anti-miR-34a/p53 Morpholino
and CRISPR/cas9 approaches has successfully recovered alcoholic liver injury in ethanol treated mice in
vivo. Although the combined evidence supports a link between ncRNAs and alcoholic liver disease, there
is a critical need to determine the underlying mechanism whereby ethanol-dependent miRNAs promote
alcoholic liver injury. Our long-term goal is to determine underlying mechanisms contributing to alcohol-
induced liver disease so that new mechanism-based, clinically effective prevention or treatment strategies
can be developed. The objective for this proposal is to determine how ethanol- dependent ncRNAs mediate
endothelial dysfunction and senescence in the progression of alcoholic liver diseases. Our central
hypothesis is that ethanol-dependent miRNAs contribute to alcoholic liver injury through regulation of
cellular senescence and dysfunction in endothelial cells. This hypothesis was formulated based upon the
existing literature and our own preliminary data described above. The following three specific aims are
proposed: First, we will determine the effects of ncRNA mediated cellular senescence and endothelial
dysfunction in senescence accelerated mice with alcoholic liver injury in vivo (Aim 1). Second, we will
identify the downstream targets of p53-miR-34a axis that are involved in endothelial senescence and
dysfunction in miR-34a and p53 knockout mice in vivo (Aim 2). Further, we will determine the effects of
endothelial progenitor cell related ncRNAs enriched extracellular vesicles on anti-senescence/anti-
endothelial dysfunction and recovery of alcoholic liver injury in vivo (Aim 3). At the completion of the
proposed research, it is our expectation to have an important positive impact because a mechanistic
understanding of the role ncRNAs play in alcohol related injury, endothelial cell and senescence mediated
liver disease is likely to provide a foundation for the development of evidence-based clinically useful
approaches to treat or prevent human alcoholic liver diseases including US veterans."
10906102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microbial infections annually claim hundreds of thousands of victims in the U.S. alone, but its complex
pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Our seminal discovery of HMGB1 as a late mediator of lethal
endotoxemia (Science, 1999, Cited >4,000 times) has fueled continuous search for other late mediators of
lethal infections. With the long-standing R01 grant support from NIGMS (R01GM063075 for 15 years) and
NCCIH (R01AT005076 for > 10 years), we identified another late mediator of sepsis, Sequestosome-1
(SQSTM1) (Nat Microbiol, 2020). Meanwhile, we recently generated exciting preliminary data that
microbial toxins (e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ACE2 receptor binding motif, RBM) and several host
secretory proteins [e.g., serum amyloid A (SAA), procathepsin-L (pCTS-L) and dermcidin (DCD)] divergently
affect the release of HMGB1 and SQSTM1 by innate immune cells. In line with the inspiring spirit of the MIRA
funding scheme, we wish to tackle bigger questions frequently considered as “higher-risk” or “ambitious” by
proposing a bold hypothesis that microbial toxins and host proteins induce the release of HMGB1 and SQSTM1
to trigger dysregulated pyroptosis, immunosuppression and coagulopathy. This hypothesis is built upon our
recent realization that extracellular HMGB1 causes macrophage pyroptosis and immunosuppression when
passively released in high levels (Sci Transl Med, 2020). Accordingly, we seek to address three key
challenges related to this hypothesis. The first involves the characterization of the dynamic changes of pCTS-
L, HMGB1 and SQSTM1 in parallel with other biomarkers in clinical sepsis using semi-quantitative
immunoassays or high-throughput Cytokine Antibody Arrays. The second involves understanding the
mechanisms by which microbial toxins (e.g., LPS and RBM) and host secretory proteins (e.g., SAA, pCTS-L and
DCD) divergently affect the release of HMGB1 and SQSTM1 by examining their effects on the expression of
macrophage hemichannels and secretory phospholipase A2s (sPLA2s), the activation of inflammasome and
pyroptosis, or immuno-metabolism. In the third project, we propose to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and
protective mechanisms of DCD as well as cocktail of monoclonal antibodies against HMGB1, pCTS-L and
SQSTM1 in animal models of lethal endotoxemia, bacteremia, viral toxemia and sepsis. Elucidating the
mechanisms underlying the regulation of several late-acting mediators and development of novel cocktail
therapies requires a long-term commitment and associated flexibility to explore different research directions.
If successful, it will significantly improve our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying the
dysregulated innate immune responses to lethal infections, and shed light on the future development of novel
therapeutic strategies for the clinical management of human sepsis and other infectious diseases."
10905977,"The long term goal of this study is to develop safer and effective therapeutic approach for bone loss caused by
excessive osteoclast (OC) differentiation implicated in many metabolic bone diseases. The immediate goal of
this application is to understand how OC differentiation is regulated through negative signaling mediated by
transcription factors and epigenetic regulators, which may serve as novel therapeutic targets for bone diseases
such as osteoporosis. Current therapies for osteolytic diseases are hindered by lack of understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of OC function to prevent bone loss. Moreover, the
mechanism(s) underlying how transcriptional factors and epigenetic factors co-regulate, especially negatively
co-regulate, OC differentiation and function remain unclear. We have identified Cbx3/HP1γ. Our subsequent
immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that C/EBPα interacts with Cbx3/HP1γ in OCs. Notably, our preliminary
data showed that Cbx3/HP1γ overexpression inhibited OC differentiation and activity, while Cbx3/HP1γ silencing
enhanced OC lineage commitment and formation. Consistently, Cbx3/HP1γ-deficient mice were found to exhibit
osteoporosis-like phenotype due to enhanced OC formation and activity. Interestingly, through ChIP analysis, we
found several binding sites of Cbx3/HP1γ on the promoters of C/EBPα regulated OC genes, NFATC1 and
C-FOS. Our RNA-seq analysis also revealed that Cbx3 deficiency in monocytes led to increased OC gene
expression. Collectively, the preliminary data indicated that Cbx3 can restrict C/EBPα-mediated OC
differentiation and activity. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that Cbx3 negatively regulates
osteoclast differentiation through interacting with C/EBPα and epigenetic factors as a result of epigenetic
modification and preventing osteoclast gene expression in bone homeostasis. We will test the hypothesis
through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we examine the function of Cbx3 in OC differentiation, skeletal
development and bone homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions through characterization of
the phenotypes and pathomechanism in two Cbx3 CKO mouse models through loss-of-function studies. In Aim
2, we determine the role of Cbx3 in OC differentiation, skeletal development and bone homeostasis under
physiological and pathological conditions by characterizing the phenotypes and pathomechanism in Cbx3
conditional transgenic overexpression mice through gain-of-function approach. We define the molecular
mechanism underlying how Cbx3 negatively regulates OC differentiation through interacting with C/EBPα and
controlling epigenetic modification in Aim 3. The study will elucidate the mechanism(s) through which Cbx3
cooperates with transcriptional factors and other epigenetic factors to negatively regulate OC differentiation and
activity. Insights gained from this study will not only address the basic scientific question about epigenetic
regulation of gene expression in OC biology, but also will provide the foundation for the ultimate goal of
facilitating the design of safer and novel therapeutic approach for osteolytic diseases (e.g. osteoporosis)."
10905982,"ABSTRACT
Transcutaneous (TSS) and epidural spinal stimulation (ESS) are both electrophysiological techniques that have
been used to investigate the interactions between exogenous electrical stimuli and spinal sensorimotor networks
that integrate descending motor signals with afferent inputs from the periphery during motor tasks such as
standing and stepping. Recently, pilot phase clinical trials using each of these stimulation modalities have
demonstrated restoration of motor functions that were previously lost due to spinal cord injury (SCI). However,
the spinal network interactions that occur in response to TSS or ESS with rehabilitation training have yet to be
characterized and directly compared. Thus, it is imperative to (1) understand the neurophysiological profiles of
individual participants comprehensively, thereby delineating the underlying mechanisms and (2) establish the
relative effectiveness of TSS versus ESS in regaining motor function. Our central hypothesis is that ESS and
TSS will promote similar levels of stimulation-augmented standing. We will compare the immediate functional
and neurophysiological effects of TSS versus ESS in the same participants (Aim 1). We hypothesize that
ESS and TSS will generate comparable motor output during standing due to similar level of modulated excitability
of sensorimotor networks. Then, we will compare immediate and delayed effects of standing training
combined with TSS versus ESS (Aim 2). We hypothesize that both TSS- and ESS-combined trainings will result
in similar functional gain. We further predict that after one month of rest following standing training with TSS or
ESS, the excitability and responsiveness of spinal and supraspinal sensorimotor networks will differ from
baseline levels and Sham. Completion of this study will establish the efficacy of both non-invasive and invasive
spinal neuromodulatory approaches to improve functions after SCI, impacting both research and clinical
communities. Further, it will shed light on the underlying mechanisms of spinal neuromodulation, allowing
ourselves and others to refine and improve stimulation protocols to maximize functional recovery."

Background. Sexual minority women (SMW) represent one of the highest-risk groups for hazardous drinking
(HD) and comorbid mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety) because of their exposure to minority
stressors (i.e., stigma-related burdens) and associated stress reactions, like drinking to cope. Research has
identified cognitive (e.g., expectations of rejection), affective (e.g., shame), and behavioral (e.g., avoidant
coping) pathways through which minority stress places SMW at disproportionate risk of HD and comorbid
depression/anxiety. Yet no interventions address these pathways. In fact, no HD intervention has ever been
tested for efficacy with SMW. Preliminary Studies. With deep stakeholder input and NIH (R01MH109413-
02S1) and foundation (Lesbian Health Fund) support, we created EQuIP (Empowering Queer Identities in
Psychotherapy). EQuIP is a 10-session cognitive-behavioral intervention focused on improving SMW’s minority
stress reactions by raising awareness of the harms of minority stress, building self-affirming cognitive styles,
and reducing avoidant coping. In a waitlist-controlled pilot trial (n=60), EQuIP showed strong promise for
reducing HD and depression/anxiety by building adaptive responses to minority stress, making it the first
intervention with preliminary efficacy for improving this population’s co-occurring behavioral and mental health
challenges. Methods. We now seek to test EQuIP’s efficacy and identify facilitators of scale-up of this
promising intervention. Aim 1: In a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with SMW who experience HD and
comorbid depression and/or anxiety, we will test the efficacy of EQuIP (n=225) against treatment-as-usual (i.e.,
supportive counseling) (n=225). Our primary outcome is proportion of heavy drinking days (≥4 drinks) on 30-
day timeline followback. Secondary outcomes include reduction in WHO alcohol risk level and depression and
anxiety. Because remote intervention delivery has quickly become normative, both EQuIP and treatment-as-
usual will be delivered via telehealth (Zoom). In fact, our second pilot of EQuIP found strong feasibility and
acceptability of telehealth delivery. Aim 2: Assessments at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months will determine if
reductions in EQuIP’s intended psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., internalized stigma, rejection sensitivity,
emotion dysregulation) mediate heavy drinking reductions. To advance personalized medicine, we will also
examine whether EQuIP is differentially efficacious across key demographic factors and stigma moderators.
Aim 3: To prepare for implementation in frontline settings, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with
directors (n=20), providers (n=20), and service users (n=20) from a network of 250 US LGBTQ community
clinics. Applying the i-PARIHS framework will help identify facilitators that can support EQuIP implementation
at these centers. Summary. As the first trial of an intervention for SMW’s HD and co-occurring mental health,
this study responds to NIAAA’s call for trials of “interventions that address AUDs and related problems and that
are appropriate to the needs of sexual and gender minority populations.”"
10893174,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The US has over 18 million cancer survivors (persons diagnosed with cancer no matter where they are in the
course of their disease), estimated to increase to 22 million by 2030. The majority of formalized cancer
survivorship care is organized and delivered by oncology, often through academic and private cancer centers.
Because 70% of cancer survivors also have other chronic conditions and receive care from multiple clinical
teams, suboptimal coordination of that care poses a significant barrier to optimal health outcomes. The growing
number of survivors and anticipated shortage of oncology subspecialists pose significant additional challenges
to delivering high quality survivorship care.
Primary care is uniquely suited to deliver whole person and coordinated care for cancer survivors because, at
its core, it prioritizes, personalizes, and integrates health care for all conditions. This view is endorsed by the
National Academy of Medicine and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend
that cancer survivors stay connected with their primary care clinicians (PCCs). Despite this growing recognition
of the importance of primary care, primary care teams experience key challenges in delivering high-quality
survivorship care especially for under- and uninsured cancer survivors who experience disproportionately
worse health outcomes and rely on community health centers (CHCs) for consistent health care.
Leveraging our team has a 10-year program of research in Texas CHCs, we propose a pragmatic trial testing
implementation and effectiveness of a primary care-based survivorship care delivery intervention among eight
Texas CHC sites. Specifically, we propose to:
(1) Implement a system-level cancer survivorship care delivery intervention in partnership with CHC clinicians,
patients, and community representatives.
(2) Test effectiveness of the intervention to improve patient and clinician outcomes using a stepped-wedge
cluster-randomized trial design.
(3) Evaluate implementation of the intervention using an iterative, concurrent mixed-methods approach guided
by the Practice Change Model.
Our overall study is guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation, & Sustainability Model (PRISM) to
maximize implementation and sustainment within each CHC’s local context. Our study recognizes the reality
that care of underserved cancer survivors is increasingly occurring in primary care CHCs. Together with our
CHC partners, we will generate the evidence-base needed for a generalist primary care-based care delivery
model with the goal of disseminating and scaling to optimize cancer survivorship care equitably."
10893175,"Key prodromal events in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) revolve on altered electrical signals and buildup of
garbage proteins in vulnerable areas before signs of AD (locus coeruleus, LC)) and as disease progresses to
brain regions that govern memory (hippocampus, HPC) as disease severity increases. This study bridges the
potential lifespan of disease progression using a mouse model of AD pathology to examine how modifications
in brain activity can lead to disease. The LC, while not traditionally associated with AD, is the site of some of the
earliest pathology in AD, as early as people in their 20s. It is also an area regulating flight or fight response and
arousal. In AD, the hyperexcitation or unregulated arousal (hyperarousal) may be a key event in moving the
disease from areas like the LC, or another area with early pathology, the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the
hippocampus or other cortical regions that are more commonly associated with Alzheimer’s.
 In AD, the accumulation of aggregated proteins due to altered cellular processes, specifically, the
regulation of protein life cycle (proteostasis) and dysfunction of autophagic-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal
systems is a key feature of neuropathology. These processes are responsible for clearing the garbage in cells
and declines with age and is accelerated in disease. While we know loss of proteostasis can impair cellular
function, how it can impede neuronal activity has not been well advanced. In this application, we propose that a
primary event early on is the alteration of neural networks in the LC (and EC), leads to the pathological hallmarks
of AD including hippocampal pathology. Demonstrating hyperactivation and proteostasis deficits in the LC as
instigators of hippocampal pathology, particularly, selective neuronal loss provides mechanistic insight as to why
these are key neural network changes in disease.
 To model Alzheimer’s pathology, we focus on the LC and HPC to identify how these regions are disrupted
when proteostasis slows down and how hyperexcitation impacts these functions. We will track early
electrophysiological changes in the LC and HPC when proteins like beta-amyloid (A) and tau start accumulating
and assess hyperarousal/excitation using electrophysiological measurements. Over time, hyperexcitation
reduces clearance of aberrant proteins resulting in a positive feedback loop of proteostasis loss and
hyperarousal, and cascade to hippocampus and memory loss. We identify the type of neurons that are most
vulnerable to hyperexcitation/arousal-proteostasis changes in this network, destabilizing excitatory-inhibitory
homeostasis. Finally, we test if dampening hyperexcitation or proteostasis restoration improves cognitive
function and reverses pathological changes in our model. Our goal is to use observations from all the paradigms
to identify if these biological changes and pathological spread of disease can be analyzed using computational
tools to predict the patterns and events leading to AD and to test if we can use as a disease risk score."
10893180,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the health benefits of physical activity in the prevention and mitigation of many chronic diseases have
been documented for decades, the molecular mechanisms mediating these health benefits are still poorly
understood. To understand the adaptive response of physical activity at the molecular level, it is essential to
comprehensively characterize the dynamic changes in protein expression and post-translational modifications
(PTMs) in. The overall objective of the PNNL Proteomics Chemical Analysis Center is to support the
consortium by providing comprehensive discovery of proteins and associated PTMs in skeletal muscle and
subcutaneous adipose tissues collected by Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC. To aid in the development of a
‘molecular map’ of transducers that provides the critical insights and molecular impacts of physical activity in
humans, our integrative proteomics analysis plan focuses on two major tissues known to be important in
exercise signaling especially with training adaptations. This work will intracellular signaling as mediated by
protein PTMs, including protein phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, and pilot studies of reversible redox
modifications. The High level summary of the Specific Aims of this project are: 1) Analyze and publish
expansive multi-omics datasets in a collaborative manner. 2) Collaborate with CC investigators and the rest of
MoTrPAC to implement temporal multi-omics profiling of muscle and adipose tissue following an acute
exercise bout in highly active adults. 3) Perform state-of-the-art proteomics profiling based on the human tissue
analysis plan. 4) Coordinate with other MoTrPAC activities including efforts under the CCC, inclusive of the
1) Administrative Coordinating Core (ACC), 2) Data Management, Analysis, and Quality Control Core
(DMAQC), 3) Exercise Intervention Core (EIC), and 4) Biological Sample Repository (BSR). 5) Participate on
Committees, Subcommittees, and Working Groups to facilitate communications, coordinate activities across all
components of MoTrPAC, conduct continuous quality assurance of data, develop analytical strategies, and
prepare presentations and manuscripts to disseminate results."
10893190,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rotator cuff (RC) tears are common, affecting over 20% of the general population with prevalence increasing
with age. A common treatment method is arthroscopic RC repair surgery, where one of many different fixation
techniques are utilized to mechanically attach the torn rotator cuff tendon to the bone. However, there is still a
high incidence of retear – ranging between 30% to 94% - leading to instability of the joint, pain, potential repeat
repair surgery, and depending on severity of the tear, highly invasive total shoulder arthroplasty. Several causes
of RC tear repair failure exist including stress risers in the tendon due to sutures, insufficient reattachment of and
healing between the tendon and bone, mechanical instability, and poor quality of tissue. There is a need to
innovate in this field in order to develop new ways to mitigate the risk of tendon tear after arthroscopic RC repair
surgery. One potential solution is to design a system that targets improving upon the most common identified
failure modes. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a novel technique for fabricating structures with precise geometry
and user defined mechanical and biochemical properties. One limitation to the current class of handheld 3D
bioprinters being used for biomedical applications is that in their current form, they require direct access to the
tissue that is being treated, which necessitates a highly invasive, open procedure. Arthroscopic 3D bioprinting is
a potential high impact medical treatment, where structures with user defined geometry, mechanical properties,
and biologic components can be precisely applied to a damaged tissue in a minimally invasive manner. Using
an arthroscopic 3D printing system, a tendon can be “spot-welded” back down to the bone to provide a
continuous mechanical interface between the tendon and bone using a previously described Janus Tough
Adhesive (JTA) biomaterial. The objective of this proposal is to develop an arthroscopic 3D bioprinter to precisely
deposit bioinks to enhance the attachment of torn RC tendons to the bone. In Aim #1 we will construct an
arthroscopic 3D bioprinter with the following key design features: 1) JTAs will be deposited via extrusion, 2) light
will be focused at the tip of the nozzle to facilitate photopolymerization, 3) control of extrusion and polymerization
on the device handle, 4) replaceable cartridges, 5) sterilizable, and 6) no more than 7mm in diameter (standard
arthroscope geometry). We will evaluate the effect of printing parameters and JTA concentrations on 3D printed
structures. We will also perform a proof of principle demonstration in a cadaver. In Aim #2 we will evaluate how
and arthroscopic 3D bioprinted RC tear repair can enhance mechanical properties of the tendon-bone interface
in a rabbit model. An arthroscopic 3D printer will be used to “spot weld” the tendon back to the bone after a
traditional RC repair in a rabbit model to reduce the point loading of the tendon where the sutures are placed.
Load to failure of the repaired RC will be evaluated and compared to the gold standard (suture repair). These
are the foundational studies necessary to develop a new surgical tool to allow surgeons to incorporate minimally
invasive 3D printing strategies for augmenting mechanical and biologic properties in RC tear repair."

will be analyzed in a cross-sectional study. A randomized 12-week EE training study is being conducted with
LA children and adolescents with N=120 participants randomized to an EE group and N=50 in a control group.
Adults and children will be sampled according to the approved MoTrPAC Tissue Analysis Plan.
MiCAS investigators will continue to develop new approaches to analyze metabolomics data, including a novel
approach to name the thousands of unknown molecular features found in untargeted metabolomics which may
serve as molecular transducers. MiCAS personnel also lead and participate in all activities of the MoTrPAC

10894801,"This R35 proposal is to support a robust translational research program focused on sepsis-associated acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), explaining individual risk and characterizing the ARDS host immune
response in order to identify molecular traits that may respond differently to specific therapy. The year 2020
and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic placed a global spotlight on sepsis-associated ARDS and its lack of
pharmacologic treatments, with over 400,000 American deaths. Even in non-pandemic years, however, ARDS
complicates approximately 10% of all intensive care unit admissions and impacts close to 200,000 Americans.
Mortality for ARDS has stubbornly exceeded 30%. I have used my translational science training to extend our
knowledge of individual factors and pathways that influence ARDS risk and resolution, use genomic tools to
infer which ARDS-associated plasma markers may be causal contributors to ARDS risk and mortality, and
deeply characterize the host response to COVID-19 ARDS. I have grown a research program that includes a
carefully phenotyped cohort of over 3,500 human subjects critically ill with sepsis, and curated biosamples at
multiple timepoints to facilitate genomic and molecular discoveries, while contributing to the career
development of multiple NHLBI-funded patient-oriented researchers. With the support of the R35, the Meyer
research program will focus on 5 complementary themes to improve the health of patients with and at risk for
sepsis-associated ARDS. Thematic area 1 concentrates upon understanding individual risk for ARDS and
ARDS mortality, which will utilize whole genome association, expression and protein quantitative trait locus
analysis, and genetic causal inference frameworks to evaluate inherited risks and identify which RNA and
plasma traits may be causal intermediates in ARDS. Area 2 addresses the host response to ARDS, using deep
immune profiling and integrated analyses to characterize and contrast the response to bacterial and viral
sepsis-associated ARDS. In later years, sterile ARDS will be compared to infectious ARDS, and the
contribution of activated T cells will be examined. Area 3 examines the interplay between ARDS and non-lung
organ injuries during sepsis, particularly acute kidney injury, delirium and cognitive injury, and shock and
circulatory dysfunction. We will identify DNA, RNA, plasma, and cytometric features specific to individual organ
failures and shared across multiple organ systems. The R35 program will also catalyze two new areas of
investigation for the Meyer lab. First, we will apply biomedical informatics techniques to integrate, visualize,
and analyze multiple data networks – clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cytometric
– to identify coordinated patterns of response and their association with ARDS outcome. We will also examine
the longitudinal host response to ARDS during recovery, testing for responses that predict or protect from post-
intensive care syndrome. An investment in our research program will advance the prevention and personalized
treatment of ARDS while fostering training and mentorship in lung health research."
10894804,"Maintaining the integrity of genomic DNA is crucial to cellular function and survival. Proteins such as
Bloom (BLM) DNA helicase function to protect the genome from the deleterious effects of both
exogenous and endogenous sources of DNA damage. Loss of BLM activity in humans leads to the
rare autosomal recessive disorder Bloom Syndrome, which is characterized by developmental
abnormalities, premature aging, and cancer susceptibility. The goal of this proposed research is to
investigate the role that BLM plays in preventing DNA damage associated with repetitive DNA
sequences. Due to the functional conservation between human BLM and Drosophila melanogaster
Blm proteins, we propose to use Drosophila as a model for studying the Blm-dependent replication
challenges posed by repetitive DNA sequences. The cellular consequences of repeat-dependent
replication challenges to Blm remain unknown, but the Drosophila embryo provides us with a useful
model for studying these aspects of Blm function. Our previous data suggest that Blm facilitates
replication of repetitive DNA sequences, particularly the highly repetitive Y chromosome, during early
embryo development. We propose to identify the repetitive sequences on the Y chromosome that
pose Blm-dependent replication challenges and to investigate long-term effects of Blm-deficiency
during early development. We will address these questions in Aim 1 by exploiting natural variation in
Y-linked repetitive DNA sequences in Drosophila to define specific Blm-dependent sequence motifs
on Y chromosomes. To accomplish this, we will screen for lines displaying Y-linked, Blm-dependent
variation and then analyze whole genome sequences of these lines for differences in Y chromosome
repetitive DNA content. Long-term biological effects of Blm-deficiency during embryogenesis will be
investigated in Aim 2 by comparing Blm heterozygous flies that developed with or without maternal
Blm for a variety of phenotypes that might be affected by sub-lethal amounts of DNA damage. Those
phenotypes will include lifespan, fertility, body composition, and locomotor activity. Lastly, in alignment
with the goals of the SuRE program, Aim 3 of this grant will provide high-impact intensive
undergraduate research training of undergraduate students who are underrepresented in biomedical
research. This proposal will provide students with direct participation in the execution, analysis, and
reporting of this research and will support the growing reputation of LC State as a vibrant institution for
future biomedical scientists and healthcare professionals that come from diverse backgrounds."

of Aβ and tau proteins in the brain. Similarly, the importance of cerebrovascular contributions to AD
pathogenesis is now well recognized. Hypertension is the leading cause of cerebrovascular disease; >70% of
adults aged 65 or older have hypertension. The SPRINT trial showed that intensive treatment of hypertension
reduced risk of cognitive impairment or dementia. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
Hypertension and the associated arterial stiffening compromise regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), reduce
brain white matter integrity, and impact brain amyloid and tau clearance via the brain glymphatic system. Our
studies also showed that high blood pressure and central arterial stiffness are associated positively with brain
Aβ burden measured with PET and that the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations of blood-oxygen-level-
dependent signal measured with rs-fMRI (BOLD ALFF) is correlated negatively brain amyloid burden in older
adults, suggesting its role in brain Aβ regulation. The overarching goal of this project is to determine
whether intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a target of <120 mmHg, compared with
<140 mmHg, reduces brain amyloid and tau in older adults who are at high risk of dementia.
Furthermore, we will determine the impact of BP lowering on CBF, arterial stiffness, BOLD ALFF, white
matter hyperintensity (WMH), brain network connectivity, and neurocognitive function, as well as the
relationships of these changes with brain amyloid and tau. We will enroll 180 older adults age 60 to 80
years who have hypertension (SBP≥130 mmHg), FH of dementia, and/or subjective memory complaints.
Participants will be randomized into the intensive treatment (SBP<120 mmHg) or usual care (SBP<140 mmHg)
arms and followed for 2 years to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of
intensive SBP lowering on brain amyloid, tau, and neurocognitive function. Hypotheses: Intensive SBP
lowering, when compared with usual care, reduces the progression of brain Aβ and tau deposition; changes in
tau are correlated with neurocognitive function. 2) To determine the effects of intensive SBP lowering on CBF,
central arterial stiffness, and BOLD ALFF. Hypotheses: Intensive SBP lowering reduces central arterial
stiffness and increases regional CBF and BOLD ALFF; changes in CBF, arterial stiffness, and BOLD ALFF are

10901533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by a loss of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, movement abnormalities, and in some cases the accumulation of
α-synuclein (α-syn) as fibrils or Lewy bodies. It is well established that T-cells are involved in PD pathology,
shaping the inflammatory cascade from the periphery into the brain, and should be the focus of additional studies.
Immune alterations in PD are found in peripheral blood indicating a pro-inflammatory status during disease and
as early as prodromal stages. However, specific alterations are disputed and must be clarified with a large-scale
study and a carefully curated single-cell cohort that controls for biological heterogeneity. T-cell infiltration into the
brain has been reported to parallel α-syn accumulation and neuronal death but exploring infiltrated T-cells to
characterize the role of these cells in neurodegeneration is a challenge. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II PD risk loci, which suggests an unexplored
important role for CD4 T-cells in their interaction with antigen presenting cells. Overall, this work evaluates T-cell
biomarker potential by investigating their contribution to PD in different clinical phases and explores their
mechanistic role in pathogenesis.
 In this proposed work, the role of T-cells, particularly antigen-specific ones, in PD pathogenesis will be
explored by characterizing immune cell expression and repertoire in PD patients, prodromal patients (who have
elevated risk of disease, including GBA/LRRK2 genetic carriers and patients with rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep behavior disorder) and control donors. Further, the clinical relevance and antigen specificity of clonal T-
cells will be determined by comparing with α-syn-specific cells identified in in-vitro stimulation experiments.
Investigating prodromal patients with an elevated risk of developing PD will assess the importance of T-cells in
disease development and their potential as biomarkers. Additionally, harnessing the human Living Brain Cohort
data, I will compare gene expression and immune repertoire between circulating and infiltrated T-cells from the
same donors at a single-cell level. Comparing the T-cell receptors (TCRs) in the blood and brain provides a
critical link between T-cells and disease progression, and can reveal whether T-cells of particular specificities
have infiltrated into the brain parenchyma. This work will also substantiate the relationship between
risk/protective HLA alleles and T-cell activity in PD patients by investigating the association between HLA alleles
and TCR gene usage and the hypervariable complementarity determining region 3. The results of these
experiments will further our comprehension of the role of T-cells in PD, lead to mechanistic discovery and
determine the potential for targeted immune-based therapeutic interventions or biomarker capabilities."

favorable federal and state policies begun to support physical distancing during the Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, the child health workforce now actively uses telemedicine to care for children, but lacks
evidence to guide best practices for telemedicine use in pediatric primary care. Our research team previously
found gaps in the quality of care delivered by commercial direct-to-consumer telemedicine for the most
common acute pediatric concerns (acute respiratory tract infections). We also demonstrated improvement in
management of common chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) using
telemedicine in research settings. However, the child health community lacks data regarding the use of
telemedicine in evolving “real-world” primary care practices, including how telemedicine visits compare to in-
person visits for the same conditions and how telemedicine use impacts longitudinal outcomes and equity for
primary care patients. Additionally, we lack understanding of the structures and processes that support primary
care practices in using telemedicine in ways that optimally enhance child health and health equity. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to identify actionable strategies for promoting the use of telemedicine
within primary care in ways that improve child health and health equity, using data from primary care practices
from 2018-25. In Aim 1, we will compare visit-level quality of primary care visits for children delivered through
telemedicine vs. in-person using electronic health record data from over 1,000 practices including independent
practices, health system-affiliated practices, and community health centers. In Aim 2, we will compare child
health outcomes for children receiving care in primary care practices with higher vs. lower telemedicine use
through comparative interrupted time series analysis of metrics related to preventive, acute, and chronic care.
In both of these aims, we will examine the impact of telemedicine on health equity by assessing variation in the
effect of telemedicine by child and clinic characteristics. Finally, in Aim 3, we will identify the practice structures
and processes that promote or impede use of telemedicine in primary care in ways that improve child health
through a qualitative multiple-case study. Through this rigorous mixed-methods approach informed by the
Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model and a Structural Competency framework,
we will identify visit-level and child-level impact of telemedicine integration within primary care for children as
well as processes supporting health-promoting use of telemedicine. As a result, this examination of
telemedicine across preventive, acute, and chronic care activities overall, for subpopulations, and within
exemplar practices will provide critical knowledge to inform research, practice, and policy to optimize ongoing
use of telemedicine within primary care to promote child health and health equity."

Together, the RAMS team and infrastructure will achieve the following Specific Aims:
1) Provide clinical research training over 2 years to 5 RAM Scholars (Addiction Medicine and Addiction
Psychiatry fellows), recruited annually, through retreats, webinars, and research-in-progress sessions.
2) Augment mentoring and networking of the RAM Scholars regarding research projects and career
trajectory, by establishing rigorous mentorship relationships between Scholars and nationally recognized
researchers (RAMS NAC) and through interactions between Scholars, RAMS alum, and RAMS core faculty.
3) Provide leadership training for the RAM Scholars, by introducing physicians to the concepts and skills
necessary for leading organizations.
4) Promote a culture that fosters diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging among and for RAM
Scholars and their institutional mentors which stimulates research focused on addressing the impact
of racial marginalization and its impact on substance use and related outcomes. The RAMS Program is
integrating a new multi-pronged curriculum devoted to promoting research and clinical interventions to undo
systems of bias and marginalization as related to substance use.
The RAMS Program will continue to be of high impact by accelerating the progress of its important goal of
developing the next generation of addiction physician researchers to advance the knowledge base to provide
better care for individuals with, and at risk for, substance use disorders."

In 2019, abuse of prescription and illicit opioids resulted in an estimated over 47,000 deaths in the United States.
The transition from therapeutic use to destructive opioid use disorder occurs through the maladaptive activation
of mesocorticolimbic circuits. Despite decades of research linking these pathways with opioids, surprisingly little
is understood about how opioids modulate the brain in vivo in space and time in freely moving animals. This is,
in part, driven by the inability to detect and monitor opioids at sub-second timescales. Together, these
issues highlight the need for significant advancements for “in vivo precision pharmacology” as indicated
specifically in this RFA-DA-20-019 NIDA program announcement. Recent developments using
photoactivatable opioid compounds (optopharmacology) together with new optofluidic hardware devices show
exciting promise for finally understanding the temporal characteristics of opioid signaling. However, further
advances in opioid detection and activation are necessary for fully decoding how opioids modulate neural circuits
in vivo. Here we address this challenge head on with a multi-disciplinary team of biochemists, neuroscientists
and bioengineers. We will utilize a series of cutting-edge approaches to: 1) develop novel opioid sensors for in
vivo, sub-second measures of fentanyl, morphine, and methadone, 2) demonstrate the utility of
optopharmacological approaches for dissecting opioid action, and 3) apply the sensors and optopharmacological
approaches to perform in vivo precision pharmacological experiments to modulate pain and reward circuits
related to drug abuse."
10902391,"Project Summary: Amylin signaling decreases food intake and gastric emptying in both humans and rats via
activation of CNS amylin receptors (calcitonin receptor, CTR; heterodimerized with a receptor activating modified
protein, RAMP1-3) making it a potential target for the development of novel pharmacotherapies to treat obesity.
Despite the distributed nature of CNS amylin receptors, research on the role of amylin signaling in the control of
energy balance has been largely focused on hypothalamic and hindbrain nuclei, leaving other nuclei with
abundant CTR expression such as the mesopontine laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg) understudied.
Recent work from our lab showed that LDTg CTR signaling reduces food intake. Additionally, in the absence of
endogenous LDTg CTR signaling, rats show increased food intake and body weight gain. However, the
mechanism by which CTR signaling in the LDTg modulates energy balance, as well as the downstream nuclei
targeted by LDTg CTR expressing neurons (LDTgCTR) has not been explored. The LDTg is known to modulate
dopamine signaling to regulate motivated behavior via direct projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and
our preliminary data shows that several LDTgCTR neurons send direct projections to the VTA. Consequently, we
will use chemogenetics to activate LDTgCTR neurons that project to the VTA and evaluate the effect of this
manipulation on feeding and motivation to obtain palatable food rewards (Aim 1). We will also use a dual AAV
approach to projection-specifically knockdown CTR expression in LDTg neurons that project to the VTA and
evaluate the role of these neuron’s endogenous CTR activity in the regulation of energy balance and palatable
food reward seeking motivation (Aim 2). Lastly, we will use fiber photometry to monitor the activity of LDTgCTR
neurons in lean and obese animals in response to food availability at different energetic states. Then, we will
determine how diet-induced obesity affects the ability of LDTgCTR neurons to modulate downstream VTA
dopaminergic (VTATH) neurons (Aim 3). Altogether, we hypothesize that this novel mesopontine-limbic signaling
pathway will have the ability to reduce food intake and body weight without inducing symptoms of malaise, via
modulation of downstream VTATH neurons. Consequently, the proposed work will functionally characterize a
promising target for the development of effective obesity pharmacotherapies."
10879300,"Project Summary
This work will characterize the solution structure, dynamics, and interactions of polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains,
which function as signaling molecules in the regulation of a host of cellular processes, ranging from
progression through the cell cycle, to transcriptional activation, antigen processing and vesicular trafficking of
proteins. Conjugation of substrates to polyUb chains of different linkage types commits the target protein to
distinct fates in the cell. In particular, Lys48-linked polyUb acts as a universal signal in the ubiquitin-
proteasome proteolytic pathway, the principal regulatory mechanism for the turnover of short-lived proteins that
influences a variety of vital cellular events. Understanding how polyUb chains are recognized by the 26S
proteasome and other downstream effector molecules is central to our understanding of the mechanisms of
regulation. Despite an increasing wealth of information on the cellular processes regulated by
polyubiquitination and the identification of numerous ubiquitin-binding proteins that tie the polyUb signal to
downstream events, the molecular basis of diversity in ubiquitin-mediated signaling remains unclear. The
mechanisms underlying the ability of different polyUb chains to signal for distinct outcomes remain to be
elucidated before the origin of specificity in polyUb signaling is understood. Obtaining such information is
absolutely necessary in order to develop a molecular understanding of how different polyUb chains are able to
act as specific molecular signals. The objective of the proposed work is to characterize the structure and
recognition properties of various types of polyUb chains, in order to understand at a molecular level the
structural basis for ubiquitin's ability to serve as a versatile yet specific cellular signal. These studies will focus
on the so-called non-canonical ubiquitin chains: linked via lysines other than Lys48 or Lys63 (e.g., Lys6,
Lys27) and chains containing heterogeneous linkages (e.g., Lys11 & Lys48), branched and unbranched, and
the mechanisms of selective recognition of these chains by dedicated receptors from the DNA repair or
proteasomal degradation pathways. We will also determine the conformations of the canonical, Lys48-linked
tetraUb chains in solution in order to gain insights into the mechanisms of their recognition by cellular
receptors. Finally, these studies will characterize the interactions and determine the structures of polyUb
complexes with the recently designed macrocyclic peptides that bind polyUb chains with high affinity and
linkage specificity, in order to facilitate further development and optimization of this entirely novel class of
modulators and potential therapeutics for ubiquitin-mediated signaling pathways. We will use modern NMR
approaches in combination with small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS) and other biophysical
techniques in order to determine the three-dimensional structures and conformational ensembles of polyUb
chains in solution and characterize their binding preferences and complexes with receptors."
10879326,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cervical cancer burden falls disproportionately on women in low- and middle-income countries. Achieving
cervical cancer elimination in these high-burden settings will require high coverage of HPV vaccination. To this
end, many African countries have introduced the HPV vaccine in national programs that offer the vaccine for
free to preadolescent girls. However, uptake in the region is low and correlates of uptake are under-studied.
This project aims to (A) collect primary (qualitative and quantitative) and secondary (quantitative) data in Kenya
and Malawi about factors hypothesized to affect HPV vaccine uptake at the environmental/policy, systems,
community, and individual levels; and use these data in (B) multi-level modeling to identify what is most strongly
associated with HPV vaccine uptake and motivation to vaccinate, and (C) agent-based models to explore what
interventions may be most effective at increasing population-level coverage of HPV vaccine in these countries.
Kenya and Malawi were selected for this study due to their high cervical cancer burden, and experience with
different vaccine delivery settings in their national HPV vaccination programs: Kenya offers the vaccine at health
facilities, while Malawi has used school-based campaigns plus health facility-based delivery. The analyses will
therefore offer “case studies” for other countries using or considering these different approaches.
To our knowledge, this would be the first study to survey a large sample of randomly-selected African parents
(n=3000 in each country) about the factors associated with their daughter’s HPV vaccination status; and the first
to systematically collect and analyze data on multi-level factors associated with HPV vaccination and motivation,
e.g. the policy space, the health system and vaccine delivery context, and social communities.
The project will leverage research partnerships between NYU and: APHRC (an African research and policy
institute), IPA (which has extensive experience collecting data in low-resource settings), UCLA (HPV vaccination
and multi-level research expertise), and USC (specifically around simulation modeling for health outcomes).
There is also local expertise from both Kenya and Malawi, and a team of experts on all facets of the study.
Multi-level analyses that include new primary and secondary data about correlates of HPV vaccine uptake are
necessary in order to develop targeted, comprehensive, context-specific strategies that will increase HPV
vaccination, improve health outcomes and ultimately achieve cervical cancer elimination. As cervical cancer is
a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries, and as vaccination uptake is an increasing challenge
worldwide especially in diverse populations, this study may inform practice and policy in other settings."
10879948,"The mechanisms of migraine are poorly understood, but a large body of indirect evidence has implicated the
nociceptive sensory innervation of the cranial meninges as playing a critical role in the generation of the
headache. A key finding, in single-unit recording studies, was the prolonged activation of the 1st- and 2nd -order
neurons of this meningeal sensory pathway following the induction of cortical spreading depression (CSD), the
cortical phenomenon that underlies the migraine aura. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding
the neural basis for the perceptual effects of CSD, and the putative role of the meningeal sensory pathway in
these effects: as yet there has been no study of CSD’s effects on the 3rd-order meningeal sensory neurons in
the thalamus, the structure that serves as the gateway to sensory cortex. This is particularly critical because
the thalamus stands apart from the trigeminal ganglion and the dorsal horn (containing the 1st- and 2nd-order
neurons) in 1) its extremely strong reciprocal connectivity with the cortex, and 2) in containing populations of
neurons bilateral receptive fields (in addition to those in the ventrobasal complex with unilateral receptive
fields), whose activity would be critical in clarifying the long-standing problem of the laterality of the migraine
headache and its relation to the laterality of the aura (see Significance).
 In addition, this information is relevant to the ongoing question in headache research of to what degree
migraine is a result of processes in the central vs peripheral nervous system. Arguments for a central
mechanism for the generation of the headache have focused on the possibility that CSD might activate the
central neurons of the meningeal sensory pathway through central mechanisms that are independent of
peripheral activation. Such a finding, of activation of a central nociceptive pathway through a central
mechanism, has long been hypothesized but has not yet been demonstrated to occur, in any pain pathway.
We explore these questions in the following two aims:
Aim 1: Characterize the effect of CSD on the activity on thalamic neurons that receive peripheral sensory input
from the cranial meninges, using single-unit recording in anesthetized male and female rats.
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that the activation of 2nd- and 3rd-order neurons in the meningeal sensory pathway
by CSD can occur independent of peripheral input. These experiments will investigate the peripheral vs central
contribution to the CSD-induced responses.
 These studies will have impact on our basic understanding of headache in relation to the key questions,
fundamental to current migraine research, of the sensory perceptual effects of CSD and the contribution of
peripheral vs. central mechanisms to the migraine headache. More broadly, the finding of activation of
nociceptive neurons by a central process that is independent of peripheral input would be a novel finding in the
study of pain mechanisms."
10879950,"An understanding of the genetic and molecular bases for developmental delay in Down syndrome (DS) will be
critical for the design of strategies to improve cognitive function in DS; however, a fundamental gap exists in our
knowledge of the effects of trisomy on juvenile cortical development when activity sculpts the functional circuitry
of the brain. The mouse visual system affords a novel window into this process with robust, activity-dependent
behaviors that can be elicited in a well-characterized, neural circuit. Ts65Dn mice, a well-studied model of DS,
demonstrate a defect in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP), a juvenile visual cortical response to loss of input
from one eye that in normal mice results in strengthening of cortical responses to stimulation of the nondeprived
eye. Ts1Rhr mice harbor a smaller duplication and demonstrate similar plasticity impairment. Within the Ts1Rhr
duplication, preliminary data indicate that the gene encoding Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated
kinase 1a (DYRK1A) drives impairment when trisomic and this impairment can be rescued by restoration of
Dyrk1a disomy. Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency also impairs ODP, suggesting that too little DYRK1A activity can be
as deleterious as too much activity; identifying DYRK1A effectors may provide additional, potentially safer, drug
targets as well as reveal the underlying mechanism of DYRK1A-driven impairment. In vitro studies have impli-
cated DYRK1A in hippocampal plasticity impairment and in behavioral phenotypes, though the mechanisms
underlying these phenotypes are not well understood. The central hypothesis is that Dyrk1a trisomy causes
aberrant kinase activity that disrupts neuronal function and consequently impairs cortical circuit function during
juvenile development in DS. The experiments of Aim 1 explore the extent to which Dyrk1a trisomy can account
for impairment in the context of model mice with a larger complement of trisomic genes (Dp1Yey mice; Aim 1a),
and whether postnatal, pharmacologic inhibition of DYRK1A can restore ODP in Ts1Rhr mice (Aim 1b) using
awake optical imaging of intrinsic signals and immediate early gene expression to measure cortical responses
to visual stimulation. Aim 2 focuses on the cellular and molecular bases for circuit impairment in Dyrk1a trisomic
mice. The Cre-Lox recombination system will be used to assess whether Dyrk1a trisomy is required in excitatory
or in inhibitory neurons to impair ODP in Ts1Rhr mice (Aim 2a). The cellular and physiologic effects of Dyrk1a
trisomy will be assessed through patch clamp electrophysiologic analysis of L4 principal neurons, the primary
cortical neurons that receive input from both eyes (Aim 2b). To identify DYRK1A effectors, laser capture micros-
copy will be coupled with mass spectrometry to perform phosphoproteomic analysis of visual cortical layer 4 in
Ts1Rhr mice with 2 or with 3 copies of Dyrk1A in the presence or absence of a challenge of loss of vision in one
eye (Aim 2c). The proposed experiments will address fundamental questions and open new avenues of inquiry
critical to the design and implementation of therapies to ameliorate developmental delay and intellectual disability
in people with DS."
10879949,"Abstract
Urodele newts are the unrivaled champions of vertebrate tissue regeneration. A greater understanding of the
processes which enable their regenerative capabilities could inspire novel therapeutic approaches to combating
blinding ailments. After injury, the Spanish ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl can regenerate its lens through the
transdifferentiation of iris pigment epithelium cells (IPECs) into lens progenitor cells. Interestingly, this
regenerative competence is restricted to IPECs within the dorsal compartment of the iris. Ventral IPECs are
nominally regeneration-incompetent, despite being morphologically indistinguishable from their dorsal
counterparts. Past efforts to identify molecular distinctions between dorsal and ventral IPECs have been unable
to pinpoint the precise determining factors for regeneration competence. These limitations were in part owing to
the large genomes of amphibians, which have precluded the robust delineation of gene structures. More recently,
our group has begun to address these limitations in Pleurodeles waltl, which now has an available reference
genome. Our preliminary observations suggest that the molecular foundations of IPEC regenerative competence
are determined by a highly conserved signaling axis relating to vertebrate eye development, including BMP and
Ephrin signaling cues. Upon surgical removal of the lens, we demonstrate that the newt iris undergoes distinct
shifts in the localization of BMP signaling effectors, serving as a molecular “switch” for regeneration competence.
Subsequently, the local environment of the dorsal iris is transformed into a pro-regenerative niche, whereas the
ventral iris is characterized by an acute injury-response program. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
pharmacologic perturbation of BMP or Ephrin signaling is sufficient to confer regenerative competence to ventral
IPECs. These results collectively lead us to hypothesize that newt lens regeneration is directed by a unique
gene regulatory paradigm that evolved downstream of the conserved BMP and Ephrin signaling axes. To
investigate this conjecture, we propose to comprehensively interrogate the role of these signaling axes in
directing dorsal and ventral IPEC injury responses. Gene regulatory mechanisms, including chromatin
accessibility profiling, will be performed on dorsal and ventral irises at landmark time points during lens
regeneration (Aim 1). Moreover, we will construct a spatiotemporal atlas of cell types associated with the
regenerative dorsal iris and non-regenerative ventral iris by leveraging cutting-edge techniques, including single-
nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics (Aim 2). Finally, we will systematically perturb the BMP
and Ephrin pathways during lens regeneration by using in vivo screens for druggable nodes within these
signaling cascades as well as transgenic newt lines (Aim 3). Collectively, these findings will greatly expand our
knowledge of the cellular and molecular determinants for regeneration competence. We are hopeful that the
proposed experimentation has the potential to uncover novel routes for the induction of tissue regeneration as a
method to combat eye diseases."
10889433,"Along with the aging of our population comes important socioeconomic costs due to the numerous healthcare
concerns of the elderly. Changes in the aging gastrointestinal tract underlie the high incidence of regional
diseases such as chronic constipation and colorectal cancer in the elderly. In addition, intestinal barrier
dysfunction that increases with age has been implicated as a central driver of inflammaging that underlies a
plethora of other pathologies that contribute to morbidity in the elderly population. The processes driving
intestinal aging are poorly understood and there is an urgent need to identify pathways mediating intestinal aging
in order to develop therapeutic interventions. A large body of published and preliminary data underscores the
critical role of cGMP signaling in intestinal health. Defective cGMP signaling in the mouse intestine mimics key
aspects of the aging phenotype, and while reduced cGMP signaling is well-documented in aging vascular and
urogenital tissues, it has not previously been studied in the aging intestine.
Our goal is to understand the role of cGMP-signaling in the aging gut-epithelium in order to develop prevention
and treatment strategies to reduce the impact of intestinal diseases on the elderly. Our central hypothesis is
that cGMP signaling becomes dysregulated in the intestinal epithelium during aging, and this predisposes elderly
individuals to diseases such as constipation, colon cancer, and others resulting from barrier dysfunction-
promoted inflammaging. Our objectives are (1) to characterize the expression and function of cGMP signaling
components in the intestinal epithelium of mice during aging, and (2) to determine the extent to which intestinal
organoids are appropriate avatars of the “aged” gut phenotype. These objectives will be accomplished in the
following aims.
Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that cGMP signaling is reduced and can be therapeutically targeted in intestinal
epithelium of aged mice. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that intestinal organoids are suitable avatars for cGMP
signaling in the gut of aged mice. Our project’s scientific impact is potentially paradigm-shifting new information
about the cGMP-signaling axis during gut aging, and how it contributes to intestinal disorders in the elderly. By
testing the suitability of intestinal organoids as avatars of the aged epithelium, our results will set the stage for
future studies of cGMP signaling in the aging human intestine, and provide a model to interrogate the underlying
mechanisms of gut aging. Importantly, our results will also determine proof of principle for the ability of FDA-
approved drugs that target cGMP signaling to treat elderly patients with intestinal cGMP dysfunction."
10889483,"Project Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that culminates in neurodegeneration resulting in
cognitive decline. The pathological correlate most tightly associated with cognitive decline in AD is synapse
loss. Synaptic loss occurs in early-stage AD patients and progresses over time. The presence of pathological
tau significantly correlates with synapse loss and cognitive decline in AD, and synapse loss is present in all
models of tauopathy. It is unclear how pathological tau causes synapse loss, however neuroinflammation,
including activation of microglia and the complement cascade, may play a causative role. The complement
system, and specifically complement C1q, is used by the central nervous system to coordinate the removal of
synapses. Within the brain, complement C1q coats the membrane of weak or damaged synapses, resulting in
phagocytic removal of tagged synapses by microglia. In the AD brain there is an increase in C1q-mediated
synaptic pruning resulting in synapse loss. Importantly, complement activation and synapse loss correlate with
the deposition of pathological tau. We hypothesize that a tau-induced insult initiates a synaptic profile
that attracts C1q to coat synapses for removal. The mechanisms by which C1q recognizes tau-affected
synapses are unclear. Synaptic deposition of C1q requires presentation of a C1q-binding partner in the outer
membrane of weak/damaged synapses. In addition, cells normally express complement regulatory proteins
that prevent the synaptic deposition of C1q. Thus, tau-induced synaptic changes that recruit C1q to the
synaptic membrane could include 1) the presentation of disease-specific C1q binding partners, and/or 2) a
decrease in the expression of complement inhibitory regulators. We will investigate both possibilities in the
PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. To identify potential C1q interacting partners, synaptosomes will be isolated
from the hippocampus of PS19 or wild type (WT) mice and C1q will be immunoprecipitated from
synaptosomes. Mass spectrometry will be used to identify protein and lipid interacting partners that co-
immunoprecipitate with C1q. C1q interacting partners identified by mass spec will be verified biochemically and
histologically in PS19 mice and early-stage post-mortem human AD tissue. To determine the effect of
tauopathy on synaptic complement regulatory proteins, we will isolate C1q+ synaptosomes from PS19 or WT
mice at 1, 3 and 6 months of age and quantify complement regulators. Changes in complement regulators will
be correlated to changes in pathological tau. Changes in complement regulators in PS19 mice will be
confirmed in early-stage post-mortem human AD tissue. Successful completion of these aims will identify the
molecular mechanisms of complement mediated synaptic pruning in response to tauopathy. Preventing
synaptic loss in early-stage AD patients could preserve cognitive function and improve quality of life."

This exploratory R21 application seeks to identify and characterize the molecular basis by which the
Vacuolating Cytotoxin (VacA), which is the only known intracellular-acting exotoxin secreted by the human
gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp), recognizes and binds to host cells as a requisite step for host cell
intoxication. Chronic infection with Hp is the single most important risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma, the
third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Nearly all Hp isolates harbor vacA, which has been
demonstrated to be important for colonization in a murine model of Hp infection. Relevant to this application,
specific polymorphisms within vacA correlate with both toxin cellular activity and the severity of Hp-associated
diseases. In particular, a region located in carboxyl-terminal domain of VacA, known as the “middle (m)
region”, segregates into two allelic variants, m1-VacA, which is associated with higher risk of disease, and
more potent cellular modulatory activity, and m2-VacA, associated with lower risk of gastric disease, and less
potent cellular modulatory activity. Although incompletely understood, several studies have suggested that
m1-VacA and m2-VacA may differ in host cell receptor specificity, which is a critical determinant of toxin cell
tropism. Moreover, results from extensive phylogenetic analyses suggest that the m1- and m2- forms of VacA
may possess different cellular activities that bestow a selective advantage for maintaining both alleles in the
human population. Previous studies in the PI’s laboratory identified the abundant plasma membrane surface
sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as an important determinant for m1-VacA binding to the cell surface of host
cells as an important determinant of toxin cellular activity. Moreover, in vitro experiments indicate that VacA
preferentially binds to SM over other common membrane lipids. These and other findings support our overall
hypothesis that SM functions as a cell surface receptor for m1-VacA. Nonetheless, essentially nothing is
known about how VacA recognizes and binds to the toxin’s sphingolipid receptor. Moreover, it is not currently
known whether SM-dependent toxin cell surface binding and cellular activity, which we discovered to be
associated with m1-VacA, are properties that extend to m2-variants of the toxin. This application proposes
studies to address these gaps in knowledge in the context of two inter-related, but not co-dependent Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to identify the SM-receptor binding site of m1-VacA, using both biochemical and
computational approaches. In Aim 2, we will extend these approaches to evaluate whether the importance of
cell-surface SM for m1-VacA, extends also to m2-VacA. Completion of these exploratory studies will address
for the first time whether SM-receptor dependent cell binding and activity is a shared characteristic of both
m1- and m2-toxin allelic variants, and will provide the framework for future studies to not only better
understand both the molecular basis and consequences of VacA allelic variation, but also set the stage for
structure-based inhibitor development to block the very earliest stages of VacA cellular intoxication."

The overarching objective of the Kidney Mapping Atlas Project (KMAP) in response to the Kidney Tissue Atlas
Coordinating Center (KTACC) application is to create and support the central data management, integration
and dissemination platform for the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Our focus for the KMAP will be
centered around the key values established by us in the first funding cycle of KPMP: a collaborative
environment committed to promoting participant safety and engagement, scientific rigor, and outreach to the
global renal research community anchored in a concept of interdisciplinary team science necessary to drive
disruptive advances in kidney precision medicine. We plan to extend our highly experienced team successfully
navigating the multiple inherent challenges during the startup phase of KPMP to address the key opportunities
and challenges of the next phase of KPMP. To this end have assembled domain expertise in nephrology,
nephro- and digitial pathology, anatomy, ontology, data curation, biostatistics, bioinformatics, renal systems
biologists, data visualization, kidney user experience, website and software development. Our overarching
principle will continue to be an uncompromising commitment to our patient partners co-leading our efforts and
a sharp focus on rigorous QC and QC in tight coordination with the KPMP Central Hub, the Tissue
Interrogation and Recruitment Sites and Opportunity pool awardees.
We have pioneered a team science structure to advance a precision medicine approach to kidney disease with
the development of the KPMP data management, integration and sharing framework strongly routed in FAIR
principles. We share a common philosophy that our role is one of service, collaboration, and leadership with
over 30 years of experience coordinating highly successful large-scale research studies into the molecular
mechanism of kidney disease always supporting diversity, equity and inclusion in all aspects of renal precision
medicine research. The KMAP will be led by Drs. Kretzler (University of Michigan) and Himmelfarb (University
of Washington) with complementary expertise and an extensive track record in working together to lead
clinical, translational and bench kidney precision medicine studies and will ensure the seamless integration of
KMAP into the KPMP ecosystem.
KMAP will serve its function via three main units. The KMAP Data Management Core (DMC) will be
responsible to clean, harmonize, register, store and curate the diverse current and future KPMP data. The
KMAP Data Analysis Hub (DAH) will integrate the multimodal data along the continuum of clinical, social-risk,
spatial, ontological, digital-pathology and molecular data sets to identify key drivers of disease processes.
Finally, the KMAP Data Visualization Hub (DAV) will develop, maintain and distribute a multi-dimensional
atlas of kidney health and disease via a flexible computation environment.
Tight integration of the KMAP efforts with HuBMAP, HCA and RBK/GUDMPA together with strong leadership
skills of the PIs will ensure effective implementation across KPMP and the biomedical community at large."
10891652,"ABSTRACT
Chromosome segregation errors can produce cells with an incorrect number of one or more chromosomes,
known as aneuploidy. Aneuploidy is therefore a special class of mutation that can have immediate phenotypic
effects. Although aneuploidy is detrimental during mammalian development, it is common in many cancers
and a driver in the evolution of drug resistant tumors and fungal pathogens. A major unaddressed question is
the degree to which different individuals vary in their ability to tolerate aneuploidy. Understanding how genetic
differences influence aneuploidy tolerance has far reaching implications for genetics, human biology, and
evolution. But studying this topic mammalian systems is extremely challenging, since it is not possible to
systematically manipulate karyotypes in a large number of genetic backgrounds. Here we will address the
fundamental question of how genetic variation influences the ability of cells to tolerate chromosome
duplications, in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the power of yeast genetics, we
adapted a method to duplicate specific yeast chromosomes in the near absence of selection. We will apply
this method to explore the breadth and mechanisms of genetic variation in tolerating chromosome duplications
(herein referred to as aneuploidy). Aim 1 will use this approach to duplicate each of the 16 chromosomes in
yeast, in dozens of non-laboratory strains across the yeast phylogeny. Results will characterize the range of
natural variation in aneuploidy tolerance and will test if this variation occurs sporadically due to rare alleles or
persists across many strains within specific lineages. Preliminary results suggest lineage-specific variation in
aneuploidy tolerance. Aim 2 will test if variations in aneuploidy sensitivity are due to differences in
“generalized” aneuploidy tolerance, in which cells are sensitive regardless of which chromosome is duplicated,
versus chromosome-specific sensitivities that are likely driven by the effects of duplicated genes encoded on
those chromosomes. We will test how well chromosome-specific sensitivities are explained by an additive
gene model that is based on measured fitness costs of the genes’ over-expression, measured here from a
gene over-expression library expressed in each strain. Aim 3 will begin to uncover the physiological and
genetic mechanisms for variable aneuploidy tolerance. We will first test our hypothesis that genetic variation in
aneuploidy tolerance is due to variations in the ability to manage proteostasis stress. We will then use bulk-
segregant mapping to study the genetic architecture of that variance and identify casual genes. Yeast is an
outstanding model in which to study this fundamental question, since many cellular mechanisms and genetic
principles are conserved in other organisms including humans. This project will generate important insights
into aneuploidy tolerance that will have broad implications for genetics, human health, and evolution."
10891653,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have assembled an entirely Florida-centric collaborative research team with collective expertise in microbial
natural products chemistry and pharmacology, genomics, bacterial enzymology, bioinformatics, synthetic
biology, chemical synthesis, and cyanobacterial and sponge chemical ecology and phylogenetics. The team is
complemented by an out-of-state expert in metagenomics and bioinformatics integration. This geographical
cluster of expertise being in the state with the greatest marine biodiversity in the continental US provides a dual
benefit and unique opportunity to explore systems that are likely to hold some of the most promise in terms of
biosynthetic potential: marine cyanobacterial communities, consisting of benthic filamentous cyanobacteria that
are associated with unique microbial diversity, and sponges and their associated rich and unique microbiome in
a local hotspot of biodiversity. Compounds produced by these communities are known to cover therapeutically
relevant chemical space and are therefore suited as starting points for drug discovery. In a targeted fashion, we
will obtain high quality (meta)genome and (meta)transcriptome sequence information from sponge-associated
microbiomes and cyanobacteria using state-of-the-art sequencing techniques. We will build an integrated, multi-
component platform that leverages existing bioinformatics tools and newly developed artificial intelligence-based
tools to shine new light at their genomes with the goal of identifying novel biosynthetic gene clusters, particularly
those unattainable with current tools, and even chemical skeletons. We will express natural products encoded
by the clusters by employing five types of complementary synthetic biology systems that we have strategically
developed over the past several years. These systems originating from five bacterial phyla commonly associated
with both marine cyanobacterial and sponge samples cover diverse genetic backgrounds and are expected to
effectively translate the identified genetic information of a variety of organisms into chemicals with proper system
optimization. We will evaluate and analyze metabolites and expression profiles using LC-MS-based
metabolomics and NMR and characterize associated new enzymology. Natural products derived from chemical
extract and fraction libraries and those generated through our expression systems or chemical synthesis will be
tested in our multidimensional screening platform, consisting of unbiased phenotypic assays in various in vitro
and in vivo models as well as experimental and computational target-based functional assays. This approach
will enable us to capture a broad array of activities from expressed and unexpressed genes. Selected bioactive
natural products will be scaled by chemical synthesis, and bioprobes and enzyme substrates will be prepared
for in-depth biological studies and enzymology research, respectively. Successful completion of these aims by

 MECHANISMS AND MODELS OF CANCER
 August 13-17, 2024
 Recent years have produced transformative discoveries that have revealed the
mechanisms behind the development and progression of cancer, both from the perspective of the
cancer cell and the host response. These advances have resulted in targeted cancer therapies
that have extended patient survival, as well as new immunotherapies that have, in some cases,
resulted in cures of previously intractable malignancies. Stunning technological developments
have enabled us to interrogate the cancer genome and epigenome with unprecedented depth
and sophistication, uncovering the challenges that tumor heterogeneity imposes for cancer
therapy, while also enabling more accurate therapeutic monitoring. Advances in functional
genomic technologies allow us to turn oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes on an off at will in
vitro and in vivo to determine their function. Tumor models, such as organoids, have been
developed, revealing new insights into cancer cell biology, while also enabling the rapid
identification and testing of new therapeutics. With advances in structural biology, we can
examine the three-dimensional structure of oncogenic proteins and protein complexes, facilitating
development of small molecule inhibitors or antagonistic antibodies. Powerful strategies also
allow us to interrogate how metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, opening up the possibility
of novel therapeutic approaches that exploit metabolic vulnerabilities. Improvements in
computational biology are yielding new insights into biological networks and tumor evolution.
Dissemination and use of these technologies, models and mechanism-based approaches in this
fast-moving field is greatly facilitated by meetings that bring investigators together to present and
openly discuss their latest unpublished research findings. We also need to train the next
generation of leaders in the field, and an essential part of this process is this fantastic opportunity
for young investigators, such as graduate students and postdocs, to present their work and
interact one-on-one with senior investigators. The Mechanisms and Models of Cancer meeting at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is one of the premier vehicles for promoting the next
intellectual leaps in cancer research and propelling the field into the future to the benefit of cancer
patients. The precise scope of the individual sessions will be decided on the basis of the openly
submitted abstracts. Each session will be chaired by two established scientists in the field, who
will establish the format of each session based on submitted abstracts. The chairs will introduce
and give an overview of the topics in their sessions and a brief update on their own research.
Particular emphasis will be given to promoting the active participation of graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and new investigators, as well as of leading scientists in the field. Three
leading experts in diverse areas of cancer biology will deliver keynote addresses during the
conference. It is anticipated that the meeting will provide unique opportunities for the exchange
of data and ideas by both junior and senior investigators in different areas of research as they
apply to many aspects of carcinogenesis. Given the success of past meetings held at CSHL on
this topic between 1996 and 2022, we anticipate the attendance of about 400 scientists from
laboratories around the world."
10899484,"Predicting how a particular patient's vascular system with respond to different treatment or
stimuli and adapt over long periods of time remains a grand challenge in precision medicine.
The lack of real-time turn around critically limits our ability to search a wide treatment space to
identify optimal intervention plans based on long-term, personalized predictions. Moreover, it
prevents real-time monitoring of a patient's hemodynamics based on streaming, dynamic data
such as that acquired from wearables. By moving from simulations that can capture only several
heartbeats to modeling months or even years, we shift the utilization of patient-specific digital
twins to provide on-demand tracking of a patient's hemodynamic state. Such data would
improve screening for cardiovascular disease, improved monitoring, and finally, inform
treatment planning by enabling prediction of longterm flow effects currently not attainable. The
major objective of this proposal is to develop and apply a methodology coupling physics-based
simulations with machine learning that, combined with wearable sensors, provides real-time,
personalized predictions of 3D, complex hemodynamic patterns over months to years. A better
understanding of how a patient's circulatory system and underlying hemodynamics responds
under different physiological states over time is of broad relevance to treating a wide range of
vascular diseases."

10904019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award (K08) details a five-year plan to promote Dr. Heather
Wachtel’s transition to an independent career as a physician-scientist studying neuroendocrine tumors.
Bioinformatics and genomics are rapidly evolving fields which offer novel approaches to the study of human
disease. This career development plan includes formal training in bioinformatics and computational genomics,
as an in-depth understanding of these fields is critical for successful completion of the proposed research, and
for Dr. Wachtel’s development as an independent investigator. Dr. Wachtel is mentored by Dr. Katherine
Nathanson, a cancer geneticist, and her current work with Dr. Nathanson utilizes translational approaches to
study tumorigenesis and the spectrum of disease associated with hereditary cancer predisposition genes. Dr.
Wachtel’s focus is on succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) pathogenic variants and neuroendocrine tumors.
Succinate dehydrogenase is a highly conserved mitochondrial complex with critical roles in metabolism and
cancer. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the SDHx genes are causative in several human cancers. Recent
data suggests that tumors associated with germline pathogenic variants in SDHx, including pheochromocytoma,
paraganglioma and renal cell carcinoma, are linked to DNA damage. However, DNA damage repair has not
been studied on a gene-specific level, and the gene and allele-specific risks of SDHx germline pathogenic
variants remain incompletely characterized. This proposal aims to accurately characterize the phenotypes and
tumor biology associated with SDHx germline variants, to develop improved risk estimates and identify targeted
therapies for patients who progress to disease. In AIM 1, Dr. Wachtel proposes to perform a Phenome-Wide
Association study (PheWAS) of SDHx in the UK Biobank to accurately characterize the gene-specific oncologic
associations of SDHx and quantify phenotypic associations with inflammatory and metabolic disease at the gene
level. Findings will be replicated in an independent cohort from the Penn Medicine BioBank. In AIM 2, Dr. Wachtel
will utilize the unique resources of the Penn Neuroendocrine Tumor Center and expertise in collaborative studies
to quantify genomic signatures of DNA damage response pathways in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma
associated with SDHx germline pathogenic variants. Finally, she will evaluate the evidence for potential
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor susceptibility in patient-derived tumor specimens. Dr. Wachtel
will supplement these studies with a career development program which takes full advantage of the depth and
breadth of resources at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Wachtel has assembled a mentoring and advisory
team of accomplished and successful physician-scientists and geneticists to guide her career development. She
will engage in both formal didactic and hands-on training to hone her skills in bioinformatics and genomics. This
career development plan and the experiments detailed in the Research Strategy will provide Dr. Wachtel with
the tools necessary to achieve her long-term goal of an independent investigative career as a physician-scientist."
10903751,"Nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) is a new modality for neuromodulation, with unique capabilities
qualitatively different from the conventional electrostimulation. The potential benefits of nsPEF include but are
not limited to prolonged stimulation with little or no electrochemical side effects; excitation at lower thresholds;
selectivity based on cell charging time constant; the capability of choosing between stimulation, inhibition, and
ablation; and achieving these effects non-invasively, either for outpatient deep brain stimulation or for tumor
ablation.
 The primary effect of nsPEF is a rapid build-up of cell membrane potential (MP). Real-time measurements
of MP kinetics are a key to predicting the outcomes of nsPEF stimulation. They are also a key to understanding
bipolar cancellation, a unique feature that enables interference targeting of nsPEF for non-invasive
neuromodulation. However, membrane charging by nsPEF occurs on a nanosecond time scale, much faster
than could be resolved by the existing electrophysiological and imaging methods.
 We have addressed this challenge by implementing strobe pulsed laser microscopy for MP imaging with
better than 50 ns accuracy. In this one-of-a-kind set-up, cells loaded with a fast voltage-sensitive fluorescence
dye are exposed to high-power momentary laser flashes (5 kW, 6 ns). The flashes are dynamically
synchronized with nsPEF stimulation of target cells. Photos of fluorescence taken at different times during and
after nsPEF show the real-time dynamics of MP changes and how these changes culminate in downstream
effects, such as opening of voltage gated ion channels, initiation of action potentials, and nanoelectroporation.
 We will employ this all-new set-up for understanding fine mechanisms and principles how neurons respond
to the nanosecond electric stress. We will characterize nsPEF parameters needed to evoke the desired
neuromodulation effect and tune the interference targeting protocols to achieve this effect at a distance from
stimulating electrodes. We will perform finite element modeling of the electric field thresholds and use our in
vitro results to define the feasibility and nsPEF requirements for non-invasive deep brain stimulation.
 This project will generate new basic knowledge of neuronal function, including nanosecond-scale
biophysics of the cell membrane and ion channels. We will systematically characterize nsPEF neuromodulation
effects and link them to dielectric and physiological properties of neurons and to nsPEF stimulation
parameters. This in vitro project will utilize R21 “high risk, high reward” concept to collect mechanistic and
quantitative data necessary for animal and human studies of nsPEF neuromodulation."
10904022,"Hypertension (HTN) is the leading modifiable cause of cardiovascular disease. The Surgeon General’s 2020
Call to Action to Control Hypertension articulated the critical relevance of multilevel strategies to address the
social determinants and access to care that affect HTN control. Rural individuals experience the additional
challenges of the rural health divide: geographic distance from providers, social isolation, limited social
resources, and high rates of low health literacy. We have developed and validated a smartphone-based
program for home-based blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), termed MyBP, and have demonstrated the
success of MyBP to promote adherence to HBPM, improve blood pressure (BP) control, and enhance patient
engagement. We now adapt MyBP as a virtual agent, termed MyBP Coach, and leverage our experience
with such agents to provide longitudinal health education, empathic guidance, monitoring, and adaptable
patient-centered coaching to rural individuals with cardiovascular disease. Here, guided by a patient advisory
committee, we provide MyBP Coach to rural individuals as a personalized curriculum to promote and support
HBPM; HTN education; medication adherence; non-pharmacologic strategies for HTN management;
preparation for the clinical encounter; and enhanced problem-solving and engagement. We will evaluate the 6-
month MyBP Coach intervention in a single-center, parallel group clinical trial, randomizing 334 patients with
poorly controlled HTN (systolic BP 150-199 or diastolic BP 95-119 mm Hg at 2 ambulatory visits) to (1) HBPM
with MyBP Coach; or (2) the control, consisting of HBPM and a smartphone with a general health application
(WebMD). For both intervention and control, we provide HBPM summaries to clinicians to improve HTN
management for rural patients. We will follow treatment intensification and adjustment of hypertensive
medications over the 12-month trial; and track (a) adherence to antihypertensive medication with 6- and 12-
month proportion of days covered and (b) 6-month adherence to HBPM. Our aims are: (1) Examine the effect
of the MyBP Coach intervention on BP at 6 months and assess the sustainability of its effects at 12 months; (2)
Evaluate the effect of the intervention on adherence to BP medications and HBPM; and (3) Determine the
effect of the intervention on patient-reported outcomes including quality of life, engagement, and social
isolation. Our trial leverages our health system’s infrastructure across rural PA, a common electronic health
record of our large health care system, and established rural clinical partnerships. We incorporate methods
previously applied by us to recruit geographically isolated rural individuals with limited health and digital
literacy, conduct remote assessments, and provide similar smartphone-based resources and instruction.
Expected Results: In this project we will evaluate a scalable and patient-centered intervention to improve BP
control, medication and HBPM adherence, and patient-reported outcomes. If proven successful, this
intervention can be broadly disseminated to improve the care of rural patients with poorly controlled HTN."
10903721,"Project Summary/Abstract
 As the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, cardiovascular disease has benefitted
from immense research investments to improve the care of afflicted patients. However, the application of this
knowledge in routine clinical practice has been variable and the evaluation of more patient-centered outcomes,
including patients’ symptoms, function and quality of life, are desperately needed. Not only do these knowledge
gaps limit the potential for US healthcare to improve, but evolving changes in reimbursement from a volume- to
value-based payment models have created an unparalleled demand for cardiovascular outcomes researchers.
This renewal application seeks to continue a highly successful program for training post-doctoral scholars to
independently perform clinically-oriented outcomes research. It extends and improves the University of Missouri-
Kansas City (UMKC)’s outcomes research training program, which is unique in the Midwest and serves as a
central unifying research program for our region. The 2-year training program has 3 synergistic components: 1)
a basic foundation of in clinical research (including a Masters degree in bioinformatics with a clinical research
emphasis), 2) specialized skills for outcomes research coupled with academic ‘survival skills’ (our outcomes-
based core curriculum), and 3) hands-on research. Hallmarks of the research experiences include multi-
disciplinary group mentorship, individualized mentorship to meet each trainee’s needs; access to numerous
existing data, as well as clinical populations for primary data collection and implementation; training in
entrepreneurship; and highly experienced statistical support. Enhancements planned for the existing program
include 1) a more robust collaboration with the University of Missouri system, which is investing in the NextGen
Precision Medicine institute and for which our program serves as the central pillar for precision healthcare
delivery; 2) increased engagement in clinical trial design and execution; and 3) access to a new community
collaboration of 19 regional hospitals innovating healthcare delivery to improve its value (www.kcqvic.org) for
deeper exposure to implementation research. Administering the program will be an experienced program
director, supported by well-qualified associate and assistant directors and mentors with expertise in economics
and decision analysis; large database analysis; bioinformatics; qualitative and implementation research; study
design, methodology and statistics; patient and clinician behavior change; community-based participatory
research; entrepreneurship; shared medical decision-making and patient-centered research; multi-disciplinary
cardiovascular research; disparities research; and risk models and creation of clinical tools, as well as an
advisory committee of national leaders. Collectively, our committed team will provide a formal training,
mentorship and evaluation program to continue and enhance our prior success in supporting the ability of
trainees to make significant contributions to the scientific literature and to embark on successful academic
research careers."
10903722,"Many anesthetics exert their action by binding to proteins embedded in the lipid membranes that encase cells.
These proteins, including receptors and ion channels, allow cells to coordinate their action across the body.
Explaining at the atomic level how binding to these proteins results in anesthesia requires knowing where on
the protein the ligand actually binds. Determining this is a difficult problem that can be addressed with various
methods, experimental and computational. The problem is made more difficult when the true binding sites are
on a part of the protein that is actually in the lipid membrane (transmembrane domains), because of the
complexity of the lipid environment. Computational methods to predict these sites that can accurately treat the
membrane (e.g. flooding molecular dynamics) are also inefficient. But more efficient methods, particularly
molecular docking, do not properly incorporate the effect of the membrane.
This project seeks to improve docking specifically so it can predict anesthetic ligand binding sites in
transmembrane domains. The overall goal is to create and calibrate a docking scoring function that takes the
lipids into account, by conducting certain one-time preprocessing steps. This will be done by:
 1) Predicting the microarchitecture of complex lipid membranes. Lipid membranes are composed of
 many different lipid types, and while the proportions of these lipids are known, the way they arrange
 themselves at the atomic level is not. This will be predicted using long-timescale molecular dynamics
simulations.
 2) Calculating the free energy profiles of insertion of selected anesthetics in these
 microarchitectures. It is necessary to know how favorable it is for the ligand in question to exist in the
 lipid membrane separately from the protein, so ligand free energy profiles as a function of depth in the
 membrane, as well as ligand rotation, will be calculated.
 3) Identifying hydrophobic regions on the protein of interest. Traditional docking assumes that the
 protein is entirely solvated in water. Inhomogeneous solvation theory will be used to identify
 hydrophobic regions that do not contain water so they may be treated appropriately.
 4) Constructing a modified docking scoring function that is parameterized by this data. The data
 calculated above will be fit to an efficient polynomial function for supplementing an existing docking
 scoring function.
The project, by its completion, will have substantially improved docking methodology for this specific but
important use case. It also will have served to improve the PI's ability to attack similar problems in the future,
preparing him for a successful career as an independent physician-scientist."
10903752,"The study of gene expression and possible role of condensates in regulating gene expression have
largely ignored known nuclear structures. This proposal is significant because we propose a novel model for
the role of nuclear organization in regulating gene expression: 1) Nuclear speckles and still unknown nuclear
compartments/bodies help organize other phase-separated condensates to modulate gene expression; 2)
Nuclear speckles together with surrounding nuclear compartments/bodies and associated phase-separated
condensates together represent active nuclear niches which may have different functional properties; 3) Small
distances matter: gene movements of only a few hundred nm between repressive and these different active
nuclear niches may differentially regulate gene expression; 4) Action-at-a distance: component flux into and
out of these nuclear compartments will have global effects on gene expression; 5) These same nuclear
compartments/bodies may similarly modulate RNA processing and organize nuclear export.
 Here we propose to: 1) Identify multiple components of known and still unknown nuclear “active
niches”; 2) Map genome-wide the positions and predicted movements of genes relative to these active niches
during physiological transitions; 3) Visualize nuclear body/compartment dynamics and fluxes of proteins
between nuclear bodies in steady-state and through physiological transitions; 4) Visualize movements of
reporter transgenes, endogenous genes, and rewired chromosome loci relative to these nuclear
bodies/compartments and temporally correlate changes in gene expression with their dynamic movements and
compartment associations; 5) Visualize movements of pre-mRNAs and nuclear mRNAs during RNA
processing and export; 6) Measure fluxes of nuclear body components to and from adjacent transcribing
chromatin. Additionally, we propose developing relatively low-cost, novel microscope platforms and software
specifically designed to facilitate these live-cell imaging goals in our laboratories as well as others.
 Our Aims will be to: 1. Map proteins, genes, RNAs relative to active nuclear compartment(s) using
iterative rounds of TSA-MS-Ratio, validation by light microscopy, and TSA-Seq; 2. Measure dynamics of
bodies, components of nuclear bodies using live-cell imaging; 3. Measure temporal correlation between
changes in gene expression and gene movement relative to nuclear bodies and visualize the export path of
expressed transcripts; 4. Design and deliver two novel microscopes designed to facilitate Aims 1-3 at a
modest cost. Successful completion of these Aims should significantly change our current understanding of the
role of nuclear organization in regulating gene expression with impact across a wide range of research fields."
10903723,"Project Summary / Abstract
Pediatric antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) in hospital and outpatient settings optimize the use of
antibiotics to improve clinical outcomes, decrease adverse drug events, and reduce the emergence of
antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, stewardship for patients at the transition from hospital discharge to
home, or “discharge stewardship,” is an unmet need for several reasons. First, few pediatric stewardship
programs perform discharge stewardship. Second, approximately 30% of pediatric patients receive antibiotics
at hospital discharge. Third, the majority of antibiotic days prescribed for hospitalized patients occur after
discharge. Fourth, up to half of discharge antibiotic prescriptions are suboptimal, which includes choosing the
wrong drug, dose, route, or duration of therapy. This project will use an implementation science framework to
develop, implement, and test the effectiveness of a multifaceted discharge stewardship intervention for
hospitalized children with the three most common indications for antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized children -
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTI), and skin/soft tissue infections (SSTI) - at
four children's hospitals to establish a foundation for future expansion to additional target populations.
Antibiotic choice, dose, route, and duration of therapy will be addressed. Aim 1 is to develop, locally adapt, and
implement a discharge stewardship intervention across the four participating sites. The integrated Promoting
Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will guide a rapid formative
evaluation to identify contextual factors likely to facilitate or hinder the implementation of a discharge
stewardship intervention at each site. Based on these results, local facilitators will work to develop and
implement a discharge stewardship intervention comprised of consensus driven clinical prescribing guidelines
for CAP, UTI, and SSTI plus quarterly feedback of prescribing data based on these guidelines. Aim 2 is to
measure the impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing (the primary outcome)
and patient-centered balancing measures. For the primary outcome, suboptimal antibiotic prescribing, we will
use retrospective data collection leveraging validated diagnostic code-based algorithms to maximize
consistency and feasibility for future dissemination. For the balancing metrics, treatment failure and post-
discharge adverse drug events, we will use prospective data collection from parents of patients with CAP, UTI,
and SSTI to maximize their capture. Both sub-aims will utilize a time series analysis based on 18 months of
pre-intervention data followed by 30 months of post-intervention data. This project will form the foundation for
future dissemination of discharge stewardship to a broader array of patient populations. Investigators on this
proposal form the leadership of the Sharing Antimicrobial Reports for Pediatric Stewardship (SHARPS)
Collaborative, a network comprised of more than 60 children's hospitals across North America that is uniquely
positioned to adopt antimicrobial stewardship interventions designed to target prescribing at hospital discharge."
10875879,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candida albicans is both a component of the human mycobiome as well as one of the most important human
fungal pathogens, capable of causing disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised people.
The pathogenic cycle that leads to invasive C. albicans disease can be divided into three steps: 1) transition
from mucosal colonization to sub-epithelial invasion; 2) filamentous morphogenesis within the sub-epithelium
leading to tissue damage; and 3) intravascular dissemination to target organs. Infections that stop after the first
two steps lead to mucosal diseases such as oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and vulvovaginal candidiasis
while those that progress to the third step cause life-threating candidemia and deep organ disease. Although
all three steps are required for the development of invasive disease, the third has been the most extensively
studied through the widely used tail-vein inoculation mouse model of disseminated infection. In this application,
we propose to use our barcoded collections of transcription factor (TF) and protein kinase (PK) mutants in
competitive fitness assays to genetically define the global regulatory networks and key downstream effectors
required for OPC mucosal infection (Aim 1). This aim will be facilitated by our recent development of an in vivo
RNA-seq approach to characterize the transcriptional profile of C. albicans during OPC. In Aim 2, we will
characterize the functions of the TF networks and identify the upstream PK signaling pathways that regulate in
vivo filamentation. We will identify PK substrates critical for in vivo filament initiation and elongation. The
successful execution of these aims will provide an unprecedentedly detailed in vivo profile of the regulatory
mechanisms for the first two steps in C. albicans pathogenesis. Since PKs have emerged as important
therapeutic targets across multiple areas of medicine, identification of PK networks with critical roles in C.
albicans pathogenesis also holds promise to provide new insights with relevance to antifungal drug
development."
10875884,"Project Summary:
 Neuroinflammation is a condition that can cause damage to the brain and lead to diseases like
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is caused by inflammation in the central nervous
system (CNS) and is linked to issues with mitochondria. Unfortunately, treating neuroinflammation is challenging
due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which makes it difficult to deliver drugs to affected areas and target specific
neuronal populations. Additionally, drugs that work for peripheral inflammation may not be as effective in the
CNS due to its unique microenvironment and cellular interactions. Our team is exploring ways to reduce
neuroinflammation using exosomes, which are small vesicles that can deliver molecules to recipient cells. We
plan to use exosomes to deliver anti-inflammatory agents directly to the CNS, creating mitochondrial-targeting
exosomes (MTEs) that carry anti-inflammatory microRNA (MTE-miRNA) to treat neuroinflammation. This method
is expected to restore mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate neuroinflammatory
responses. MTE-miRNAs have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders. To
achieve this, we will prepare and evaluate MTEs containing microRNAs with anti-inflammatory properties, assess
the impact of different dosages on reducing neuroinflammation in rats, and evaluate the effectiveness of MTE-
miRNA treatments over different periods. Our primary outcomes are to improve mitochondrial function and inhibit
inflammatory mediator production levels in rats with neuroinflammation. We will also gather crucial data on
potential side effects and an appropriate treatment duration that balances efficacy and safety, informing future
human studies. Another focus of this project is to train students extensively on exosome-based therapy and its
potential use in treating neuroinflammation. Our educational goal is to equip students with the necessary
knowledge and skills to make valuable contributions to biomedical research, and potentially create new and
effective treatments for neuroinflammatory disorders."
10875886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project, we propose to develop primary and secondary lead small molecules into preclinical drug
candidates for a precision SYNGAP1-DEE therapy. This research is consistent with the mission of NIMH
because this genetic disorder impacts mental health and behavior through impairments in intellectual and
social adaptive functioning. Pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants may explain up to 1% of non-X-linked
neurodevelopmental disorder cases and the estimated prevalence of these mutations is similar to that of
Fragile X syndrome, or 1-4/10,000 live births. Most, if not all, SYNGAP1-DEE cases are caused by variants
that lead to genetic haploinsufficiency (i.e. 50% of normal protein levels). Therefore, a rational strategy to treat
these patients is to develop precision-based approaches that “boost” low SynGAP protein expression in
affected brain cells. In prior NIMH funded research, we developed a novel phenotypic screening platform,
NDD-ChemScreen, which can detect chemical and biological agents that raise target gene/protein expression
in haploinsufficient neurons. This platform was used to discover lead small molecule compounds that
substantially raise SynGAP protein. Small molecules have distinct advantages compared to other
approaches for genetic disorders that impact central nervous system function. They can regulate disease-
driving biology, be delivered orally and still concentrate in brain tissue, and dosing can be easily adjusted
to fit individual patient needs and rapidly respond to adverse effects. While these compounds currently work
well in vitro, here we will optimize through established preclinical drug development workflows. This U01
research project has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will focus on optimizing the primary lead, SR-1815,
through medicinal chemistry. We will perform extensive SAR on SR-1815 to optimize potency, efficacy,
brain penetrance, solubility, and other drug-like properties (e.g., microsomal stability, CYP inhibition) to
reach a primary optimized lead. Specific Aim 2 will focus on identifying and optimizing a secondary lead
series for SYNGAP1-DEE with a chemical scaffold that is distinct from the primary lead. This will de-risk
the overall development of small molecules for SYNGAP1-DEE by mitigating unforeseen dead-ends that
can occur during development of any given chemical scaffold. Specific Aim 3 will focus on scale-up and
early-stage preclinical development of one optimized lead compound (i.e. the best of the primary or
secondary optimized leads). This aim will including in vitro safety pharmacology testing and end with non-
GLP dose-range finding studies in two species to determine tolerability and safety. The end result of this
project will be a preclinical candidate ready for IND-enabling studies, which will be a launch pad for subsequent
clinical research projects aimed at improving the quality of life for patients diagnosed with SYNGAP1-DEE."
10900046,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute pancreatitis, if it doesn’t resolve, can further develop into a chronic condition. Resulting chronic
pancreatitis is characterized by presence of inflammatory macrophages, fibrosis, and loss of acinar cells.
Moreover, it represents a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that
mediate the transition from acute to chronic pancreatitis are ill-defined, and efficient therapeutic treatment
methods for chronic pancreatitis are lacking. In this proposal, it is our hypothesis that Protein Kinase D1
primes acinar cells to produce factors that prevent acute pancreatitis from resolving and generates a
chronic condition. We further hypothesize that the resulting chronic pancreatitis can be targeted with
PKD inhibitors. To test this we will: Determine how PKD1 expression in acinar cells can generate an
environment that is favorable for developing chronic pancreatitis (Specific Aim 1); and utilize our acinar cell-
targeted animal models to determine the effects of PKD1 on development and resolution of chronic pancreatitis
(Specific Aim 2). Successful completion of this project will define the role of activated PKD1 in altering
pancreatic acinar cells in a way that they can facilitate the transition of acute pancreatitis to a chronic state. We
will define how these molecular changes affect cells in the pancreatic environment and the immune landscape
in the pancreas. Eventually, we will determine if inhibition of PKD1 in vivo can resolve chronic pancreatitis. This
will lay the groundwork of developing targeted treatment strategies for pancreatitis based on inhibition of PKD1
or downstream signaling events."

The Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) Core will play a pivotal role in the International URBAN Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Center as a full collaborator in study design, conduct, data management and statistical analyses. The overarching goal of the BDM Core is to facilitate the long-term conduct of rigorous, reproducible and innovative alcohol/HIV research. Over the next five years, the BDM Core will collaborate closely with International URBAN ARCH Center investigators by providing statistical expertise and effective data management to two research projects focused on understanding the role of alcohol use on TB acquisition, active disease, and lung disease after TB treatment among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in order to accelerate the future development of interventions that can reduce alcohol’s impact on TB-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH. The BDM Core will provide statistical and data management leadership in all phases of research to ensure high standards for data quality and statistical analyses. The BDM Core brings together an experienced team of investigators uniquely qualified to support the International URBAN ARCH Center based on their extensive knowledge of underlying scientific and clinical issues relevant to alcohol, HIV, and TB, and their long history of productive collaboration with URBAN ARCH investigators. Having this dedicated BDM Core will enhance the synergy and productivity of investigators, promote the validity and generalizability of the scientific findings, promote data sharing, and ultimately elevate the understanding of the impact of alcohol on the spectrum of TB infection among PLWH."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent and the leading cause of death in people with HIV (PWH). An estimated 8.5 million people with TB are cured every year but many do not return to full health. Up to half of those completing treatment for pulmonary TB have post-TB lung disease, a disabling under-diagnosed group of lung deficits. Lung deficits at TB treatment completion are the strongest predictors of post-TB lung disease severity up to a year later. Alcohol and HIV are associated with lung immune dysfunction and alcohol use is associated with delayed TB diagnosis, increasing the risk of lung injury during active TB disease. However, it is not known whether alcohol use is associated with post-TB lung disease in PWH. We hypothesize that hazardous drinking increases susceptibility to and worsens post-TB lung disease in PWH. Our objective is to investigate hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] ≥8) as a modifiable risk factor for post-TB lung disease in PWH. To achieve this, we propose an 18- month observational study of 200 PWH completing pulmonary TB treatment in Mbarara, Uganda. We will evaluate the following post-TB lung disease outcomes: functional exercise capacity (primary outcome assessed by 6-minute walk distance), lung physiology (pulmonary function tests), anatomy (CT scan), and lung infections. The primary exposure is past-year hazardous drinking. Secondary alcohol measures will include 30- day Timeline Followback (calendar-based method of alcohol use recall) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth; a biomarker of recent alcohol use). Our expertise spans alcohol use, HIV, TB, pulmonology, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Our primary aim (Aim 1a) is to determine the relationship between past-year hazardous drinking and post-TB lung disease. In Aim 1b we assess the association of past-month heavy drinking and post-TB lung disease progression over time. In Aim 1c we explore whether smoking modifies the association of past- month heavy drinking and post-TB lung disease progression over time. Heavy drinking in Aims 1b and 1c is defined by Timeline Followback as ≥7 drinks/week (women) or ≥14 drinks/week (men) or PEth>200 ng/mL. In Aim 2, we will qualitatively evaluate factors that can improve tailoring of pharmaco-behavioral alcohol and smoking interventions in PWH receiving TB treatment. We will conduct in-depth interviews with 24 PWH during or after TB treatment and 12 TB healthcare providers. IMPACT: We will determine the association of alcohol use and post-TB lung disease in PWH. Our quantitative and qualitative data will lay the foundation for future work to tailor alcohol and smoking interventions to improve long-term health in HIV/TB co-infection."
10904898,"Challenge. One of the most important challenge in biological science today is to elucidate the extent to which complex 
experiments, which measure hundreds of thousands of variables, can be analyzed to generate consistent and global signal when 
repeated, to identify local signal related to tissues, cancer types or population structure. 
Importantly, we must include the intrinsic diversity of variation across different studies and control for technical confounders as 
part of this task. 
Most measurements from high-dimensional biological experiments display variation arising both from biological sources, such 
as genes belonging to a different tissue or different positions in the brains. While some components reappear across multiple 
tissues, global biological signal is more likely than spurious signal to be reproducibly present in multiple tissues. Our challenge is 
to systematically and reliably identify the global biological factors, and estimate the signal specific to each study. 
Aims. In order to meet this challenge, we propose a novel concept that combines ideas from meta-analysis and statistical 
modeling dimension reduction. We posit that one can develop high-dimensional data reduction techniques that at the same 
time function as multi-study tools to extract consistent signal and local specific signal.This proposal develops statistical methods 
for identifying shared and study-specific signal across multiple cancer studies. In this work, it is crucial to understand the shared 
signal - here, gene co-expression shared across different cancer types - and the signal specific to each study. This proposal will 
pilot this concept by building novel classes of multi-logistic regression and factor analysis methods. The key is to decompose 
data from each study into latent dimensions, some of which are global while some are not and only specific to a local signal. 
This will simultaneously achieve two goals: learning reproducible biological features shared among studies, and identifying the 
variation specific of each study. Specific aims include methodology design, software development and applications. 
Impact. The concepts, approaches, and software tools generated by this research will have a direct impact on the ability of the 
biomedical community to reproducibly identify stable signals across multiple high-throughput biology studies and to capture 
local signals. Our tools will also enable a more reliable identification of artifacts and thus facilitate more efficient experimental 
designs and guide technological development. We also hope to impact data sciences beyond genomics. Our study will be the 
first opportunity to evaluate the novel concept of sharing latent factors as well as estimating local latent structures. The 
proposed work could subsequently provide the inspiration, as well and the practical foundation, for expanding this concept to a 
variety of another dimension reduction and machine learning techniques."
10904925,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Previous studies show discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indian (AI) 
populations and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations for studying AIs due 
to the small sample sizes for AI populations. Data collected by Cherokee Nation (CN) Health Survey provides 
an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AIs since the sample size is large and the survey contains 
extensive information. However, the CN Health Survey focused only on CN citizens who used CN clinics, and 
thus the sample may suffer from sampling, coverage, and nonresponse errors without further proper 
adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hamper the analysis of AI populations in health and behavior research. 
Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability 
samples can reduce sampling, coverage, and nonresponse errors in the original non-probability sample. The 
Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis 
specifically tailored to health and behavior research and disseminate the methodology to local stakeholders. 
In recent years, we have: 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) 
investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 
3) assembled an experienced multi-disciplinary team of experts. 
In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: 
Aim 1. Develop and evaluate our proposed novel data integration approaches using machine learning 
and propensity score modeling by real data. 
We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data 
types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods 
such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data 
source and expands the impact of Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration 
method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability samples, which can 
provide in-depth understanding regarding AI population-based health and behavior studies. 
Aim2. Develop county-level small area estimation (SAE) models and examine the association of SAE 
estimates with county-level geographic and health related environmental information. 
We will compare the estimates based on SAE with direct estimates obtained in Aim 1. Multi-level model will be 
built to examine the association between health-related outcomes with county-level geographic and 
environmental factors. 
Aim 3. Disseminate our research products to local and national stakeholders. 
After CN IRB approval, we will disseminate our proposed methods, usage of our data files, and Computational 
Codes (e.g. SAS macros and/or R packages) to local and national stakeholders through workshops, trainings, 
conferences, and meetings."
10904976,"ABSTRACT – Path Core
The Pathology Core will provide services to this proposal essential to the success of the projects.
The Core will leverage existing technologies and infrastructure in Uganda and Tanzania as well
as CWRU to provide reliable diagnoses of prospective project enrollees. The Pathology Core
facilities include state of the art slide scanners which have been installed at the two African
Pathology coordinating centers. The scanners are part of a large multi-institutional continent-wide
program organized by the American Pathology of Clinical Pathology to improve surgical pathology
diagnostic standards in Africa through a program of targeted infrastructure development. This
program has enabled both teaching for faculty and residents in pathology diagnostics as well as
facilitating pathology consultations across the globe. The slide scanning system and software are
robust and user friendly. The program has been extremely successful and has been extensively
implemented – linking multiple pathology departments in Africa to departments throughout the US
and Europe. The design of the Core will facilitate rapid turnaround of pathology diagnoses through
consensus. The two African center Pathology Leaders have extensive experience in the
presentation of a host of non-cancerous lesions of the lung. This experience compliments that of
Dr Willis, the Pathology Core Leader at CWRU, with his extensive experience in diagnostic
oncology. The CWRU Pathology Core Center also has extensive experience in digital slide
imaging management and translational research having extensive engagement with the CWRU
Center for Computational Imaging & Personalized Diagnostics. Central to the mission of the core
is standardization of diagnoses through teaching and cross center engagement. This will include
cross visits by Drs Willis and Lukande. The core will also engage in important technology transfer
of the technique of immunohistochemistry to both main sites in Africa. Immunohistochemistry is
fundamental to modern diagnostic pathology and a pillar of diagnostic accuracy especially in
oncology. Techniques to be introduced are designed to be used in low / middle resource centers
and are flexible so that incremental additions to immunohistochemical panels can be performed
with only minimal expenditures. The primary objective of the Core is to provide a resource that
contributes significantly to the translational goals and endpoints of the individual projects, to
facilitate cooperation between the three sites and to identify areas of potential further expansion
of oncology–related translational research."
10904951,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although evidence-based treatments (EBTs) have been developed for childhood behavior problems, many
families do not have access to these services. Barriers to access include local availability of services,
transportation, cost, and perceived stigma. In this project, we aim to test the effectiveness of a mobile health
(mHealth) system as a standalone versus coach-assisted intervention with the goal of achieving reach and
scalability. The project will consist of an RCT to study the effectiveness of an mHealth system called UseIt!
(Utilizing Skills to Enhance the Impact of Treatment) to deliver treatment remotely and promote the use of
parent management training (PMT) skills and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills. UseIt! is part of the
growing field of digital therapeutics, based on the concept that electronic devices can enhance health
outcomes and reduce costs. Parents of children (ages 5-8) with disruptive behaviors (N = 324 dyads) will be
randomly assigned to Group 1 (standalone app; n = 108), Group 2 (coach-assisted app; n = 108), or Group 3
(control app; n = 108). The outcome assessments (post-treatment and 6-month follow-up) will include
measures of target engagement (PMT/CBT skill acquisition and utilization) and symptom reduction. This RCT
takes an experimental therapeutics approach and is designed to measure target engagement to determine
whether target engagement is associated with symptom reduction. The targets are PMT/CBT skill acquisition
and utilization. Skill deficits in these domains are understood as key maintaining factors for serious disruptive
behavior problems. Aim 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UseIt! mHealth system as both a standalone
and coach-assisted intervention compared to a control app condition. Aim 2 is to assess target (PMT/CBT skill
acquisition and utilization) engagement and validation. Aim 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
components of the UseIt! mHealth system. The project has the potential to make an impact on both scientific
knowledge and clinical practice. In terms of scientific knowledge, the project has the potential to expand our
understanding of target mechanisms. By incorporating reliable and valid measures of the treatment targets, the
project will be informative regardless of the clinical outcome. In terms of clinical practice, digital therapeutics
has the potential to enhance the reach and scalability of skills-based psychosocial interventions. Even small
effects can be meaningful on a population level if the intervention can be delivered easily on a large scale at
low cost. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure “that all children have the chance to achieve
their full potential for healthy and productive lives.”"
10904955,"Risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) onset dramatically increases during adolescence, particularly for girls.
There is a vital need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MDD risk to improve early risk detection and
targeted preventions. The stress generation model posits interpersonal stress generation (I-StressGen) as a
mechanism of risk and proposes that youth with preexisting MDD vulnerabilities actively contribute to the
occurrence of interpersonal stressful life events in their lives (i.e., I-StressGen), which in turn exacerbates their
risk for MDD. Although the impact of I-StressGen on prospective MDD risk in adolescents is well-established,
the precise mechanisms contributing to I-StressGen remain unclear. Self-report research indicates increased
affective reactivity during negative social interactions as a promising mechanism contributing to I-StressGen,
though this has not been directly tested. The underlying neural mechanisms of I-StressGen also remain
unexamined, despite work suggesting that greater social stress is associated with aberrant activation in
corticolimbic regions during tasks probing response to negative social interactions. Therefore, the overarching
goal of the proposed study is to obtain a fine-grained, mechanistic understanding of the role of brain and
behavioral affective reactivity during negative social interactions as it relates to I-StressGen and subsequent
MDD risk in female adolescents. The proposed study will enroll a risk-enhanced sample of 90 female adolescents
(ages 13-15) and will utilize neuroimaging (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine brain
and behavior indices of socio-affective reactivity as predictors of I-StressGen and depression symptoms across
a multi-wave one year follow-up. In doing so, the current study will test whether affective reactivity during negative
social interactions at the neural (Aim 1) and real-world behavioral (Aim 2) level prospectively predicts I-
StressGen, and whether I-StressGen mediates the relation between this socio-affective reactivity and
prospective increases in female adolescents’ depression symptoms (Aim 3). The proposed study and parallel
training plan will allow the Candidate to build upon her current expertise in adolescent stress and MDD risk and
develop new skills in four key areas: (1) fMRI, (2) EMA, (3) advanced statistical multilevel modeling, and (4)
professional development. The rich academic environment at the University of Illinois at Chicago coupled with
the collective expertise of the Candidate’s mentorship team in fMRI methodology, developmental affective
neuroscience, EMA, and advanced statistical techniques will facilitate successful implementation of the proposed
study and training plan. The acquisition of these skills will be integral to launching the Candidate’s independent
career as a translational scientist focused on delineating brain-behavioral mechanisms of adolescent MDD risk
within the context of real-world interpersonal stress. Results from this study will inform the development of future
grants focused on characterizing socio-affective brain and behavior mechanisms and aberrant developmental
trajectories contributing to the emergence of maladaptive stress processes and MDD onset in adolescence."
10904709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide disproportionately affects American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, with the greatest
burden experienced by AI/AN children and adolescents. A paucity of mental health care resources in AI/AN
settings points to a critical need to deliver suicide prevention interventions outside conventional mental health
clinical settings. Past research has shown cultural protective factor approaches will be more effective than risk-
focused interventions to reduce AI/AN youth suicide. Culturally grounded (or “ground up”) prevention
interventions—which place local culture and values at the forefront of intervention design, implementation, and
evaluation—hold strong promise to prevent AI/AN youth suicide. However, we know little about core
components, mechanisms, and constructs through which culturally grounded interventions can prevent suicide.
The Elders’ Resilience Curriculum (ERC) is a school-based, culturally grounded, suicide prevention
intervention currently delivered by White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) Elders through monthly lessons
about tribal cultural values, beliefs, ways of life, and Apache language to youth ages 9-14, a nascent stage
prior to the highest risk period for suicide (15-24 years old) in this community. The proposed research builds
upon the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health and WMAT’s 35+ year research and public health
partnership that continues to innovate and scale prevention interventions through community-based
participatory research. The candidate will engage with the tribal-university partners to conduct an Exploratory
Sequential Mixed Methods study to identify key suicide protective factors and ERC core components that
target these factors, refine a theoretical model specifying causal mechanisms and outcomes, develop a
culturally adapted assessment battery, and pilot a rigorous evaluation to test the theoretical model and
culturally adapted measures to prepare for a larger R01 effectiveness study. If successful, new understanding
of the mechanisms and constructs through which ERC operates to prevent AI/AN youth suicide will support
replication and scaling of this intervention to other AI/AN communities suffering youth suicide disparities. The
proposed K01 will provide the candidate, who is from the Cherokee/Seminole Nations, with critical training in
qualitative and mixed methods research, culturally grounded intervention design and evaluation, and
child/adolescent development as it relates to resiliency, cultural identity, and suicide prevention. The candidate
will receive guidance and targeted training from a mentorship team of national experts at the forefront of
Indigenous mental health prevention science. This K01 award will support her to become an Indigenous NIMH
independent investigator focused on culturally-informed, strengths-based mental health promotion research.
The proposed research and candidate’s career goals align with NIMH Strategic Objective 4 to “strengthen the
public health impact of NIMH-supported research” and “identify, validate, and scale-up innovative programs
currently in use that improve mental health services for underserved populations” (4.1)."
10904711,"Project Summary/Abstract
Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular degradative process that is intimately connected to the
process of aging. Autophagy maintains cell health and homeostasis through the delivery of potentially cytotoxic
cargo to the lysosome through the de novo formation of the double membrane autophagosome.
This process is impaired with increased age. Furthermore, deletion of the core autophagy genes has been
shown in multiple organisms to decrease lifespan, while rescue experiments conversely restore a full lifespan.
Autophagy is especially critical in maintaining the health of long-lived neurons, and defects in autophagy result
in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s Disease, Alzheimer’s Disease, and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. Autophagy protein ATG2 is essential to this process and tissue-specific ablation of this protein
results in decreased lifetime, motility, and age-related tissue deterioration. We recently demonstrated that
ATG2 is a lipid transfer protein with a novel structure that allows for bulk lipid delivery. This activity is essential
for autophagosome biogenesis. I predict that ATG2 delivers lipids directly into the nascent autophagosome to
expand the growing membrane. As-of-yet, the identity of the lipid-donating organelle is not known. Intriguingly,
a mechanism to deliver a net transfer of lipids in one direction is without clear precedent in mammalian biology.
As this mechanism likely depends on the biophysical properties of both membranes, I propose to formally
identify the donor membrane from which ATG2 extracts lipids. This project is designed to provide the training
necessary to achieve a future career in independent research. Furthermore, as this project will elucidate
the membrane source for this critical age-delaying cell biological process, this body of research will identify
key regulators of autophagy that represent additional methods of age-related therapeutic intervention.
In this proposal, I seek to understand the mechanism by which ATG2 delivers a net transfer of lipids into the
autophagosome by addressing three main questions. First, what is the donor membrane for autophagosome
biogenesis? I propose to leverage the non-biased and high resolution APEX strategy of proximity labeling with
live cell fluorescent microscopy to formally identify the donor membrane. Strikingly, preliminary data reveal that
ATG2 resides at ER exit sites (ERES) during autophagosome biogenesis, a highly specialized subdomain of
the ER. Second, does ATG2 lipid transfer possess intrinsic directionality, or does it rely upon local membrane
energetics? I have developed two in vitro lipid transfer assays to mimic the ERES-autophagosome contact site,
through which I can assess the directionality and specificity of lipid transfer through bulk-ensemble
measurement and by visual examination. Third, how is ATG2 recruited to the donor membrane? Following
identification of the donor membrane, I can now systematically assess ATG2 recruitment through a
combination of biochemical and cell biological techniques. This proposed study will further elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of healthy aging through the identification of a key player in autophagy."
10901600,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial energetic dysfunction is implicated in many common human diseases, including conditions
impacting the liver such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
liver failure. The precise consequences of loss of mitochondrial energetics in the mammalian liver are largely
unknown. To date our understanding of the roles of mitochondrial complex V (mCV), or ATP synthase, has arisen
primarily from in vitro cultured cells or yeast studies. These seminal results revealed structural and functional
insights into mCV’s role, but are unable to clearly delineate the physiologic effects of mitochondrial energy
dysfunction. Our lab has developed a new mouse model that conditionally deletes a core subunit of mCV and
ablates the ATP synthesis activity of the mitochondria. This model will enable us to study pure mitochondrial
energy dysfunction in any organ system, and in particular this proposal aims to determine effects of mitochondrial
energy dysfunction in the adult murine liver. To accomplish this, a combination of isotope tracing mass
spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, specialized mitochondrial respiratory assays, electron microscopy,
next generation sequencing and mouse physiology studies will be used. The specific aims of this proposal intend
to 1) understand the mitochondrial structural and functional consequences of mCV disruption in liver and 2)
determine the contributions of mitochondrial ATP to liver and whole body homeostasis. The findings of this
proposal will provide insights into basic mitochondrial biology and the pathophysiology of common liver diseases."

(HF) disparities persist in the US despite decades of research and national public health campaigns.
The role of social determinants of health (SDH) like structural racism in health disparities has been
studied in only 1% of published work. Few studies of SDH have taken a life course perspective related
to risk of CHD and HF. The ability to recover after the stress of an acute health event, or resilience, is
an important patient-centered outcome, but the influence of SDH on resilience is unknown. Few past
studies have examined both structural and intermediary SDH in the World Health Organization's (WHO)
Commission on SDH (WHOCSD) conceptual framework in a longitudinal national sample with
rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF endpoints, which is one of the aims of this application. We propose
a series of studies to fill these gaps, while also providing rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF events
and causes of death to a host of investigators interested in using these data (to date, over 500 have
used these data). We build on a track record of mentoring to propose a formal year-long career
development program for early-stage investigators (ESI), especially underrepresented minorities
(URM). The specific aims of this application are to: (Aim 1) conduct studies examining underlying
mechanisms of health disparities, guided by the WHOCSD conceptual framework, in three thematic
areas: a) the incidence and recurrence of CHD; b) the incidence and recurrence of HF with preserved
ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction; c) reserve and resilience after an incident or
recurrent CHD or HF event. (Aim 2) To continue to adjudicate CHD events, HF hospitalizations, and
causes of death to support a wide range of studies by investigators beyond our group, and to link the
cohort with Medicare data to support investigators conducting health services utilization studies. (Aim 3)
To support the development of researchers in CVD health equity, especially URMs, through a new
mentored research program for a cohort of early stage investigators, including analytic and statistical
support and an annual 2-day Health Equity Research Summer Institute of presentations, training, mock
study section, and networking. Early stage investigators will graduate with specific competencies in
CVD health equity research. The proposed grant will inform policy, advocacy, and the design of
interventions by generating new evidence on which SDH and disparities in health services lead to
population-level disparities in incident and recurrent CHD and HF, and on resilience in recovery after a
CHD or HF event. Our multidisciplinary team includes epidemiologists, sociologists, health services
researchers, biostatisticians, clinicians, and a participant Advisory Board, assuring rigor and relevance
of the proposed research. Continued funding for the REGARDS-MI infrastructure will support a host of
additional studies led by an expanding group of investigators. Funding will also expand the cadre of researchers dedicated to discovering strategies to achieve health equity for all US adults, a goal
supported by NHLBI, the National Academy of Sciences, the CDC, the American Heart Association,
and all major professional societies in the US."
10872783,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
An evolving concept that contributes to our understanding of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) or androgen receptor (AR) antagonists in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is the ability of cells to
evade AR blockade and turn on compensatory hormone receptor signaling for survival. Preclinical and
clinical studies by us and others have demonstrated that induction of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
expression confers resistance to AR-targeted therapy. Elegant studies by others in the hormone
receptors field have shown that posttranslational modifications (PTM) on nuclear hormone receptors can
amplify or alter their canonical activity to favor cancer cell survival or drug resistance. One such PTM is,
phosphorylation. We published that pan-AKT inhibition blocks GR induction/activity and overcomes GR-
mediated resistance to AR-targeted therapy (ARi). We observed this in a setting of both ligand-dependent
and ligand-independent GR signaling. Furthermore, preliminary proteomics studies show that GR
phosphorylation is expressed with progression to castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) and increases
significantly in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. This increase also correlated with an increase in AKT1
expression. We found that AKT1 is directly bound to GR, which validates the finding by others.
Pharmacologic inhibition specific for AKT1 or knockdown of AKT1 significantly decreased pGR(s134) but
not total GR. In addition, inhibition of AKT1 inhibited pGR(s134) expression in the nucleus with or without
ligand. When cells were exposed to a GR-specific modulator (GRM), CORT134, in combination with
enzalutamide and the presence/absence of ligands, we only observed suppression of cell proliferation in
CRPC but not very effective in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. Conversely, AKT1 inhibition decreased
pGR(s134) in the nucleus, with/without ligand, and was also associated with inhibition of cell proliferation.
Phospho-site mutation on pGR(s134) was also associated with suppressed cell proliferation. Our central
hypothesis is that induction of oncogenic GR in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC is modulated by PTM on
GR, and inhibition of pGR, would re-sensitize treatment-resistant CRPC to enzalutamide. We will test our
central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the following specific aims:
(i) Characterize ligand-dependent driven GR vs. PTM-driven GR expression and activity in patient-
derived xenograft models using multi-omic assays, (ii) Perform functional studies to determine the
mechanism of PTM driven GR vs. ligand-dependent GR activity in lethal PCa (iii) Determine the
therapeutic efficacy and benefit of targeting AKT-GR-AR as a novel therapeutic approach for lethal
prostate cancers. Impact: The results from this study will significantly expand our knowledge of the
mechanism of PTMs in advanced PCa and the role their unique signatures play in disease progression
and resistance to AR and/or GR targeted therapy. Currently, clinical trials are testing the therapeutic
effects of ARi with GRM or ARi with AKT1-specific inhibitors in PCa. Our findings will be of immediate
clinical relevance as they would guide what stage patients with advanced disease would benefit from
GRMs and at what stage alternative approaches (targeting GR PTMs) be used in GR-driven lethal
disease."
10872726,"Project Summary
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading yet largely preventable cause of childhood blindness globally.
There is an unmet need for timely and consistent diagnosis of treatment-required ROP, such as plus disease of
ROP. A deep learning-based diagnostic tool would be advantageous to reduce the dependence on clinical
expertise during the diagnostic phase. However, there are two significant challenges in training deep learning-
based approaches. The first challenge is that the performance of deep learning-based diagnosis is hindered by
limited data availability in the training phase. The size of the training data set directly influences training efficiency
and the ability to generalize. Since premature babies are vulnerable populations, images from these babies are
inherently limited and insufficient to cover all potential scenarios of ROP for training. The second challenge is
the variation in image quality due to differences in acquisition systems. The differences in quality data sets will
impact the deep learning model. They will likely fail to produce accurate diagnoses due to the lack of alignment
between the training data and data acquired from other platforms. Therefore, there is a great need for new
methods and technology to increase the training set and improve or normalize the image quality to develop a
diagnostic deep learning model for ROP. To address this critical unmet clinical need, we have developed
technology to augment the training dataset using animal-to-human (A2H) translated images and implement
quality control by cross-platform retinal image standardization process (CRISP). In this study, we will
demonstrate that our A2H translated images will exhibit retinal vascular patterns of plus disease of ROP. These
translated images can be used to train the deep learning-based ROP diagnostic model. We will demonstrate that
our CRISP model can resolve the difference between different imaging acquisition systems and/or overall image
quality. We will evaluate the impact of quality control on the performance of ROP diagnosis. Specific Aim 1 is to
optimize and test an animal-to-human model using an existing retinal image dataset. Specific Aim 2 is to acquire
a robust set of longitudinal animal ROP images using two animal models and three different imaging platforms
and manually annotate the images for the training. Specific Aim 3 is to develop and test a CRISP model on
quality control. Specific Aim 4 is to validate the A2H model to diagnose ROP and evaluate the combination of
A2H and CRISP as a universal tool to improve learning performance. Our proposed method could potentially
improve the diagnosis of ROP. Furthermore, our innovative approach of using animal data to enhance human
studies could also be applied to other clinical studies where human data and clinical labeling resources are
limited. Finally, our quality control tool that can standardize the image quality will allow opportunities for more
robust image analysis and potentially applicable in telemedicine."

10881904,"Despite four decades of study, major gaps remain in our understanding of key molecular and cellular processes that orchestrate the action of the RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease during antigen receptor (AgR) gene assembly by V(D)J recombination. V(D)J recombination occurs in focal regions of RAG binding in AgR loci known as recombination centers (RCs) but virtually nothing is known about the composition or organizing principles of RCs. Our recent findings demonstrate that recombinase function is modulated by nuclear compartmentalization of RAG1 and that RAG1's large N-terminal region (NTR) controls RAG activity, trafficking, chromatin binding, gene segment repertoire, and interaction with a newly discovered recombination factor, Spin1. However, RAG nuclear cell biology is poorly understood and the RAG1 NTR is largely a black box, with almost no understanding of its structure, the residues that mediate its many functions, or how it works together with the remainder of the RAG enzyme. Indeed, no structures are available for the holo-RAG complex, severely limiting insight into cooperation between the catalytic and regulatory domains. The central objective of our proposed experiments is to fill these gaps in understanding through a systematic dissection of RCs and RAG nuclear cell biology, the function of the RAG1 NTR, and the structure of the holo-RAG-nucleosome complex. We will use complementary biochemical, imaging, molecular, structural, and genetic approaches to achieve the following aims:
Aim 1. Delineate RAG nuclear cell biology and the contribution of the RAG1 NTR. Our findings reveal a repressive association of RAG1 with nucleoli and repositioning of RAG1 adjacent to nuclear speckles when recombination is activated. We will systematically characterize RAG nuclear compartmentalization, function, and entry into RCs, determine how each parameter is controlled by binding partners and the RAG1 NTR, and establish the physiological role of RAG1 nucleolar association in a novel RAG1 mutant mouse. Aim 2. Determine components of and regulatory mechanisms in RCs. We will identify the components of RCs using in vivo proximity labeling and quantitative proteomics, establish the mechanism by which Spin1 interacts with RAG1 and stimulates recombination, and determine how the RAG1 NTR dictates gene segment repertoire through control of the balance between short- and long-range modes of recombination. Aim 3. Determine the structural basis of holo-RAG-nucleosome interactions. Building on extensive preliminary data, we will use: i) X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a RAG1 NTR fragment free and bound to histone tails; ii) cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of RAG1/2 bound to DNA and the nucleosome core particle; and iii) cryo-electron tomography to determine the structure of holo­ RAG bound to chromatin in situ in the nucleus-thereby providing unprecedented insight into the quaternary structure of RAG, its mechanism of recruitment to chromatin, and the function of its regulatory domains."
10881907,"Abstract
Elucidating the coding potential of the genome has benefited from accurate genome sequences and extensive
transcriptome sequencing to allow detailed models for protein-coding sequences (CDSs) or open reading frames
(ORFs). Although at least one reliable full-length transcript model has been assigned for every protein-coding
gene, the majority of alternative isoforms remains uncharacterized due to i) vast differences of expression levels
between isoforms expressed from common genes, and ii) the difficulty of obtaining full-length (FL) transcript
sequences. Furthermore, there remains a large discrepancy between the total number of transcripts in
annotation databases and the number for which there is an annotated FL transcript with experimental evidence.
The spectrum of encoded transcripts comprises a vast but finite “isoform-space” with multiple dimensions: i)
genes, ii) tissues and cell types, iii) development and time iv) disease, and v) response to stimuli. Just as
expression levels vary across cells and tissues, so can the relative abundance of alternatively spliced transcripts.
Full, functional understanding of the human genome will not be possible without empirical knowledge and
complete annotation of the entire complement of encoded functional proteins.
Historically, gene annotation was supported predominantly by ESTs and mRNAs from INSDC databases while
automated approaches to annotation are being applied to whole genomes and transcriptomes. However, current
automated annotation does not provide the same quality data as does manual annotation. Sensitivity and
specificity are reduced, less functional annotation is captured, and all automated methods lack the capacity of a
manual annotator to introduce additional orthogonal data types and interpretation of the scientific literature, but
manual annotation is highly labor-intensive. GENCODE release v36 represents the interpretation of nearly 10
million EST, cDNA and protein homologies. Given the anticipated volumes of data, with single experiments
producing more data than the entire INSDC catalogue, current methods of manual annotation do not scale. The
emergence of long transcriptomic sequencing methods provides for the replacement of historical data types to
the benefit of gene and transcript annotation. However, the massively greater data volumes already being
deposited in public data archives exceed manual curation capability, demanding implementation of automated
solutions without compromising annotation quality. Furthermore, as untargeted sequencing approaches are very
inefficient in their discovery of less abundant transcripts, the majority of sequence data generated gives us very
little insight into discoverable transcript diversity. To overcome these challenges, our two respective groups have
joined forces to increase the catalog of fully experimentally verified full length human protein-coding transcripts.
This proposal focuses on the integration of experimental approaches that will provide a comprehensive
enumeration of human protein-coding transcripts, a “Reference Human Transcriptome” with the development of
an automated annotation pipeline to allow the integration of this resource into GENCODE gene annotation."

Depression and anxiety (common mental disorders, CMD’s) are the leading contributors to health burden in
adolescents worldwide and are associated with adverse outcomes1,2. In Pakistan, the reported prevalence
estimates of emotional problems in school going adolescents range between 25%- 35%3,4. Schools have been
identified as a scalable platform to bridge the treatment gap for adolescent mental health5,6. However, in
Pakistan, no formal system for school-based programs to promote youth mental health exists. To address this
unmet need, a President’s Program to Promote Mental Health of Pakistanis, an ambitious plan to scale-up the
school based mental health programs to the entire country, was initiated7,8. Under the umbrella of the President’s
program and through our NIMH U19 Global Mental Health Research Hub, SHINE (School Health Implementation
Network: Eastern Mediterranean Region), we 1) adapted and feasibility tested the WHO School Mental Health
Program (SMHP)9 into an online teachers’ training program (Enhanced School Mental Health Program [eSMHP],
www.learnwithshine.org) and 2) supported the development and feasibility testing of the Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT) based, WHO STARS (Sustainable Technology for Adolescent to Reduce Stress) self-help chat-
bot to address the symptoms of CMDs in adolescents studying in low resource public schools of Pakistan10.
Pilot implementation of eSMHP and STARS has identified a need to integrate these interventions into a stepped
care package and to determine their optimal delivery sequence to address heterogeneity in the presentation and
progression of CMDs’ symptoms over time, and to ensure cost-effective implementation at-scale. Therefore, the
aim of the ‘SMART-STEP study’ is to investigate the effectiveness of eSMHP (low intensity and least resource
intensive treatment) (vs. Treatment as Usual-TAU) as a front-line treatment to improve the symptoms of
depression in adolescents, and STARS self-help chat-bot as an augmentation tactic (second-line treatment) to
address early signs of non-response to the eSMHP and TAU. By using Sequential Multiple Assignment
Randomized Trial (SMART) design to compare the timing and dosage of these intervention strategies, we will
answer ‘what works, for whom, under what conditions and why for adolescent depression’ in public schools of
Pakistan. We hypothesize that adolescents who receive the eSMHP will show improved symptoms of depression
compared to TAU, and among non-responding adolescents, augmenting eSMHP with the STARS self-help chat-
bot (vs. continue with the initial intervention) will improve symptoms of depression from baseline to 9-months.
We will begin our work by establishing an External Advisory Committee, consulting stakeholders and engaging
young people to guide project implementation. Next, the SMART-STEP trial will investigate the (cost)
effectiveness of stepped care package. These research aims are aligned with my research career development
plans to become a global mental health expert in optimizing interventions for adolescents with CMDs in low-
income communities and are supported by a highly experienced team of co-investigators and consultants."

 Bilateral loss of vestibular sensation is disabling, with affected individuals suffering chronic disequilibrium,
increased risk of falls, and inability to maintain stable vision during head movements typical of daily life. Most
individuals with mild or moderate loss compensate through rehabilitative strategies enlisting other senses;
however, those with severe loss who fail to compensate have no good therapeutic options. For older
individuals who are already contending with decreases in vision, proprioception and other systems that
normally contribute to maintaining balance, lack of compensatory reserve can make loss of vestibular
sensation even more impactful. Fortunately, when the vestibular nerves are anatomically intact, as is true in
most such cases, electrical stimuli encoding head rotation can artificially drive nerve activity to partially restore
vestibular sensation, much as a cochlear implant partially restores auditory sensation. In the first-in-human
early feasibility study designed to test the safety and efficacy of long-term prosthetic vestibular nerve
stimulation as a sensory restoration treatment, we performed unilateral vestibular implantation in 8 adults aged
51-66 years old who had been disabled for 2-23 years by bilateral vestibular hypofunction. We found that
vestibular implantation and 24 hr/day motion-modulated prosthetic stimulation targeting the three implanted
semicircular canals drives directionally-aligned vestibulo-ocular reflexes, improves objective measures of
posture and gait, and improves patient-reported dizziness handicap and vestibular-related disability. However,
we do not yet know whether this sensory-restoration treatment will work well in older adults, who are thought to
have greater difficultly adapting to asymmetry in input from the two vestibular labyrinths. Drawing on an
established design, experienced study team and protocol that have already yielded highly impactful results in
the existing study of younger subjects, the proposed research will extend this approach to older adults disabled
by bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Results are very likely to yield sustained impact, by clarifying the relative
risks and benefits of this intervention in older adults and by providing data that can inform decisions by
regulators, policy-makers and third-party payers regarding whether older adults disabled by bilateral vestibular
loss should have access to vestibular implantation."

that contribute to development and progression of most cardiovascular (CV) diseases, as well as the end stage
clinical consequences of these diseases and how to better treat or prevent them. A central premise of this T32
Basic and Translational Cardiovascular Research Training Program (CVTP) is that these diseases are extremely
complex, and that rigorous study of them requires trainees to have a strong foundation of knowledge of basic
CV physiology, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, epigenetics, pathology, systems
biology, biomedical engineering, and other disciplines. A major strength of our CVTP is that we have 40
outstanding clinical, translational, and basic science mentors representing these areas, and have built a unique
training program over the past several decades that integrates mentoring talents into producing the best trained
CV scientists possible. Our goal is to provide pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees the necessary knowledge,
intellectual capabilities, technical skills, passion, and problem-solving abilities to conduct outstanding state-of-
the-art CV research employing a wide range of powerful and innovative approaches. Support is requested for 8
pre- and 7 post-doctoral fellows who represent a small fraction of a much larger cohort of CVTP trainees who
are working in mentor laboratories. The program is led by co-PIs Drs. Gary K. Owens and Brant Isakson, as well
as two talented Associate Directors Drs. Coleen McNamara and Shayn Peirce-Cottler who are all exceptional
CV researchers and mentors. Pre-doctoral trainees are selected from a large pool of outstanding trainees initially
recruited into an umbrella biomedical sciences (BIMS) graduate program or the UVA MD/PhD (NIH MST)
Program, whereas post-doctoral candidates are largely recruited by individual mentor labs or from one of several
clinical residency-fellowship programs. After completing a highly innovative BIMS 6000 core course in integrated
biology in year 01, CVTP pre-doctoral trainees take elective modular courses that are customized based on their
interests and degree program. They also complete three lab rotations to aid in selection of a mentor. Only
trainees who have already selected a CVTP mentor are eligible for appointment. All trainees are required to take
our signature CVTP advanced courses including BIMS 8052-3 (Advanced Vascular Biology) and BIMS 8064 (a
trainee-run Careers/Professionalism Course), and are also required to attend our weekly research seminars,
monthly research in progress sessions, bi-annual research retreats, and to complete biomedical ethics training.
The CVTP also has an exceptional grant writing program including an annual workshop and approximately 20
annual grant brewing sessions. There are many indices of the success of this program including: 1) many former
CVTG trainees being leaders in their field; 2) current CVTG trainees publishing many high impact first author
papers and having a 48% success rate in securing extramural fellowships upon first submission; and 3) 90% of
trainees who have completed training the last 10 years have secured high quality permanent research positions."
10893017,"Between 1999 and 2018 more than 446,000 people died from profoundly slow and shallow breathing after opioid
overdose. This number grows at a faster rate each year and in 2019 there were nearly 50,000 overdose deaths.
Opioids are perhaps the most effective analgesic, therefore, despite concern, they will persist as a staple therapy
in medicine and within our society into the future. Thus, novel solutions to safely use opioids must be developed.
But to discover these, we must first understand the key cellular and molecular mechanisms for opioid depression
of breathing, known as opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD).
Recently we demonstrated that opioids depress breathing mostly through their action upon µ-opioid receptor
(MOR) expressing neurons in the same site where the breathing rhythm is created, the preBötzinger Complex
(preBötC). In this proposal, a central goal is to define the key preBötC neural type and MOR signaling pathway(s)
that cause OIRD. Results from both aims will have direct clinical and therapeutic impact. Here, we hypothesize
that opioids cause OIRD by blocking synaptic vesicle release from just 140 MOR+ excitatory preBötC neurons.
Additionally, we expect that these same neurons, despite being less than 10% of preBötC, are specialized for
creating the pace of breathing in general, analogous to the cardiac pacemaker cells. If so, these will be the first
neurons identified with such an important purpose. This is the second central goal of the proposal. To test these
three hypotheses, we have designed a sophisticated intersectional genetic approach to selectively delete MOR
in adult mice from either excitatory or inhibitory preBötC neurons or nearby upper airway motor neurons to then
compare if and how much OIRD changes. Next, we will use a sensitive in vitro system to uniformly test the
necessity of each primary MOR signaling pathway in suppressing preBötC rhythmicity. And last, we will use an
intersectional genetic approach to measure changes in breathing after acutely, ectopically silencing the preBötC
MOR+ excitatory neurons.
The identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of OIRD will establish a framework for future studies
to develop novel pharmacological approaches to block or rescue it. Moreover, this proposal aims to determine if
MOR+ excitatory neurons are pacemakers for breathing. If so, we will have identified, perhaps, some of the most
vital neurons in the brain."

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause severe diseases in humans (COVID-
19) that presents a major threat for global public health. Since it was first reported in 12/2019, COVID-19 has
become a pandemic that continues to spread, with >246 million confirmed cases and >5 million deaths as of
11/02/2021. In addition to the human tragedy, the magnitude of the pandemic-driven implosion of global
economies is enormous. Although vaccines are now available, their efficacy appears to be reduced with
spreading viral strains. Remdesivir is the only approved antiviral targeting SARS-CoV-2, but it has little effect on
COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, it is critical to identify and develop additional antivirals to combat viral infection.
 The following strong preliminary data enable targeting of SARS-CoV-2: 1) Construction of an extensive
collection of SARS-CoV-2 replicon systems that enable cutting-edge, rapid, and economical high-throughput
screening. 2) Preparation of cell lines that stably express SARS-CoV-2 replicon. 3) Preliminary screening of
chemical libraries led to the discovery of a novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, which has already been improved with
one round of optimization through medicinal chemistry efforts. 4) Multiplex visualization of single-genomic or
subgenomic (+) or (-) SARS-CoV-2 RNA and simultaneously viral and/or host proteins in individual infected cells.
5) Cutting-edge rapid high-throughput infectious virus BSL3 assays that enable kinetic, mechanistic, drug
resistance studies. 6) In-house cloning expression and purification of 10 SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins
(nsps). 7) Biochemical and biophysical assays to measure the enzymatic activities of several SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 nsp proteins and to measure compound binding to nsps.
 We hypothesize that our recently developed replicon systems can be used for the discovery of anti-SARS-
CoV-2 hits, which upon hit-to-lead optimization can become COVID-19 drug candidates. To address this
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
1. Use of SARS-CoV-2 replicon plasmid systems and SARS-CoV-2 replicon-expressing cell lines to screen
 chemical libraries for antiviral hits.
2. Inhibition and resistance studies with prioritized inhibitors.
3. Hit-to-lead optimization
 These studies will lead to antivirals with strong potency and pharmacokinetic profiles, setting the stage for
development of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and combination therapies."

Living cells contain a variety of distinguishable parts called organelles which have characteristic sizes and
specific functions. These organelles grow in a shared pool of their respective building blocks, and are remarkably
able to maintain their structure despite a rapid exchange of their building blocks. This prompts a question: how
are the sizes of organelles growing in a shared pool of building blocks actively controlled by the cell? Years of
biochemical experiments have revealed a plethora of proteins involved with these structures, yet, due to the
high-dimensionality of the variables involved, how they all work together to create properly-sized organelles is
still not well understood. Mathematical modeling and simulations, thus, provide an exciting avenue to tackle
these questions, with the added benefit of identifying key tunable knobs for biochemists to run streamlined
experiments. Over the last few years, using these techniques on organelles like actin cable and flagellum, I
identified that a negative feedback to the size, mediated by a diminishing pool of building blocks or key accessory
proteins specific to the organelle, was critical in controlling the size of a growing organelle. Significantly, the key
experimental knobs that we suggested, have since been used to test the predictions of my quantitative models.
My results enabled us to understand the design principles for constructing a single structure, yet how competing
structures assemble and maintain their sizes while sharing a common pool of building blocks remains an open
question. Over the next five years, our goal is to quantitatively analyze the mechanisms used by the cell to share
building blocks between competing structures. Proteins involved in disassembly of organelles offer a solution -
in addition to disassembling pre-existing structures, they can provide key length-sensing feedback to the size of
individual structures sharing a common pool of building blocks. Using simulation schemes and theoretical tools
that I pioneered, we will identify discernible signatures of specific disassembly mechanisms, and quantitatively
describe their repercussion on the sharing of common resources between different competing structures. Using
actin structures and nucleolus as our model systems, we will design theory-driven experiments to verify our
predictions with already established collaborations, and use experimentally tunable knobs to discriminate
between different mechanisms that cells use to share building blocks between competing structures. A
quantitative understanding of molecular mechanisms affecting organelle growth will accelerate the development
of new therapies to combat many human neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(abnormalities in actin assembly) and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (nucleolus abnormalities)."
10893020,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Crossing over facilitates accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division that
produces gametes. A fundamental gap in our understanding of crossing over is how double-Holliday junction
(dHJ) intermediates are specifically resolved into crossovers and how this process is regulated. This
knowledge gap has persisted because of challenges to study dHJ resolution at the biochemical and cellular
levels. These impediments are overcome in this proposal through breakthroughs in understanding the
mechanism of dHJ resolution and the development of biochemical, genetic, and molecular reagents and
approaches to study dHJ resolution in vitro and in vivo. These include the realization that dHJ resolution occurs
through a mechanism that resembles the initiation steps of DNA mismatch repair and involves the nicking of
dHJs by the MutLg endonuclease, trigged by the replicative clamp PCNA. These observations evoke a
coherent model for crossover-specific dHJ resolution in which orientation-specific loading of PCNA targets
MutLγ to incise specific DNA strands on both sides of the Holliday junctions (HJs). Resolution then occurs via
migration of the HJs across the nicks driven by the Bloom helicase complex (BLM-TOP3-RMI1/2). Critically,
the asymmetric pattern of nicks always yields a crossover. The long-term objective of this project, to
understand the mechanism and regulation of crossover-specific dHJ resolution during meiosis, will be pursued
through three aims. Aim 1 will test the key tenets of the crossover-specific dHJ resolution model in vitro by
reconstituting the reaction using purified human proteins and a variety of DNA substrates containing HJs and
loading sites for PCNA. In Aim2, predictions of the model will also be tested in vivo using the unrivaled suite of
molecular-genetics tools available in budding yeast, augmented by new approaches to isolate the dHJ
resolution step and study pertinent factors using real-time genetics. This aim will detect MutLγ-catalyzed nicks
at prospective crossover sites and in dHJs poised for resolution; detect immature resolution products
containing single-stranded flaps and gaps; confirm the crossover resolution role of Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 (ortholog
of the human BLM complex); determine the influence of MutLγ on alternative resolution pathways; and test the
idea that Exo1 functions at crossover sites to stabilize MutLγ-catalyzed nicks. Aim 3 will exploit new insights
into the regulation of dHJ resolution by polo-like kinase, Cdc5. Candidate targets identified by phospho-
proteomics will be analyzed using molecular-genetics tools in budding yeast to understand how Cdc5 triggers
dHJ resolution. The results of these aims will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanism and regulation
of crossing over during meiosis. These findings will be germane to understanding pathologies associated with
human meiosis, including infertility, miscarriage, congenital disease, and premature ovarian insufficiency, and
are expected to define paradigms that are broadly relevant for chromosome biology."

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an NIDDK funded program that, in part, aims to generate a
human Kidney Tissue Atlas. In the initial UG3/UH3 KPMP program, our Tissue Integration Site (TIS)
implemented and streamlined spatial metabolomics and lipidomics technologies based on matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and set up a quality-controlled pipeline for high
throughput analysis of human kidney biopsies. We also developed new bioinformatic methods for confident
molecular annotations of our MALDI-MSI data, as well as new visualization tools that permitted molecular image
overlay on optical images (e.g., histopathological images) using METASPACE– a cloud software for molecular
annotation, visualization, and data sharing. As such, these three technologies were sufficiently validated for
KPMP data collection on kidney biopsy tissue and approved by the Tissue Interrogation Site Approval Committee
(TISAC). We also developed a new platform for spatial profiling the kidney glycome that is currently under review
for TISAC approval. In close collaboration with other TISs and the Data Visualization Center, our TIS has been
able to demonstrate the unique value of connecting hundreds of bioactive molecules to genes and proteins and
to infer functional relationships at the renal compartment and cellular level, capacities critically needed for the
human Kidney Tissue Atlas. Our team combines the expertise of the University of Texas Health San Antonio
and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in nephrology and spatial omics, the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory in molecular data annotation, management, and visualization, and the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai in integrating multi-omics data. We are uniquely positioned to generate spatial multi-omics
interpretation describing kidney metabolism and to contribute to the Kidney Tissue Atlas. The overarching goals
of the project are to generate spatial multi-omics data from KPMP kidney biopsies to elucidate pathways related
to acute kidney injury (AKI), hypertensive chronic kidney disease (H-CKD), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD),
to define disease subgroups on the spatial and single-cell level, and to interrogate drug metabolism. We will
achieve this through two main project aims: (1) scaling up, improving, and validating spatial omics technologies,
and (2) developing and validating bioinformatics for pathways analysis and multi-level data integration. For each
of the spatial omics platforms, we expect to reach throughput to analyze up to two kidney biopsies per week with
a spatial resolution of ≤10 µm. We will focus on developing the necessary bioinformatics and data management
methods and workflows to extract the molecular knowledge for integration into the Kidney Tissue Atlas in
collaboration with the Kidney Tissue Atlas Coordinating Center, and we will develop integrative bioinformatics
for pathway analysis and drug metabolism. Our proposed program within the next phase of KPMP will provide
an essential contribution to the Kidney Tissue Atlas, will deliver clinically relevant molecular data and methods,
and provide a FAIR data resource paving the way towards novel precision therapies against AKI/H-CKD/DKD."

the alcohol research field, each providing expert guidance throughout the progress of the proposed studies.
The research plan evolved from Dr. Zamudio-Bulcock’s long standing interest in alcohol effects on the
cerebellum and her experience studying the effects of acute and developmental alcohol exposures on cerebellar
physiology. Thus, it is clearly distinguishable from the research focus of her mentor’s laboratory. Studies from
the mentor and co-mentors have characterized functional, structural and epigenetic alterations after chronic
alcohol exposure in brain regions implicated in alcohol consumption and dependence. Dr. Zamudio-Bulcock’s
proposal will apply the methodologies used by her mentors to evaluate chronic alcohol–induced alterations in
the cerebellum which, despite being highly sensitive to alcohol, has been understudied in the context of chronic
alcohol use and dependence. The aims in this proposal have been tailored to test the hypothesis that chronic
alcohol exposure leads to functional, structural and epigenetic alterations in the sole output of the cerebellar
cortex, the GABAergic Purkinje cell. Importantly, the cerebellar cortex has been recently found to be a
heterogeneous brain region with marked molecular, functional and structural differences among cerebellar
lobules. Such differences are postulated to support the ample diversity of behavioral functions the cerebellum
provides neuronal computation for. Given the functional connectivity of the posterior cerebellum with higher-
order brain regions known to be affected in alcohol-dependent mice, the effects of chronic alcohol exposure will
be studied in a sub-lobular specific manner with a focus on posterior lobules that are inter-connected with
midbrain and cortical areas involved in reward and decision making. The opportunity to carry out these studies
and engage in comprehensive career development training activities will provide a solid foundation for the

Research Plan: An impaired hematopoietic differentiation process underlies bone marrow malignancies like
leukemia, but we still lack the mechanistic understanding of the sequence of regulatory events that misleads the
differentiation process. Since epigenomic regulatory patterns are major features of leukemic development,
understanding the chromatin dynamics of a failed (malignant) hematopoietic differentiation process can help
define the molecular basis of leukemia. A prerequisite to such an understanding is a framework that allows
investigation of the progressive changes in the activity of the regulatory elements (RE) during hematopoietic
differentiation. Single-cell CUT&Tag (scCUT&Tag) technology is well-suited for such studies as RE activity
through histone modification profiles can be investigated in a lineage-specific manner. However, poor
understanding of the cell-type-specific histone modification patterns makes the task challenging. To overcome
this challenge, we designed scCUT&Tag-pro which allows simultaneous measurement of cell-surface protein
and in-silico integration of gene-expression and chromatin accessibility. I will leverage this novel multimodal
framework to investigate the RE and progressive changes in their activity during hematopoiesis. First, I will define
a multimodal reference mapping framework for mouse hematopoiesis. This framework will allow me to integrate
multiple histone modification profiles onto one reference and compare the chromatin states of the RE between
a wild type (WT) and mouse model with loss of function in histone methyl transferase (HMT) (Aim 1). Second,
since HMTs regulate transcription through the interaction network of RE. I will define a chromatin state aware
map that dynamically links REs across developmental trajectories. I will use this framework to investigate the
changes in the interaction of REs due to HMT loss (Aim 2). Third, since the transcriptional state of a cell emerges
from the underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), I will integrate single-cell gene expression data with histone
modification profiles and extend it to define a chromatin state aware model of GRN. I will compare the WT and
HMT loss experiments and define the differential GRN (Aim 3). Altogether, this research proposal seeks to
pioneer the computational methods for the integrated analyses of multimodal single-cell histone modifications
and systematically dissect progressive changes in the system-level function of the regulatory circuits that
misleads hematopoietic differentiation using mouse models with conditional HMT loss of function in the
hematopoietic compartment. I have developed a 5-year career development plan to meet my goal of becoming
an independent investigator in the multi-disciplinary field of computational cancer biology. The mentorship
committee will also provide me the guidance in my research and academic job search. Given the excellent the
outstanding record of training multiple independent scientists, New York Genome Center provides me an ideal
environment to attain my scientific career goals."
10898676,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Understanding Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and identifying effective interventions are among the most
exciting scientific frontiers and most critical healthcare challenges. While the roles of several
pathological hallmarks of AD have been extensively studied, the biochemical alterations associated with
these hallmarks and the mechanisms underlying progressive neuron loss and neuronal vulnerability in
AD are not fully understood. Neurogenesis, a unique characteristic of the hippocampal formation, has
been shown to play important roles in aging and AD progression. Abnormal early declines in
neurogenesis have been observed in AD brains in both human and animal models, but the molecular
profile of alterations in vulnerable brain circuits and neurons associated with varied neurogenesis have
not been documented. Fourier transform mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and single cell analyses
allow for mapping and profiling hundreds to thousands of molecules in biological samples and single
cells, providing unparalleled chemical insights relevant to AD as discussed above. However, several
major challenges exist: (1) the limited throughput that prohibits the analysis of many tissue slices and
samples; (2) the challenges associated with high-resolution volumetric reconstruction of biomolecular
distributions for regional analysis across samples and experimental groups; (3) the need for integrating
multiscale tissue MSI and single-cell MS data to relate cellular neurochemistry to tissue chemical
heterogeneity. The proposed research addresses these challenges by developing a suite of novel mass
spectrometry-based technologies and uses these technologies to map biomolecules related to AD and
neurogenesis. Aim 1 develops a new technology to significantly enhances the throughput of FT-MSI by
synergizing compressed sensing and deep learning, and a multimodal approach to integrate many MSI
slices for 3D chemical atlases of AD and wild type mouse brain. Aim 2 develops an experimental
framework to generate multiscale tissue MSI and single-cell MS data, a computational framework to
jointly analyze these data, and -omics based molecular libraries to aid in interpreting the MSI and single
cell data. Aim 3 leverages the tools developed in Aims 1 & 2 to determine the temporal and spatial
signature of vulnerable circuits and neurons in a FAD mouse model of AD. Aim 4 investigates the
effects of hippocampal neurogenesis on neuronal vulnerability and AD progression using the new
multiscale MSI technology, as well as creates 3D chemical atlas of the mouse brain. The proposed
research, synergistic with both technology- and hypothesis- driven aims, will expand the technological
envelop of MSI and transform how high-resolution MSI data are generated and analyzed. The proposed
measurements will address critical knowledge gaps on the mechanism underlying neuronal vulnerability
in AD, potentially identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
10898687,"Testing for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in blood has enabled early detection of prostate cancer and
reduced metastasis and death from disease—but also contributed to overdetection of low-risk cancers.
Although no PSA concentration confers zero risk of finding cancer at prostate biopsy, a single PSA
measurement at midlife is a remarkably strong predictor of the risk of developing lethal prostate cancer
decades later. PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that is non-catalytic in blood, and it occurs in multiple forms. A
statistical model based on four kallikrein (4K) markers (free, total, and intact PSA, plus human kallikrein-related
peptidase-2 [hK2]) improves specificity in detecting high-grade prostate cancer among men with elevated PSA
(reducing unnecessary biopsies) and is also a strong predictor of the risk of lethal prostate cancer decades
later. While intra-individual fluctuations in PSA levels are common, an excessive degree of variability is highly
problematic, as temporary “false positive” elevations reduce the specificity of PSA as a cancer marker,
attenuate the diagnostic value of PSA kinetics, and lead to the use of unnecessary antibiotics. Less studied but
similarly abundant in prostatic fluid as PSA, the concentration of microseminoprotein-ß (MSP, MSMB) in blood
is inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs10993994) in
the promoter region of the MSMB gene is also associated with prostate cancer risk, but the role of these
markers in clinical decision-making is unclear. Similarly, a SNP in the SERPINA3 gene is significantly
associated with blood levels of PSA, and the encoded protein, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), is the
predominant stable complexing ligand to PSA in the blood. However, the clinical value of these makers is
undetermined, and it remains unclear whether ACT levels in blood influence the predictive value of a baseline
PSA value or affect intra-individual variation in PSA. Additionally, the intra-individual variation of the 4K-panel
is currently unknown but could be determined using high-quality serial samples. As the role of these different
molecular markers in combined risk-prediction models of aggressive prostate cancer is not well understood, we
plan to delineate the influence of intra-individual variability in serial screening samples on clinical decision-
making for risk stratification and biopsy by a single PSA value and additional markers. Using blood samples
from the PLCO, Göteborg-1 & -2 trials, and Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), we plan to: 1) quantify the patterns of
variation in the 4K markers + MSP in serial measurements; 2) determine the relationship between a statistical
model based on 4K markers + MSP and subsequent risk of lethal prostate cancer, then independently validate
the clinical utility of the markers in decision-making and risk stratification before treatment decisions in a
randomized trial of prostate cancer treatments (ProtecT); and 3) compare head-to-head the clinical utility of
pre-biopsy biomarkers versus magnetic resonance imaging on cancer detection rates. The resulting insights
will shed light on how to improve the specificity of prostate cancer screening and early detection."
10898747,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was the first human tumor virus discovered over 50 years ago in the context of
endemic African Burkitt lymphoma. However, we now know it is also a common herpesvirus that persists as a
lifelong latent infection in virtually all adults worldwide. Early work in the field led to a model for EBV infection
promoting B-cell lymphomas as evidenced by the growth transformation, or immortalization, of primary resting
human B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). In vivo, EBV latent infection is met with a robust cytotoxic
T-cell response keeping most infected individuals protected from the oncogenic potential of the virus. As such,
EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas occur at significantly higher rates in the setting of immune suppression.
Studies of viral and cellular gene expression in EBV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo have led to a model of
lymphomagenesis characterized by the full expression of EBV latency gene products. However, the phenotypes
in bulk culture and tumor tissue lack the nuanced detail of cellular heterogeneity and the consequences of minor
frequency phenotypes on cancer progression. Our recent single cell RNAseq experiments have characterized
gene expression within individual EBV-infected B cells leading to an appreciation of cell fate trajectories and
dynamic gene expression behavior of individual cells that we will integrate with human tumor analysis and mouse
models of lymphomagenesis. It is our ultimate goal to define the importance of specific EBV-infected cell
populations on the progression of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas of the immune suppressed. In this proposal,
we aim to define how EBV-infected cell heterogeneity, including innate antiviral restriction and plasmablast
differentiation, impacts lymphomagenesis and can be exploited for therapy. Our central hypothesis is that EBV-
infected B cells toggle between different states that can restrict or promote lymphomagenesis as well as render
cells susceptible to virus-specific therapeutic intervention. We formulated our central hypothesis based on
preliminary data including single-cell RNA sequencing of EBV-infected primary B cells early after infection and
in LCLs as well as characterization of cell fate dynamics regulating plasmablastic differentiation and lytic
reactivation. We also provide evidence supporting a recent clinical trial using the “kick and kill” strategy of
promoting EBV lytic reactivation with histone deacetylase inhibition coupled with ganciclovir to kill lymphoma
cells that activate viral kinases. Thus, the rationale for the proposed research is that understanding EBV
regulation of infected B-cell fates will dissect mechanisms of pathogenesis and reveal new therapeutic avenues
to target EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas. We plan to test our central hypothesis and complete the objectives in
this proposal through the following three specific aims: i) to define the role of innate immune sensors and
effectors in EBV-mediated immortalization and lymphomagenesis, ii) to determine the role of plasmablast
differentiation in suppressing EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis, and iii) to define the mechanism by which HDAC
inhibition promotes susceptibility of EBV+ DLBCL to killing by ganciclovir."
10898751,"ABSTRACT
Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) are the most significant entry into the market for nicotine in
decades, disrupting patterns of nicotine use as well as other substances such as combustible tobacco and
cannabis. The rapid rise in vaping has caused public health professionals concern, particularly with respect to
high use among youth, leading to significant efforts at regulation. At the same time, there is increasing
evidence that under proper circumstances, ENDS may be an effective smoking cessation aid and harm
reduction tool. As a result, ENDS regulation is likely to have broad impact, affecting the use of not only ENDS,
but also combustible cigarettes and other vaped products (i.e., cannabis), and differentially affecting use and
outcomes for youth, young adults, and adults. A comprehensive effort is needed to understand the potentially
far-reaching consequences of ENDS policy. Federal, state, and local governments have instituted efforts to
control youth ENDS use and protect non-users from ENDS vapor. Public policies may be placed principally into
five categories: 1) raising the legal purchasing age to 21, 2) restricting or prohibiting sales of flavored products,
3) limiting stores where ENDS may be used or sold, 4) restricting where ENDS may be used (e.g., clean indoor
air laws), and 5) taxing ENDS
. Schools have also instituted policies and programs to curb ENDS use. In the
proposed research, we will obtain publicly available data on ENDS policy enactment and use qualitative
methods (key informant interviews) to investigate the adoption and implementation of ENDS policies by states
nationally and by localities and schools in eastern Massachusetts. Next, we will leverage natural experiments
induced by policy introductions at different places and times to rigorously evaluate how these specific ENDS
control efforts, individually and in combination, affect ENDS, tobacco, and cannabis use among youth, young
adults, and adults. To this end, our analyses will combine policy data from public documents, databases, and
our interviews with large national datasets (e.g., the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System and the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) and a limited-access local data set from eastern Massachusetts
(the MetroWest Adolescent Health Survey) from 2014-2025. Analyzing data from this extended period will
allow adequate follow-up after major recent state and national policy changes as well as the major disruptions
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using our estimates of how policies impact these substance use outcomes, we will
conduct simulation analyses using the Simulation of Tobacco and Nicotine Outcomes and Policy (STOP)
microsimulation model to project the potential short- and long-term impact of alternate ENDS control policy
configurations on behaviors and health. These complementary efforts, synthesizing new, high-quality inputs
and analyses, will provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of ENDS control policies. Findings will
be disseminated using a theory-based approach and assistance from national tobacco policy experts to help
guide stakeholders towards policies that are maximally feasible and effective for improving population health."

10905998,"PROJECT 1 – SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Project 1 competitive renewal addresses the unmet clinical and scientific needs to enhance donor liver supply
through organ “rejuvenation.” We reported that hepatic CEACAM1 (encoded by CC1 gene; CD66a) dictates
donor liver quality, and prevents early OLT injury in mice and humans. CC1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing
(AS) to generate splice variants, characterized by the inclusion (CC1-L; long) or exclusion (CC1-S; short) of exon
7. Hypothesis: Hepatocyte CC1-S functions as a cytoprotective sentinel, while CC1-L in OLT-infiltrating recipient-
derived neutrophils, regulates liver IR-inflammation and fine-tunes its resolution.
 Aim 1: Delineate mechanisms by which hepatic CC1-S isoform promotes cellular protection in IR-
stressed mouse OLT. Hypothesis: Antisense oligomer morpholinos (MOs)-enforced AS of hepatic CC1
generates CC1-S isoform in the donor mouse liver, which under the control of HIF-1α, stimulates cytoprotection
by blocking p-p38 (under cold IR-stress) while promoting GPX4 and targeting ferroptosis (under warm IR-stress).
Here, we will ascertain whether 1.1: CC1-AS accelerates otherwise impaired hepatic recovery in the acute and
the resolution phase of IR-inflammation. 1.2: CC1-S controls IRI-OLT by regulating hepatic cell death pathways.
1.3: CC1-S-mediated cytoprotection is controlled by HIF-1α signaling under warm vs. cold hepatic IR-stress.
 Aim 2: Define mechanisms by which neutrophil CC1-L isoform exerts anti-inflammatory and
cytoprotective functions in IR-stressed mouse OLT. Hypothesis: Recipient CC1-L neutrophils counteract acute
IRI-OLT, and stimulate inflammation resolution by orchestrating N1/N2 polarization, with resultant liver
homeostatic/regenerative remodeling. We will study whether 2.1: Recipient CC1-L deficient immune cells
exacerbate hepatic IRI-OLT. 2.2: CC1-L polarizes N2 neutrophils to promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype/
improve OLT outcomes. 2.3: CC1-L proficient neutrophils polarize M2 macrophages/promote hepatic autophagy.
 Aim 3: Elucidate mechanisms by which hepatic CC1-S isoform rejuvenates discarded human livers
subjected to normothermic machine preservation (NMP). Hypothesis: NMP, supplemented with HIF-1α – CC1-
S axis modifiers, improves the function of discarded human livers by mitigating ferroptosis while promoting
autophagy. We will incorporate the emerging NMP strategy with adjunctive CC1-intervention to assess whether
3.1: MOs-conditioned humanized CC1 transgenic mice (huCC1-Tg) mimic the effects of CC1-AS upon liver IR-
stress in normal mice but be translatable to the human liver. 3.2: CC1-S isoform synergizes with HIF-1α to
improve liver function. 3.3: CC1-S synergizes with HIF-1α to enhance cytoprotection in human livers.
 Integration with PPG: Project 1 complements studies assessing homeostatic mechanisms in the
resolution of IRI-OLT in Project 2. Aim 1-2 in Project 1 will be validated by the screening of human OLT biopsies
to accelerate assessments of clinical innate immune phenotypes in Project 3. Project 1 is dependent on Core A
(Administrative), Core B (Mouse and Human OLT Surgery), and Core C (Computational and Biostatistics)."
10906001,"Project Summary:
 Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is the major risk factor in liver tumor resection and transplantation. Innate
immune activation drives the development of tissue injury via interactions of danger associated molecular
pattern (DAMP) and pattern recognition receptors. As an integral part of the disease process, inflammation
resolution in liver IRI has not been well defined. Questions of whether and how IRI may lead to transplant
rejection remain to be answered. Inflammation resolution is an active process, initiated by or overlapped with
immune activation. Thus, anti-inflammatory strategy by itself may potentially interfere with inflammation
resolution. The pro-resolution strategy is, therefore, is critical for the true restoration of tissue homeostasis.
 Preliminary experiments have been performed to define inflammation resolution in a murine liver partial
warm ischemia model with data on the kinetic changes in histopathology, inflammatory gene expressions and
macrophages (MФs). KCs are the dominant player in the liver inflammation resolution. Their depletion by
clodronate-liposomes (CL) results in significant delays in the resolution of liver IRI (14 days) with increased
expressions of pro-inflammatory and fibrosis genes, as compared with the depletion of CD11b+iMФ (in CD11b-
DTR mice). The KC reconstitution in these CL-treated mice restored the resolution kinetics. Experiments with
TAM RTK deficient mice and TIM-4 depleting Abs showed that both Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and
TIM-4 are critical for the KC function in the resolution of liver IRI.
 The current project will take advantage of novel mouse genetic tools to elucidate KC-specific function in
liver IRI in both partial warm ischemia, as well as liver transplantation models. Experiments are designed to
test the hypothesis that embryonic KCs are the most effective reparative MФs in the resolution of liver IRI in
MerTK/TIM-4 dependent manner via Liver X Receptor (LXR) - and lipoxygenase (LOX) -mediated effector
pathways. Enhancement of pro-resolution function of KCs protects liver Tx and inhibits alloimmune activation.
 Aim 1 will determine the functional mechanism of KCs in the resolution of liver IRI. Aim 2 will define
MerTK-mediated pro-resolution effector pathways in KCs. Aim 3 will determine roles of KCs in liver
transplantation. Results of the study will help to delineate the inflammation resolution mechanism in liver IRI
and identify novel pro-resolving therapeutic targets for future clinical application."
10906004,"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), the inevitable consequence of the transplant process, is a key limitation to
human liver transplantation. The cellular damage incurred by IRI can lead to primary non-function necessitating
re-transplantation. Liver IRI also predisposes the recipient to both acute and chronic rejection and graft loss, as
well as, decreasing the pool of transplantable organs. Key observations in murine models indicate that liver IRI
is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Little is known whether similar mechanisms are
at play in human liver transplantation. Our central hypothesis is that identifying the DAMPs and their associated
PRRs driving myeloid cell plasticity during human OLT-IRI will permit us to develop therapeutic interventions to
improve OLT outcomes. Aim 1, we will determine the TLR9 and TLR7/NOD2 ligands mediating differential
polarization of inflammatory vs. regulatory macrophages and crosstalk with T cells. We will characterize the cell-
free DNA/TLR9 ligands mitochondrial DNA, neutrophil extracellular traps, and HMGB1/RAGE in pre/post
reperfusion blood to establish their contributions to human OLT-IRI, ability to polarize macrophages and develop
alloreactive T cells. We will also determine the tolerogenic effect of TLR7 and NOD2 ligands for their regulatory
potential to mitigate TLR4 and/or TLR9 polarization and suppression of alloimmunity. Characterization of
longitudinal changes in myeloid and T cell phenotypes of recipient blood and donor allograft biopsies obtained
pre- and post-reperfusion will identify new targetable interactions along the endotype-specific pathways
TLR4/TLR9 and TLR7/NOD2 in situ. Aim 2 will determine the therapeutic potential of PRR preconditioning to
mitigate myeloid activation and OLT-IRI. We will assess the therapeutic potential of TLR4/9 antagonists to
mitigate IR mediated-injury, macrophage inflammatory polarization and T cell alloreactivity in vitro using blood
from human OLT recipients, and in vivo in rodent models of IRI. In situ assessment of the spatial immune profile
of donor vs. recipient myeloid cells in control vs. tolerized organs will explore the IRI-mediated immune cell and
parenchymal changes contributing to a regulatory vs inflammatory state in the graft. Aim 3 will determine the
impact of DAMP/PRR endotypes on generation of alloimmunity and graft outcome. We will assess the
DAMP/PRR endotypes that direct the generation and breadth of alloreactive T cells and donor specific
antibodies. Data will be integrated with clinical metadata, blood and graft immunophenotypes, IRI and transplant
outcomes to determine DAMP/PRR endotypes responsible for susceptibility to IRI and worse outcomes."

10906051,"Aging is associated with a loss of muscle mass in the form of sarcopenia and a loss of bone mass and density
in the form of osteoporosis. Muscle and bone loss with age are, in turn, underlying factors contributing to falls
and fractures in the elderly. These fractures are very costly both in terms of financial burden and quality of life.
A critical barrier to progress in correcting the problem of muscle and bone loss with aging is a poor understanding
of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction. Our goal is to
address this problem by providing critical, new information on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control
these processes, and thereby improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and eventually clinical practice.
Our central hypothesis is that age-associated accumulation of the tryptophan (Trp) metabolite kynurenine (Kyn),
a by-product of Trp degradation by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), plays a key role in
healthspan regulation by modulating skeletal muscle function and muscle-bone crosstalk. Kyn is now recognized
as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that has recently
been highlighted as playing a key role in regulating organismal aging and lifespan. Our preliminary data provide
a strong rationale for this hypothesis and indicate that 1) Kyn increases significantly with age in human subjects
and is positively correlated with measures of frailty, 2) Kyn induces muscle atrophy and inflammation in vivo and
increases accumulation of muscle reactive oxygen species in vitro, 3) AhR activation increases significantly with
aging in skeletal muscle, 4) AhR inhibition reduces Kyn-induced ROS production and senescence in vitro, and
5) pharmacological inhibition of either IDO1 or AhR increases muscle fiber size in aged mice. These findings
suggest that elevated oxidative stress and inflammation in skeletal muscle by Kyn-mediated AhR activation are
factors that impair musculoskeletal function and healthspan with aging. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
inhibiting IDO1 activity in skeletal muscle can improve muscle and bone function with aging. Aim 2 tests the
hypothesis that inhibiting AhR in skeletal muscle can improve muscle and bone function with aging. Our
expected outcomes include 1) defining the respective role(s) of IDO1 and AhR in skeletal muscle with aging so
that they can be targeted therapeutically, and 2) characterizing muscle-bone crosstalk in the context of altered
Kyn-AhR interactions to better understand the cellular and molecular processes related to impaired muscle and
bone function with aging."
10906052,"Our group recently identified the tryptophan-kynurenine (Kyn) catabolic pathway as a novel causal
mechanism in age-associated musculoskeletal complications (stem cell dysfunction, muscle, and bone
loss). Our published studies reported that the Kyn pathway is activated with age and decreases bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) differentiation, decreased autophagy flux, induces
premature senescence, and promotes bone loss. Furthermore, our pilot study demonstrated that inhibiting
AhR prevented bone deterioration and reduced systemic stress markers in aged mice. Based on our
published and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that elevated levels of Kyn metabolites and AhR
activation with age in bone and BMSCs lead to altered autophagy/mitophagy flux, which underlies
mitochondrial dysfunction and BMSC’s vulnerability to premature senescence, leading to decreased
osteogenic differentiation, and consequently increased bone loss. This hypothesis will be tested with two
independent but related aims. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the accumulation of Kyn
and its metabolites alters mitophagy and induces premature senescence with age in BMSCs
thereby affecting osteogenic pathways (in vitro and in vivo). We will define the roles of several Kyn
metabolites (e.g., Kyn, KynA) in the inhibition of mitophagy and senescence in vitro and in vivo. We will
assess autophagy and senescent biomarkers, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) gene
expression, and Kyn metabolite profiles to identify potential translational approaches. Specific Aim 2:
Test the hypothesis that inhibiting AhR signaling in response to Kyn pathway metabolites restores
mitophagy and inhibits premature senescence, rescuing osteogenesis, thereby reducing or
preventing bone loss with age. For this specific aim, we will use pharmacological inhibitors (e.g., CH-
223191) and genetic manipulation (stem cell and bone-specific AhR KO mice using, e.g., Prrx1-Cre, Osx1-
Cre) to examine the ability of AhR inhibition to restore autophagy and inhibit senescence in BMSCs. The
knowledge gained from our proposed studies will establish a conceptual framework to advance the
therapeutic potential of AhR inhibition in age-related musculoskeletal fragility."
10906054,"Project Summary/Abstract: Our group has demonstrated that increasing levels of the oxidized tryptophan
metabolite kynurenine (Kyn), and downstream signaling through its activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), contribute to age-related musculoskeletal dysfunction. Surprisingly, however, Kyn exerts more
deleterious effects on the female musculoskeletal system as compared to its effects in males. The molecular
mechanism behind this dimorphic phenomenon is not yet known, but our results suggest strong relevance to the
pathophysiologies of osteoporosis and frailty, which are more prevalent in women than in men. Our working
hypothesis is that the sexually dimorphic effects of Kyn in the musculoskeletal system may be attributed to
crosstalk between Kyn/AhR and signaling downstream of ligand-regulated DNA-binding transcription factors in
the nuclear receptor superfamily including the estrogen receptor (ER alpha/beta) and the glucocorticoid receptor
(GR). Glucocorticoids (GC) are key mediators of stress responses that regulate skeletal homeostasis. During
aging, endogenous GC levels increase, lose proper circadian regulation, and show amplified local activation
from increased expression of GC-activating enzymes (e.g., Hsd11b1) with age in bone. Despite the known
inhibitory effects of exogenous GC in bone, our data suggest that endogenous GC/GR-mediated signaling in
osteoblasts is protective for aging bone, as loss of GR signaling in osteoblasts promoted low bone mass and
increased bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). As we saw with Kyn, these effects from impaired GC/GR
signaling in bone are more severe in female than in male mice, and preliminary data suggest that the deleterious
effects of Kyn on osteoblasts are linked to impaired GC signaling. Therefore, the objective of Project 4 is to
understand AhR function with age, and determine the molecular mechanisms by which Kyn, and crosstalk
between Kyn/AhR and the nuclear receptors described above, drives aging-related phenotypes in bone and its
resident cell populations, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel targets to mitigate these effects"
10815174,"Abstract
Mammalian brains are extremely sensitive to metabolic perturbation. If blood glucose drops by only a factor of
~2, immediate neurological symptoms emerge, including delirium and coma. We identified nerve terminals as
a one of the likely loci of this vulnerability, as the vesicle recycling program crashes very quickly upon fuel
withdrawal. We hypothesize that this metabolic sensitivity may lie at the heart of both neurodegenerative and
neuropsychiatric diseases, as brain hypometabolism is a strong predictor of the onset of these diseases
(albeit on different time scales). We seek to address many fundamental knowledge gaps we have
concerning how local synaptic metabolism is regulated, including what molecular machineries for
metabolism support synapse function and how different metabolic fuels can be used to support synapse
function. We recently determined that one of the ten enzymes needed for glycolysis serves as a critical
control point for glycolytic flux in nerve terminals. Enhancing the activity of his enzyme, PGK-1, only 2-fold is
sufficient to provide dramatic protection against hypometabolic synaptic dysfunction. We recently discovered
that synapses contain the necessary machinery to both synthesize and utilize lipid droplets, and that they
normally constantly burn through these lipid droplets to sustain synapse function. Mutations in the key
triglyceride lipase required to lipid droplet use are drivers of neurological disease, including intellectual
disability. Similarly, we have recently uncovered a new role for neuromodulators at nerve terminals: in
addition to directly controlling synapse function, they serve as signals to tell synapses to either store or use
glycogen. Our aims to examine how difference cell biological machineries in synapses allow fuel switching
and how perturbations in these machineries drive or heighten neurological disease states."
10902593,"Project Summary Abstract
Alteration of essential metabolic pathways is a major mechanism by which oncogenic KRAS promotes tumor
development and growth in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). KRAS-driven PDAC is dependent on
macropinocytosis (MP) and autophagy to fuel the high metabolic demand of rapid proliferation. Thus, these
metabolic processes are attractive targets for the development of treatments for PDAC. Genetic depletion of
KRAS results in downregulation of MP in PDAC. Additionally, our lab demonstrated that KRAS depletion or
inhibition of ERK-MAPK signaling decreased glucose uptake and glycolysis but increased autophagy, thereby
enhancing dependency on autophagy for essential nutrient supply. Accordingly, dual RAS-pathway and
autophagy inhibition via chloroquine (CQ) synergistically enhanced efficacy in PDAC. Clinical data demonstrated
that resistance to this treatment arises over time through unknown mechanisms. Preliminary data indicates that
following RAS or ERK inhibition, both autophagy induction and MP downregulation are transient—with
autophagic and MP activity returning to/surpassing basal levels after prolonged treatment. Recent work has
suggested that these nutrient scavenging processes are able to compensate for loss of each other. We
demonstrate an inverse temporal relationship between autophagy and MP following depletion or inhibition of the
KRAS-ERK MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we show that CQ, commonly thought to inhibit lysosomal acidification,
does not prevent degradation of MP-derived proteins. We hypothesize that there is compensatory regulation
between autophagy and MP in the context of RAS-pathway inhibition. Thus, during prolonged RAS-pathway and
autophagy inhibitor treatment, PDAC cells upregulate MP, consequently abrogating dependency on autophagy
and reducing sensitivity to autophagy inhibition. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that upregulation of MP confers
resistance to dual autophagy and RAS-pathway inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we present the
unexpected observation that prolonged inhibition of the ERK-MAPK pathway results in the upregulation of MP.
Previous PDAC studies have employed genetic depletion of KRAS to demonstrate the role of oncogenic KRAS
in driving MP with no evaluation of inhibitors of KRAS or the ERK-MAPK pathway. Given the dependence of
PDAC on macropinocytic uptake for tumorigenic growth, it is imperative to understand how these inhibitors
regulate MP. Initial Aim 2 studies will be dedicated to comprehensive characterization of MP regulation in the
context of genetic and pharmacological inhibition of KRAS and ERK over time. Subsequent work in Aim 2 will
determine whether the changes in MP via RAS-pathway inhibition corresponds with changes in uptake and
efficacy of nab-paclitaxel. Further understanding of RAS-driven regulation of these essential metabolic pathways
in PDAC will inform future development of RAS-pathway inhibitor combinations. These studies will require my
application of a diverse spectrum of experimental approaches, advance my understanding of key steps in anti-
cancer therapeutic development, and foster my career development as an independent cancer researcher."
10903489,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to structurally and biochemically characterize wild-type LOXL1 and LOXL1 containing
variants associated with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (XFG). XFG is the most common form of secondary open-
angle glaucoma and is characterized by abnormal accumulation of fibrillar deposits in the anterior segment of
the eye. The accumulation of these deposits obstructs normal outflow of aqueous humor, leading to elevated
intraocular pressure and subsequent retinal damage and vision loss. The strongest genetic link to XFG is lysyl
oxidase 1 (LOXL1), a protein responsible for the cross-linking of tropoelastin into elastin microfibers. LOXL1 is
comprised of a signal peptide, a disordered N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal copper oxidase domain. The
copper oxidase domain contains the copper-containing active site and lysyl-tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor
necessary for cross-linking activity. Residues H449, H451, and H453 coordinate the copper (Cu(II)) ion while
residues K477 and Y512 form the LTQ cofactor. While the pro-region of LOXL1 interacts with elastin, fibulin-5
interacts with the 334-402 amino acid region of LOXL1 in order to properly orient LOXL1 with elastin fibers. While
proteolytic processing by BMP1 at residues 151-152 is necessary for proper cross-linking activity of LOXL1,
additional cleavage at residues 216-217, 292-293, and 375-376 by ADAMTS14 may also occur. Genome-wide
association analyses have identified two common coding variants (R141L and G153D) in LOXL1 associated with
increased XFG risk and one rare coding variant (Y407F) associated with decreased XFG risk. In addition, a
number of variants (e.g., D292V, K477R) in LOXL1 have been identified in the Genome Aggregation Database
(gnomAD). Little is known about how these variants impact the structure and function of currently structurally
uncharacterized LOXL1. However, these variants lie in important regions of LOXL1: R141L and G153D lie near
the 151-152 BMP1 cleavage site while D292V lies within the 292-293 ADAMTS14 cleavage site. Meanwhile
Y407F lies in the copper oxidase domain just downstream of the 334-402 fibulin-5 interaction region, and K477R
changes the lysine residue responsible for LTQ cofactor formation. Therefore, we hypothesize that these variants
impact the structure, proteolytic processing, protein interactions, and catalytic activity of LOXL1. We will test this
hypothesis with the following aims: In AIM 1, we will characterize the effects of Y407F and K477R variants on
the copper oxidase domain, examining domain structure, Cu(II) metalation, LTQ formation, and catalytic activity.
In AIM 2, we will characterize the effects of R141L, G153D, and D292V variants on the ability of the N-terminal
domain to fold and be cleaved by BMP1 and ADAMTS14. In AIM 3, we will examine the effects of the Y407F
variant and proteolytic cleavage on fibulin-5 interactions. Successful completion of this project will identify the
effects of XFG-associated variants on LOXL1 structure and function, thereby clarifying our understanding of how
LOXL1 contributes to XFG and laying groundwork for future therapeutic development."

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) involves the urothelial cells that line the bladder, kidney and ureters and is a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, especially in men. Bladder UC can be clinically separated into
nonmuscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle invasive (MIBC). MIBC accounts for the vast majority of metastasis
and mortality, having only a ~50% cure rate. Patients with treated NMIBC are at risk of recurrence or
progression to MIBC at prior or de novo sites. Over half of urothelial cancer, regardless of site of origin, harbor
loss of function mutations in the histone demethylase KDM6A (UTX) and in two highly homologous histone
methyltransferases KMT2C (MLL3) and KMT2D (MLL4). These proteins form the MLL3/4-COMPASS
(COMplex of Proteins ASsociated with Set1)-like complex that regulate enhancer function, partly through
methylation of histones at enhancers. Enhancers are regions of DNA that regulate lineage specific
transcriptional programs. Recent studies have shown that patients with two urothelial carcinomas in far away
sites (ureter and bladder) harbor the same COMPASS-like mutation. Further sequencing of histologically
benign urothelium identify frequent mutations in the complex at expand over time. Our hypothesis is that these
mutations under “field-cancerization” of the urothelium. Our lab has generated a genetically engineered mouse
model with deletion of Kmt2c, Kmt2d, or the combination in the urothelium. The urothelium of these mice
exhibit no histologic abnormalities. However, transcriptome analysis shows the urothelium exhibit increased
stemness and functional studies show they exhibit increased organoid forming abilities. When crossed into the
Pten conditional deletion mouse, there was robust cooperativity in tumorigenesis. The overall objective of this
proposal is to utilize our recently generated mouse models of urothelial this COMPASS-like complex loss to
mechanistically understand its role in tumor urothelial suppression. Specifically, in Aim 1, we seek to determine
the stemness, clonal dynamics, oncogene and carcinogen susceptibility of urothelium harboring mutations in
this COMPASS-like complex, using lineage tracing, organoid culture, and single-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim
2, we seek to determine the functional interplay between MLL3/4-COMPASS dysfunction and oncogene
activation. In Aim 3, we will seek to define how loss of Kmt2c and Kmt2d in urothelial cells affect enhancer and
promoter function. Active enhancers are genomic regions of open chromatin with transcription factor binding,
divergent transcription of enhancer RNA, and looping to promoters. We will study each step by global mapping
of histone marks, chromatin accessibility, mRNA transcription of associated gene and looping to promoters
using state-of the art epigenetics techniques."

The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) is a pioneer in HIV research, a leader of HIV behavioral research and interventions with the transgender (hereafter “trans”) community and has been a training ground for HIV scientists since the beginning of the epidemic. Trans people are a key population most severely affected by HIV, but they are under-served in the epidemic response. Intervention trials do not adequately include trans people, and when they are included it is often with other populations without the sample size to power analyses that can determine the benefit of breakthroughs in HIV prevention and care. HIV behavioral research often misses the mark in asking the questions and gathering the right data needed to determine reasons for elevated risk and identify appropriate modalities for intervention. To move the epidemic to zero new infections, zero AIDS deaths, and zero stigma, scientists with expertise in trans population health must play a significant scientific role in the response to HIV, especially those from underrepresented populations in the US biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences research enterprise. There is a paucity of HIV behavioral scientists with expertise in trans population health to do this work, and to our knowledge, there are no known mentoring programs to train scholars in HIV behavioral science and trans population health. Our team has decades of HIV research training experience and we are also experts in HIV behavioral research with trans communities, having run studies for almost 20 years and with 8 HIV behavioral studies with the trans community currently in the field. Building on our research and mentoring experiences, we propose “SHINE Strong” – a mentoring program committed to the long-term development of HIV behavioral scientists with expertise in trans population health. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop an HIV behavioral research training program for undergraduates from underrepresented populations in the US biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences research enterprise interested in trans population health that will include intensive summer research, year-long mentored projects, and life-long career advocacy and social support; (2) Work collaboratively with scholars to develop career plans, pathways to independence, support systems, and capacities for culturally and medically relevant trans health research; and (3) Create and sustain a network of mentors from diverse backgrounds to support scholars’ careers in trans population health research. The 5-year grant will recruit 4 cohorts of 3 scholars each. The program entails: (a) an intensive summer of interdisciplinary training, development of a career plan, design of an HIV-related study, and networking with the local research community; (b) completion of a 1-year mentored research project; (c) an online learning platform with scheduled, asynchronous peer-to-peer exchanges; and (d) a final Research Forum presentation for the local trans and scientific communities and the next cohort of scholars."

The goal of the work outline in this proposal is to understand the fundamental signaling that controls cell fate to
maintain tissue homeostasis. Epithelial tissues demonstrate an intrinsic ability for their constituent cells to
organize and maintain a steady-state of form and function. Many disease states lack these intrinsic controls.
Epithelial tissues of the human body are in a constant state of renewal. Our understanding of the signaling
systems that control how these complex epithelial tissues maintain robust organization is incomplete. Essential
for progress, we need a quantitative understanding of signaling at the single-cell level in the context of
physiological conditions to reveal systems-level behaviors that can be targeted therapeutically. We focus on
protein kinases as critical mediators of signaling in the cell, which are well known to play prominent roles in
tissue function and drivers of disease. Our kinome-wide studies have identified GSK3 and CLK3 as major
tissue homeostasis regulators that govern the balance between proliferation and differentiation. In Project 1,
we hypothesize GSK3 requires multiple suppressive inputs that uniquely produce different fate outcomes
ranging from stem cells, transit-amplifying, and differentiated. We will provide the first systems-level mapping
for multiple inputs onto GSK3 dynamics and how these dynamics are decoded into distinct cellular outcomes
of renewing epithelium. In Project 2, we hypothesize CLK3 is a gatekeeper controlling stem cell fate through
transcriptome regulation. We will define the activity of CLK3 in the stem cell niche as a regulator of expression
and splicing of Wnt-target genes to promote stemness. Our approach uses high-throughput quantitative
microscopy to measure single-cell behaviors in physiological organoid homeostatic culture models. Our
research will define the regulatory mechanisms for two critical kinases, GSK3 and CLK3, and discover novel
signaling circuitry needed for the accurate organization of renewing and regenerative epithelia, uncovering new
strategies for treating diseases of regenerative tissues."

 Gasotransmitters, such as H2S and NO, are small molecule bioregulators that are responsible for
regulating different aspects of physiological functions and cellular signaling. The crosstalk between these and
related biologically active species can lead to the formation of reactive sulfur species (RSS), reactive nitrogen
species (RNS), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have their own roles in physiological mechanisms.
Although often written as a neutral species, H2S and other reactive sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen species are
typically anionic under physiological conditions. Anionic reactive sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen species (ARSONS)
are short-lived, small molecule intermediates formed by the crosstalk between gasotransmitters and other
physiologically relevant species. Molecular crosstalk between NO and H2S leads to the formation of SNO– and
SSNO– which have their own physiological roles in crosstalk and cell-signaling processes. The complexity and
reactivity of these small reactive species in biological environments make understanding their interconnectivity
and specific involvement in signaling pathways incredibly difficult. My proposed research will investigate methods
of molecular recognition to target RSS, RNS, and ARSONS as an understudied class of anionic targets with the
more long-term goal of understanding specific molecular environments that stabilize these reactive species.
 The long-term goal of this research is to develop new tools for the molecular recognition of ARSONS. In
a recently submitted manuscript, I have been able to demonstrate through a diverse library of C–H hydrogen
bonding based receptors that vary in charge, directionality, and preorganization that HS– and NO2– can be bound
and that these receptors exhibit a particular preference for forming strong C–H⋯S interactions. We noted that
the macrocyclic receptors exhibited much stronger binding affinities compared to non-macrocyclic analogues.
Inspired by these strong hydrogen bonding interactions and the driving force of preorganization, we now first
focus on using C–H and N–H based macrocycles, cryptands, and cages to further investigate RSS, RNS, and
ARSONS. Additionally, I will also investigate how anion-p interactions can stabilize these reactive species. These
host compounds are comprised of electron deficient p-systems capable of binding anions and vary in flexibility
and complimentary binding motifs. Finally, I will use the insight gained the previous experiments to rationally
design novel anion receptors specific for binding ARSONS. The iterative feedback gained from the other hosts
will provide new information on how cooperative interactions can target different functional groups present in
ARSONS. Completion of this work will aid in the development of new tools to investigate biologically relevant,
reactive anions and has the longer-term potential to inform on mechanisms and pathways related to molecular
crosstalk and cellular signaling of these under-investigated species."

Abnormalities in feeding behaviors are a key symptom of several conditions, including binge-eating disorder,
anorexia and obesity. In order to develop novel treatments, it is imperative to gain a deeper understanding of the
circuits controlling adaptive feeding. Eating is affected by metabolic and hedonic features, and it consists of
several actions, including exploratory food-seeking and consumption. Despite its central clinical and biological
importance, networks controlling these behaviors are not well-understood. Prior data have indicated that
activation of several GABAergic inputs to the midbrain lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG)
elicit hunting of insects in mice. However, the role of local l/vlPAG GABAergic cells in feeding is unknown.
Intriguingly, our preliminary data show that these cells encode food-seeking actions, such as approach to food
and consumption. Furthermore, activity in these ensembles, or of their projections to the subthalamic zona
incerta (ZI) are required for foraging leading to consumption of both prey and non-prey food. Here, we propose
to combine converging advances in neural activity recording, computational methods and molecular circuit
dissection tools to: 1. Characterize how l/vlPAG VGAT cells encode food sources and food-seeking behaviors
by recording the neural activity of large ensembles of cells with miniaturized microscopes. 2. Determine if activity
in the l/vlPAG circuit and their projection to the ZI is necessary and sufficient to promote foraging leading to
consumption, and 3. Dissect how the l/vlPAG input affects the ZI by combining ex vivo and in vivo recordings of
neural activity. Since prior reports show ZI activation induces feeding, we hypothesize that activation of the
inhibitory l/vlPAG input to ZI elicits feeding by disinhibiting the ZI. Importantly, feasibility for all proposed aims is
demonstrated in preliminary data and our prior publications, and we have successfully collaborated with all
participating key personnel. Taken together, execution of these aims will establish the function of a novel bottom-
up midbrain-subthalamic pathway that is vital for food-seeking actions, having direct implications for
understanding feeding mechanisms."
10901473,"Antitumor responses of CD8+ T cells are tightly regulated by distinct metabolic fitness. It has been
reported that terminally differentiated exhausted T cells display impaired mitochondrial respiration
and/or glycolysis and such limited metabolic reserve reinforces T cell dysfunctionality especially
in the tumor microenvironment of advanced cancer. The molecular mechanism by which
sustaining metabolic fitness in highly differentiated effector T cells (TEFF) for enhancement of anti-
tumor immunity has been ill-defined. Interestingly, increased levels of glutathione (GSH) are
observed in the majority of tumors such as breast cancer and melanoma contributing to cancer
progression and treatment resistance in part by preventing glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4)
dependent ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death. However, the role of the GSH-
Gpx4 metabolic axis in modulating the antitumor response of CD8+ T cells remains elusive. Based
on the preliminary results we obtained, the central hypothesis is that sustaining the GSH-Gpx4
axis while inactivation of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is critical for the generation of long-lived
TEFF for durable metabolic responses against tumor cells, and bioengineering TEFF to conditionally
express Gclc/Gpx4 with A2AR inhibition improves in vivo persistence and function to prolong the
efficacy of adoptive cell therapy (ACT). To test this hypothesis, we will define the downstream
metabolic and cellular effects of sustaining the GSH-Gpx4 axis while inactivation of A2AR
signaling in TEFF cells, and further determine the safety and efficacy of adoptive therapy of murine
and human T cells bioengineered to express Gclc/Gpx4 with A2AR inhibition."
10904981,"The study of cancer has been predicated on the discovery of individual events, mechanisms, and processes that
are implicated in the malignant transformation of normal cells. The expectation has been that learning how
tumors arise would teach us how to defeat them, by providing pharmacologically actionable targets.
Unfortunately, while the etiology of many cancers has been elucidated in painstaking detail, curative therapies
for the more aggressive subtypes remain elusive. Indeed, once their regulatory and signaling logic is
dysregulated by events leading to transformation, cells are no longer constrained to well-defined physiologic
states but rather transition to a novel dysregulated and highly plastic landscape, where de-differentiation and
trans-differentiation events become common and novel synergies with other non-transformed cell populations
are forged, leading to the emergence of bona fide neomorphic organs. Thus, to study cancer, we must generate
cellular network models that are fully capable of recapitulating dynamic cell behavior and response to drug
perturbations, mutations, and interactions with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our prior research
suggests that identifying vulnerabilities that are more universal and less likely to be defeated by the cancer cell’s
remarkable adaptive nature will require a quantum leap in our ability to dissect and interrogate intra- and inter-
cellular network models that are predictive of the dynamic behavior of cancer as a bona fide neomorphic organ.
To address this challenge, we will create the first generation of genome- and proteome-wide network models
that can effectively predict the probabilistic, time-dependent response of mammalian cells to small molecule and
genetic perturbations, as well as their ability to plastically reprogram across the relatively small number of
molecularly distinct states detected in virtually all human malignancies. To achieve these goals, we will leverage
a repertoire of state-of-the-art experimental and computational advances, developed over the last six years with
R35 funding, for the creation of systematic, large-scale Transcriptional Regulator Knock-down (TREK) single cell
profiles at multiple time points following CRISPRi-mediated silencing of regulatory proteins. Owing to their
novelty and value, these reagents have already been distributed by Addgene to >270 labs. TREK data,
comprising hundreds of thousands to millions of individual molecular profiles and billions of individual molecular
readouts, will be used for causal network learning with intervention, allowing the assembly of probabilistic models
of cell regulation that effectively recapitulate the dynamic behavior of both normal and cancer-related cells, as
well as their interactions within the TME. By the end of the R35 funding cycle, we expect to be able to infer the
time-dependent activity of most regulatory and signaling proteins following arbitrary genetic or pharmacologic
perturbations, and to infer which proteins were affected by a perturbation based on generation of a small (n ≥ 6)
longitudinal series of scRNA-seq profiles. These new cellular network models will also allow rapid, systematic
elucidation of mechanisms that have been traditionally studied via low-throughput, hypothesis-driven assays."

This K23 proposal is designed to help Dr. Pederson achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent
investigator with expertise in developing and testing interventions that reduce mental health stigma, increase
engagement in mental health services, and improve mental health outcomes. The candidate and her mentors
have developed a comprehensive training plan: 1) to build her expertise in user-centered design and digital
mental health intervention development, so that she can engage end-users early in the intervention design
process both in this study and in future trials; 2) to expand her training in community engaged research to
address health disparities and promote engagement in mental health services; and 3) to bolster her skills in the
conduct of clinical trials and quantitative analysis of clinical trial data for a future R01 application centered on
implementing and testing a fully powered anti-stigma contact intervention. The efficacy and precision of anti-
stigma interventions to improve mental health outcomes among underserved Black adults are grossly limited
and represent a critical public health gap. Studies show stigma compounds disabilities related to the primary
symptoms of mental illness, and increases morbidity and premature mortality related to mental illness.
Compared with white adults, Black adults with mental illness have more chronic disease, and more severe
illness at presentation. Meta-analyses have consistently shown that both face-to-face and video based contact
with individuals with mental illness can reduce stigma. Recent studies that distinguished contact delivery
showed effect size for video-based contact to be comparable to face-to-face contact. Digital mental health also
offers a platform to overcome barriers to early access, implementation, and scalability. Strong preliminary data
identify mental illness stigma and medical mistrust as critical intervention targets that should be addressed in
order to increase mental health service utilization among Black adults. To address these gaps in the literature,
the following specific aims are proposed: 1) a user-centered design approach will be used to develop a self-
administered, video-based mobile app to reduce stigma and medical mistrust among Black adults; 2) a pilot
randomized trial design will be used to assess the feasibility and acceptability, and test the preliminary efficacy,
of a self-administered, video-based mobile app in reducing mental illness stigma among Black adults with
moderate to severe depression or anxiety; and 3) a causal mediation analysis will be used to estimate the
extent to which changes in anticipated/enacted/internalized stigma and medical mistrust mediate the
intervention’s effect on the primary and secondary outcomes. The key innovation of this proposal is that it will
be the first mobile health intervention focused on mental health stigma reduction using a targeted approach by
integrating user characteristics (such as race, ethnicity and religiosity), while addressing medical mistrust using
a robust user-centered design approach and targeting service utilization."
10902540,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of childhood disability, results from a non-progressive
disturbance to the developing brain and leads to impairments which negatively impact mobility and function.
Individuals with CP demonstrate abnormal reactions to anticipated (proactive) and unanticipated (reactive)
balance challenges, placing them at increased risk of falls. Adults with CP are 3.64x more likely to fall than
their typically developing peers, and the incidence of falls in children with CP is similarly increased. Balance
control is worsened with the addition of a secondary (dual) cognitive task. This causes cognitive-motor
interference, which results when motor and cognitive tasks are competing for the same resources and leads to
degradation in performance of one or both tasks. These cognitive-motor tasks mimic daily life situations such as
walking and talking with friends, and the difficulty that children with CP experience in these situations leads to
declines in participation and function. Previous work has investigated this cognitive-motor dual task paradigm;
however, all studies have utilized proactive balance challenges, with the primary motor tasks of balance or
straight path ambulation. Evaluation of a more functional proactive balance task, such as obstacle negotiation,
is needed in the context of a cognitive-motor dual task situation. Additionally, previous studies have shown that
children with CP fall more and have decreased stability during single task reactive balance challenges; however,
this single task condition requires the addition of a secondary task to become functionally relevant and mimic
daily life scenarios. Our specific aims will address these mechanistic and participatory gaps in the literature by
investigating: (1) proactive balance control through negotiation of an overground obstacle in single and dual
task conditions, in children with CP compared to TDC; (2) reactive balance control through stance slip-like
treadmill induced perturbations in single and dual task, in children with CP compared to TDC; and (3) the
correlation between balance control and participation in mobility-related habits of daily life in children with
CP utilizing the LIFE-H, linking the biomechanical and mechanistic laboratory findings (Aims 1 +2) to participation
and quality of life (Aim 3) for children with CP. We hypothesize that children with CP will demonstrate decreased
stability and greater falls in both single and dual task conditions when compared to TDC, and that both groups
will experience these declines in performance, when compared to themselves, in dual task conditions. The
results from this study will be integral in establishing the mechanisms underlying balance control during functional
proactive and reactive balance challenges, and how this stability correlates with overall mobility-based
participation for children with CP. This will provide valuable insights for developing effective clinical interventions
and improving the quality of life and participation of children with CP. The findings will contribute to the design of
future research paradigms and facilitate the translation of intervention strategies into clinical practice."

Visual system dysfunction is a common and debilitating comorbidity for individuals diagnosed with a variety of
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The microbiome is emerging as an important determinant of brain
development, and recent research links these NDDs to intestinal dysbiosis, suggesting that a normal
microbiome is a necessary component of typical brain neurodevelopment and function. To further connect
these issues, microbial dysbiosis is also frequently associated with visual system dysfunction, yet practically
nothing is known about the mechanisms by which the microbiota impacts visual system development.
Therefore, a greater understanding of the dynamics between host and microbiome, including the specific
cellular pathways and microbial products influencing neurodevelopment, is needed before effective treatments
can be pursued. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that normal development of the visual system
depends on sensing of specific secreted bacterial factors by specific cell types that mediate
communication between the intestinal microbiome and the brain. To accomplish this, I will use the
gnotobiotic zebrafish model to investigate how the microbiome interacts with intestinal cells and peripheral
neurons to impact early visual neurodevelopment. This is a simple but powerful model system because it
allows us to test the role that individual bacterial species and their byproducts play in neurodevelopment. I will
use three approaches to determine the role specific host cell types and secreted bacterial products play in
visual system development and its downstream behavioral output. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the
microbiota is required for the normal development and function of a set of superficial interneurons involved in
prey capture behavior. Aim 2 investigates the role of gut epithelial sensory cells and the vagus nerve in
sensing bacterial products and relaying this information to promote visual system development. In Aim 3, I will
identify the active product secreted from a gut bacterium that is sufficient to promote visual system
development. These approaches allow an unbiased identification of the anatomical locations, cell types, and
signaling pathways that relay microbial cues required for normal development of the visual system and its
behavioral outputs. This work is significant because it lays the foundation for understanding mechanisms
behind visual comorbidities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD, and ultimately serves to
better inform intervention and treatment, and to one day prevent these complex NDDs and their associated
comorbidities."

 Lymphedema, a condition characterized by swelling and impaired lymphatic flow, affects a significant
portion of the global population, particularly individuals undergoing cancer treatments involving
lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy. Despite its prevalence, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding
of the underlying mechanisms driving lymphedema progression and the most effective treatment strategies. This
project seeks to address these challenges through a multidisciplinary approach that combines biomechanics,
computational modeling, and experimental data.
 The primary focus of this research is to study the lymphatic flow dynamics and adaptations in response
to lymphaticovenous anastomoses (LVA), a surgical intervention commonly used to treat lymphedema. By
collaborating with Chang-Gung Hospital, we have gained access to invaluable clinical data, including declassified
patient data, which allows us to investigate the outcomes and impacts of both antegrade and retrograde
anastomoses in treating lower limb lymphedema. This novel analysis platform provides unique insights into
lymphatic function in vivo in humans, and we employ non-invasive imaging techniques to quantify lymphatic
pump dynamics.
 Our research leverages a theoretical framework that integrates a lumped parameter model for
lymphangion function and lymph transport, a microstructurally-motivated constitutive model for the mechanical
behavior of isolated lymphatic vessels, and innovative models for acute mechanically-mediated vasoreactive
adaptations and long-term volumetric growth. We simulate changes in muscle contractility and geometry of a
single isolated lymphatic vessel in response to sustained elevation in afterload to understand the acute and long-
term adaptations to mechanical loading.
 Furthermore, we develop computational models to investigate the effects of growth and remodeling
(G&R) processes in the lymphatic vessel network in response to elevated loading conditions caused by LVA.
This multi-scale approach considers the biomechanics at the tissue and cellular levels, aiming to determine the
causative factors behind lymphatic failure and the potential impact of LVA on lymphangion loading.
 Through this project, we aim to gain deeper insights into the mechanosensitivity of the lymphatic
vasculature and the implications of shear stress and pressure on lymphatic contractility. The findings from our
research have the potential to advance our understanding of lymphatic flow regulation and the adaptation
process in response to various loading conditions. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to improved treatment
strategies for lymphedema patients and potentially pave the way for more effective biomedical engineering
interventions."

Reduced bone strength is a hallmark of many bone disorders, including osteoporosis, a debilitating disease
affecting millions of Americans. The strength of bone is influenced by multiple characteristics of bone including
microarchitecture, biomechanical properties (e.g., stiffness), and bone mineral density (BMD). Genome-wide
association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified over 1100 independent associations for BMD.
However, BMD is the only bone strength trait investigated using large-scale GWASs. This is largely due to the
inability to directly measure bone strength in vivo and quantify other strength-related traits in humans at scale.
The sole focus on BMD has limited the development of a comprehensive understanding of the genetics of
bone strength. Here, we propose to use Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to address this limitation. We will perform
GWAS in ~5792 mice (an ~9-fold increase in our current sample size) to significantly increase our power for
association detection. The following three specific aims will identify novel genes influencing bone strength. In
Aim 1, we will perform GWAS for bone strength and multiple strength-related traits in 5792 DO mice and utilize
an extensive set of transcriptomics data on bone to identify causal genes. In Aim 2, we will use DO bone
strength mapping data to inform human bone mineral density GWAS. In Aim 3, we will validate the role of
multiple candidate genes using in vitro and in vivo approaches. We will begin by investigating the role of eyes
absent homolog 4 (Eya4) in the regulation of bone strength. In this project we will significantly expand a proven
resource to discover new genes impacting bone strength – the most clinically relevant feature of bone, but one
that cannot be studied directly in humans. Our approach will significantly expand gene discovery efforts and
has the potential to identify dozens of new bone strength loci. These efforts will not only increase our
understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying bone strength, but point to new therapeutic targets for
the prevention and treatment of low bone strength and skeletal fragility."

Sexual and gender minorities are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at an earlier age than
heterosexuals. One of the reasons is that emerging adult (18-29) young sexual and gender minorities (YSGM)
have higher rates of harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors (CHB; e.g., physical inactivity, dysregulated
sleep, smoking, and alcohol use) than cisgender heterosexuals. One key factor that leads to increased rates of
harmful CHB within YSGM is exposure to intersectional discrimination (i.e., the experiences of discrimination
occurring amid multiple identities and/or positions [e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation]).
Although there is currently research demonstrating links between intersectional discrimination and
cardiometabolic health behaviors among SGM, much of this research cannot characterize the experiences and
effects of intersectional discrimination on CHB in ways that reflect the lived experience of race, place, and
identity among YSGM. Thus, to better understand the contextual features that influence intersectional
discrimination on CHB, we will employ a geographically explicit ecological momentary assessment (GEMA)
and a qualitative mapping approach. This approach will help to reveal the rich, context specific, experiences of
intersectional discrimination, protective social and interpersonal factors, and CHB across and within different
racial groups of YSGM. The qualitative mapping method involves making maps of participant activities based
on their geolocation and EMA data (gathered via GEMA) and then conducting an in-depth qualitative interview
to explore participants’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences while in the mapped locations. This approach is
critically important as YSGM experience unique exposures to intersectional discrimination based on the
geographical locations in which they travel, while also having differing appraisals of discrimination experiences
based on the features of these spaces (e.g., time spent in them, purpose [school, home, work], safety). Our
overarching approach is to utilize GEMA and qualitative mapping to understand the complex relationships
between environmental and interpersonal experiences of intersectional discrimination and related CHB
behaviors for YSGM. Specifically, this study aims to; 1) examine how daily experiences of intersectional
discrimination and CHB differ by level of structural inequality, measured by the combination of individual GPS
and census data among YSGM; 2) examine how social protections (e.g., community relationships, social
cohesion) buffer the negative effects of intersectional discrimination on CHB among YSGM; and 3) explore
context-specific risks/protective factors associated with CHB across different racial/ethnic groups of YSGM
using GEMA methodology. In all, our innovative approach allows reporting of experiences of intersectional
discrimination in real time while also considering the situational factors that are associated with these
experiences to improve external validity. This study is significant because it will inform tailored harmful CHB
prevention interventions for diverse groups of YSGM, including future Just in Time interventions."

Only 17% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) meet the recommended target for hemoglobin A1c,
placing them at high risk for acute and long-term complications of T1D. Thus, there is a critical need for novel
approaches to improve diabetes management in adolescents with T1D. Insufficient and poor-quality sleep
decrease insulin sensitivity, worsen glycemic outcomes and compromise executive function in adolescents,
reducing their ability to effectively manage T1D. In other populations, sleep disturbances are linked to reduced
brain matter integrity and to novel cerebrospinal fluid glymphatic flow. The glymphatic system is a recently
characterized brain-wide interstitial fluid drainage pathway that enables metabolic waste clearance from the
brain, particularly during sleep. Glymphatic clearance occurs through a network of perivascular spaces, and
dysfunction is associated with cognitive impairment. White matter integrity and perivascular fluid, a marker of
glymphatic flow, can be measured through quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to assess,
for the first time, how disordered sleep may impact brain health in adolescents with T1D. Aim 1. Building on our
pilot work in this population, we will evaluate the effects of a sleep-promoting intervention for adolescents (age
11-17) with T1D on sleep duration and timing via a randomized controlled trial. Our central hypothesis is that
adolescents randomized to the Sleep Coach intervention will exhibit significantly longer sleep duration and
reduced sleep variability as compared to those who receive enhanced usual care. Aim 2: We will evaluate the
effects of a sleep-promoting intervention on executive function and glycemic outcomes (HbA1c, Time in
Range) and diabetes management. Hypotheses: adolescents randomized to the Sleep Coach intervention will
demonstrate improved executive function, improved HbA1c and Time in Range and better diabetes
management, as assessed by validated measures, compared to those who receive enhanced usual care. Aim
3: We will explore whether brain glymphatic flow, assessed via quantitative diffusion tensor imaging along
perivascular spaces with MRI, increases among adolescents with T1D in parallel with increased sleep duration.
We will also assess whether adolescents with increased glymphatic flow exhibit improved executive function
skills. This exploratory aim will aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which disrupted sleep may impair
cognitive function in T1D. Our multidisciplinary team includes a pediatric psychologist, a pediatric neurologist, a
pediatric endocrinologist, and a pediatric neuroradiologist, an imaging physicist and a pediatric sleep expert.
Our Children’s Diabetes Program serves a large, diverse population of children with T1D with a strong history
of clinical research leadership and participation of youth with T1D and their families. This project has the
potential to influence standards of clinical care for adolescents with T1D by rigorously studying a behavioral
sleep intervention to improve diabetes management and executive function and elucidate mechanisms by
which sleep may improve brain health and ultimately T1D outcomes."
10889481,"Project Summary. Until recently, sphingolipids within the microbial environment have been attributed to host
association, as the conventional wisdom was that bacteria did not contain their own biosynthetic pathways to
produce them. Recently, members of our team uncovered a new bacterial sphingolipid pathway involving an acyl
carrier protein similar to that of fatty acid synthase (FAS). This new acyl carrier protein, AcpSP, appears to play
a role distinct from its FAS progenitor, AcpP, whose primary purpose lies in de novo fatty acid synthesis.
Remarkably, AcpSP shares less than 30% sequence identity to AcpP, suggesting a unique activity and
interaction landscape than that of AcpP. We have identified AcpSP and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) within
in many pathogenic bacteria, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli (studied herein), Staphylococcus
aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that this
pathway may be involved in pathogenesis. In this program, our team applies a suite of chemical and structural
biology tools originally developed for the study of AcpP in order to explore the interaction of AcpSP with its
partner enzymes. Using a combination of chemical probes and structure-based methods, we will characterize
the interface between AcpSP and SPT, the first key step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. To further explore the
cryptic interactions between sphingolipid biosynthesis and FAS, we will deploy a systems-wide structural
analysis to detail AcpSP interactions with de novo FAS enzymes. This program provides an essential step toward
understanding bacterial sphingolipid biosynthesis and its role in pathogenesis and will likely provide important
new targets for future drug discovery."
10891658,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As the population of childhood cancer survivors grows, the impact of long-term treatment-related side effects
also grows. Cancer treatments for children with leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) have long-lasting
toxic effects on the developing brain, known as neurocognitive late effects, which can impact the children’s
learning, function, and ability to achieve independence as adults. However, these problems are often untreated
in leukemia and LL survivors, creating a medically underserved population. Recognizing the impact of familial
factors on survivor outcomes, we designed a parent-directed training intervention (the high-intensity intervention
program, HIP), which teaches parents about brain development and neurocognitive late effects; trains them on
tools to improve their child’s behavior and cognitive functioning; provides tips for establishing better learning
environments and effective study habits; and helps them to manage stress for themselves and their children.
Pilot trials of the HIP in English- and Spanish-speaking families demonstrated efficacy but also revealed critical
barriers to success, including travel time and scheduling challenges. Digital health technologies offer
transformative solutions to improve the efficiency, quality, and convenience of healthcare delivery. However,
“eHealth” has not been applied to a parent-directed intervention to improve educational outcomes for children.
Therefore, we propose to test a new eHealth version of our English/Spanish intervention (HIP-eHealth) in a
randomized clinical trial of 180 parent/child dyads from 4 sites in California. HIP-eHealth addresses the remaining
barriers to HIP access and incorporates improvements recommended by parents in our earlier trials. We will
deliver HIP-eHealth from a single central site (City of Hope) through a HIPAA-compliant study website that hosts
Zoom videoconferencing for HIP sessions; digitized study content; supplemental multimedia content; links to the
award-winning IXL learning environment; gamification features and automated reminders to increase
engagement; and robust user analytics. Other advances include a streamlined 4-session program, an enhanced
booster phase, and greater inclusion of the children. We hypothesize that HIP-eHealth will produce greater
improvements in child and parent outcomes than a lower-intensity program (LIP) that mimics the usual care
provided to survivors of pediatric brain tumors (i.e., a single meeting to discuss the child’s neuropsychological
testing results and provide recommendations for optimal learning). Our study aims to: (1) Evaluate the
effectiveness of HIP-eHealth on the learning and school performance of pediatric cancer survivors; (2) Evaluate
the effectiveness of HIP-eHealth on the “pro-learning” efficacy of their parents; (3) Investigate the extent to which
the parents’ efficacy and/or children’s use of online learning activities is associated with changes in the children’s
school performance; and (4) Assess factors that impact the parents’ ability to complete the intervention. We
anticipate this study will help shape a scalable and effective therapy that is easily integrated into standard care."

The proposed Hematology Central Coordinating Center (HCCC) will take advantage of our broad base
expertise of established hematology researchers to set up a centralized site for investigators to find NIDDK-
sponsored Collaborative Center of Excellence in Hematology (CCEH) Core Technology resources, Pilot &
Feasibility funding opportunities, educational materials, standardized protocols and connect with other
investigators. The goals of the collaborative center are to provide the tools for individual CCEHs to expand
their influence by providing standardized protocols to improve reproducibility, a platform for data sharing,
collaborative connections and administering a robust Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) program that is available to
laboratories nationwide. We will provide timely announcements regarding information/education opportunities
offered at each of the CCEHs. We aim to increase exposure of the resources available at CCEHs to recruit
additional researchers to the nonmalignant hematology field. The HCCC will provide multipronged
communication approaches (website, social media, newsletter, email, webinars, YouTube videos) to improve
the visibility of the state-of-the-art technologies available at CCEHs. We will expand on the success of our
established Collaborative P&F program. Applications will be solicited, reviewed and awarded in a time
sensitive manner. This improved P&F program will increase grant applications and leverage more funding
dollars for hematology research. The HCCC Education and Outreach program will use novel approaches such
as “Meet the Expert” webinars to provide a real-time exchange of information and ideas that promotes
innovative solutions to important questions that will rapidly advance this science. The HCCC will also provide
materials; posters, brochures, handouts and general slide sets to CCEHs and NIDDK program staff to
advertise these programs at national meetings. The overarching goal of these programs is to support and
expand the national research effort to combat nonmalignant hematologic diseases and focus areas of
hematopoiesis."
10899686,"Although patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) have increased disability, morbidity, and mortality, no current
FDA-approved medications for SSc prevent or reverse fibrosis. Our long-term goal is to understand how E2
influences fibrosis in SSc, which provides the rationale for using medications that inhibit E2 production and
signaling (aromatase inhibitors and fulvestrant, respectively) for SSc treatment. The overall objectives of this
proposal are to identify the estrogen receptors (ERs) needed for E2-induced fibrosis, the transcriptomic
alterations caused by E2 and ER signaling in human skin, and any associations between systemic E2 levels and
disease outcomes. The central hypothesis is that hormonal dysregulation promotes dermal fibrosis through time-
dependent signal propagation via ER(s), leading to increased pro-fibrotic gene transcription and worse SSc
clinical outcomes. The rationale for this project is to understand how E2 leads to fibrosis by incorporating the
cellular, transcriptomic and systemic effects of estradiol. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific
aims: (1) Identify the contribution of ERs in E2-induced dermal fibrosis; (2) Determine the novel transcriptomic
profile of E2-induced dermal fibrosis ex vivo; and (3) Determine associations between hormonal dysregulation
and clinical outcomes in SSc. In the first aim, we will use 3 models to examine how ERs affect fibrosis: human
and mouse primary dermal fibroblasts in vitro, ERα-null and GPER1 KO mice in vivo, and human skin tissue ex
vivo. In the second aim, we will stimulate human skin with E2 at various time points to assess differential gene
expression using mRNA seq and determine which ERs are responsible for these specific transcriptomic
alterations. In the third aim, we will compare levels of the sex hormones E2, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and
testosterone in African American and Caucasian patients with limited SSc and diffuse SSc as well as in healthy
controls and estimate associations among hormonal level, autoantibody status, and clinical measures of disease
severity. The project is innovative because understanding the role of ERs (ERα isoforms and GPER1) in fibrosis
and discovering clinical associations between sex hormones and SSc raise the prospect of using systemic
hormonal levels as a biomarker for SSc disease characteristics, severity and prognosis. The proposed research
is significant because it provides the basis for using estrogen modulators to treat SSc. My long-term career goal
is to understand the relationship between SSc-related fibrosis and estrogen using basic science and clinical
research, with the hope of developing personalized medicine targets. To accomplish this goal, I will obtain
training in receptor signaling biology, bioinformatic data interpretation and clinical research. MUSC contains
resources such as the Core Center for Clinical Research and the CTSA-sponsored South Carolina Clinical &
Translational Research Institute which provide necessary research support and career development. My mentor
and co-mentor, advisory committee and the Division of Rheumatology all foster a supportive environment,
allowing for successful completion of this proposal and continued progression toward independence."
10899831,"The University at Buffalo (UB) NIMHD Center of Excellence in Investigator Development and Community
Engagement will provide well-coordinated, careful mentoring, didactic training, and professional development
individually tailored to each scholar’s needs. The education and training components of the Center of Excellence
will fill a critical gap in our minority health and health disparities research environment by bringing comprehensive
and rigorous training and mentoring in the discipline. This Center of Excellence will be the only formal training
program in minority health and health disparities research at UB, bringing an enormously important resource to
our training environment. The Center of Excellence will function as a centralized training center bringing
coordination and communication to this key element of advancing health disparities research locally and
nationally. The Investigator Development Core (IDC) will attract, mentor and train early-career investigators from
a broad range of disciplines in transdisciplinary research in minority health and health disparities, including
offering the opportunity to apply for pilot studies awards addressing health inequities and social determinants of
health in the Buffalo region (Aim 1). Two of the most important elements for early-stage investigators to
successfully establish their own independent research program are 1) training and mentoring, and 2) funding to
support the development of preliminary results to be competitive for larger extramural grants. Our IDC is
designed with these goals in mind. Because of lack of diversity in the health disparities research workforce, many
researchers lack the insight that lived experiences bring to understanding systemic racism and the effects of
discrimination and their impact on health disparities. A diverse workforce is more successful in engaging people
from underrepresented groups in research and relevant stakeholders in policy making. Research related to
racism and discrimination requires a multidisciplinary, broadly engaged, team science approach, which merges
team science and community engagement. With this in mind, we will implement a diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility (DEIA) Action Plan and leverage the resources and expertise of the proposed Center of Excellence
to increase and diversify our workforce, especially in health disparities research (Aim 2). Our IDC will provide
expert training and mentoring in rigorous research design, methodology, statistical analysis, and community-
based participatory research to early-career investigators to support their research and advance their careers in
minority health and health disparities research (Aim 3). One theme of our Center of Excellence is integration of
community throughout. We will assist early-career researchers in engaging community members on their
research team and/or as a member of their mentoring team. Our vision for the next five years is that our Center
of Excellence will facilitate the training of a more diverse faculty from more disciplines to perform innovative
research in minority health and health disparities to advance their careers to independence and to create
systemic change to reduce health inequities in Buffalo and beyond."
10900470,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application is in response to PAR-19-183: Biology of Bladder Cancer. Muscle invasive bladder cancer
(MIBC) claims approximately 18,000 deaths annually in the United States. Funding and research devoted to
this cancer-type are significantly under-proportioned. An unmet clinical need for MIBC treatment lies in the
poor patient response towards chemotherapy, with treatments providing only a dismal 5% improvement in
overall survival. The long-term goal of this application is to address this urgent need for adjuvant therapies
to improve chemotherapeutic response. The success of chemotherapy is historically thought to solely depend
on its direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. However, there is growing evidence, as shown by our own
research and others, that chemotherapeutic efficacy is also dependent on 1) successful prevention of cancer
stem cells in repopulating residual tumors and 2) an effective anti-tumoral immune response. These two
phenomena are often investigated separately but their possible synergy has been overlooked. Our research
project is conceptually innovative to examine a common upstream pathway that regulates both tumor
repopulation and immune response. We hypothesize that the inhibition of this common pathway will provide
an effective therapeutic target for clinical translation. Our specific aims include: Aim 1) Decipher this pathway
by investigating the non-canonical downstream mechanism leading to the extracellular release of pleiotropic
factors. This is significant, since these extracellular factors can modulate both tumor repopulation and
immune response. Aim 2) Evaluate how these extracellular factors and their cognate receptors drive the
repopulation of quiescent cancer stem cells. Aim 3) Investigate how inhibition of this upstream pathway can
collectively abrogate tumor repopulation and immunosuppression, and thus, enhance chemotherapeutic
response. Success of this proposal will pose drug targets capable of augmenting patient response to
chemotherapy. Moreover, these findings will provide insights to how these drugs can reestablish an
immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment in MIBCs. In summary, the studies outlined in this proposal are
significant to address an unmet need, i.e., to improve a dismal response of MIBC patients to standard
chemotherapy. The conceptual advance from this study will likely extend beyond MIBC to benefit patients
from other epithelial malignancies."

Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial
infarction, strokes, and heart failure leading to tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factor
modification such as weight loss, reductions in hyperlipidemia and hypertension constitute the only preventive
strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes
that provide mechanistic insight. Recent work by us and others has renewed interest in the role of the
autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Various lines of evidence demonstrate a progressive
dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosome system of plaque macrophages suggesting that attempts at
reprogramming the degradative capacity of macrophages might be a fruitful therapeutic area. Our work with
TFEB, the predominant transcription factor regulating autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis, shows that enhancing
its function in macrophages leads to reductions in atherosclerosis. A critical TFEB target is the autophagy
chaperone p62/SQSTM1 which mediates the removal of cytotoxic protein aggregates. Our work has shown
that clearance of the p62-enriched cargo in macrophages is a novel therapeutic strategy. In specific aim 1, we
will determine the predominant p62-dependent autophagic processes in macrophages that underlie TFEB-
mediated atheroprotection. In specific aim 2, we explore the potential atheroprotective benefits of HSP104, a
novel disaggregase system mostly studied in simple organisms. This approach will be complementary to the
autophagy studies since it is a completely autophagy-independent mechanism of clearing macrophage protein
aggregates. Overall, this proposal will test the hypothesis that harnessing the macrophage degradative
response to clear protein aggregates can be a novel approach to treat atherosclerosis."
10900580,"Project Summary
 Optogenetics is a powerful tool for relating brain function to behavior because it enables cell-
type specific manipulation of neurons with millisecond temporal precision and artifact-free neural
recordings. Such capabilities are particularly needed in studies using non-human primates
(NHPs), where sophisticated behavioral techniques are commonly employed but
neurophysiological tools have lagged those used in other model species. While the use of
optogenetics in NHPs has grown rapidly in recent years, the full power of the technique requires
the ability to perform large-scale, bi-directional study of neural circuits. Systems to achieve this
have become widely used in other animal models, particularly mice, while there have been limited
systems implemented in NHPs. In this proposal, a large-scale, high-density, and stable
optoelectric neural interface (smart dura) for large brains will be developed and validated in
macaques, for the first time. This novel interface enables simultaneous electrical recording from
4096 electrodes and optical stimulation in 4096 sites over about 5 cm2 of cortex, which is more
than two orders of magnitude higher than the state-of-the-art technology. As opposed to existing
surface electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode arrays, the proposed neural interface is in the form
of an artificial dura that monolithically embeds electrical recording and optical stimulation
functionalities such that it can permanently replace the native dura as a chronic, seamless neural
interface, while maintaining the natural cranial pressure. Therefore, this novel design combines
the best of passive/static artificial dura windows and functional surface electrode arrays in one
unified platform. The proposed smart dura enables long-term recording, provides new
opportunities for creating sophisticated closed-loop stimulation and recording paradigms, and
advances the development of new stimulation-based therapies. The smart dura can be implanted
as a stable port into large brains and consists of high-density recording electrodes as well as
optical micro light sources all embedded in a hybrid biocompatible polymer platform. In this
project, a novel fabrication process will be designed to implement the proposed large-scale (5
cm2) smart dura in two stages of: i) Fabricating high-density transparent electrical smart dura for
electrophysiology recording and external optical access (transparent electric dura: transparent e-
dura), enabled by high resolution interconnects (300 nm features). ii) The optoelectric dura (oe-
dura) consisting of high-density recording electrodes and embedded micro light emitting diodes
(µLEDs). In each stage of the device development, the neural interface will be tested in two
hemispheres of two monkeys, with large optogenetic expression of activating opsin (ChR2) in
sensorimotor cortex via electrophysiology recording, behavior, and imaging. The proposed smart
dura will greatly enhance the opportunities for closed-loop optogenetic experiments in macaques,
which can serve as a powerful tool for understanding brain function and for developing novel
therapeutic interventions that can be translated to humans. After successful demonstration of the
smart dura in this proposal, the results can be extended in future to i) develop even larger
interfaces that cover the whole brain for translational use ii) integrate recording, stimulation,
processing, communication and power-transfer electronics into the smart dura to enable
tetherless chronic neural interfacing with freely-moving subjects."
10900594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has expanded therapeutic options in disorders of movement, cognition, and
mood. DBS is even beginning to be used to treat both motor and neuropsychiatric disorders in children.
Several years ago, inspired by a study showing DBS can improve memory in Alzheimer's disease, my lab
tested forniceal DBS in a mouse model of Rett Syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that
affects the entire brain, producing intellectual disability, motor, and affective abnormalities. One ramification of
MeCP2 loss is the reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, we found that forniceal DBS stimulated
neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and dramatically rescued hippocampal memory in RTT mice. While
suggestive, no direct causality has been drawn between DBS-induced neurogenesis and enhanced memory.
Moreover, given that new neurons are born daily, and DBS is applied over a two-week period, it is conceivable
that DBS is not only stimulating the generation of newborn neurons but also influencing their maturation and
integration into the hippocampal circuit. Identifying a link between DBS, neurogenesis and the integration of
newborn neurons is critical to understanding how DBS is enhancing hippocampal memory. Furthermore,
although DBS induced neurogenesis may account for memory improvements in RTT, it is insufficient to explain
how DBS of the nuclei in the basal ganglia, where neurogenesis does not occur, improves motor function. Our
preliminary data show that DBS applied to the dorsal striatum improves the motor symptoms of RTT mice. We
will capitalize on this progress to understand DBS effects in two different types of neurons and two different
neural circuits in the same genetic context. In Aim 1, we will first examine the causation between forniceal DBS
induced hippocampal neurogenesis and the memory enhancement. Then, we will determine how forniceal
DBS affects the maturation and functioning of the newborn hippocampal neurons. In Aim 2, we will determine
the duration of motor benefits induced by chronic striatal DBS and optimize the frequency of DBS treatment.
Then we will elucidate the possible mechanisms of striatal DBS on motor benefits at the neuronal and circuit
levels as well as the role of midbrain dopaminergic signaling in the benefits. Collectively, these studies will
generate proof-of-concept data to validate DBS as an intervention to treat RTT and, potentially, other
neurodevelopmental diseases."

Lyme disease, one of the most commonly reported infectious diseases in North America, is
caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borreliella burgdorferi. Although humans and other large
mammals can be infected by B. burgdorferi, in order to complete its life-cycle in the wild the
bacteria relies on rodent reservoirs, the major one being Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed
deermouse. The role of P. leucopus in Lyme disease and several other tick-borne diseases is
analogous to that of bats as reservoirs for SARS coronaviruses and Ebola virus. In this proposal
we continue the development of P. leucopus as an emerging genetic model system for the study
of infectious and other diseases by maintaining and expanding genomic and biological
resources for this species. These resources are the starting point for any gene-focused
experiments in the Peromyscus genus. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify
segregating genetic factors that impact the competence of P. leucopus as a reservoir of B.
burgdorferi. The trait of reservoir competence is measured as the prevalence of infection and
corresponding bacterial burdens among a cohort of nymphs that had molted from larvae
previously fed on experimentally-infected deermice. Secondary endpoints include rates of
growth and decline of the bacteria in the blood and skin of the animals and selected host
responses, such as antibodies to the agent and inflammation of tissues, over the time course of
the infection. It would normally be extremely difficult to carry-out large-scale genotyping and/or
genetic crosses in an emerging rodent model. Here we show that our genome assembly for P.
leucopus in concert with low pass short read sequences from a long-term closed colony of
deermice can be leveraged to accurately impute SNP and haplotype genotypes on a genome-
wide scale. These genotypes are then used to identify genes contributing to the remarkable
capacity of P. leucopus to serve as a key reservoir host for B. burgdorferi and other disease
agents. Finally, a subset of identified genes will be validated via CRISPR/Cas9 gene knock-outs
in P. leucopus spearheaded by the person who pioneered transgenics for this genus. The
identification of reservoir competence mediating genes may suggest better interventions to
block transmission and provide insights into the management of human infections."

 The long term goal of our research program is to understand at an atomic level the
mechanisms by which lipids regulate human G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activity, and in turn
learn how GPCRs influence their surrounding membrane environment. GPCRs drive many
physiological processes and represent the largest family of “druggable” protein targets. Drug binding
and GPCR signaling are both allosterically regulated by the surrounding cellular environment through
receptor-lipid interactions. Such membrane-protein interactions are ubiquitous within the cell and
have well documented roles in physiology, however, little is known about the structural mechanisms
by which membranes regulate GPCR function. The need to address this gap in knowledge is
heightened by more recent studies associating GPCR-lipid interactions with cell-specific drug
responses and revealing critical roles of GPCR-lipid interactions in a wide range of diseases,
including Alzheimers’ disease, cancers, and heart disease. Our research will capture the different
roles by which lipids regulate GPCR function, both as specific chemical partners and through the bulk
physical and chemical properties of lipids, by integrating unique capabilities of solution and solid state
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with additional biophysical tools and correlative functional
assays. Initial efforts are directed at two lines of investigation aimed at addressing the most
immediate and important questions regarding receptor-lipid interactions. In the first, we will determine
how lipids modulate drug binding and signal transduction for the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR), a
representative model GPCR that shares structural and functional characteristics with many
rhodopsin-like receptors. These studies will reveal how lipids impact protein dynamics, alter activation
“hotspots”, and regulate formation of signaling complexes. Integrating this new data with available
pharmacology and crystal structures will provide a new conceptual framework for interpreting cell-
specific drug responses. In the second direction, we will determine the structural mechanisms by
which membrane lipids allosterically modulate signaling of the smoothened receptor (SMO), a
hedgehog signaling protein and validated cancer target. SMO functions in primary cilia, specialized
organelles packed with sensory proteins that act as cellular “antenna”. An emerging concept is that
ciliary membrane composition is fine-tuned for receptor function, yet little is actually known about the
properties of receptor-lipid interactions in ciliary membranes. Our work will reveal for the first time
how both specific lipids and bulk lipid properties regulate SMO signaling complexes. Together, these
lines of investigation will reveal basic principles of lipid-mediated allostery and set the stage for long
term efforts to apply these principles to design drugs targeting specific receptor-lipid interactions."

Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared
to the general population. Immune activation, particularly driven by coinfections, is considered an important
contributor in that enhanced risk. However, whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) coinfection increases
CVD risk in PLWH is unknown. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) affects a quarter of the world population,
with coinfection rates as high as 50% in HIV-endemic areas. Our preliminary data point towards an important
role of LTBI in augmenting CVD risk. In HIV-uninfected individuals, we have demonstrated that LTBI is
associated with increased likelihood of acute myocardial infarction and higher prevalence of obstructive
coronary artery disease, independent of traditional CVD risk factors. In proof-of-concept mouse experiments,
we revealed that persistent, asymptomatic mycobacterial infection exacerbated aortic plaque development,
and that plaque burden directly correlated with alterations of monocyte populations. Our overall hypothesis is
that in PLWH, LTBI coinfection contributes to the development of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) through
enhanced immune activation and pro-inflammatory stimuli resulting in increased plaque burden and instability.
In this project, we will study PLWH with and without LTBI in Lima, Peru, a TB-endemic area. In Aim 1 of this
proposal, we will define the burden of obstructive coronary artery disease and plaque vulnerability in PLWH
with LTBI using advanced coronary computed tomography angiography studies. In Aim 2, we will determine
how LTBI and LTBI treatment affects the activation, function, and metabolic profile of monocytes and Mtb-
specific T cells in PLWH, using high-dimensional multi-parameter spectral flow cytometry for in-depth
longitudinal immune cell profiling. Finally, we will study the relationship between variations on immune
activation markers and changes on coronary plaque volume over 2 years. Successful accomplishment of the
proposed research aims will define the role of LTBI as a contributor of ASCVD risk and immune activation in
PLWH. Our results will set the stage for targeted mechanistic studies and interventional trials aimed at safely
reducing underlying immune activation in PLWH with LTBI, and emphasize the importance of LTBI control as a
therapeutic strategy to mitigate ASCVD risk. Moreover, the knowledge gained will further enhance our broader
mechanistic understanding of ASCVD."
10902035,"ABSTRACT
Many RAS-transformed aggressive cancer cells are able to escape cytotoxic chemotherapy and survive in
near-starvation conditions. One adaptation making them hard to kill is their ability to scavenge extracellular
proteins and recycle the cellular components using autophagy, both of which are then digested in lysosomes to
recover free amino acids. The process of scavenging and internalization is known as macropinocytosis, and
cancer cells aquire mutations to upregulate it when faced with nutrient-poor conditions. To fight such cancers,
researchers are currently targeting the macropinocytosis machinery; however, because this process is not very
well studied, and likely involves hundreds of proteins with redundant functions, such therapy might prove
challenging to exectute without involving multiple drugs. We propose a better way of targeting
nutrient-scavenging cancers by focusing on a downstream process of releasing digested nutrients from
lysosomes to cytosol. The Sabatini Lab showed that the release of digested amino acids from lysosomes is
orchestrated by the mTORC1 pathway, and specifically by SLC38A9. This lysosomal membrane protein
senses the rising levels of digested amino acids in lysosomes by directly binding arginine. Our lab found that
this sensing is coupled to activation of the transporter function, and results in the efflux of essential non-polar
amino-acids, such as leucine, from lysosomes to cytosol. Importantly, RAS-transformed pancreatic cancer
cells that feed on extracellular protein were unable to efficiently form tumors in the absence of SLC38A9.
These results present a novel therapeutic idea of targeting a metabolic vulnerability in cancers transformed by
oncogenic RAS signaling. In this five-year project we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of releasing
digested amino acids from lysosomes to cytosol via SLC38A9, and therefore provide a rational approach to
drug discovery. In parallel to that, we will screen for small molecules that specifically bind to SLC38A9, and
develop them into chemical probes that modulate its transport activity. Impaired efflux function of SLC38A9 will
lead to entrapment of macropinocytosis-derived amino-acids within the lysosomes, and our expectation is that
this treatment will impair the growth of RAS-mutant and other tumors addicted to protein scavenging, while
sparing normal cells that lack this requirement. Over the first two years of the mentored phase, I will be based
at the Whitehead Institute, where I will learn cell signaling and metabolomics approaches from the experts in
the field. I will also venture into a completely new research area to me, chemical biology, working with experts
at the Broad Institute. After the completion of my K99 training, my aspiration is to lead a laboratory that
combines cell signaling, structural biology, and chemical biology to study membrane transporters and their role
in cancer metabolism. In parallel to understanding basic biology, I want my lab to develop specific
small-molecule modulators that adjust transport activities of those proteins, facilitating further research in the
field, and in long term – new medicines."

 This proposal details a 5-year training plan to prepare the physician candidate, Thao (Tina) Ho, for a career as
an independent, translational investigator who will become a leader in the field of iron deficiency and anemia of
prematurity. The project will identify the effects of enteral iron supplementation, as prevention for anemia, on
intestinal health of preterm infants through complementary clinical and basic science studies.
 All preterm infants are at risk for iron deficiency. Enteral iron supplementation is recommended to all preterm
infants at 2-4 mg/kg/day; however, they are often given at higher doses, 6-10 mg/kg/day. Emerging evidence
suggest that enteral iron can exacerbate the overgrowth of enteric pathogens and suppress beneficial bacteria.
This imbalance, or intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation, and disrupted barrier are observed in necrotizing
enterocolitis, a devastating intestinal disease of prematurity. Preterm infants are colonized with higher
percentage of enteric pathogens at baseline compared to term infants. Dr. Ho’s preliminary data has led to the
hypothesis that high enteral iron supplementation exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, mucosal
inflammation and permeability in preterm infants. Dr. Ho will test this hypothesis by conducting a randomized
study to compare the fecal bacterial composition, mucosal inflammation and barrier function between premature
infants given high vs. low iron regimens and investigating the cellular mechanisms with cytokine production and
gene expression using human 3D enteroid models. At the completion of this project, Dr. Ho will be experienced
in 1) designing and conducting clinical studies, 2) advanced biostatistical analyses and interpreting the results
of large clinical datasets, and 3) performing experiments on 3D cell models.
 The candidate’s independent analytical thinking will grow with regular discussions among NIH-funded
researchers and didactics provided by the University of South Florida. This award will allow her more protected
time to develop necessary skills and collaboration to establish independence by the 4-5th year. Dr. Ho will work
under the primary mentorship of Dr. Groer, an expert in translational microbiome and infant health research with
many successful mentees. To complement her primary mentor, Dr. Ho’s mentoring team, Drs. Adams and Kim,
will support her in cell culture techniques, microbiology, and genomics. Dr. Ho also has established a superb
team of scientific advisors with the following expertise: Dr. Michael Georgieff (iron and neurodevelopment), Dr.
Josef Neu (intestinal immunology), Dr. Sharon Donovan (childhood nutrition and intestinal microbiome), and Dr.
Jason Spence (3D intestinal models). They have committed their time to her career development and research
goals long before this application. Their mentorships, the fast-growing and supportive research environment at

Dr. Ho to secure an R01 to investigate the long-term health effects from different iron doses to optimize the

10904023,"Recent retrospective studies show that radiology's diagnostic error rates did not decrease significantly over
the years. For example, missed lung cancer rates remain at 20-60% on chest radiography dependent on
study design. This error contributes to 40,000-80,000 deaths annually in U.S. hospitals. This project aims
to develop a computational framework for Al to collaborate with human radiologists on medical diagnosis
tasks. To achieve this goal, we divide the project into three Aims, where the first two focus on fundamental
theories, and the last one evaluates the proposed approaches on targeted applications.
 Aim 1: Develop computational principles for optimal Al-radiologist interaction. This Aim will develop
a computational framework for guiding the interaction between radiologists and Al to achieve the best
possible diagnostic performance while minimizing the time burden. Our framework consists of the first
method for reverse-engineering radiologists' intention from the joint gaze and visual information based on
reinforcement learning. This Aim is the first to provide an integrated system with gaze sensing, deep
networks, and human radiologists. The knowledge from this Aim will fundamentally transform how one
would build collaborative medical diagnosis systems.
 Aim 2: Design a user-friendly and minimally-interfering interface for radiologist-Al interaction. This
Aim addresses an essential question of designing a minimally interfering interface that allows human
radiologists to interact with Al models efficiently. Our proposed system combines an innovative ""multimodal
thinking with audio and gaze"" (MTAG) methodology with user-centered iterative design. The process will
result in a novel radiologist-Al collaborative interface that maximizes time efficiency while minimizing the
amount of distraction. The outcome of this Aim will shed light on design principles for systems involving
radiologists.
 Aim 3: Evaluation Plan. This Aim evaluates the proposed approaches in Aim 1-2 on two clinically
important applications: i) Lung nodule detection and ii) pulmonary embolism. Lung cancer is the second
most common cancer, and pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death.
Studying how radiologists collaborate with Al to reduce diagnostic errors will lead to significant clinical
impacts.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Diagnostic errors contribute to 40,000-80,000 deaths annually in U.S. hospitals. This project combines
novel artificial intelligence (Al) algorithms, gaze monitoring software, and design principles to help doctors
minimize diagnostic errors due to cognitive and perceptual biases. The project's success will fundamentally
change how we design Al medical systems to increase diagnostic accuracy, save lives, reduce missed
cancer diagnoses, improve public health, and advance NCl's mission."
10903927,"Project Summary - Patient Derived Cancer Model (PDCM) Finder
An area of significant growth in cancer research is the diversity and volume of low passage human cancer cell
lines, three-dimensional organoid cultures and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) known as Patient Derived
Cancer Models (PDCM). This project will therefore aggregate, harmonize and integrate diverse PDCM data,
extending our previous resource PDX Finder by inclusion of novel models, making these FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) compliant and cloud accessible, for example in the NCI Research
Commons. PCDM Finder will address challenges with searching over many repositories for models, incompatible
standards that make analysis and reuse of models difficult, molecular datasets annotated with insufficient
information that prevent cloud-based analyses and the need for more community awareness in providing FAIR-
compliant data to maximize the impact of their work. To address these challenges, PDCM Finder has 3 tasks: 1)
Enable cancer researchers to Find and Access models by enhancing our current resource to deliver the PDCM
Finder, 2) Aggregate and Integrate PDCM datasets to ensure Interoperability and Reusability for the NCI Cancer
Research Commons, and 3) Perform targeted community outreach during all stages of the project to determine
and prioritize requirements, guide development and promote the PDCM Finder resource. The expected
outcomes are users will be able to find, group and locate PDCM models of all types based on community defined
attributes (e.g. diagnosis, oncogenic mutation); explore and download molecular data summaries and drug
response data from the PDCM portal; aggregate and analyze harmonized PDCM molecular datasets on cloud
based analysis platforms. This will accelerate cancer research by allowing doctors and researchers to find PDCM
data that best matches their patients and/or research questions and explore new therapeutic avenues for
patients."
10904024,"Project Summary/Abstract
It is highly beneficial and meaningful for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (IAD) to age-in-place.
Prolonging time at home helps preserve their memories, spatial awareness and socio-emotional
connections. At the same time, undue care burden is imposed and is associated with high rates of
depression and anxiety among family caregivers. While relocation to long term care is an option, the
alarming increase in annual costs with assisted living and nursing home admission creates significant
financial constraints on the families. There is a significant need for novel technological solutions to promote
independence, health, and safety of IAD to age-in-place. To address this need, we propose to develop a
smart home-based social assistive robot (SAR) called Mobile Assistive Robot with Smart Sensing
(MARSS). Our innovative SAR will: a) have four evidence-supported modalities of care built in- activity
engagement and assistance, telehealth, home safety, and caregiver-care recipient connectivity; and b) a
training program to enable a non-technology expert (caregiver, family member or health professional) to
scale and program the modalities to fit with the disease severity and context of the IAD.
MARSS will be developed and tested in accordance to the NIH Stage Model of Intervention Development.
We have already pilot-tested a lab-based model of MARSS (Stage Ia). Now our priority is to pilot test the
technology in the community (with 8 dyads of IAD and caregivers) and verify its implementation fidelity,
robustness as well as behavior change techniques to optimize target engagement of IADs and caregivers
(Aim I- Stage IB). To address Aim II (Stage III), we will conduct an 18-month randomized controlled trial to
validate the real-world efficacy of MARSS. We will recruit 60 dyads in two staggered cohorts of IAD and
caregivers and randomly assign them to the intervention (n=30) or a control group (n=30). We will gather
repeated measures data on the IAD’s functional independence, safety, and physical and cognitive health,
and the caregiver’s perceived care burden, autonomy and wellbeing over nine data points, 2 months apart.
To account mechanism-focused change, we will objectively collect data on the technology’s utilization to
tease out the influence of the MARSS’s modalities on the intervention outcomes. In addition to much
needed empirical evidence on AD-based SARs, the findings will contribute knowledge to create and test
advanced yet pragmatic technological solutions to strengthen aging-in-place of IAD."

 This proposal describes a five-year research training program that will prepare Dr. McDaniel to achieve
her long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist dedicated to supporting the delivery of high-
quality, equitable care to children hospitalized in rural settings. With more than 12 million children living in rural
communities in the United States and with almost half of rural counties not providing definitive general pediatric
inpatient care, children in rural areas experience both poorer health status and limited access to pediatric
healthcare infrastructure and resources relative to children from urban areas. Addressing inequity in access for
children in rural areas in the setting of scarce resources and limited infrastructure requires health policy change
and innovative initiatives. Dr. McDaniel’s project goal is to establish system-level (e.g., provider, hospital,
community) facilitators for the provision of pediatric care in rural hospitals that may improve access to and
delivery of equitable inpatient care for children in rural communities
 In the first aim of this proposal, using a difference-in-differences approach, Dr. McDaniel will determine
if there is an association between the state-level provision of cost-based reimbursement for critical access
hospitals, a federal designation to promote the retention of services within rural communities, and the
maintenance of pediatric services (1a). Then she will examine the hospital and system characteristics of rural
hospitals associated with loss, gain, or sustained provision of general pediatric inpatient services across the
US from 2010 to 2018 (1b). Together, these will identify these will identify hospital, county, and state-level
characteristics associated with sustained provision of general pediatric inpatient services in rural counties over
time. In the second aim, using a consensus methodology with key stakeholders from seven partnering rural
hospitals, Dr. McDaniel will develop an intervention-bundle to support the provision of general pediatric
inpatient care. The bundle will build off preliminary qualitative data identifying rural hospital strategies to
support care and the contextual factors identified in Aim 1. In the third aim, Dr. McDaniel will conduct a pilot
implementation trial at three rural hospitals of the developed intervention bundle. She will assess 4 primary
implementation outcomes: acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and adoption. These will create a
framework for future multi-site interventions evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to promote the
sustained provision of high-quality general pediatric inpatient care.
 Dr. McDaniel’s research will be supported by an outstanding group of mentors with expertise in patient-
centered outcomes research, rural healthcare disparities, qualitative and mixed-methods, and econometrics.
Her mentors are dedicated to ensuring the success of this project and her development as an independent
clinical investigator. By accomplishing the aims of this proposal, Dr. McDaniel will have the necessary skills for
a research career dedicated to improving care and reducing disparities for children hospitalized in rural areas."
10903758,"Project Summary/ Abstract
An estimated 30-40% of cancer patients experience clinically significant anxiety and depression. The burden of
suffering caused by psychiatric distress has profound negative impacts on quality of life (QOL), medication
adherence, increased rates of completed suicide, and even decreased cancer survival rates. Approximately
25% of cancer patients with advanced or terminal cancer experience clinically significant existential distress
characterized by demoralization, hopelessness, absence of purpose or meaning, loss of dignity, and hastened
desire for death. Pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments are commonly used to treat depression, anxiety
and existential distress in cancer patients, but their effectiveness is limited and mixed. Psilocybin is a
psychedelic tryptamine with a good physiologic-psychological safety profile in human lab and clinical research,
producing highly salient meaningful experiences, often described as spiritual/mystical states of mind,
associated with enduring (months to years) positive changes in cognition, affect, behavior, and spirituality.
Based on extensive preliminary data, psilocybin-assisted therapy has demonstrated both safety and
preliminary efficacy to improve cancer-related depression and anxiety (effect size = 0.82-1.69), and existential
distress while improving quality of life, Participants in preliminary trials found the experience to be both
acceptable and highly meaningful and spiritual. Building on this strong foundation of preliminary work, we
propose to conduct a two-site, active placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled
trial of single high dose psilocybin-assisted therapy versus active placebo (very low dose psilocybin) for 200
participants with advanced cancer and baseline psychiatric distress. All participants will receive preparatory,
active dosing, and integrative therapy sessions as part of the psilocybin and active placebo groups. We
propose to conduct the following aims: 1) To assess the short- and long-term effects of psilocybin on mental
health (e.g. anxiety, depression, existential distress) outcomes; 2) To assess the effects of psilocybin on QOL;
and 3) To evaluate the contribution of psilocybin-induced psychological change mechanisms (mystical
experience, personality trait openness, cognitive flexibility) on acute and long-term mental health outcomes
(depression, anxiety, existential distress). We will collect baseline measures and follow up of outcomes at 1
day, 1 week, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks (6 months). The proposed study will impact clinical care for
persons with advanced cancer by testing an innovative, evidence-based intervention to improve depression,
anxiety, existential distress, and quality of life. The study is significant because it addresses important mental
health domains of suffering in patients with life-limiting cancer. The study is innovative as the potentially first
effective therapy to impact existential distress. Furthermore, this study will further the science by evaluating the
psychological change mechanisms for this promising new therapeutic intervention."

We seek renewal of our NLM Research Training Program in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science
(NLMTP), which for 29 years has consistently produced outstanding pre- and postdoctoral trainees as the
program has evolved along with Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BMI and DS) themselves,
successfully bringing computation, data science, applied mathematics, statistics, biomedicine, modeling, data-
driven inference and decision-making, and advances in cognitive informatics, to bear on biomedical problems.
With this renewal, we will further expand our research training program to explore and exploit the dynamic
interaction of BMI and DS with artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, and their applications in
biomedicine and human health and disease. Our program will not only equip trainees with solid DS
methodology and the latest tools, computational approaches, and statistical methods to solve BMI problems,
but also provide broad foundations that will enable them to invent the methodologies of the future to attack
problems currently beyond our reach; this will produce a new generation of BMI scientists who can extract new
knowledge from experience and experiment to inform basic research, patient care and public health. We,
therefore, seek to train our students and postdocs to work effectively at the interface between theory and
practice, between knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing. Our 46 training faculty, with broad expertise
in BMI, DS, and AI coupled with basic science and clinical knowledge, have a record of high research
productivity, extensive collaborations, and federal funding. Their track record of the recruitment, training, and
career advancement of underrepresented (UR) groups including women is strong, having mentored 264
predocs and 337 postdocs over the past 10 years, with 208 predocs (31% UR, 39% women) and 132 postdocs
(16% UR, 31% women) currently in their labs. Our 9 predoctoral trainees will have completed one year of study
and joined a lab at one of six participating institutions before joining the NLMTP (typically for 3-year
appointments), thus ensuring that their research projects fit well into the training areas of the NLM. Our 6
postdoctoral trainees will be selected through national recruiting and from the labs of our faculty, for typically
2-year appointments. NLMTP training will combine core courses in BMI and DS, advanced elective courses,
training in rigor and reproducibility and the responsible conduct of research, professional/career development
activities, monthly meetings with experts, and interdisciplinary dual-mentored research projects in health
care/clinical informatics, translational bioinformatics, and clinical research informatics. Our research training
program will undergo regular evaluations by external experts with adjustments made as needed. This program
will provide the perfect opportunity for trainees to acquire the skills, expertise and intellectual abilities to foster
innovative research and prepare them for applied research or related careers in which they can profoundly
affect such critical areas as personalized medicine, clinical decision making, and data-driven health."
10899944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most diagnosed eating disorder, characterized by eating objectively large
amounts of food one feels unable to refrain from or stop consuming (i.e., binge eating; BE). Recurrent BE must
be present at least once a week on average over the past three months and co-occur with significant
psychological distress. BED is notoriously difficult to treat, with some estimates concluding that more than one
half of patients do not maintain remission from binge eating six months after treatment discontinuation.
BE is often onset by momentary factors, such as a desire to reduce negative affect, or as a response to food
cravings. Less understood is what differentiates individuals with BED and those without eating pathology when
experiencing cravings or negative affect, and if there are strategies that prevent BE for the latter population.
Increasingly, there has been a call for assessment of the efficacy of a harm reduction approach in
addressing eating disorders. Harm reduction, primarily utilized in the substance use disorder field, is a
framework in which lowering risk of use is promoted in those who are unable or unwilling to completely abstain
from a harmful behavior. Experiences shared across substance use disorders and binge eating (e.g., cravings)
may account for the high co-occurrence of BED and substance use, and salience of similar treatment targets
and intervention strategies. Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) are actions one can take while engaging in a
potentially harmful behavior to decrease risk of serious consequences. Characteristics of highly palatable foods
(e.g., high sugar/ fat) and frequency at which they are consumed are associated with serious morbidity and
mortality implications, and thus these foods are commonly recognized as risky to over-consume. The proposed
study will utilize a PBS framework to assess how PBS may apply to reducing the frequency and intensity of BE
and specifically, whether there are differences between healthy controls (HC) and individuals with BED regarding
their momentary-level behavior that leads to differential eating outcomes. First, using an online screener to recruit
from a national sample, an estimated 10-15 HC and 10-15 individuals with BE will engage in interviews to
qualitatively assess presence of BE and eating-related PBS (Aim 1). Next, a measure of eating-related PBS will
be developed from qualitative responses and cognitive interviews will be used to refine and ascertain
comprehension of the developed measure. The measure will then be validated among 500 with BE and 500 HC
in an online survey (Aim 2). Finally, 25 HC and 25 individuals with BED will participate in an ecological
momentary assessment study where they report daily-level PBS to assess for group differences in PBS use in
response to real-life BE precedents (Aim 3). The proposed study will implement a mixed methods approach
utilizing technology for real-time assessment to investigate PBS against BE. Findings will inform
potential efficacy of PBS for eating behavior in line with a harm reduction approach and may bolster
existing BED interventions."

10901576,"Kidney transplant (KT) short-term outcomes have steadily improved over the last several decades, however,
similar progress in long-term allograft survival has not yet been reached largely due to chronic allograft injury
(CAI). In our previous funding cycle, we identified a gene expression signature in deceased donor kidney biopsies
at pre-KT that was predictive of graft function, measured by eGFR, at 24-months post-KT. Further, our single-
cell/nucleus transcriptome profiles yielded several important findings including that KT recipients with acute
kidney injury have increased fibroblasts and macrophages (both donor- and recipient-origin) with a macrophage
subset characterized by fibroblast-like markers; donor-derived macrophages were present in functioning kidney
grafts with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) more than 24-mo post-KT; and paired single-cell
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed immune cell type specific profiles reflecting graft injury.
Thus, our results revealed the unappreciated role of donor kidney cells (immune and non-immune) on tissue
repair and local immunomodulation, which plays a critical role in response to injury and determines graft function.
Moreover, post-KT graft survival is determined by a complex interplay between donor and recipient factors. Thus,
our findings guided the establishment of our new hypothesis that early measurable donor and donor-recipient
cellular interactions and molecular profiles are strong indicators of chronic inflammatory responses and
maladaptive repair circuits, shaping long-term graft outcomes. Therefore, in this funding cycle, we will
elucidate the effects of donor cell type-specific drivers of injury that exacerbate the initial donor/recipient immune-
and non-immune cell interactions in response to injury and determine how these events are reflected in the
peripheral samples, allowing non-invasive graft monitoring by using cell type-specific markers of injury. This will
be accomplished by leveraging our large unique available resource that includes donor biopsies (pre-KT) with
paired longitudinal recipient biopsies and PBMCs (post-KT) along with KT recipient clinical outcomes to pursue
the following specific aims: Aim 1. Assess donor and recipient cells' origin, function, and interactions that play a
role in graft injury. Aim 2. Uncover cell type-specific molecular signatures from peripheral immune cells derived
from KT recipients at pre-implantation and longitudinally post-KT, reflecting immune risk status and kidney graft
function. Aim 3. Establish a novel statistical method for developing a composite score using high-dimensional
donor/recipient molecular and clinical/demographic variables to predict graft function. This study will provide (i)
cell type-specific gene signatures and regulatory regions that control the transition between healthy and diseased
kidney graft states, eventually guiding efforts to reprogram cells to promote repair after injury, (ii) cell type specific
gene profiles within recipient PBMCs that can longitudinally inform ongoing graft injury/repair and assist with
better matching of patients and organs for improved long-term outcomes, and (iii) combined scores for pre-KT
immune risk and post-KT graft function prediction using timely and cost-effective cell type-specific markers."
10904956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children.
In the last 20+ years a total of 9 genetic loci have been associated with HI, however, in approximately 40-50%
of cases a genetic cause is not identified. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for HI is of
great importance to guide the development of novel therapies and eventually, a cure. Building on the success
of the previous cycles of this award, we propose a comprehensive approach to examine the mechanisms of
disease for two novel forms of HI that we have previously mapped to specific genomic loci by linkage analysis
and whole exome sequencing. In addition, we propose a broad discovery effort for novel mechanisms of
disease by performing deep genotyping and phenotyping of both individuals and isolated islets in cases with
negative genetic testing on constitutional DNA. Our overall hypothesis is that genetic testing negative HI
cases can be explained by novel genetic loci encompassing factors important for ß-cell function and
by somatic mutations of known HI genes. To test this hypothesis, we propose two aims: to examine the
mechanisms responsible for dysregulated insulin secretion by novel genetic loci identified in families with
dominantly-inherited HI: Hexokinase 1 and PASK; to identify the role of post-zigotic mutations in HI; and to
continue our discovery efforts through a comprehensive approach to examine genomics and functionomics of
HI by deep genotyping and functional evaluations of affected individuals and their pancreatic islets. This study
will expand our understanding of the molecular genetics and pathophysiology of HI and will facilitate the
identification of new genetic causes and potential new therapeutic targets for this devastating disease. The
discovery of novel HI loci may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating insulin secretion
and may benefit the development of new therapies not only for HI, but also for diabetes."
10904712,"Treatment of prostate cancer patients relies heavily on therapeutic strategies depriving tumor cells of the
transcriptional activity of the Androgen Receptor (AR). Despite their initial efficacy, androgen-deprivation
therapies (ADT) are eventually circumvented by the emergence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),
which is characterized by skeletal metastases in more than 90% of patients.
We have recently demonstrated that approximately 30% of bone-metastatic prostate cancer cells lack AR
(ARNeg) and express Interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Our hypothesis is that ARNeg cancer cells, by secreting IL-1β,
establish a supportive bone habitat, allows ARPos cells to withstand androgen-deprivation and AR inhibition.
Thus, a major goal of this proposal is to define the modalities by which ARNeg/IL-1β cancer cells sustain
skeletal colonization in prostate cancer under androgen-deprived conditions.
This proposal is structured in three aims: Aim 1. IL-1β involvement in ADT resistance; Aim 2. Role of bone
stroma in IL-1β induced regulation of ARPos cells; Aim 3. Regulation of IL-1β expression by AR.
The proposed studies will employ animal models of metastasis, human cell lines, PDX-derived cells and
human tissue amples to ascertain the functional role of IL-1β in skeletal colonization of prostate cancer cells,
discriminating between direct autocrine-paracrine effects on cancer cells and targeting cells of the tumor-
associated bone stroma. Furthermore, we will identify the bone stroma cells targeted by IL-1β and evaluate
three stromal factors secreted in response to IL-1β for the ability to induce AR signaling and expression of AR-
regulated genes. Finally, using a combination of molecular biology approaches we will define the mechanism
for the transcriptional regulation of IL-1β by the AR and the translational control exerted on this cytokine by
miRNAs.
Our studies will define the unique role of ARNeg prostate cancer cells in metastases and provide conceptual and
pre-clinical ground for complementary strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes."
10872534,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability is a common pathophysiological feature of many cardiovascular
diseases. While NO donors are used, significant issues limit their utility, including the development of nitrate
tolerance and endothelial dysfunction. Although intermittent nitrate therapy is common practice, this strategy has
limitations and is not considered a solution to nitrate tolerance issues. Extensive intravenous use of sodium
nitroprusside is associated with a risk for cyanide poisoning. There is thus a strong need to identify new
approaches to promote endogenous NO production. The stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a Ca2+-sensing
protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is a critical determinant of store-operated Ca2+ entry, which in
endothelial cells (ECs) is required for sustained endogenous NO production. Vascular smooth muscle-specific
STIM1 deletion blunted hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy caused by angiotensin II. In contrast, endothelial
STIM1 is predictably important for vasorelaxation, such that EC-specific STIM1 deletion attenuates endothelium-
dependent vasodilation and increases blood pressure. However, no strategy currently exists to directly target
endothelial STIM1 for clinical benefit.
 In this application, we propose to develop a novel vasorelaxing peptide (EFG2) that acts by promoting
endogenous NO production and has several unique properties that are of potential clinical benefit. Our peptide
is derived from the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, is designed to be specific for the endothelium, and
directly targets STIM1 to trigger endothelial Ca2+ entry without depleting ER Ca2+ store, thereby stimulating
endogenous NO production while protecting ER function. Our objectives in this proposal are to delineate the
mechanisms of action of EFG2 in endothelial cells, assess its effects on several aspects of EC function, begin
testing its potential as a vasorelaxing agent using a model of hypertension, and through these studies, provide
training for students in the graduate and medical programs at DMU. Three specific aims are proposed. AIM 1
will delineate the mechanisms of action of EFG2 in endothelial cells, by testing its ability to activate the
prototypical ICRAC current and document its target domains on STIM1 that are responsible for its effect to trigger
endothelial Ca2+ entry. AIM 2 will assess the effects of EFG2 on several aspects of EC function, by testing the
hypotheses that EFG2 promotes eNOS activity, reduces inflammation-induced expression of vascular adhesion
molecules and smooth muscle proliferation, but does not cause ER stress. AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that
EFG2 reduces blood pressure in hypertensive rats in a NO-dependent fashion.
 Completion of the studies will introduce a mechanistically novel vasorelaxing peptide with several unique
features that are of potential clinical benefit, provide quality student training, and enhance overall research
outcomes of Des Moines University."
10872786,"Breast cancers emerge through a years-long process of somatic evolution within the physical constraint of milk
ducts, characterized by accumulation of heritable genetic and epigenetic changes. While these genetic
alterations have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the microenvironmental conditions
that select for these genotypes. We and others have demonstrated that evolving pre-cancerous hyperplastic
cells are subjected to spatio-temporal variations in oxygenation due to poor vasculature, acidosis due to
fermentative metabolism, and nutrient scarcity due to competition among cancer cells and between cancer and
stromal compartments. Adaptations to these microenvironmental stressors are prerequisite for survival and
eventually results in selection of cells with more aggressive phenotypes. To model the eco-evolutionary
dynamics of tumor microenvironment (TME) in vitro, we subjected benign breast cancer cells (eg. MCF7 and
MCF10AT) to harsh conditions encountered in TME (ie nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and acidosis resulting from
metabolism) and we observed that the cells that survive these selection pressures exhibited a lipogenic
phenotype characterized by robust accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs). We selected three nutrient stress
adapted clones (NSA) to further characterize the distinct metabolic phenotypes and to determine if this
phenotype switch contributes to aggressive tumor behavior. The selected clones maintained the lipid phenotype
under nutrient replete, normoxic and normal pH culture conditions implying that this is a hard-wired metabolic
phenotype. Indeed, the nutrient stress adapted cells (NSA) were more migratory in vitro and highly metastatic in
orthotopic xenograft models, however, grew smaller primary tumors compared to control cells. We will further
characterize lipid phenotype of the NSA cells by assessing differential gene expression patterns that define
distinct metabolic pathways. Further, we will determine if these clones engage in alternate nutrient acquisition
pathways such as macropinocytosis, receptor mediated endocytosis and entosis to scavenge nutrients and use
them to generate lipids. We will employ stable isotope tracing as well as image-based assays (live confocal high
content microscopy using Opera Phenix) to define the mechanism of lipid accumulation in adapted cells. Finally,
we will perform metabolic profiling to measure oxygen consumption rate and proton production rate and
determine their ability to metabolize alternate fuels including lipids. Combining these approaches, we propose to
decipher the mechanism whereby microenvironmental stress-induced evolution results in hard-wired phenotypic
adaptations, represented by a lipogenic phenotype. At the end this study, we expect to have a more complete
and comprehensive understanding of the microenvironmentally-induced gene expression changes that occur
during carcinogenesis, and how these relate to hard-wired phenotypic profiles, such as the lipogenic phenotype
that contribute to cancer progression. A deeper understanding of this metabolic switch has potential to identify
novel therapeutic targets."
10872851,"Only one in ten pancreatic cancer patients is alive 5 years after their diagnosis. Unfortunately, this outlook has
not improved significantly in decades. This is in stark contrast to most other cancers, which have benefited
tremendously from the recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Therefore chemotherapies
remain as the only option for pancreatic cancer patients, but these therapies are not particularly effective, and
they produce significant side effects. Given that pancreatic cancer patients have received little benefit from
conventional cancer therapies, there is a need for deeper understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer.
Here, we propose to investigate how low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) promote emergence of aggressive behavior
of pancreatic cancer cells. Cancer cells in the same pancreas tumor can show substantial diversity at the
molecular level and in how they respond to therapies. The inability to effectively target all cancer cell subsets
within a tumor contributes to treatment failure. Pancreas tumors have regions of hypoxia, which are caused by
variable access of cancer cells to blood vessels that deliver oxygen to tissues. Our initial results indicate that
metabolic adaptations in cancer cells that reside in these hypoxic regions reprogram the cancer cells, so that
they become resistant to chemotherapy. In other words, what does not kill the cancer cells makes them stronger.
We propose to investigate other possible outcomes of this reprogramming process, including the ability of the
cancer cells that experienced hypoxia to contribute to tumor growth as well as their ability to spread into distant
parts of the body (metastasis) or resist therapy. The second part of the proposed study will focus on identifying
the molecular changes that are induced in the cancer cells by hypoxia. In the third part, we will determine which
of these molecular changes enable cancer cells to survive hypoxia and acquire more aggressive behavior. The
project will identify fundamental drivers of cell state diversity in pancreatic cancer, which may point to a new
generation of targeted therapies that will control the cellular composition of tumors to improve treatment
response. We have devised a two-prong research strategy focusing on both the role of the hypoxic pancreatic
cancer cells within the tumor and the molecular programs unlocked by hypoxia that promote tumor progression.
If successful, this study will (i) fundamentally advance our understanding of the molecular and biological
mechanisms underpinning intra-tumoral heterogeneity, tumor progression, and drug resistance; (ii) provide
innovative experimental approaches for investigating phenotypic diversity; and (iii) elucidate novel strategies for
targeting tumor heterogeneity, malignant progression, and drug resistance in pancreas cancer."
10872852,"ABSTRACT
Women live longer than men, yet they also experience greater morbidity, which makes understanding how
specific chronic conditions further impact multimorbidity in women essential. Importantly, chronic conditions
disproportionately affect certain women, including those who are historically underrepresented, understudied,
and underreported (U3) in biomedical research. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) involves discrete episodes
(≥1/week) of eating abnormally large amounts of food in one sitting while feeling out of control. BED is more
common among women than men and is associated with poor cardiometabolic and mental health profiles,
adjusting for BMI. As with many chronic conditions, disparities exist in both the prevalence and understanding
of chronic BED within subpopulations of women. Specifically, because eating disorders are stereotyped as
disorders of youth, white race, and affluence, data in populations beyond this stereotype are highly limited.
Yet, recent evidence indicates greater BED prevalence and negative health correlates among women in two
understudied areas: 1) older age, and 2) economically disadvantaged. Cross-sectional research suggests
nearly 20% of women aged ≥60 years may meet BED severity criteria, and that those with BED experience
poorer mental health and quality of life, and profound cardiometabolic morbidity. Recent research among
largely Hispanic/Latino (H/L) samples living with food insecurity (FI) found that 17-20% of older women (aged
≥51 years) met BED severity criteria. One limitation to this research is its cross-sectional nature. Thus, the
prospective health impacts of BED among older H/L women living with FI remains unknown. Another limitation
is the insufficient exploration of environmental factors (e.g., psychosocial; social determinants of health
[SDoH]) that influence cardiometabolic risk in older H/L women who have chronic BED and live with FI. The
specific research objectives of this R01 are to determine the prospective mental and cardiometabolic health
impacts of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, thus creating a risk index for the health burden of
BED and FI in later life for H/L women. The proposed study will include 250 older (≥50 years) H/L women living
with FI (n =125 with chronic BED & n = 125 no lifetime history of any eating disorder) to assess the prospective
impact of BED on cardiometabolic health (e.g., HbA1C, BMI change), sarcopenic obesity, menopause quality
of life, physical functioning, and depression over 2 years, and to explore SDoH factors between groups on
outcomes (Aim 1); examine longitudinal trajectories of BED and FI (Aim 2); and explore the lived experiences
and major life events among participants with and without BED in a concurrent nested mixed-method design
(Aim 3). The long-term objectives of this research program are to a) elucidate potential factors of influence
(e.g., mediators/moderators) on the health burden of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, b) develop
U3 relevant, scalable interventions so that healthcare providers and hunger relief organizations can improve
services, and c) generate data for policy change to ultimately reduce multimorbidity in this U3 population."
10872801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Celiac disease (CeD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy that occurs when genetically susceptible individuals
consume gluten. CeD affects >1% of the US population, and its prevalence is rising. HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8
haplotypes are necessary for the development of CeD. However, only ~3% of individuals with these risk alleles
develop CeD, suggesting a role for environmental factors and gene-by-environment interactions in the initiation
and pathogenesis of this disease. Diagnosis of this lifelong disease obligates strict adherence to a restrictive
diet, which markedly reduces quality of life. Potential celiac disease (PCeD) is used to describe individuals with
HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 risk alleles and circulating antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and endomysium, and yet
normal duodenal villous architecture. PCeD can progress to CeD (PCeD-P), revert to seronegativity, or remain
persistently seropositive without abnormal small bowel histology (PCeD that is static (PCeD-S)). The PCeD
population provides a unique ability to define the cascade of microbial and host factors culminating in CeD.
Insight into the mechanisms that lead to the loss of gluten tolerance and resulting tissue injury will provide reliable
markers of disease progression, aid in case management, and offer an opportunity to prevent the progression
to mucosal injury. To do this, we will recruit children with suspected CeD based on positive serology and children
with negative celiac serology undergoing upper endoscopy at Washington University and University of Alabama.
This will allow us to compare paired plasma, stool, duodenal biopsies, duodenal fluid aspirates, and clinical
metadata from four gluten consuming groups (newly diagnosed treatment naïve CeD, PCeD-P, PCeD-S, and
non-CeD controls). To determine if there are transcriptomic signatures in children with PCeD who subsequently
develop histologically proven CeD (PCeD-P), we will perform spatial transcriptomics on biopsies from PCeD
participants and sex, age, and race matched CeD and non-CeD controls. Previously, we demonstrated that a
subset of CD8+ T cells expressing killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are increased in frequency in
the blood and duodenum of adults with CeD and suppress pathogenic gliadin specific CD4+ T cells. We will
determine the frequency of KIR+CD8+ T cells, gliadin specific CD4+ T cells, and the ratio of these cells among
CeD, PCeD, and non-CeD controls. Additionally, we will determine the transcriptomic and TCR clonality shifts
within KIR+CD8+ T cells and associate these to CeD progression. Understanding the interplay between CD4+
T cells and CD8+ T cells will help in assessing the contribution of adaptive immune system in CeD progression
in children. We do not know if microbial differences drive small bowel CeD inflammation, or vice-versa. By
systematically comparing the gut (small bowel and stool) bacterial microbiome and virome of children with biopsy
confirmed CeD, PCeD-P, PCeD-S, and non-CeD controls we will define the microbial cascade of events leading
to progression in susceptible individuals. This prospective interrogation of CeD at a uniquely instructive point in
the disease process will provide novel and informative insight into the evolution of tissue injury in CeD."
10893146,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Administrative Core is the “nerve center” of the PSC. It provides infrastructure management, administrative
leadership and research, technical and clerical assistance to PSC associates so they can devote as much time
as possible to population research. The core arranges activities that enhance interaction, build community, and
expand exposure to population research to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The core sets priorities for the
Center, allocates resources, ensures continuing strong University support, and generates an environment that
fosters energetic supportive and stimulating intellectual exchanges within the Center. The cadence of the
administrative Core is in step with the NIH, NSF and foundation deadlines and proactively reaches out to early
career researchers to provide encouragement, interpretation of instructions and formats, timelines and
university policy and procedures. The Core provides specific staffing to the Scientific/Technical and
Development Cores. Coordination by the Administrative Core of shared staff across overlapping functions
makes efficient use of scarce resources. The Administrative Core staff is organized for flexibility and
responsiveness to researcher needs. The staff is cross-trained so there is always coverage of core
administrative tasks. The Core maximizes efficiency for population dynamics research by minimizing the
financial and time burdens of providing administrative support services associated with research projects. The
Administrative Core services and activities are essential to accomplishing the mission and the continued
success of the Center. The Administrative core reduces the structural burden for researcher who seek
extramural funding and frees population scientists to focus on their research. By having a centralized
Administrative Core, staffed with knowledgeable and specialized staff, ready to step in and provide top-notch
service, the efficiency and cost effectiveness of grants development is enhanced. Priority in access to the Core
services is given to junior research scientists."
10892848,"Project Summary
Mammalian gene expression is a stochastic process marked by short periods (minutes) of intense activity or
bursts of transcription interspersed between long intervals (>30 minutes to hours) of inactivity. Many genes
also display transcriptional memory (TM), where an initial stimuli primes a promoter subsequently allowing
faster and stronger re-activation of gene expression. TM can occur over both long (cell-divisions/LTTM) and
short (hours/STTM) timescales. Mechanisms regulating mammalian STTM and its relationship to
transcriptional bursting are poorly understood. This knowledge is critical for understanding how this process
becomes dysregulated in diseases such as cancer. Our live cell imaging system will survey the molecular
origins of the multiple ON states of bursting and transcriptional noise suppression that lead to STTM at a large
cohort of genes.
Preliminary data show 1.) transcription from the endogenous p21 and ACTB loci displays multi-phasic bursting
(MPTB) associated with different burst durations and Pol II initiation rates 2.) multi-phasic bursting patterns
exhibit STTM which can be modulated up and down via different stimuli. 3.) Noise is inversely correlated with
STTM and is suppressed via histone methylation. Our long-term goal is to understand how gene expression is
coordinately controlled by chromatin to restrict or grant of access of transcription factors to target promoters.
Based on our preliminary data and previous studies, we hypothesize that MPTB and STTM arise from the
coordinated recruitment of alternative pre-initiation complexes.
This hypothesis will be tested using cutting-edge single molecule live-cell microscopy in the following 3 specific
aims: 1.) Define the molecular origins of Multi-Phasic Transcriptional Bursting (MPTB). Live cell imaging will
determine the relationship between alternative pre-initiation complexes and the different burst states. 2.) Define
how Short-term transcriptional memory (STTM) is related to MPTB and the DNA damage response. Live cell
imaging will determine the prevalence of STTM at a large cohort of genes and the molecular mechanism of
how MPTB and STTM is regulated during the DNA damage response. 3.) Define the relationship between
transcriptional noise, MPTB, and STTM. Live-cell imaging will be used to determine how noise modulators
impact MPTB and STTM. These studies will provide key insights into how transcriptional bursting and STTM is
modulated by the dynamic interplay between activators, pre-initiation factors, and Pol II."
10892849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As a vascular and interventional radiologist and a health services researcher, my long-term goal is to achieve
transformative improvements in vascular procedural care through national quality of care assessments and
implementing pragmatic inventions to improve outcomes. This research and training proposal will allow me to
gain critical skills needed to establish independence and launch a portfolio of scientific contributions focused
on systems-level quality improvement in venous thromboembolism (VTE) related care.
The goal of this research proposal is to increase timely retrieval of inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) and
improve patient outcomes in the United States. Inferior vena cava filters are very commonly placed in patients
with blood clots in the leg (deep venous thrombosis; DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism; PE), to prevent
propagation to the heart, which can be fatal. Unfortunately, national retrieval rates remain low and prolonged
IVCF implantation has resulted in considerable, avoidable morbidity. Multi-society guidelines recently
emphasized the need to improve timely IVCF retrieval rates through institution of structured follow up programs
and to better understand which program components are effective in real world settings. What is needed next
is identification and testing of pragmatic strategies to improve timely IVCF retrieval in real-world settings. We
propose to do this via three complimentary aims: 1) quantification of facility-level variation in IVCF retrieval
across the United States; 2) qualitative characterization of high-performing institutions to identify best practices
and characterize facilitators and barriers to their implementation; 3) design, pilot testing and iterative
adaptation of a pragmatic intervention package to improve IVCF retrieval, informed by the existing literature
and adapted with findings from aim 2. The pragmatic intervention will then be tested in multi-center hybrid
implementation-effectiveness trials to follow, with the goal of improving timely IVCF retrieval and reducing
complications across hospitals in the United States.
My training aims closely parallel the proposed research methodology through focused education in: a)
Bayesian hospital profiling, b) qualitative interviewing and analysis, and c) intervention design using an
implementation science framework. This training will be accomplished through an intentional mix of structured
coursework, formal workshop experience and one-on-one education with topical research experts.
My mentorship team and research environment at the University of Colorado Denver (UCD) are ideally
suited to this proposal. My primary mentor, P. Michael Ho MD PhD, is a national leader in cardiovascular
quality assessment and pragmatic intervention design. I will additionally leverage the extensive data and
methodologic core resources of Adult and Child Consortium for Outcomes Research and Delivery Science
(ACCORDS) and Data2Value (D2V) initiatives at the University of Colorado to accomplish these aims."

entering competitive careers in biomedical research. Aim 1 will develop an integrated, city-wide Training
Network for KUH research training (TL1 Training Core). Pre- and post-doctoral trainees will perform original
KUH research under the mentorship of a scientifically diverse preceptor pool. ATLANTIS will create a vibrant,
supportive and dynamic training environment to encourage trainees to answer important questions that directly
affect human health and disease. This rich experience will promote KUH research and prepare trainees for
their future research. Aim 2 will develop a dynamic Networked Program actively engaging TL1 and other
KUH trainees through peer networking, team science, and outreach efforts in KUH research (Network
Core). We will implement a cloud-based community software platform, ATLANTIS-Connect, explicitly designed
to foster, support, and supplement traditional in-person interactions and engage trainees at all career stages,
promote interest in KUH research, and develop peer-networking and peer-to-peer mentoring. Aim 3 will
develop an integrated Professional Development program that enhances trainee and preceptor
professional development (Professional Development Core). Trainees will participate in professional
development opportunities offered by the Office of Postdoctoral Education and the graduate programs at
Emory (Laney Graduate School), GaTech, and MSM. Our goal is to provide a meaningful research experience
coupled with individualized professional development. Preceptors will be required to obtain formal mentor
training, including mentoring of diverse trainees."
10892980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a sudden yet persisting set of stressors for children across the
U.S., that have had far-reaching impacts on their wellbeing, health, and academic outcomes. The COVID-19
pandemic brought about an unprecedented number of school closures that have impacted learning for nearly
78 million children (UNESCO, 2021). Learning to read is crucial, as reading is a critical indicator of lifetime
earnings, general health, and wellbeing (OECD, 2012). Before the pandemic, many children were already at
risk for reading difficulties, with only 35% of U.S. fourth graders showing proficient levels of reading
ability (NCES, 2019). These reading difficulties have only been magnified by COVID-19 related
impacts. Data from the 2020-2021 school year shows that children’s reading scores got worse, with average
end of year reading scores 3 to 6 percentile points lower than pre-pandemic levels (Lewis et al., 2021). The
overall goal of this project is to uncover the mechanisms through which COVID-19 has and will have short-term
and long-term impacts on children’s reading skills. We use a risk-resilience model as the framework for this
project, which recognizes children have varying levels of risk factors that make them more or less likely to be
affected by COVID-19 related disruptions to their sources of resiliency. We will capitalize on an existing active
national twin project, the National Project on Achievement in Twins (NatPAT). NatPAT has already enrolled a
cohort of 1801 pairs of twins (and growing) and has been tracking them as they progress through elementary
school, collecting their reading progress monitoring data three times a year. We will continue to enroll twins
into NatPAT using our successful and established recruitment procedures, and collect their ongoing reading
data. In addition, every summer for all five years of the grant, any twin family with children in grades
kindergarten to 6 will be mailed a survey packet to their homes. This packet will contain a parent and child
survey with questionnaires related to their experiences over the last school year related to COVID-19 impacts,
specifically their social interactions, health and economic status and changes, and their experiences with digital
technology. Using methods that allow us to understand causal relations, we are uniquely situated to address
the overall goal of the proposed research through three specific aims (SA). First, we will quantify the short and
long-term effects that losing social resources due to COVID-19 has on reading skills (SA1). Second, we will
quantify the short and long-term effects of COVID-19 related health and economic stressors on reading skills
(SA2). Finally, we will quantify the short and long-term effects of the digital-divide on reading skills during
COVID-19 (SA3)."
10892988,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have
increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU
has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of
suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross-
sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are
needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the
temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal
uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn,
contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone
technology to assess
SMU using
real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine
the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and
suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk
(Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively-
monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The
candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new
conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including
social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The
candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the
exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and
Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in
mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent
development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied
to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed
training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify
clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent
suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of
suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research
along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading
scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide."

10892856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Malaria continues to be a major global health concern and is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths
annually with more than 90% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Symptoms of malaria are caused by asexual parasites,
but malaria is passed from humans to mosquitoes by sexually-differentiated gametocytes. After repeat
exposures, acquired immunity limits the density of asexual parasites and the likelihood of developing
symptoms. One possible barrier to malaria elimination is the reservoir of chronic infections with asexual
parasite densities too low to prompt treatment, but sufficient gametocytes to infect mosquitoes. Therefore,
detecting and treating asymptomatic infections could reduce transmission and indirectly prevent deaths.
 Preliminary results from a clinical trial in Burkina Faso (the INDIE trial) suggest that regular screening,
testing, and treatment (STT) interventions significantly reduce gametocyte density and infectivity to
mosquitoes. However, the effect of STT on reducing transmission and preventing cases and deaths at the
population level remains unknown. I propose to use agent-based modeling to predict the impact of STT if it
were to be widely implemented as part of malaria control or elimination efforts.
 First, I will use data from INDIE to build a detailed spatial model of the study site, calibrate within-host
relationships between parasites, gametocytes, and infectivity, and validate the effect of STT on gametocyte
density and infectivity. Next, I will predict the impact of implementing universal STT for the entire INDIE
study area on reducing malaria cases. Since STT is resource-intensive, I will compare the effectiveness of
implementing targeted STT in the INDIE study area, considering targeting by age group, limiting STT to the
wet or dry season, and targeting STT to households with the highest mosquito exposure. Using an
archetypes approach and without considering other malaria interventions, I will make a back-of-the-envelope
prediction of the impact of universal and targeted STT across all malaria-endemic Sub-Saharan Africa.
Finally, I will adapt existing models contextualized by intervention history to assess the impact and cost-
effectiveness of targeted STT strategies in high-burden and near-elimination settings, compared to
established interventions. The results of the proposed research will help policymakers decide if, when, and
how to deploy STT to combat malaria.
 The F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship award will allow me to build my
quantitative and research skills, improve my scientific writing and communication, and gain expertise in
infectious disease epidemiology on the path toward becoming a successful independent investigator. In
conducting the proposed research, I will integrate into a global network of malaria modelers and
epidemiologists, gain familiarity with agent-based modeling, and make scientific contributions to the
assessment of STT as a tool for malaria control and elimination.

10892874,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Impact: This proposal addresses the pressing need for effective treatments for cryptosporidiosis in infants. The
therapeutic target is human protein kinase C (PKCα), which we recently discovered as a host susceptibility gene
for cryptosporidiosis. Successful completion of this work will broadly advance the field of host-targeted therapy
by taking a hit from a forward-genetic screen through mechanistic validation during disease.
Significance: Cryptosporidiosis is one of the top 5 causes of diarrhea in children in low- and middle-income
countries. There is no vaccine and the drugs are extremely limited with none approved for infants. Thus, there
is an urgent need for effective therapies, particularly for children. This proposal sets a precedent for developing
host targets for microorganisms, an area of high significance in the face of emerging antimicrobial resistance.
Innovation: A genome-wide scan for infectious disease susceptibility in infants from low-resource countries had
never been done until it was pioneered by our investigator team. The proposal integrates human genetics and
parasite cell biology to develop the discovery of PKCα into a target for host directed therapy. Our previous work
identified novel host factors that could be blocked to prevent cell-killing by Entamoeba parasites. We propose to
expand this innovative approach to Cryptosporidium. This strategy is fundamentally different from traditional
parasite-targeted drugs and is based on preliminary data that PKCα is a novel host susceptibility factor for
cryptosporidiosis.
Approach: We have discovered that human PKCα is a key component of susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis in
infants using a genome wide scan for disease-associated loci. We hypothesize that PKCα is required for
intracellular infection by Cryptosporidium and could be targeted to cure cryptosporidiosis. We will define the role
of PKCα in a multi-disciplinary study that integrates an analysis of PKCα during natural infection in infants
(Aim 1), targeted sequencing of the PKCα locus to identify the causal SNPs and mechanism of action (Aim 2),
and an analysis of host PKCα during in vitro and in vivo infection studies in combination with testing of FDA-
approved PKCα antagonists (Aim 3). Successful completion of this R01 will result in an Investigational New
Drug Application for a host-targeted PKC drug for cryptosporidiosis.
Environment: The Investigators bring strong and complementary skills to accomplish this work. Dr. Marie (PI)
is an expert in host and parasite cell and molecular biology. Dr. Duggal leads an internationally regarded program
in human genetic susceptibility to infection and Dr. Haque brings extensive experience in field studies in children
in Bangladesh. Importantly this team is highly collaborative as evidenced by their past discoveries and co-
publications. The team brings together three internationally recognized global health centers: The University of
Virginia (Dr. Marie), the ICDDR,B (Dr. Haque), and John Hopkins University (Dr. Duggal). This collaboration will
occur in an exciting and rigorous interdisciplinary environment."
10881918,"Clinician-scientists are uniquely positioned to ask new and insightful scientific questions inspired by patient observations, yet, they often lack the expertise to be able to translate their observations into carefully designed basic scientific and translational experiments. There are likely many reasons for this, but the most cited barriers are lack of specific training, mentoring, funding, and time. If these barriers could be removed, more clinician-scientists could pursue careers in laboratory-based translational research, thereby helping to reverse the current state of affairs in many neurological disorders, in which basic research is proceeding at an increasingly rapid pace but translational research is lagging, and most patients with neurological disorders are left without preventions, treatments or cures. Here we propose a research training program for MD-PhDs or MDs who have finished their clinical training in a neuroscience-related specialty and are highly motivated to pursue careers as physician-scientists in innovative, laboratory-based translational research in brain diseases. The ReConNecT-IT (Remapping Clinical Neurosciences through Translation and Innovation Training) program consists of intense research training under the close mentoring of 1-2 faculty mentors. Trainees design and conduct independent research projects that they can take with them when they transition to independent support, and upon which they will base their NIH K-award application. Research projects are directed toward the translation of the genetic, molecular and cellular pathophysiology of neurological diseases into strategies for prevention, treatment or cure. Trainees will be encouraged to pursue projects that are collaborative and cross-disciplinary, as this fosters their research development, and linking disciplines helps generate ideas that are novel. Trainees will have access to 20 core faculty and can collaborate with other groups. Trainees will work alongside PhD researchers and participate in journal clubs, lab meetings and basic science seminars. The curriculum includes formal training in experimental design, statistical methodology and quantitative literacy, and well as individualized training on statistical/quantitative methodology by our Director of Statistical Training. Trainees will gain an understanding of critical topics in translational research and how basic research is translated into clinical trials (patient-oriented research) via two specific, semester-long courses. They will gain professional skill and understand career opportunities by participating in workshops on developing a K-award application, grant and scientific writing, pursuing an academic career, job search skills, laboratory and project management, and responsible conduct of research. A unique feature of ReConNecT-IT is that prospective trainees can know of their acceptance before their clinical training ends, allowing them to schedule research into their remaining clinical time, thereby expanding the total amount of research experience they will have before writing a K-award application. The main expected short-term outcome for this program is application for an NIH K award or equivalent grants."
10881922,"Our goal is to elucidate molecular mechanism for neuroprotective autophagy in Huntington's disease (HD) and
determine therapeutic potential for selective autophagy in treating the disease. HD is caused by an aberrant
expansion of CAG repeat (polyQ) in the HTT gene, which leads to a toxic gain-of-function in the mutant
huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Despite over 20 years' research, disease-modifying therapeutics is unavailable.
Thus, elucidation of the disease mechanism and mHTT clearance pathways is pivotal for the success of
therapeutic development. Autophagy is a catabolic cellular pathway that clears protein aggregates and injured
organelles through lysosomes as a quality control system. PolyQ-expanded protein aggregates including
fragments of HTT can be degraded by selective autophagy, and thus selective autophagy is considered a drug
target for HD. However, autophagy is a complex process subjected to tight regulation, and how exactly
autophagy selectively degrade mHTT remains poorly understood. We previously showed that ULK1 regulates
p62-mediated selective autophagy under proteotoxic stress. In the context of mHTT, however, we reported
dysregulation of ULK1 kinase activity that connects to reduced VPS34 activity and aberrant p62-selective
autophagy in the brains of HD model zQ175. Our current study suggests that ULK1 deficiency accelerates
mHTT-mediated toxicity. The data thus provides strong evidence for the role of ULK1-p62 mediated selective
autophagy in regulating mHTT toxicity. We hypothesize that ULK1 and p62 are promising modifiers of HD
disease progression. We propose (1) to determine the role and mechanism for ULK1-p62 signaling in the
degradation of mHTT through selective autophagy; (2) to investigate pathogenic mechanism that mHTT
disrupts ULK1 kinase activity and causes ULK1 deficiency-mediated selective autophagy impairment and
neurotoxicity; (3) determine ULK1 kinase activity as a therapeutic target to inhibit mHtt-mediated neurotoxicity
using animal models through genetic and pharmacological approaches. Our study is expected to reveal
molecular mechanism for ULK1 protective function against HD and validate ULK1 kinase activity as a drug
target for the clearance of mHTT and offering neuroprotection."
10881923,"In vivo studies in conscious animals indicate that ORL1, for opioid receptor-like one,
receptor agonists produce profound changes in the cardiovascular function and renal excretion
of water and sodium via an action within the central nervous system (CNS). These observations
provide evidence to suggest that central endogenous ORL1 receptors participate in the regulation
of cardiovascular and renal function under normal and certain pathophysiological conditions. In
regard to endogenous systems, opioid peptides have been categorized into three major families,
β-endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins, and are suggested to be the endogenous ligands for
the mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors, respectively. In addition to these subtypes, a fourth
opioid receptor termed ORL1 has been identified. The endogenous ligand for the ORL1 receptor
has been isolated and is a novel endogenous peptide referred to as nociceptin (N/OFQ). Despite
their structural resemblance to endogenous opioid peptides and receptors, the role of nociceptin
and the ORL1 receptor in pathophysiological (e.g., heart failure) regulatory processes including
the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function, is not known.
 Activation of ORL1 receptors in conscious healthy rats produce bradycardia, hypotension,
and a free water diuresis (increase in excretory urine flow rate without concurrent increase in
sodium excretion). In addition, this diuretic effect occurs without the loss of potassium. As such,
nociceptin produces pharmacological effects that are similar to the combined effect of several
drugs currently used to treat heart failure (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics). Thus,
nociceptin is a potential candidate for the treatment of this disease. However, the sites,
mechanism and pathways involved in these responses are unknown. Furthermore, the effects of
nociceptin in a heart failure model are still to be established.
 Proposed experiments are designed to examine the changes produced by selective
activation of ORL1 receptors in a heart failure model. The results of these studies will provide
fundamental knowledge of how an individual component of the opioid system affects
cardiovascular and renal function. This is of importance because the development of novel
therapeutics with affinity for a specific opioid receptor subtype will require further investigation
under different experimental and pathophysiological conditions."
10881944,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of deaths in the United States, however the underlying
inflammatory pathways that contribute to CVD are poorly understood. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of
CVD and induced by various inflammatory mediators, many of which signal through G-protein coupled receptor
(GPCRs). Thrombin, an inflammatory mediator, is generated in response to vascular injury and disrupts
endothelial barrier integrity and promotes vascular leakage, a hallmark of inflammation. Thrombin activates
endothelial protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) to disrupt endothelial barrier through the RhoA/myosin light
chain (MLC) pathway. However, thrombin/PAR1-stimulated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling also promotes barrier permeability through a pathway that does not integrate with the RhoA/MLC
signaling, suggesting that p38 acts through an uncharacterized pathway to promote inflammatory responses in
endothelial cells. Our previous work showed that thrombin-activated PAR1 ubiquitination drives the recruitment
of TAB2-TAB1 protein complexes on endosomes to trigger non-canonical p38 activation and endothelial barrier
disruption. The mechanisms that regulate PAR1 ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination are not known. This proposal
aims to understand the molecular processes that regulate PAR1-ubiquitin-driven p38 signaling and most
importantly its impact on endothelial barrier integrity. The central hypothesis is that de-ubiquitination of PAR1
leads to termination of p38-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and will be tested with two specific aims: 1) To
delineate the function of PAR1-specific deubiquitinases (DUBs) enzymes in the regulation of ubiquitin-driven p38
MAPK inflammatory signaling and 2) To study the functional impact of ubiquitination / de-ubiquitination of PAR1
on endothelial barrier permeability. Using advanced biochemical, microscopic and genome-wide RNAi screening
methods, the proposed research plan will allow for the first time to investigate molecular determinants that
regulate the dynamics of PAR1-ubiquitination and the impact on endothelial proinflammatory responses in vitro
using human endothelial cells and in vivo using mice. The contribution of this work is expected to be significant
as this study will reveal new information regarding the function of PAR1 ubiquitination in driving non-canonical
endosomal p38 MAPK signaling in endothelial barrier disruption, a hallmark of inflammation and will further
reveal a new signaling pathway that controls endothelial barrier function, which will provide an opportunity for
the development new strategies for the treatment of inflammatory responses associated with CVD."
10892779,"Abstract. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system
(CNS) that affects an estimated 400; 000 people in the United States alone. MS is characterized
by focal demyelinating lesions and causes physical and cognitive impairment. While imaging stud-
ies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of targeted and strongly predictive
neuroimaging-based biomarkers is small. Thus, we focus on two promising imaging modalities that
are likely to capture complementary information on MS disease severity and dynamics: (1) longitudinal
changes in white matter integrity captured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) across the corpus cal-
losum; and (2) longitudinal changes in the voxel intensities of MS lesions in multi-sequence Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). To address these emerging data structures we propose realistic biostatisti-
cal methods that can scale up and produce principled inference for longitudinal high dimensional data.
The ﬁrst Aim is focused on massively univariate generalized linear mixed effects models (MU-GLMMs)
and proposes a simple inferential approach for dealing with the within- and between-study participant
correlation. The second Aim is concerned with the joint modeling of dense longitudinal high dimen-
sional data (e.g., lesion voxel intensities) and survival time (e.g., time to voxel recovery). The third
Aim is designed to quantify the association between the longitudinal neuroimaging and established
MS biomarkers. The fourth Aim is dedicated to implementation, software, and reproducibility."

NIMH seeks to “identify biomarkers and behavioral indicators with high predictive value, as early in the course
of illness development as possible”, in order to reduce the overall burden of mental illness. However, the
number of potentially important psychological, environmental, and biological factors of mental health disorders
is vast, and a key challenge is to narrow down to the most important predictors of disorder. This challenge is
made especially difficult as 1) recent advances in neuroscience begin to reveal neural substrates of
psychopathology, and 2) many predictors are themselves correlated, making it difficult to disentangle which
factors are reliably related to disease, after controlling for other factors. Currently used statistical methods are
inadequate to overcome this challenge. Powerful Bayesian variable selection methods, called stochastic
search variable selection (SSVS), can be used to identify predictors with the most robust relationships for a
given criterion, however these methods have not been developed for use in psychology and are currently only
available to specialized statisticians. The goal of this project is to develop guidelines to enable mental health
researchers to use SSVS to overcome current methodological barriers. I will also develop user-friendly online
applications to make SSVS easily available. For the first Aim of this study I will use computer simulation
studies to evaluate how SSVS works across a range of conditions and develop guidelines and software for
researchers to use. In the second Aim of this study I will apply SSVS to predict obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD) symptoms in the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland sample, which is a large, publicly available database.
OCD is a common, chronic, and debilitating disorder. Much regarding risk for OCD remains unknown, which
limits efforts aimed at treatment and prevention. Previous research to identify potential risk factors and triggers
for illness onset has relied heavily on evaluation of individuals long after symptoms began. The predictors in
this sample include a wide range of theoretically-derived risk factors, including measures of potential
psychological vulnerabilities, brain connectivity, stressful life events, and key comorbidities. This proposed
research is embedded in a training and mentoring plan that will provide training in 1) the etiology and
assessment of psychopathology, 2) neuroscience approaches to determine neural substrates of
psychopathology, and 3) Bayesian variable selection methods. This K01 mentored research award will provide
the training, time and resources for me to make substantial advances towards addressing this important
problem and establish myself as an independent, R01-funded investigator."
10893316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising. While targeted inhibitors and immune checkpoint
antibodies have increased long-term survival in advanced-stage cutaneous melanoma, many
patients still do not benefit and regimens are associated with significant toxicities. We are studying
the determinants of treatment response and mechanisms of resistance in melanoma. From our
studies, we aim to provide pre-clinical data for new combinations that delay/prevent the onset of
acquired resistance while minimizing patient toxicities in order to improve patient survival and
quality of life. Multiple clinical trials have emanated from our work (NCT03580382, NCT02012231,
NCT02683395). Aberrant cell cycle regulation is a hallmark feature of cancer. In melanoma, cell
cycle progression is promoted through mutations in BRAF, NRAS and NF1 leading to MEK-ERK1/2
pathway activation, amplification of cyclins and/or cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and/or loss of
CDK inhibitor proteins. Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are FDA-approved in ER-positive/HER2-
negative breast cancer but their use in melanoma requires optimization of combinations and
schedules. We aim to understand how to utilize CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma and combine them
with immune checkpoint agents, which remove the blocks on T cell action. In the previous cycle of
funding, we provided new insights into mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor
monotherapy and combination therapy. We then developed novel models and to analyze
resistance to BRAF pathway inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitor-based combinations. We identified
enhanced phosphorylation of S6 as a common node of therapy resistance and validated our
studies using patient trial samples. In this current proposal, we aim to identify and target
mechanisms underlying residual disease following CDK4/6 inhibitor + MEK inhibitor treatment in
melanoma. Additionally, we aim to determine effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor + MEK inhibitor on the
tumor immune microenvironment. The application will utilize novel models and patient samples
from relevant clinical trials to measure heterogeneity of tumors and mechanisms of drug tolerance
and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor + MEK inhibitor. Identifying the tumor intrinsic mechanisms and
effects on the tumor-associated immune microenvironment will inform potential new treatment
strategies across genetic subset of cutaneous melanoma."
10893324,"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated
 Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART-2)
ABSTRACT
There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest
pain, one of the most common and potentially deadly conditions encountered in acute care settings. The 12-
lead ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain yet is currently only diagnostic for a small
subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Over the past funding period, we have built the
largest database of multi-hospital, outcome-linked, prehospital 12-lead ECG repository known to us (n=4,132).
Using this multi-expert, multi-tier ground truth annotated database, we have developed and validated novel,
machine learning-based, ECG interpretation algorithms that could identify non-ST elevation acute coronary
events. Using state-of-the-art interpretability toolkits, we identified ECG signatures that are mechanistically
linked to ischemia and can serve as plausible markers of acute coronary syndrome. We now aim to move
these extensive efforts to clinical use by expanding and building these models at the bedside for prospective
validation and real-time clinical deployment. The specific aims of this renewal application are: 1) to build and
externally validate a multi-task, ECG-based intelligent decision support system; 2) to build and deploy a real-
time architecture for this intelligent system along with a clinician-facing graphical user interface platform; and 3)
to perform a prospective clinical validation of this intelligent ECG system, including silent deployment and
evaluation at two clinical sites. The final deliverable is an intelligent ECG interpretation system for detecting
and stratifying patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome of sufficient readiness to be deployed in
clinical trials aimed at improving outcomes in non-ST elevation coronary syndromes. Such intelligent system,
when combined with the judgment of trained emergency personnel (physicians, nurses, and paramedics),
would more accurately identify patients with acute coronary occlusions for ultra-early intervention. This system
will streamline the care provided to non-specific chest pain beyond the costly and time-consuming overnight
observations for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing."
10893377,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Critical periods are restricted windows of heightened plasticity during which developing neural circuits are
particularly sensitive to sensory input. Unlike the transient alterations that come with adult plasticity, changes
occurring during developmental critical periods are lasting and cemented after closure. The transplantation of
inhibitory progenitors into adult amblyopic mouse visual cortex has been shown to reactivate critical period
plasticity and rescue visual deficits. Recent findings suggest that this reactivation stems from the transplant-
induced developmental rejuvenation of host inhibitory neurons. The preliminary transcriptional profile of
rejuvenated host inhibitory neurons identifies Calbindin (Calb1), an understudied plasticizing molecule, as a key
upregulated factor. The long-term goal of this work is to investigate the role of Calb1 in the transplant-
induced rejuvenation of host inhibitory neurons and subsequent reactivation of critical period plasticity.
Aim 1a tests whether Calb1 is necessary for transplant-reactivated plasticity by virally-inactivating Calb1 function
in recipient adults and using intrinsic signal optical imaging to assess for a shift in ocular dominance following
monocular deprivation. To test whether Calb1 is necessary for developmental critical period plasticity, the same
approach will be applied to non-transplanted juveniles. Aim 1b tests whether Calb1 is sufficient to reactivate
plasticity, non-transplanted adults with virally-overexpressed Calb1 show shifts in ocular dominance post-
monocular deprivation. Aim 2a utilizes weighted gene co-expression network analyses of the previously
generated transcriptional data to identify the biological pathways underlying transplant-induced rejuvenation.
Expression of identified pathway components will be validated and characterized in Aim 2b using
immunohistochemistry. This work will yield novel insight into the cell and molecular mechanisms underlying
inhibitory neuron transplantation, visual circuit development, and reveal new translatable targets for the
development of neurotherapeutics. Brain repair strategies that catalyze endogenous cellular rejuvenation hold
great clinical promise for a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disease.
The technical aspect of my training plan focuses on the acquisition of viral injection and functional imaging (Aim
1), and bioinformatic and statistical analysis skills (Aim 2). Aim 1 training will be carried out under sponsor and
visual neurophysiologist Dr. Gandhi and postdoctoral fellow Dr. Figueroa-Velez, and Aim 2 training will be guided
by co-sponsor and transcriptomics expert Dr. Spitale and bioinformatician Dr. England. Technical training will be
complemented by a heavy emphasis on scientific communication, professional development, teaching, and
outreach. UC Irvine is a rich, well-established training ground for successful graduate students and offers a
breadth of resources, structured courses, and networking opportunities."
10893380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Celiac disease (CeD) is a complex T cell-mediated enteropathy induced by dietary gluten in HLA-DQ2+ and/or
HLA-DQ8+ individuals, which currently affects 1% of the global population. A gluten-free diet (GFD) is, to this
date, the treatment of choice for CeD. However, 50% of CeD patients are unable to effectively adhere to a diet
that sustainably excludes gluten, with many patients suffering from inadvertent gluten exposure. Moreover, over
30% of CeD patients have persistent high symptom burdens, resulting from continued mucosal damage, despite
adhering to a GFD. Persistent mucosal damage on a GFD is associated with several severe complications,
including malignancies, especially lymphomas and bone diseases. In addition, patients with active CeD display
a wide range of clinical presentations, including metabolic defects (vitamins, iron, and cholesterol) that are not
correlated to the degree of tissue damage. Although much progress has been made in understanding CeD,
major gaps remain, notably regarding the biological mechanisms involved in different clinical presentations and
the inconsistent healing process. For instance, it is poorly understood why, independently from the degree of
villous atrophy, certain patients display nutrient and lipid deficiencies, whereas others have normal levels of
vitamins, cholesterol, and iron. Furthermore, while there is evidence for a role of the microbiome in CeD, we lack
information on small-intestinal mucosal microbiota in human CeD (which is more likely to have metabolic effects
and directly interact with the immune system). Finally, we have little knowledge about interactions between gluten,
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), immune cells, and the microbiota, and how they are linked to the different CeD
clinical phenotypes. Our RC2 proposal will test the hypothesis that CeD is a heterogeneous disorder, while
attempting to define interactions between IECs, microbiota, immune system, and genetics that underlie
differences in clinical presentation, severity of tissue destruction, and the ability to heal. It will also
address critical gaps in our understanding of CeD pathogenesis and clinical presentations, and develop
tools for non-invasive monitoring of CeD patients. We have assembled a team of internationally recognized
experts in the field of CeD, epithelial cell biology, mucosal immunology, microbiome, and chemistry. The RC2
proposal is anchored around multi-omics studies performed in the context of cross-sectional and interventional
gluten challenge and de-challenge studies, on 445 well-characterized adult and pediatric patients. The proposed
specific aims are: 1) Developing an approach to precision medicine in CeD; 2) Deciphering the mechanisms
associated with tissue destruction and healing in CeD, 3) Developing non-invasive tools for monitoring CeD
patients, and 4) Developing research resources for the scientific and medical community to advance patient care
as well as discovery-based and hypothesis-generating science. This application aims to generate the much-
needed knowledge base and resources to further our understanding of CeD pathogenesis and its heterogeneity,
improve individualized patient care and follow-up, and develop new therapeutic and preventive targets."
10893381,"Recently developed CRISPR-based systems permit precise genome editing by inducing targeted DNA
breaks at specific sites in the genome. Cellular DNA repair machinery can restore genome integrity by copying
information from the intact homologous chromosome at the cleavage site via homology directed repair (HDR).
While precise HDR-mediated DNA repair is the predominant pathway active during meiosis, the competing and
potentially mutagenic non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) is typically thought to prevail in somatic
cells. One reason for this bias is that the NHEJ pathway is active throughout somatic cell cycles, while HDR is
primarily restricted to post-replicative S and G2 phases. Thus, achieving efficient HDR-based gene editing in
somatic cells has proven challenging, which limits the in vivo use of this technology for human gene therapy.
 My group has contributed to developing the first CRISPR-based gene-drive (or active genetic) systems in
flies, mosquitoes, mammals, and bacteria that bias germline inheritance of genetic elements programmed to
cut the genome at their site of insertion. We also pioneered allelic-drive systems designed to promote biased
inheritance of a favored allelic variant at a separate genetic locus. These germline drive systems also produce
somatic phenotypes, which have generally been attributed to mutations induced by the NHEJ pathway.
Recently, we developed genetic elements we refer to as “CopyCatchers” that permit visualization of HDR-
mediated copying of gene cassettes. These studies have revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of somatic
gene conversion (SGC) events in Drosophila (30-50%) wherein the chromosome homolog serves as a DNA
repair template. Rates of SGC can be improved further by optimizing delivery of CRISPR components, or by
reducing the expression of various genes encoding factors involved in DNA repair or chromosome pairing.
Preliminary experiments indicate that interhomolog SGC can also take place in human cells and point to
untapped strategies for repairing disease-causing mutations using intact sequences from the homologous
chromosome.
 In this grant we propose to explore SGC repair mechanisms mediated by Cas9 and Nickase in somatic
cells of Drosophila and then extend analysis of this interhomolog repair process to human cells. First, we will
analyze the mechanisms underlying CRISPR dependent copying of gene cassettes or allelic variants to
optimize their activities. Next, we will develop and optimize Drosophila models for homolog-based repair of
disease-causing mutations in the Notch locus affecting mitotically active stem cells or in post-mitotic cells in the
adult gut epithelium using a humanized Drosophila CFTR–/– disease model. Finally, we will assess whether
insights gained in Drosophila are portable to human somatic cell lines, and whether interhomolog SGC can
restore native gene activity in human cell-based models for cystic fibrosis. Enhancing homolog-based repair in
mammalian cells could offer transformative possibilities for next-generation gene therapy strategies."
10893383,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The bacterial communities (microbiota) residing on the human body have been linked to a variety of acute and
chronic diseases and conditions, such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disorders, Type 2 diabetes, depression,
and urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as to the host’s response to a variety of treatments and health
interventions for these diseases and conditions. As the critical role played by the microbiota has become
increasingly recognized, microbiome sequencing data sets are now routinely generated under ever more
sophisticated experimental designs and survey strategies. While such data share many common features and
challenges of modern big data, such as high-dimensionality and sparsity, they also possess characteristics
peculiar to the microbiota, including (i) the explicit and latent contextual relationships among the bacterial species,
such as their evolutionary and functional relationships; and (ii) the substantial heterogeneity across samples and
complex structure in the sample-to-sample variation. Effective analysis of modern microbiome studies calls for
new statistical methodology that incorporates these important characteristics in the data generative mechanism.
This project’s objective is to develop a suite of statistical models, methods, algorithms, and software that meet
this urgent need. An initial aim is to develop a multi-scale probabilistic framework for modeling microbiome
compositions that effectively characterizes the high dimensionality, sparsity, and substantial cross-sample
variation in microbiome sequencing data, and incorporates a variety of common experimental designs, such as
covariates, batch effects, and multiple time points, while striking a balance in flexibility, analytical parsimony, and
computational tractability. An additional focus is to develop latent variable models for microbiome compositional
data for the purpose of identifying latent structures such as sample clusters and species subcommunities. A final
aim is to produce user-friendly, open-source software that implements all of the proposed methods for the
analysis of microbiome sequencing data. All of the models and methods developed are informed by two on-
going collaborative projects of PI Ma and his team. One is on the identification of microbial communities
associated with UTIs in aging women, and the other on the study of longitudinal changes in the microbiome of
cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These studies will serve as testbeds for all
development. The models, methods, and software developed will not only result in better prediction of the health
outcomes in these and other microbiome studies but also help decipher the roles of microbiome in various
diseases and biomedical processes, with the ultimate goal of personalized interventions on the microbiome
compositions of patients to lead to improved health."
10893965,"Non-equilibrium activity is crucial for maintain and modulating tissue shape, development and
morphogenesis, lysosome dynamics, cell membrane remodeling during cell division or membrane fusion
and fission events. Importantly many of these processes play a significant role in human health helping
regulate for instance immune system function and ensuring accurate developmental morphogenesis.
However, there is a major gap in our understanding of how microscopic non-equilibrium biophysical
driving forces give rise to a desired molecular response, function, or control. Indeed, while the theoretical
and computational frameworks for the study of equilibrium biological processes are very well developed,
there are very limited analogous tools for the study of complex far-from-equilibrium biological systems.
Further, the large length and time scales of biological systems and processes make explicit computational
simulations impractical.
Addressing this problem requires the development of a range of multiscale non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics techniques in combination with tools from machine learning and artificial intelligence so that
the large length and time scales associated with the above-mentioned biological processes can be
appropriately captured. The work outlined in this proposal builds towards these long-term goals by focusing
on three paradigmatic example systems 1) Understanding and predicting non-equilibrium lysosomal
dynamics and morphologies 2) Understanding and modelling cytoskeletal processes responsible for
developmental patterning, cell-cell communication, and force generation 3) Developing frameworks for
determining drivers of cell fate and differentiation from single cell RNA sequencing data. Each of these
paradigmatic examples has implications for diseases. These paradigmatic examples build on the recent
foundational non-equilibrium statistical mechanics frameworks developed by my group and expand them
so that they can be utilized in biological contexts."
10893967,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Metastasis is the primary cause of death of cancer patients. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs)
leave the primary tumor and seed target organs originating metastasis, years or decades after treatment. This
delay in growth is mediated by a process called tumor dormancy. The extracellular matrix (ECM)-tumor cell
interactions have been shown to regulate the hallmark of cancer; from primary tumor growth to migration,
invasion and metastasis. However, how ECM sensing and remodeling can induce and sustain dormancy of
DTCs is unclear. Moreover, whether DTCs assemble dormancy-supportive ECM niches to sustain their
phenotype is also an unanswered question. We will explore the hypothesis that ECM remodeling by dormant
cells contribute to tumor dormancy by constructing a dormant ECM niche rich in collagen III (COL III).
Hypothesis: Our overall hypothesis states that dormant cancer cells can construct their own “dormancy-
supportive niche” by remodeling and depositing a COL III rich ECM that sustain their phenotype.
Objective: The overall goal of this project is two-fold: 1) to understand the role of the COL III ECM on the
formation of dormancy-supportive niches and 2) to determine how the interaction with the collagen III ECM
through DDR1 regulates the dormancy-to-reactivation transition.
Specific Aims: #1: To determine how fibrillar collagen III networks contribute to establish a dormancy-supportive
niche. #2: To identify the molecular mechanisms through which collagen receptor DDR1 modulates assembly of
a pro-quiescence ECM.
Study design/Methods: 1) The approaches available to study the biology of dormant cells in real-time in vivo
are limited. We propose to use high-resolution imaging tools combined with dormancy models to study tumor
cell-ECM interactions during dormancy. We have been developing an imaging approach that includes: i)
Multiphoton imaging and second harmonic generation (SHG) and ii) activity reporters for dormancy-related
specific pathways to measure changes in p38/ERK signaling and cell cycle status during dormancy. 2) To
analyze the ECM composition and remodeling we use quantitative proteomics in collaboration with Dr. Naba.
Relevance: This project is innovative both at the conceptual and at the methodological level. We propose to
study the following aspects of metastasis: 1) how DTCs create a dormant ECM niche enriched in COL III to
sustain dormancy; 2) the role of COL III/DDR1 interaction in regulating dormancy; 3) how IFNg/STAT1 signaling
regulates tumor dormancy through ECM remodeling; 4) how disruption of a pro-quiescence ECM proteome and
increase in LTBP1 mediate dormancy-to-reactivation transition. We expect our studies to have a significant
impact on biomedicine because they will uncover the mechanisms regulating dormant cell-ECM interactions,
which will be an efficient way of identifying targets to prevent metastasis."

This K01 application is designed to provide Jessica King, PhD, with the mentored training necessary to
transition into an independent tobacco regulatory science researcher. Dr. King will be mentored by a team of
renowned tobacco control and tobacco regulatory scientists and will complete mentored training, coursework,
and professional development in the areas of advanced statistical analyses, policy impact analyses, and health
disparities. This additional career development and mentorship will directly contribute to completing the
proposed research strategy, which examines the impact of cigar pack quantity on tobacco use behaviors. Cigar
use is the third most commonly used tobacco product among adults, and second most commonly used product
among youth, with use increasing among low income, minority, and young adult populations. Given the
significant health effects attributable to cigar use, this represents a critical health disparity. Low cost is often
cited as a reason for increased use among these populations, in part due to low taxes and varying pack
quantities. Research on cigarettes has shown minimum pack quantity laws increase price and decrease use.
As of 2016, the FDA has regulatory authority over cigars, allowing it to regulate the marketing, manufacturing,
and distribution of cigar products, including mandating minimum pack quantities. However, cigar-specific data
are needed to inform FDA's regulation. Thus, the goal of the proposed analyses are to advance understanding
of the relationship between cigar pack quantity and tobacco use behaviors to inform regulation on minimum
cigar pack quantity. Specifically, we aim to (1) assess whether cigar pack quantity is associated with between-
and within-person changes in cigar use and whether there are differences by sociodemographic factors, (2-3)
identify the impact of local minimum cigar pack quantity laws on cigar and other tobacco use and cigar sales
and whether impacts differ across communities of varying demographics, and (4) characterize differences in
the implementation and enforcement of minimum cigar pack quantity laws through qualitative interviews with
key implementation personnel. In this mixed-methods approach, we will utilize national datasets, including the
Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population
Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, and Nielsen retail scanner data. Each aim will explicitly
examine the impact among racial and ethnic minorities, low income populations, youth, and young adults, each
vulnerable populations. This research will directly address the FDA Center for Tobacco Products Scientific
Domains of behavior and impact analysis. The findings from this study may inform future FDA rulemaking on
cigar pack quantity."

Ovarian cancer (OCa) is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers in the United States. Patients with OCa initially
respond to standard combinations of surgical and cytotoxic therapy; however, nearly 90% will develop recurrence
and inevitably succumb to chemotherapy-resistant disease. OCa stem cells are implicated in the tumor re-
initiation and therapy resistance. Lack of targeted therapies that promote apoptosis of tumor cells and eliminate
cancer stem cells in OCa represents a critical barrier. The goal of this Academic-Industry Partnership (AIP)
grant application is to develop a novel targeted therapy for treating OCa. Through this AIP grant, we will establish
a collaborative framework between the University of Texas Health at San Antonio and Evestra Inc., a San
Antonio based biotech to create a novel targeted therapy for treating OCa. With Evestra Inc.'s expertise in
developing novel small molecule inhibitors that disrupt protein-protein interactions, we have rationally designed
and synthesized a first-in-class leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) inhibitor, EC359. Our preliminary
studies have shown that EC359 reduces the growth of OCa cells with high potency, promote apoptosis, reduce
stemness, sensitize therapy resistant OCa cells and has in vivo activity with favorable PK parameters. The
objective of this AIP proposal is to synthesize EC359 in grams using GLP protocol, establish its mechanisms,
identify biomarkers, conduct efficacy studies using PDX models, and perform off target screening studies that
are needed to file the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application to FDA. Our overarching hypothesis is that
LIFR signaling plays a critical role in OCa progression, and disruption of LIF/LIFR signaling with small molecule
inhibitor EC359 will have a therapeutic effect by promoting apoptosis of OCa cells, reducing stemness, and
promoting anti-tumor immunity by altering the tumor microenvironment. Our AIP team is unique due to
synergistic expertise in drug development, availability of GMP facility, experience with OCa biology, preclinical
models and geographic proximity. In Aim1, we will evaluate translatability of EC359 by determining maximum
tolerated dose, toxicity, biodistribution, in vivo efficacy using xenografts and PDX models and test the utility of
EC359 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. In Aim 2, we will define EC359 mechanisms,
establish molecular correlates of EC359 activity using unbiased genomic and proteomic approaches, define the
role and mechanism by which EC359 reduces stemness and determine the role of EC359 in reprogramming
the anti-OCa immunity, including macrophages, in syngeneic and humanized mouse models. In Aim 3, we will
synthesize EC359 using multi-gram scale, conduct metabolite studies, perform cardiovascular safety screens,
and establish formulation and chemistry manufacturing controls. The studies proposed in this AIP proposal will
establish a novel targeted therapy that will eliminate local tumor growth, reduce recurrence, and enhance the
survival of OCa patients. EC359 could be utilized as a monotherapy, or in combination therapy or as a
maintenance therapy, thus creating a new paradigm of novel targeted therapy for the treatment of OCa."

Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs) are estimated to affect over 10 million Americans as per NIDCR.
Total 80 - 90% of symptomatic TMJDs patients have internal derangement (ID), also referred to as disc
displacement, which is highly associated with osteoarthritis (OA) that may necessitate surgical treatment.
Previous attempts to replace the TMJ disc with alloplastic and/or synthetic grafts have failed, resulting in further
joint degradation. Thus, regeneration of TMJ disc has recently emerged as an alternative approach to overcome
limitations of current treatments for TMJ disorders. In our preceding studies, we developed anatomically correct
3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with native-like anisotropic microfiber orientation. To engineer the
native-like heterogeneous fibrocartilage, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; profibrogenic cue) and
transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3; chondrogenic cue) were spatially embedded in the scaffolds as
encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acids) (PLGA) microspheres (μS). The spatiotemporal release of CTGF
and TGFβ3 guided recruitment of TMJ syMSCs, followed by spatially controlled fibrocartilaginous differentiation
toward regeneration of TMJ in rabbits and mini-pigs. Despite the promising in vivo outcome, our CTGF/TGFβ3
μS-embedded scaffolds encountered few outstanding translational challenges for TMJ discs regeneration,
including PLGA degradation-derived acidic environment, a notable interspecies variance in the in vivo
degradation rate of scaffolds, and potential side effect of over-physiological dose of growth factor. To address
these issues, here we propose to develop and validate a novel combination of pharmaceutical small molecules
to replace CTGF and TGFβ3 as incorporated in bioactive scaffolds, to refine the in vivo degradation rate as
balanced with de novo tissue formation through our advanced imaging modality, and then to promote
regeneration of TMJ discs in a pre-clinical large animal model. Our preliminary study identified novel small
molecules that are safe and highly efficient and specific for promoting fibrocartilaginous differentiation of TMJ-
derived syMSCs. We also achieved a precisely controlled delivery of the small molecules in 3D-printed TMJ disc
scaffolds by adopting a self-assembling multi-domain peptide (MDP) hydrogel as a delivery vehicle. We also
devised a highly efficient and reliable imaging modality that will enable to track in vivo scaffold degradation and
new tissue formation. We will perform a comprehensive comparative study between small molecules and
CTGF/TGFβ3 as control-delivered in our scaffolds regarding local/tissue pH change, cytotoxicity, degradation
and tissue formation in our TMJ disc engineering model in vitro. We will conduct a comprehensive in vivo study
to balance scaffold degradation with tissue regeneration. The degradation rate will be controlled by applying
surface micro-porosity, and in vivo tracking of scaffold degradation as well as fibrocartilage regeneration will be
achieved via our minimally invasive imaging modality."

Human tumor cells, including breast cancers, exhibit aberrant DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways,
which drive genomic instability and carcinogenesis, and most importantly, may serve as novel molecular targets
that can be used to reverse treatment resistance phenotypes. However, the precise mechanisms governing the
repair of DSBs and how their dysregulation, including upstream signaling in cancers, contributes to tumor cell
resistance remains unclear. DSBs are induced by many types of cancer treatments, including ionizing radiation
(IR), PARP inhibitors, and chemotherapy. As such, the overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the
critical processes by which tumor cells respond to DSBs, as directed by SAMHD1, and how these repair
pathways can be exploited to improve breast cancer treatment. SAMHD1 is recognized for its dNTP
triphosphohydrolase activity, which restricts HIV-1 and other viral infections and for mutations associated with
Aicardi Goutières syndrome (AGS), an autoimmune disorder. SAMHD1 is also overexpressed in 27% of breast
cancers. We were the first to identify a novel role for SAMHD1 in promoting the end resection step of homologous
recombination (HR) repair independent of its dNTPase activity, which has since been independently validated.
Our preliminary data indicate that high SAMHD1 expression is associated with poor survival in breast cancer
patients treated with adjuvant IR, suggesting that SAMHD1 overexpression contributes to IR resistance. Using
a proteomic approach, we found that SAMHD1 interacts with a number of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins,
including CtIP and SIRT1. Our data suggest that SAMHD1 recruits CtIP to DSBs to facilitate DNA end resection
and HR independent of its dNTPase activity, and moreover, that SIRT1 directs SAMHD1 function in DSB repair
through deacetylation. Finally, we developed a novel therapeutic strategy whereby targeting SAMHD1 for
degradation with Vpx, a lentivirus accessory protein, packaged in virus-like particles (VLPs), sensitizes breast
cancer cells to DSB-inducing agents. Thus, we hypothesize that in addition to its role in dNTP metabolism,
SAMHD1 responds to SIRT1-mediated deacetylation to maintain genome integrity and govern breast cancer
treatment resistance by non-catalytically directing DNA end resection and HR through CtIP, which may be
exploited to improve breast cancer control. Using innovative genetic, cell biological, biochemical, structural, and
in vivo approaches, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of SAMHD1 in directing CtIP
in DSB repair; 2) Determine the regulation of SAMHD1 in DSB repair by SIRT1; 3) Establish SAMHD1 as a
potentially new molecular target for cancer therapy. Completion of this work will define how SAMHD1 non-
catalytically directs CtIP function in DSB repair to maintain genome integrity and govern breast cancer treatment
resistance, connect the SIRT1 acetylome with SAMHD1-regulated DSB repair, and establish proof of concept
for the use of VLPs containing Vpx to target SAMHD1 as a novel therapeutic approach for improving breast
cancer control."

Human tumor cells, including breast cancers, exhibit aberrant DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways,
which drive genomic instability and carcinogenesis, and most importantly, may serve as novel molecular targets
that can be used to reverse treatment resistance phenotypes. However, the precise mechanisms governing the
repair of DSBs and how their dysregulation, including upstream signaling in cancers, contributes to tumor cell
resistance remains unclear. DSBs are induced by many types of cancer treatments, including ionizing radiation
(IR), PARP inhibitors, and chemotherapy. As such, the overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the
critical processes by which tumor cells respond to DSBs, as directed by SAMHD1, and how these repair
pathways can be exploited to improve breast cancer treatment. SAMHD1 is recognized for its dNTP
triphosphohydrolase activity, which restricts HIV-1 and other viral infections and for mutations associated with
Aicardi Goutières syndrome (AGS), an autoimmune disorder. SAMHD1 is also overexpressed in 27% of breast
cancers. We were the first to identify a novel role for SAMHD1 in promoting the end resection step of homologous

Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) is the largest teaching and referral hospital in Kenya. KNH’s mandate
includes facilitating research and participating in national health planning and policy development, in addition
to providing medical training and care. As the leading site for clinical research in Kenya, KNH established a
Research and Programs Department to oversee conduct of research which currently is implementing >40
collaborative clinical research projects and programs and has seen growth of the internal research database
with >2,000 research conducted to date.
For over 90% of the implemented programs, KNH researchers act as subcontractors on awards due to limited
pre-award research administration capacity. Of the awards at KNH, 80% are linked to the collaborating partner
University of Washington (UW). Through this partnership many research trainings, mentorship and career
growth opportunities have been made available to the KNH researchers and other local institutions.
Researchers have attained MPH or PhD trainings, advanced research trainings and mentorship that have
expanded their capacity in research methods and grant writing skills from institutions such as UW and Yale
University. This has created more applications being developed by KNH investigators, but has not increased
the capacity or systems at KNH to effectively support pre-award research administration. This creates a need
to strengthen the capacity for pre-award grants management processes at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH)
and other local institutions in Kenya to eliminate over reliance from outside collaborative institutions. By
strengthening the capacity for pre-award grants management processes, it will enable more KNH researchers
to successfully apply for research funding from NIH, and create a benchmark for other local institutions to learn
and improve their grants processes.
The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Train two KNH senior research administrators on pre-award grant
management processes at University of Washington and the National Institutes of Health; 2) Develop
institutional pre-award processes that are compliant with the US federal government regulations; and 3) Build
capacity through training of other research administrators at KNH and other Kenyan institutions that receive
NIAID funds.
Two senior administrators at KNH will undergo training at UW (Global WACh and UW's Office of Sponsored
Programs) and NIH to help them to develop standard operating procedures and training materials on NIH
grants management. Post training, they will implement an on-the-job training and mentorship program by
creating a research administrators’ community of practice aimed at enhancing capacity for other research
administrators within KNH. The overall implementation will be overseen by the MPIs Dr. John Kinuthia, deputy
director Research and Programs department at KNH and Ms. Emmaculate Nzove, a Program manager."

 Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) is a global public health threat. Pregnant and postpartum
women are at increased risk of TB and RR-TB, especially among those with HIV. Maternal TB increases
the risks of maternal morbidity and mortality, adverse pregnancy outcomes and transmission of both TB
and HIV to their infants. In 2022 the World Health Organization recommended a novel all-oral 6-month
regimen for RR-TB. However, as very few pregnant women were included in the clinical trials, there are
limited data on the use of this regimen during pregnancy.
 Adherence to RR-TB therapy could be reduced both in pregnancy (e.g., due to nausea and vomiting),
and in the postpartum period, driven by depression, which has a high incidence in the postpartum period in
our setting. Determining factors associated with adherence to RR-TB treatment during pregnancy and the
postpartum period is critical for developing evidence-based interventions. In Aim 1 of the proposed study,
we will enrol pregnant and non-pregnant women of childbearing potential with RR-TB and monitor their
adherence using electronic adherence monitoring devices. We will screen for depression using validated
screening tools. We will compare adherence between pregnant and non-pregnant women, and also
compare adherence during pregnancy with the postpartum period.
 Inadequate TB drug concentrations are associated with treatment failure and increase the risk of the
development of resistance. The physiological changes of pregnancy decrease the exposure of most drugs
and therefore, it is essential to determine whether adequate concentrations of RR-TB drugs are reached in
pregnancy. In Aim 2 of our proposed study, we will compare plasma concentrations of drugs in the new
regimen in the third trimester with the postpartum period. If we show a marked reduction during pregnancy
of one or more drugs this will pave the way for studies of dose adjustment in pregnancy.
 There are very limited data describing the exposure of RR-TB drugs in breastmilk. For Aim 3, we will
determine concentrations of the drugs in breastmilk and infant plasma (including some infants who will be
breastfed). These data will inform risks about toxicity to infants and possibly also the need for preventive
therapy.
 This study proposes a comprehensive model for investigating new therapeutic intervention for RR-TB
in pregnant women which includes mental health, adherence, and drug levels. This will inform how
therapeutic interventions for TB, HIV and other infectious diseases in this population are carried out."

The blood-brain barrier prevents most drugs from reaching the central nervous system and is one of the biggest
problems in developing new effective therapies for patients with brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and
other disorders. The use of ultrasound in combination with injected microbubble agents has emerged as a prom-
ising method to temporarily disrupt the barrier. After over a decade of preclinical studies in animals, multiple
commercial systems have been developed and clinical trials have begun. Early experience with these trials have
shown several problems that were predicted by the preclinical work. The clinical treatments use lower doses of
microbubbles, have to overcome the variable attenuation of the human skull, and are often in white matter. As a
result, treatments have been suboptimal. The purpose of this proposal is to provide a roadmap to clinical success
for ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening. We will develop new treatment planning methods that ac-
count for the human skull, electronic steering of the focused ultrasound beam, and variations in microbubble
concentrations in different tissue structures. These methods will be employed to improve safety and control of
the procedure. Next, we will investigate whether we can improve our ability to control the procedure in white
matter targets and evaluate the safety of repeated blood-brain barrier disruption in white matter targets. Finally,
using what we have learned, we will investigate whether we can deliver sufficient drugs to treat a highly infiltrating
tumor model. If successful, this work could have a significant impact on future use of this exciting technology."

Preterm birth and low birthweight are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in infancy and are risk
factors for chronic disease across the life course. Maternal exposure to particulate air pollution during
pregnancy has been associated with these adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although exposure to air pollution
varies on a daily basis, the majority of studies have focused on the effects of cumulative exposure averaged
across pregnancy. The underlying pathways linking air pollution with adverse pregnancy outcomes are
incompletely understood, however, growing evidence supports epigenetic dysregulation, including altered
microRNA (miRNA) expression, as one putative mechanism. During pregnancy, miRNAs of placental origin
can be packaged into vesicles and trafficked to distant targets in the maternal and fetal systems, where they
are thought to play a key role in cellular communication. However, the potential role of placental miRNAs in air
pollution-pregnancy outcome relationships is unknown. The goals of the proposed research are to 1)
investigate windows of prenatal susceptibility to particulate air pollution exposure, and 2) examine whether
altered extracellular vesicle (EV) encapsulated miRNAs of placental origin and placenta tissue miRNAs play a
role in these relationships. During the mentored K99 phase, Dr. Cowell will leverage data from 800 mother-
newborn pairs enrolled in the urban, predominantly minority PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress
Mechanisms (PRISM) pregnancy cohort to investigate spatially (1x1 km) and temporally (daily) resolved fine
particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in relation to fetal growth, birthweight, and gestational age. To accomplish
this, Dr. Cowell will train in methods for identifying windows of susceptibility, including distributive lag models
(DLMs) and recently developed DLM extensions for examining interactions (e.g., PM2.5 х sex). She will also
train in computational methods for analyzing transcriptomic data, which she will apply in the R00 phase. During
this phase, Dr. Cowell will investigate whether placental miRNAs, measured using RNA-seq, serve as a link
between air pollution exposure and pregnancy outcomes using mediation analysis and will examine effects on
the placental miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. She will also characterize changes in placental EV miRNAs
across pregnancy and examine PM2.5 exposure in relation to change. Results from this research will inform
public health strategies for reducing exposure and mitigating its impact during the most sensitive
developmental periods. The proposed studies will also provide insight on how PM2.5 operates at the biological
level and may contribute to the identification of early and informative biomarkers of pregnancy risk. Dr.
Cowell's mentoring team has expertise in air pollution exposure, susceptibility modeling, transcriptomics,
placental signaling and neonatology. This team will provide on-site training tailored to the proposed research
aims and will guide Dr. Cowell's transition to independence and her establishment of a research program that
integrates `big data' analytics into children's environmental health and molecular epidemiology research."

The ongoing monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, with a total of more than 87,000 cases reported in over 100 non-
endemic countries, highlights the pandemic potential of poxviruses. Due to its zoonotic nature with broad hosts
and unidentified natural reservoirs of the causative agent, mpox virus (MPXV), future spillovers and outbreaks
are expected even if the current outbreak is contained. Although typically manifesting in milder symptoms than
smallpox, MPXV infections can still cause significant morbidity and mortality (up to 10% for clade I) that need to
be therapeutically mitigated. The clinical efficacy of FDA-approved smallpox antiviral drugs is unclear or
unpromising for treating MPXV, necessitating dedicated and expanded efforts in developing MPXV antivirals.
The goal of this grant application is to develop novel antivirals for treating MPXV. Prior research from our team
has developed and validated an efficient and robust reporter assay using the vaccinia virus (VACV), and
identified and characterized three high quality and chemically distinct antiviral hits with strong potencies (EC50 =
0.14‒2.1 M; plaque reduction at 10 M 1,400‒160,000-fold), no cytotoxicity (CC50 > 250 M) and largely
favorable ADME properties. The immediate focus of this grant is to further develop these three hit series into
pre-clinical candidates using a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary approach combining medicinal chemistry,
virology, ADME / pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicity, animal efficacy and proteomics. Three Specific Aims are
proposed: 1) optimization and expansion of the identified hits. Iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) and
structure-property relationship (SPR) studies will be carried out via extensive analog synthesis, antiviral assay
and ADME profiling to obtain optimized leads. Hit expansion will also be conducted by screening the high quality
synthetic compounds in PI’s lab as well as preselected commercial compounds; Aim 2) in vivo PK, toxicity and
efficacy studies, where the acute and sub-acute toxicity and PK studies in mice will guide compound selection
for efficacy studies in mice; Aim 3) determine the antiviral mechanism of action (MOA). The molecular targets
and antiviral MOA of optimized leads will be determined using a few different methods: a) identify the viral
replication stage(s) targeted by the leads; b) select resistant mutants by passaging virus in cultured cells in the
presence of individual lead compound, and sequence viral genomes to identify affected genes; The compound
will then be tested in recombinant viruses harboring the selected mutations; c) design and synthesize chemical
probes to label, pull down, and identify the target protein(s); d) test metal chelating analogs in resolvase
biochemical assays. Overall, 2-3 antiviral leads with strong potency, favorable PK profiles, minimal toxicities,
and established MOA will be developed, setting the stage for further pre-clinical development of MPXV drugs
that will also contribute substantially to countering other orthopoxviruses."

In the USA, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 16 million children and adolescents, who are undergoing critical
periods of brain development when higher cognitive abilities are acquired, and mental illnesses typically emerge.
Autopsy, blood, and CSF studies during acute COVID-19 reported neuroinflammation, which can alter cerebral
white and gray matter morphometry, microstructure, and brain function. These brain alterations are associated
with elevated risks for cognitive deficits and mental illness. A major gap in our current knowledge exists in
understanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection during adolescence may impact brain structure and function and
consequently, cognition and mental health. To address this gap, we will utilize pre-/post-pandemic neuroimaging,
cognitive, and psychiatric symptom data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®. We
will test the overall hypothesis that neuroinflammation during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to brain
changes that are detectable on MRI, including lasting alterations in macro and microstructural and
functional abnormalities, which in turn mediate poorer cognitive performance and mental health. In Aim
1, we will identify morphometric (on structural MRI) and microstructural (on diffusion tensor imaging)
abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing longitudinal MRI data between those with
(COVID+) and without a prior documented COVID-19 history (COVID-) to evaluate group differences on cortical
thickness, cortical surface areas, subcortical volumes, and microstructural measures across baseline, year 2
and year 4 follow-up visits. Aim 2 will determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection alters brain function using the
Emotional N-Back task. We will longitudinally compare brain activation patterns and performance scores
between the COVID+ and COVID- groups. Aim 3 will evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with
increased risks for neurobehavioral abnormalities. We will use data from the NIH Toolbox® Cognitive Battery
and Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia 5 to longitudinally compare cognitive
performance and anxiety/depression prevalence between the two groups. Lastly, mediation analyses will be
performed to assess the direct and indirect impact of changes in brain structure and function on cognition and
mental health. For all Aims, sex differences and sex-specific effects will be evaluated. Throughout this 3-year
project, I will be supported by my sponsor, Dr. Linda Chang, and my co-sponsors, Drs. Amal Isaiah, Gloria
Reeves, and Thomas Ernst, who will provide interdisciplinary expertise and training to me in the areas of COVID-
19, neuroimaging, neurodevelopment, cognitive assessments, clinical research, MRI data processing and
analyses, data mining, and adolescent psychiatry. Furthermore, my training will be sufficiently supplemented
with coursework, seminars, career workshops, conferences, and mentorship opportunities to allow me to fully
develop into a well-rounded, independent investigator in clinical neuroimaging research."

The intrinsically disordered carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) may
nucleate the formation of transcription factories through a mechanism of liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS). Transcription factories are densely packed membraneless organelles (MLOs) that contain all
the necessary components to perform the transcription cycle. The intrinsically disordered carboxy
terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in model organisms such as S. cerevisiae, S.
pombe and C. albicans, is composed of ~ 26 copies of consensus repeats (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7). However,
we have recently shown that CTD sequences of fungi isolated from geographically distinct locations
from temperate to polar regions, show high sequence diversity at positions 1, 4, and 7 and undergo
LLPS differently. The CTD is highly conserved at its Ser-Pro motifs where it is the target of
phosphorylation and cis-trans prolyl isomerization by Ess1. Ess1, an essential PPIase in yeast (Pin1 in
humans), has a highly conserved evolutionary relationship with the CTD. Ess1 and phosphorylation
may modulate the phase separation behavior of the CTD, but the molecular mechanism remains
elusive. This proposal has two specific aims to test my hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will elucidate the
mechanism of CTD LLPS by generating wild-type CTD and functional unit mutants and subjecting them
to a series of turbidity assays with and without the presence of Ess1 to elucidate differences in LLPS
due to sequence contribution. LLPS will be observed by naked eye, differential interference (DIC)
microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. In Aim 2 we will determine how
regulators of CTD function, phosphorylation and isomerization by Ess1, influence the LLPS of the CTD.
To do so we will adopt the same approach as Aim 1 but phosphorylate CTD constructs and induce the
LLPS of these constructs with and without the presence of Ess1. For both aims 1 and 2 we will
investigate the atomic structure of the CTD both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated and in
complex with Ess1. We will utilize nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and specialized
pulse sequences that enable the detection of single amino acid residues to determine the isomerization
state of the CTD which will enable the elucidation of Ess1 involvement in LLPS. Upon completion of
this study, our expected outcomes are elucidation of the mechanism by which LLPS of the CTD recruits
Ess1 and how cis-trans isomerization influences LLPS. We expect to have a positive impact by
providing a molecular basis for the role of LLPS in mediating the assembly of transcription factories by
the CTD, thereby enabling additional pathways for therapeutically targeting transcription associated
diseases."

This grant application is a renewal of an NIH-funded project in developing bioresorbable metallic stents in
treatment of heart disease. The goal of this study is to optimize a novel bioresorbable zinc-based drug-eluting
stents for pediatric cardiovascular applications and conduct comprehensive in vitro and in vivo testing to evaluate
their efficacy.
 Coarctation of the aorta is a common heart defect in children, causing narrowing of the aorta and resulting
in various symptoms. Traditional metallic drug-eluting stents are not suitable for pediatric patients due to their
interference with artery development. To address this, biodegradable drug-eluting stents (BDES) are being
explored. However, current materials have limitations in mechanical strength and degradation. To overcome this,
a new solution called biodegradable zinc-lithium-manganese (Zn-Li-Mn) stents with a drug-eluting coating (Z-
DES) has been developed. These stents offer mechanical strength, ductility, and stable biodegradation.
 The study aims to optimize the composition and configuration of Z-DES and evaluate its efficacy. In Aim
1, different Zn-Li-Mn alloys coated with PLLA and Sirolimus will be tested for mechanical properties and
biocompatibility. Aim 2 focuses on assessing Z-DES biodegradation and safety in rat abdominal aortas. Aim 3
aims to validate Z-DES in a large animal model with narrowed aortas. The success of this research could lead
to biodegradable pediatric stents that significantly improve patient outcomes and revolutionize cardiovascular
interventions in children."

Recent studies in humans and mice have identified previously unknown interactions between the host gut
microbiome and Plasmodium that dictate susceptibility to severe malaria. Yet, the specific members of gut
microbiota and their functions responsible for differential malaria outcomes remain unknown. The objective of
this application is to determine the gut bacteria function that shapes host immunity to Plasmodium and
susceptibility to severe malaria. We have demonstrated that gut microbiota in mice affects the magnitude of
parasite burden and severity of malaria by modulating Plasmodium-induced humoral immune responses in the
spleen, the secondary lymphoid organ required for immune-mediated clearance of Plasmodium. Our data
demonstrate that gut bacteria do not confer resistance to hyperparasitemia. Rather, specific bacteria confer
susceptibility to hyperparasitemia. Specifically, gut Bacteroides species function within a microbial consortium
to cause susceptibility to hyperparasitemia in mice. Of note, Ugandan children with severe malarial anemia
have increased abundances of several Bacteroides species compared to children with asymptomatic
Plasmodium falciparum infections. Importantly, colonizing hyperparasitemia-resistant mice with these human-
associated Bacteroides species caused susceptibility to hyperparasitemia. These data strongly support the
relevance and translational potential of our ongoing efforts using murine malaria to identify mechanisms by
which gut bacteria cause susceptibility to severe malaria and investigate gut microbiome-based therapeutics to
prevent severe malaria. Our data show that mice susceptible to hyperparasitemia have increased regulatory T
cells (Tregs) in both intestinal tissue and the spleen before and during Plasmodium infection. Tregs have been
shown in mice to inhibit humoral immunity to Plasmodium. Bacteroides are among the primary producers of the
short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate that induces Tregs. We have also published that mice susceptible to
hyperparasitemia have increased amounts of propionate compared to hyperparasitemia-resistant mice.
Intriguingly, we have published that treating hyperparasitemia-susceptible mice orally with the antibiotics
metronidazole or vancomycin reduces the severity of malaria. Oral treatment with metronidazole decreases
intestinal propionate levels, while oral treatment with vancomycin decreases colonic Tregs. These novel
findings support the central hypothesis that propionate production by gut bacteria induces Tregs that dampen
humoral immunity to Plasmodium, causing susceptibility to severe malaria. This hypothesis will be tested
through the following aims: Aim 1. Determine if propionate-producing bacteria cause susceptibility to severe
malaria by inducing Tregs that dampen humoral immunity. Aim 2. Determine if stool propionate levels and
Tregs correlate with malaria disease severity in diverse groups of African children and mice."

Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a devastating disease characterized by recurring episodic inflammation of the colonic
mucosa that imposes a significant health and monetary burden on the developed world. Currently a significant
portion of patients with UC are treated with TNFα inhibiting antibodies. Such treatments are burdensome on the
healthcare system financially and pose the risk of significant side effects and frequently lead to the development
of anti-drug antibodies, and consequent infusion reactions, and treatment failure. Consequently, researching
novel cost effective, low risk approaches for treating ulcerative colitis should be of high priority. One approach is
to leverage the microbiome to restore and maintain a non-inflammatory state in the colon, instead of targeting
the systemic immune system. Dysbiosis is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and leads to consequent dysregulation
of local host immune pathways such as neutrophil transmigration through the intestinal epithelium, which has
been shown to be instrumental in the initiation of mucosal inflammation in UC and its perpetuation through
disruption of the intestinal barrier. The dysbiotic microbes in the colon of patients with UC have been shown to
decrease P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. Under homeostatic conditions P-gp inhibits neutrophil transmigration
through maintenance of a transepithelial gradient of endocannabinoids, thereby preventing aberrant
inflammation. Thus, increases in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) P-gp expression promises to limit inflammation in
UC by preventing neutrophil transcytosis. To this end we must understand the mechanisms by which intestinal
P-gp is regulated. While previous work has shown the microbiome dependence of intestinal P-gp expression,
the specific microbial signals and the underlying metabolic networks have not yet been explored. In this proposal
I will design an optimized microbial consortium to induce P-gp in IECs and dampen colonic inflammation in
ulcerative colitis. Additionally, I study the microbial signals and underlying microbial dynamics that induces P-gp.
In Aim 1 I will determine candidate bacterial species with the potential to regulate IEC P-gp. I will then use these
strains to design and optimize a commensal consortium to induce P-gp when transferred into mice. The use of
such a consortium as a potential bacteriotherapeutic for dampening intestinal inflammation will be studied using
murine inflammatory bowel disease models. In Aim 2 I will study the mechanisms by which microbes
communicate with each other and the host epithelium to induce P-gp. I will use a targeted and an unbiased
approach to determine the bacterial signals and metabolites that upregulate P-gp and study the interactions
between bacterial species that encourage P-gp induction on IECs. Overall, this study will provide insight into
how the human microbiome regulates neutrophil transmigration and consequently intestinal inflammation. The
design of the commensal consortium will serve as a first step in the development of a bacteriotherapeutic for
treatment of ulcerative colitis."

While conventional electromagnetic approaches to non-invasive brain stimulation are limited in their spatial
resolution and penetration depth, ultrasonic neuromodulation carries the potential of millimeter scale
stimulation of deep brain regions without the need for surgery. Abundant evidence shows that low intensity
focused ultrasound stimulation (FUS) modulates brain activity. However, there have been several reports of
substantial variability in the neural response to ultrasound, with the same ""dose"" producing disparate effects.
Understanding the source of variability is critical to harnessing the vast potential of FUS in basic neuroscience,
neurology, and psychiatry.
The long term goal of this research is to develop FUS into a personalized, closed loop technology that
can drive brain activity towards desirable states. As the first step towards this goal, the overall objective of this
proposal is to identify the primary source of the variability in neuronal responses to FUS. Based on our group's
preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that response to FUS is greatly influenced by brain state, and that
the outcome of stimulation may be accurately predicted by taking into account the dynamics of neural activity
leading up to stimulation. In the proposed work, we will thoroughly test the notion that FUS is state dependent
by probing the influence of oscillatory dynamics and cell type during both sleep and wake states. Our specific
aims are: (1) Identify the relationship between baseline LFP dynamics and neuronal response during sleep, (2)
Identify the role of cell type in response to FUS during sleep, and (3) Identify the determinants of neuronal
response to FUS in the awake state. We will work with both urethane-anesthetized and head-fixed awake rats,
and will target the hippocampus with FUS while simultaneously capturing electrophysiological activity.
The proposed work is significant because it addresses the central problem with ultrasonic
neuromodulation: how to make its effects more robust and predictable. This research is innovative because it
explicitly links neural dynamics leading up to stimulation with the subsequent response to FUS.
The products of this research have the potential to solve a central problem in FUS: variability of
response. By delineating the conditions that lead to robust effects, this research will bring the FUS field one
step closer to closed-loop capabilities, which clearly necessitate predictable responses. Moreover, we will
obtain a clearer understanding of the mechanism of FUS by considering the neurobiological substrates of the
responsive states identified in this research. For example, if we do confirm a link between FUS response and
baseline gamma, this will shed light on the (gamma generating) circuits that FUS is modulating. This
knowledge will then immediately inform the rapidly growing FUS neuromodulation research community as well
as future pilot studies in neurology and psychiatry."
10906551,"Abstract
Muscle regrowth and function following disuse atrophy in aged muscle is significantly compromised, and this
increases the risk for falls, long-term disability, and loss of independence. Therapeutic strategies to enhance
muscle recovery are non-existent stemming from a poor understanding of cellular mechanism during regrowth
in aging muscle. Invasion of muscle macrophages and polarization to pro- and anti-inflammatory states are
critical to promote muscle stem cell function and the full resolution of muscle and function following disuse. More
recently, macrophage metabolism has been shown to be tightly coupled to the inflammatory state of activated
macrophages and regulated by transcription factors such as HIF-1α and accumulation of TCA intermediates
such as succinate. Our preliminary data in impaired aged muscle during early recovery supports decreased
macrophage succinate and HIF-1α corresponding to a reduced macrophage glycolytic and inflammatory
program and functional characteristics. Therefore, using novel mouse genetic and bone marrow transfer
experiments, along with chemical approaches and in vitro studies, we will test if succinate and HIF-1α are key
regulatory steps for macrophage metabolic and inflammatory activation during regrowth from disuse in aging
muscle and if this dysfunction arises from an aged immune system. In Aim 2, we will translate our pre-clinical
findings to young and older humans and confirm our hypothesis by extensively characterizing muscle
macrophage metabolic and inflammatory functional states in vivo and in vitro during recovery from disuse
atrophy. We anticipate that the findings will identify macrophage metabolism as a future target to accelerate the
recovery of aged muscle following disuse related events (e.g., surgery, illness)."

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which a highly orchestrated host-microbial interaction leads
to the destruction of the tooth-supporting structures including periodontal tissue attachment and alveolar bone.
Mast cells are found in the gingiva; their numbers are increased in chronic periodontitis and the degree of their
activation correlates well with disease severity. Not surprisingly, it has recently been shown that mast cells
contribute to Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis in mice, but the mechanisms involved in their
activation and regulation remain unknown. Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2, mouse
counterpart MrgprB2) is a newly described cell surface receptor that is expressed in a subtype of mast cells
found predominantly in the skin and the gingiva. We recently demonstrated that MRGPRX2-expressing mast
cells are present in normal gingiva and that their numbers are increased in patients with chronic periodontitis.
In addition, our unpublished preliminary data demonstrated that compared to wild-type mice, MrgprB2-/- mice
are protected from mast cell recruitment, gingival inflammation, and bone loss in a ligature-induced model of
periodontitis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment and activation of mast cells
through MRGPRX2/B2 contribute to periodontitis. In aim 1, we will develop two models of humanized mice.
The first involves retroviral transduction of MRGPRX2 into MrgprB2-/- mouse bone marrow stem cells, their
differentiation into bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) ex vivo and their engraftment into mast cell-deficient
Wsh/Wsh mice. The second involves CRISPR/Cas9-mediated replacement of MrgprB2 with MRGPRX2. These
humanized mice will be used to study Porphyromonas gingivalis and ligature-induced periodontitis. In aim 2,
we will modulate periodontitis by targeting MRGPRX2/MrgprB2-mediated cofilin and NF-κB signaling in mast
cells. Successful completion of this study will lead to the development of new preclinical models to modulate
periodontitis through specific small molecule receptor antagonists and by targeting signaling in mast cells."
10902737,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Liver dysfunction is a major global health concern. In the U.S. alone, liver disease is the 10th leading cause of
death and afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Managing and treating liver diseases is difficult and costly. In
cases of end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation is the most effective therapy, but it is severely limited by
donor organ supply, necessitating the development of therapeutic alternatives to whole organ replacement.
Extensive necrosis and poor regeneration observed in acute liver injuries can result in liver failure.
Acetaminophen (APAP), a common analgesic, can result in liver failure and death when taken in excess. A better
understanding of hepatocyte biology is required to improve existing approaches and innovate therapies for liver
disease treatment, including APAP-induced liver failure. Most somatic cells are diploid and contain single pairs
of homologous chromosomes, while hepatocytes are characterized by polyploidy, an increase in entire
chromosome sets. Polyploid hepatocytes comprise >90% of hepatocytes in adult mice and 25-50% in adult
humans. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate polyploidization have been well characterized;
however, the functions of diploid and polyploid hepatocytes are poorly understood. In the context of liver
regeneration, diploid hepatocytes begin proliferating earlier and complete the cell cycle faster than polyploids,
suggesting that diploid hepatocytes drive an initial wave of proliferation. The overall goal of this project is to
understand how diploid and polyploid hepatocytes function during compensatory proliferation following APAP-
induced injury and the molecular mechanisms that contribute to these differences. The central hypothesis tested
in the proposal is that diploid and polyploid hepatocytes respond differently to APAP overdose, where
diploids resist APAP damage and drive critical, early-stage compensatory proliferation. This hypothesis
will be studied with 2 aims. Aim 1 will determine ploidy-specific effects on hepatocyte regeneration during APAP
overdose. Experiments will evaluate APAP-induced damage, compensatory regeneration, and mechanisms
regulating oxidative stress, specifically sirtuin signaling, in polyploid knockout models and cultured hepatocytes.
Aim 2 will investigate proliferation by human diploid and polyploid hepatocytes. Experiments will test the
regenerative and injury responses of diploid and polyploid cells isolated from human livers. Overall, this project
will expand our understanding of hepatocyte ploidy populations and their roles in acute liver injuries. These
findings may lead to the development of strategies or therapeutics to improve liver disease treatments."
10894656,"Oral anticoagulation is a foremost, guideline-based priority for stroke prevention in individuals with atrial
fibrillation (AF), a common condition with high social and medical costs. Social determinants of health (SDOH)
contribute to accessibility of anticoagulation and the long-term adherence necessary for stroke prevention. This
patient-oriented mentoring research program will (1) examine the relations of individual- and neighborhood-
level social factors with oral anticoagulation, and (2) accelerate an innovative health services mentoring
program in SDOH and AF and cardiovascular disease. SDOH have had limited investigation in AF, such that
the investigations described here will inform how SDOH contribute to disparities in anticoagulation. The
investigations build on and leverage the core infrastructure of an active, funded health services research
program, the resources of a large, regional health care system, and the availability of large, highly
generalizable administrative health claims data. The specific investigatory aims are: (1) Evaluate
neighborhood-level SDOH in relation to anticoagulant adherence as measured by proportion of days covered
(PDC). This aim will add geocoding to two actively recruiting clinical trials (n=504) which aim to improve
adherence to anticoagulation in individuals with limited social resources. (2) Relate neighborhood-level SDOH
to anticoagulation. Employing the extensive electronic health record of the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, the analysis will examine associations of neighborhood-level SDOH with anticoagulation prescribing in
individuals with AF in a large, socially heterogeneous region. (3) Examine SDOH in relation to anticoagulant
prescription and 1-year adherence in a large administrative database. We will employ Optum Clinformatics to
examine individual-level SDOH in relation to PDC from 2015-2021. These investigations will be conducted in
the framework of a well-established mentoring program and build on the PI's active mentoring capacity in the
Schools of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentoring activities expand the
candidate's role with NHLBI-funded T32 training programs, the University of Pittsburgh cardiology fellowship,
internal medicine residency, and pre- and post-doctoral students in the School of Public Health. The project (1)
leverages multidisciplinary mentoring opportunities within the University sponsored by the Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (CTSI); (2) bolsters mentorship in conduct and design of clinical trials; and (3)
extends and broadens the applicant's demonstrated commitment towards mentoring and retention of
individuals from groups historically underrepresented in medicine. In summary, the award program will
enhance evaluation of SDOH in cardiovascular disease, health services research with large-sized
administrative data, and capacities for robust academic, research, and clinical mentoring. This application
proposes innovative research in SDOH and cardiovascular disease alongside career development activities for
substantive progress and achievement as a mentor in patient-oriented research."
10894657,"Primary graft dysfunction, a severe form of acute lung injury, occurs in 20-30% of lung transplant recipients
and is a major determinant of both short- and long-term outcomes. Risk of PGD is affected by clinical features
of both the donor and recipient as well as by operative management. However, the cellular mechanisms that
underlie risk of PGD are incompletely understood and new studies of mechanisms contributing to PGD are
essential to development and testing of specific therapies to mitigate PGD risk. Our published and preliminary
data suggest that cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) is a major causal factor in the alveolar-capillary disruption that
leads to the characteristic development of pulmonary edema in PGD. In a pilot case-control study, we showed
that elevated recipient pre-operative plasma CFH is independently associated with increased PGD risk. In a
human ex vivo lung perfusion model, CFH in the perfusate caused increased microvascular permeability by
oxidative injury to the lung endothelium. Similarly, elevated levels of intra-alveolar CFH are associated with
severe lung injury in critically ill patients and intra-bronchial instillation of CFH into ex vivo human lungs injures
the lung epithelial barrier and impairs alveolar fluid clearance. New preliminary data show increased CFH in
the airspace of donor lung allografts. In this proposal, we will determine how peri-operative management may
magnify the impact of CFH on PGD. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) increase hemolysis and release of CFH. Although ECMO has been associated with
lower PGD risk than CPB, it is unclear whether this is explained by alterations in CFH. Higher driving pressure
during mechanical ventilation may also increase CFH and alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction. Furthermore,
increased FiO2 at reperfusion augments the association between CFH and PGD and hyperoxia exacerbates
CFH-induced lung injury in ex vivo human lungs. This strong preliminary data supports the concept that peri-
operative management affects PGD by modulating accumulation and oxidation of CFH. In this proposal, we
will establish a three-site consortium to test the hypothesis that CFH causes PGD via oxidative injury
to the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers. We will also determine how modifiable risk factors
including mechanical support and hyperoxia at reperfusion increase accumulation and oxidation of
CFH, thereby increasing risk of PGD. There are three specific aims: 1) test the independent effects of
intravascular and intra-alveolar CFH on risk of PGD and injury to the endothelial and epithelial barriers, 2)
determine how peri-operative factors affect intravascular and intra-alveolar CFH accumulation, and 3) test how
CFH oxidation by intra-operative hyperoxia increases risk of PGD. Completion of this large multicenter cohort
study of lung transplant recipients will provide novel insight into the relative contributions of intravascular and
intra-alveolar CFH to PGD and identify modifiable factors that alter CFH accumulation and oxidation, providing
the necessary foundation for development of clinical trials to mitigate PGD with CFH-targeted interventions."
10894662,"Pain management is a top priority during pediatric burn dressing changes. Although virtual reality (VR) for pain
management during burn care has been studied in clinical trials for more than 2 decades, there is still no evidence
of the effectiveness of smartphone VR for pain management during the care transition from medical settings to
at-home burn care. This study’s long-term goal is to use innovative, patient-centric smartphone VR to improve
patient experience and outcomes. Based on our published findings that our innovative VR Pain Alleviation Tool
(VR-PAT) could result in a clinically meaningful reduction in pain (47.1% overall pain reduction) among 90
pediatric burn patients treated at our hospital outpatient clinic, the overall objectives are to (i) determine VR-PAT
effectiveness for pain management and opioid medication use reduction during at-home burn care, and (ii) to
identify potential facilitators and barriers that could affect wide use of VR-PAT. The central hypothesis is that
VR-PAT can induce clinically meaningful pain reduction (>30%) during repeated at-home burn dressing changes.
The rationale is that a determination of the VR-PAT effectiveness at reducing pain and opioid medication use,
safety, and patient/family engagement is likely to offer a strong scientific framework by which a smartphone VR
can be implemented widely and easily by families at-home. Two specific aims : 1) Evaluate effectiveness of VR-
PAT for pain management and opioid pain medication reduction during at-home burn care; 2) Examine
continuous engagement of patients and caregivers with VR-PAT during repeated at-home burn dressing
changes. A two-group randomized clinical trial will be implemented among a total of 200 pediatric burn patients
(6-17 years old). Patients and caregivers from both the intervention group (VR-PAT) and control group (standard
care) will complete their daily burn dressing changes at home. Overall pain and worst pain will be measured
using a standardized pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during each burn dressing change for 1 week. Area
under the curve for child reported overall pain (AUC-VAS) and morphine equivalent total dose of pain
medications (AUC-OC) will be integrated to calculate composite pain score intensity and opioid consumption
(PIOC) score as the primary outcome for Aim 1. For Aim 2, adverse events, VR experience and engagement
will be measured in the VR group to specifically address challenges in designing mHealth interventions that
the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM) identified as needing more research. This project is innovative
because it not only tests an innovative smartphone VR to optimize patient’s experience and outcomes during at-
home care but will also develop a novel composite pain assessment statistical method for broader burn research.
The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific as well as practical
justifications for implementing smartphone VR for pain management during at-home burn care. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential of offering smartphone VR as an effective and safe non-pharmaceutical pain
management approach during care transition from medical settings to at-home care by family caregivers."
10894936,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women and results in more deaths
than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. The primary reason for the high death rate of ovarian
cancer is multidrug-resistance. Since conventional anticancer drugs cannot kill drug-resistant cells while causing
systemic toxicity to deteriorate patient health condition, a novel effective and safe treatment for ovarian cancer
is urgently needed. Our preliminary study has discovered a novel polymer-metal combination which uniquely
induces a lysosomal copper elevation initiated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Consequently, this combination is
highly selectively in killing cancer cells, including drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells, while not
damaging healthy cells. The objective of this research is to develop a polymer-metal nano-complex (PMC) for
safe and effective ovarian cancer therapy through a cancer cell selective apoptosis mechanism. Our project has
three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the mechanism of cancer cell killing effect of PMC. Aim 2 will identify
the cancer selective killing mechanism of PMC and optimize its formulation to achieve the highest selectivity for
cancer cells. Aim 3 will investigate the pharmacokinetic properties, examine the biodistribution of PMC, and
evaluate its tumor growth inhibitory effect, immune response, and systemic toxicity. In summary, the unique
anticancer mechanism of PMC and its simple formulation will provide clinicians a safe and effective tool to control
advanced ovarian cancer and benefit ovarian cancer patients."
10894937,"Project Summary
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a type of soft tissue sarcomas deeply associated with
nerves. The clinical observation and mouse model studies indicate the vital role of the nerve microenvironment
in MPNST tumorigenesis, but the mechanism is still not clear. Our recent data showed a stem-like tumor cell
population in both primary human MPNST and MPNST mouse models. The cancer stem cell (CSC) population
in mouse MPNSTs can be labeled by a transgene that was also expressed in the neural crest stem cell, the
cell-of-origin of NF1-associated tumors. The CSCs demonstrated significantly high potentials to generate new
tumors in sciatic nerve transplantation and the metastases by intracardiac injection. The nerve-enriched tumor
microenvironment and the consistent high ERBB3 expression between neural crest stem cells and CSCs
strongly suggest the neuregulin1 (NRG1)-ERBB3 signaling, which regulates early Schwann cell lineage
development, can contribute to the tumor initiation. CD44 facilitates the ERBB2 and ERBB3 heterodimer
formation and promotes the downstream focal adhesion kinase, boosting the metastatic phenotype.
Interestingly, the CD44 can be upregulated through loss of function of TP53 and activated ERK signaling that
are also the two critical determinants for MPNST malignant progression. Therefore, we will test the central
hypothesis that targeting the NRG1-ERBB3-CD44 positive feedback loop can inhibit tumor initiation and CSC-
related metastasis. Using a novel transgenic mouse model and humanized MPNST models, we will pursue
three aims 1) To test the hypothesis that disruption of the NRG1-ERBB3-CD44 loop blocks MPNST growth and
progression. 2) To test whether hyaluronan-CD44-PAK2 signaling is critical for MPNST CSC-initiated
metastatic seeding and growth. 3) To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting the ERBB3-CD44 axis
combined with ERK inhibition on humanized MPNST models. We expect the 1) ERBB3-targeted treatment will
inhibit the tumor growth, 2) CD44-targeted treatment can attenuate the CSC-induced metastasis, and 3) we
can prove the principle of therapeutic effects on MPNST xenograft models and through combination with MEK
inhibitor to suppress the single-drug induced resistance. These discoveries may fill the gap in MPNST
tumorigenesis and metastasis and pave the path for innovative translational study and clinical application."

The overall goal of this proposal is to provide the training, career development, and mentorship that will result in
Dr. Hinds’ ability to integrate the bodies of research surrounding sexual minority (SM) identity development with
tobacco use across the lifespan, expanding and improving upon culturally-relevant conceptual models that
explain SM tobacco use. Dr. Hinds is a postdoctoral research fellow and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Steve
Hicks School of Social work at The University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Hinds’ research portfolio has focused on
describing and explaining the tobacco use disparities of sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults. Dr.
Hinds’ long term career goal is to be a faculty member at a top-tier research university with a portfolio of
independent, community-engaged collaborative research aimed at eliminating SGM tobacco and substance use
disparities. Dr. Hinds completed a 2-year postdoctoral research fellowship funded through the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), focused on promoting health equity in cardiovascular disease
(T32HL140290). Dr. Hinds completed graduate training in Tobacco Regulatory Science and received her PhD
in Health Behavior and Health Education. In the current five-year proposal, Dr. Hinds outlines three training goals
that are critical to expanding her skill set as an SM-focused tobacco researcher, to be addressed through
coursework, seminars, directed readings, and mentored meetings: 1) content training in SM identity development
and tobacco use across the lifespan, 2) methodological training in psychometrics and survey instrument
development, and 3) data analysis training in order to test and refine a comprehensive model of SM tobacco use
that includes elements of SM identity, measured multidimensionally. Dr. Hinds has assembled a strong
mentoring team of highly successful, multidisciplinary experts who can each advise on multiple training goals
and research aims, where Dr. Hinds will comprehensively examine the SM identity-related factors and
dimensions that are linked to both increased and decreased risk for tobacco use and yield the following three
primary outcomes: Aim 1) novel findings into the association between identity dimensions and milestones with
tobacco use, based on mixed method secondary data analysis of two of the most prominent SM-focused studies
ever conducted in the U.S.; Aim 2) a novel survey instrument assessing the phenomenon of SM identity
management behaviors, and Aim 3) an updated and comprehensive conceptual model of SM tobacco use, that
integrates the identity elements of dimensions, milestones, and identity management behaviors as explanatory
mechanisms, alongside minority stress, in explaining unique determinants of SM tobacco use. Ultimately,
findings from this project will improve our understanding of the etiology of SM tobacco use disparities, and inform
an R01 proposal that will identify avenues for identity-affirming initiatives designed to reduce SM tobacco use."
10901734,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogenous set of diseases
and is considered one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes. TNBC lack of well-defined endocrine
markers limits the therapeutic options for these patients. This has spurred significant efforts towards developing
therapies directed towards the tumor microenvironment, but these have demonstrated only modest success.
This is attributed to the high functional heterogeneity of macrophages, which is in part determined by their origin,
and the distinct molecular landscape of different TNBC subtypes. Our overarching objective is to elucidate a
link between the molecular profile of TNBC and macrophage origin and function in order to establish the
groundwork for the finetuning of the next generation of macrophage-targeted therapies to consider the tumor's
molecular signature as a proxy for macrophage function. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine a
potential enrichment of macrophages from different origins and functional profiles in TNBC subtypes with
divergent molecular landscapes. The central hypothesis is that luminal TNBC subtypes are enriched for tumor
antagonistic TRMs and their ablation gives way to pro-tumor MDMs colonization. The rationale is that
intratumoral macrophages can stem from different origins (i.e., embryonically derived tissue-resident (TRMs) or
monocyte-derived (MDMs)), which strongly influence their functional profile. MDMs are associated with tumor
promoting properties, while TRMs have been reported to play tumor antagonistic roles. Our preliminary data
supports that TNBC with divergent molecular profiles are enriched for macrophages of divergent origins. This
proposal consists of proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate macrophages TNBC molecular subtypes that
preserve epithelial properties are enriched for tumor antagonistic TRMs, while TNBC molecular subtypes that
have acquired mesenchymal features are enriched for tumor-promoting MDMs. Along this trajectory, the central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the origin and function of
intratumoral macrophages in claudin-low and luminal-like TNBC tumor subtypes and the need for epithelial
features to main a TRM pool. Aim 2 will determine a skewing of the macrophage compartment towards pro-
tumor MDMs in luminal-like TNBC after cessation of macrophage-ablation therapy. The proposed studies are
innovative because they will establish a correlation between TNBC molecular profile and macrophage origin and
function. The project is significant because establishing the molecular landscape of TNBC as a proxy for
macrophage function will serve to tailor macrophage-targeted therapies to account for macrophage
heterogeneity."
10904667,"To ensure aging Veterans remain active and mobile with as little musculoskeletal pain as possible, new
approaches to the prevention of osteoporosis and promotion of timely bone regeneration following a fracture are
necessary. This collaborative research study brings together a group of VA investigators with diverse
perspectives, insights, models, and techniques, to synergistically attack a major clinical problem that leads to
high morbidity and mortality among Veterans, a bone fracture. The overall research strategy of each integrated
project is to use pre-clinical models of a disease that either weakens bone or delays bone repair, to investigate
novel ways to enhance the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to promote bone formation, and to assess
disease and treatment effects on bone in a unified, stringent manner. Already under-diagnosed and under-
treated, osteoporosis is likely to increase the number of fragility fractures being treated at VA hospitals without
novel tools for early detection and novel treatment strategies that circumvent the rare but devastating side effects
of current therapies that inhibit bone loss. Addressing this unmet clinical need, the overall aims are to identify
therapeutic strategies to improve bone health among Veterans and to enhance the bone anabolism of PTH
signaling. The collaboration will address this overarching hypothesis: health problems disproportionately
affecting Veterans activate signaling pathways that increase bone resorption, suppress bone formation, or
impede the transition of cartilage to bone in a fracture callus such that improvements in the clinical management
of osteoporosis lie in understanding how these health problems hurt bone health."

Patients with diabetes mellitus have an estimated 27% elevated risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) and
are disproportionately Non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Hispanic. At the point that CRC is diagnosed in patients
with diabetes opportunities to implement CRC screening tests demonstrated to be effective in preventing CRC
and reducing cancer mortality have been missed. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) struggle to
implement CRC programs for average risk patients and primarily serve as primary care for priority populations
(low income and racial/ethnic minorities). Thus, targeted implementation strategies are needed that emphasize
CRC screening tests that prevent CRC for patients at elevated risk in safety-net settings. Herein, the main goal
of the proposal is to identify and overcome multi-level factors affecting optimal use of CRC preventive screening
options for patients with diabetes in FQHCs. The applicant set out to examine racial/ethnic differences of specific
CRC screening test use among patients with diabetes comparing individuals who receive majority of their care
in FQHCs vs patients receiving care in traditional primary care settings (Aim 1). To optimize and adapt
implementation strategies, an implementation planning group will be assembled. Using a community-based
participatory research method, data inputs from multiple sources (Aim 1 findings, scoping review) will inform a
local multi-method organizational implementation assessment (e.g. survey and key implementation actor
interviews). These findings will guide implementation toolkit and strategy development (Aim 2). In the R00 phase,
the implementation toolkit and strategy to optimize CRC preventive test use targeting patients with diabetes in
FQHCs will be evaluated using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation feasibility pilot (Aim 3). The candidate has
assembled an exceptional mentoring team, in an outstanding training environment to help her achieve her
training goals and career transition. Her mentors include: Dr. Anita Kinney (health disparities, cancer prevention),
Dr. Shawna Hudson (implementation science, practice-based research), Dr. Benjamin Crabtree (mixed methods,
organizational assessment), and Dr. Jeanne Ferrante (practice-based research network recruitment, primary
care). The training period will allow the candidate to gain applied learning and formal training in cancer
prevention, implementation science and practice-based research. In the future, the proposed model can be
utilized to investigate the development of targeted cancer prevention strategies in additional chronically ill priority
populations. The research program aligns with the candidate’s long-term goal of developing an independent
research program focused on implementing targeted cancer prevention strategies for underserved patients with
comorbidities in safety-net settings."
10901603,"Project Summary
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential in cellular processes and human diseases. It is estimated that
80% of proteins rely on PPIs to perform their primary functions. Thus, modulating PPIs should be a powerful way
to interfere with pathological pathways and treat human diseases. However, PPIs are challenging targets for
small-molecule drugs due to the lack of druggable pockets to achieve sufficient drug affinity. Recent advances
in covalent inhibition of kinases have shown that targeting hyperreactive cysteines with small electrophilic
molecules can achieve increased potency, prolonged target engagement, and improved selectivity. We
hypothesize that electrophilic molecules forming covalent bonds with hyperreactive cysteines on PPI interfaces
may represent a new avenue for developing PPI-modulating drugs.
 Building on the recent development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for protein structure modeling
and analysis, the ongoing efforts to predict and model 3D structures of human PPIs in my sponsor’s lab, and my
co-sponsor’s expertise in developing covalent inhibitors, this project aims to predict and validate druggable
hyperreactive cysteines located within PPI interfaces.
 Using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a large dataset of reactive cysteines to integrate the
physiochemical environment around a cysteine in the 3D space, I will develop a predictor for cysteine reactivity.
I will identify reactive cysteines on human PPI interfaces by integrating experimental results and predictions on
PPI structures and cysteine reactivity. Based on my preliminary data, I expect to find thousands of PPI interfaces
with hyperreactive cysteines. Next, I will analyze the protein surface pockets around hyperreactive cysteines on
PPI interfaces using both established tools to evaluate pocket druggability and new AI methods to characterize
the geometric and chemical fingerprints of a pocket. Comparing the fingerprint of a potential drug pocket against
the surface pockets of the entire human proteome will allow me to identify pockets with unique features for
specific drug targeting. Results from these analyses will be incorporated into a comprehensive online database
of reactive cysteines on PPI interfaces and their druggability. Combining the above analyses with other structural
(such as interface size and other components in a complex) and functional considerations, I will choose several
dozen target PPIs to perform virtual screens using multiple established methods to identify covalent drug
candidates. Several promising drug candidates supported by multiple methods will be tested experimentally
through pull-down assays. Experimentally tested candidates will be further studied by affinity chromatography
and mass spectrometry to evaluate the off-target binding partners.
 Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into the identification and targeting of hyperreactive
cysteines within PPI interfaces, offering new opportunities for the development of covalent inhibitors to modulate
PPIs and treat various diseases and providing valuable resources for further research in the field."
10901610,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanotransduction is the ability of a cell to detect and respond to mechanical stimuli. This tightly regulated
process allows cells to adapt to environmental and structural changes. The nucleus is a central regulator of
mechanotransduction. As the nucleus detects a change of force, it responds by altering cell behavior and
function. While extensive research in non-neuronal cell types has investigated mechanotransduction in the
context of cell proliferation, metastasis, and differentiation within physiological and pathological conditions, few
studies have investigated the role of mechanotransduction in neurons. The brain is exposed to changes in
mechanical force from the vasculature, direct force impacts with the skull, and neurodegeneration. Tauopathies,
including Alzheimer’s disease, are neurodegenerative disorders that involve the progressive deposition of tau
protein in the brain. Mechanistically, pathogenic forms of tau have been found to drive neurodegeneration by
inducing over-stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, which causes destabilization of the lamin nucleoskeleton.
Nucleoskeletal destabilization drives heterochromatin decondensation, aberrant gene expression, and ultimately
neuronal death. I recently reported that neurons harboring pathological tau have a decrease in nuclear tension
and a disruption in the Linker of Nucleoskeleton to Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, an established nuclear
mechanosensor. My preliminary studies indicate that neurons harboring pathological tau have a significant
increase of emerin, a mechanosensitive protein that resides on the inner nuclear membrane and binds to A-type
lamins. Studies in non-neuronal cells suggest that mechanical stimulation causes emerin to become
phosphorylated and translocate to the cytoplasm, where it regulates actin dynamics. As neurons predominantly
express B-type lamins, it is currently unknown if and how emerin regulates nuclear mechanotransduction in
neurons. The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand mechanisms underlying nuclear
mechanotransduction in neurons in physiological and pathological conditions. I will test the hypotheses that
emerin is mechanosensitive in neurons and interacts directly with B-type lamins, and that pathogenic forms of
tau disrupt nuclear mechanotransduction. Understanding how neurons detect and respond to mechanical forces
will be instrumental to our understanding of basic neurobiology and disease."
10901612,"SUMMARY
Gut microbes generate a wealth of bioactive small molecules that are absorbed by the body and impact a
plethora of physiological processes. Indeed, it is estimated that about 10% of all metabolites in circulation are
derived from gut microbes. Despite the clear significance of gut microbe generated metabolites towards health,
relatively little is known about how these metabolites mechanistically influence aspects of host biology. This is
important because quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the microbiota, and microbiota generated
metabolites have been associated with metabolic conditions such as adult-onset diabetes, metabolic syndrome,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and obesity. With the goal of developing novel live biotherapeutics (beneficial
microbes) to treat these metabolic conditions, our research group published that supplementation of mice fed a
high fat and high sugar diet (western-style diet) with a novel beneficial microbe, namely Lactococcus lactis subsp.
cremoris (LLC) lowers total cholesterol, decreases hepatic adiposity, and lowers the levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in the liver. The goal of my graduate school studies, and the focus of this F30 proposal is to characterize
the metabolome of western-style diet fed and LLC supplemented mice in an attempt to identify LLC-generated
small molecules that confer its beneficial effects on the host. To this end, employing mass spectrometry-based
metabolomics for analysis of small molecules, I generated preliminary data that demonstrate salient differences
in the metabolite composition of western style diet fed mice supplemented with LLC compared to saline control.
Computational analysis of the metabolomics dataset for pathway enrichment associated with the metabolomic
profile using Mummichog v2.0 software revealed that LLC supplemented mice had metabolomic features
associated with increased lipid and fatty acid metabolism, with Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity that functions
in xenobiotic elimination in the liver, and with the activation of the Nrf2 cytoprotective signaling pathway. Based
on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that metabolites generated by LLC act as regulatory integrators of host
metabolism, especially in the context of a western style diet. Furthermore, I hypothesize that metabolites
generated by LLC confer cytoprotective influences in the liver of mice by enhancing CYP450 activity, and by
activating cytoprotective Nrf2 signaling pathway. I will test the hypothesis by 1) identifying LLC-induced shifts in
the metabolome of mice fed a western style diet in the gut, liver, and hepatic portal vein of gnotobiotic and
specific pathogen free mice and by 2) identifying the therapeutic target of LLC-mediated cytoprotection in the
liver using clinically relevant mouse hepatic injury models. Our findings may uncover novel bacterial-generated
bioactive metabolites that may be used as the next-generation therapies for disease of the liver. Through this
research plan, I will be trained in gnotobiotic mouse husbandry, metabolomics analysis, mouse liver injury
models, and histological analysis of liver tissue, all of which will form a basis to my career goal of becoming a
gastroenterologist and physician scientist focusing on diseases of the liver."

The goal of this proposal is to compare and contrasts the effects of different medications for opioid use disorder
(MOUD) on driving abnormal immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS) in people living with HIV
(PLWH) through the lens of epigenetic programming. Prior published research suggests that opioids and opioid
receptor agonists lead to a proinflammatory state in the CNS through changes to myeloid cells. Conversely, pre-
clinical studies suggest potential beneficial anti-neuroinflammatory effects of opioid antagonists. Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) studies are a window into the CNS of PLWH, revealing a role for abnormal myeloid cell activation
and persistent viral transcription in the CNS, despite apparent systemic viral suppression with ART. Our own
single cell genomic studies of fresh CSF cells from PLWH have shown that a rare microglia-like myeloid cell
population resides in the CSF in PLWH; that these cells are linked to HIV disease status; and are defined by a
distinct epigenetic state consisting of alterations in chromatin accessibility of myeloid/microglia-like cell type
specific proinflammatory genes. However, despite myeloid cells being recognized as crucial cellular mediators
of CNS abnormalities in PLWH, the impact of different MOUD therapies on the epigenetic landscapes of CNS
myeloid and other immune cells in PLWH remain uncharted. Our central hypothesis is that opioid antagonist
MOUD (XR-naltrexone) suppresses myeloid cell activation by exerting anti-inflammatory epigenetic effects in
CNS myeloid cells of PWH, thereby improving cognitive function; while, in contrast, opioid receptor full/partial
agonists (methadone, buprenorphine) induce a pro-inflammatory epigenetic landscape increasing myeloid cell
activation, and impairing cognitive function. This hypothesis will be tested in our established InSTRIDE Research
MOUD program at Yale that includes a mobile health clinic to perform lumbar puncture and cognitive testing “on
the road” meeting research participants in their own communities. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team
with expertise in Neuro-HIV, addiction medicine including treatment of OUD, single cell epigenetics, HIV
neuropsychology, and data science. In PLWH, we will longitudinally assess CSF biomarkers of
neuroinflammation, neuronal injury, and myeloid cell activation over the course of either opioid antagonist or
agonist MOUD treatment. Using single cell simultaneous profiling of epigenetic chromatin accessibility and gene
expression from the same CSF cells, we will then ask whether there is damage to the epigenomes of CSF
myeloid cells sustained during specific MOUD treatments that persists over time as epigenetic “scars”. Lastly,
we will evaluate the effect of the different MOUD regimens on post-treatment cognitive trajectories and
associations with post-MOUD CSF biomarker and single cell biological measures. The proposed work will
significantly advance our understanding of how specific MOUD treatments interact at a molecular and cellular
level in the CNS, potentially leading to improved treatments and outcomes for PLWH with opioid use disorder."

Lead (Pb) is a naturally occurring metal in the environment, however; biomonitoring and epidemiologic studies
have demonstrated that there is no safe level of Pb in humans. Despite this fact, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) identifies race as a known risk factor for higher exposure to Pb, with African Americans
(AAs) recognized as an overexposed group. Structural racism impacts many of the demographic characteristics
commonly associated with higher Pb exposure. Data from the Continuous National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES; 1999–2016) demonstrates higher Pb levels among individuals living in low-
income housing and without health insurance. The CDC also identifies pregnant women as a population at higher
risk for Pb exposure, as bioaccumulated Pb released from bone during pregnancy can cause an acute increase
in blood Pb concentration. Further, Pb exposure during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk
for adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
AAs experience the highest rates of preterm birth, with rates nearly 50% higher than their white counterparts,
and socioeconomic status does not fully account for these disparities. We recognize that experiences of racism
uniquely impact AA women, who concurrently represent groups that are targeted by historic and current
discrimination on the basis of both race and gender. However, research has yet to elucidate determinants of
increased Pb exposure among AA women and, specifically, in the context of pregnancy. My study will leverage
the Atlanta African American Maternal Child Cohort, an ongoing, prospective birth cohort of self-identified AA
pregnant women in Atlanta. In seeking to understand root-causes of racial health disparities in maternal health,
I will take advantage of the rich extant survey data and biologic measurements of Pb. In Aim 1, I will test the
hypothesis that levels of maternal Pb are higher among those who are of lower socioeconomic status, who live
in older homes, and who live in neighborhoods that are more racially and economically segregated. In Aim 2, I
will examine associations between exposure to Pb and preterm birth and assess whether this relationship is
stronger among those who report experiencing greater frequency of gendered racial discrimination. In Aim 3, I
will return contextualized Pb exposure data back to participants through reporting back of research results
(RBRR). Participants will not only learn about the impact of Pb exposure on adverse maternal health outcomes,
including preterm birth, but will receive this information through focus groups designed in partnership with the
community and facilitated by scientific researchers. Together, these aims will fill a critical knowledge gap in
understanding racial disparities in Pb exposure and identifying risk factors for overexposed groups. The
proposed project represents an innovative and accessible approach to research in perinatal health disparities:
exploring risk identification and intervention through community-academic partnerships."
10906012,"Project Summary
The post-translational modification of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) by methyl groups is an evolutionarily conserved
epigenetic mark that is generally associated with transcription activation in all eukaryotic cells. Early studies of
the yeast model system, S. cerevisiae, have not only identified the prototype of the SET1/MLL family of
methyltransferases as the enzyme responsible for H3K4 mono-, di-, and trimethylation, but also revealed a yeast
Set1-centric protein complex, known as COMPASS, that stabilizes and confers catalytic activity to the enzyme.
The SET1/MLL family of H3K4 methyltransferases has undergone a significant expansion in animals. Mammals
have evolved a total of six distinct and functionally non-redundant family members, each of which also functions
within a COMPASS or COMPASS-like complex. Remarkably, recent studies have shown that mutations or
dysregulation of the six human SET1/MLL methyltransferases are associated with a spectrum of mental
illnesses, including schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual disability disorders. Malfunctions of some of these
family members are further linked to other human diseases such as mixed lineage leukemia and congenital heart
disease. Despite their important biological roles and their high relevance to human health, a molecular and
mechanistic understanding of the SET1/MLL H3K4 methyltransferases is largely lacking due to the large sizes
of most SET1/MLL enzymes and the complexity associated with their assemblies and regulation. To date, most
structural and biochemical studies have been focused on single domains and small fragments of the yeast and
human SET1/MLL enzymes and COMPASS subunits. Many questions, such as how the SET1/MLL enzymes
bind and become regulated by four common catalytic module subunits, namely RBBP5/Swd1, WDR5/Swd3,
ASH2L/Bre2, and DPY30/Sdc1 (human/yeast ortholog), how the resulting complexes recognize H3K4 in the
context of nucleosome and differentially catalyze mono- vs. multi-H3K4 methylation, and how the activities of
COMPASS and COMPASS-like complexes are regulated by upstream signals such as H2B mono-ubiquitination
remain unclear. Using a combination of structural, chemical and biochemical approaches, as well as yeast cell-
based functional assays, we propose to dissect the structure and function relationship of the yeast Set1
COMPASS complex as a model system and extend this work to the clinically relevant human SET1/MLL
complexes. Our proposed studies hold the promise to establish the missing framework for understanding the
structural basis of the SET1/MLL H3K4 methyltransferase function and regulation in eukaryotic biology and
unmasking the molecular mechanisms of various human diseases associated with their malfunction."
10906125,"Heart transplantation is considered gold standard therapy for end-stage heart failure. However, demand
currently far outstrips supply due to multiple challenges. An important limitation is the occurrence of primary
graft dysfunction (PDG) in 10-20% of patients and contributes greatly to adverse clinical outcomes and
resource utilization. PGD occurs when donor heart function and output is inadequate end organ perfusion. Risk
for significant PDG increases when donor heart preservation time is greater than 4 hours. Valproic acid (VPA),
a histone deacetylase inhibitor, is a “Food and Drug Administration (FDA)” approved drug traditionally used for
the treatment of epilepsy. We now convincingly demonstrate that addition of VPA can dramatically improve
donor heart function and improve ischemic tolerance compared to preservation using Histidine-Tryptophan-
Ketoglutarate (HTK) preservation solution alone. This was seen in murine heart reperfusion models in the
setting of ex-vivo perfusion and transplantation. Furthermore, we show evidence that VPA achieves this by
upregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme Irg1 which produces the anti-inflammatory metabolite “itaconate”.
Indeed, our cardiac reperfusion model confirms the impressive upregulation of Irg1 above baseline driven by
VPA treatment, and this was accompanied by robust activation of antioxidant pathway mechanisms through
Nrf2 transcription factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that VPA treatment increased Irg1 enhancer
activity as indicated by increased occupancy by acetylated H3K27 histone. Importantly, VPA treatment of
stored human donor hearts also upregulated Irg1 expression and decreased the expression of inflammatory
mediators suggesting translational relevance for large animal and human clinical settings. For this proposal, we
plan to: (1) Identify the cell type through which Irg1 acts and we hypothesize that it is most likely through
cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cells (EC). The is achieved using transgenic mice with conditional
deficiency of Irg1 in these cell types using inducible Cre-Lox technology. We will also examine overexpression
models using adeno-associated virus mediated expression Irg1 mRNA. (2) Using cell culture, we will determine
whether Irg1/itaconate mediated alkylation modifications on Nrf2 pathway antioxidant proteins impacts their
function. We will treat cells with itaconate and then identify as well as mutate relevant alkylation modifications
sites at the cysteine residue of antioxidant proteins to determine their importance. (3) We will determine the
efficacy of VPA for improving donor heart function and ischemic tolerance in pigs and humans. We will also
corroborate mechanisms of VPA mediated cardioprotection identified in murine models. This project has critical
clinical implications such as decreasing the PGD incidence, allow transport of donor hearts over longer
distances to facilitate organ allocation, and improve clinical transplantation outcomes. Reduction in
perioperative donor heart injury by harnessing the cardioprotective effect of VPA and Irg1/itaconate is novel
and potentially relevant for preservation of other organs such as the livers and kidneys."

Fluorescent biosensor techniques in cell biology now allow for the real-time interrogation of molecular processes
as they occur inside living cells at spatial and temporal resolutions of microns and seconds, respectively. I
have a prior and continued focus on the development of novel Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-
based biosensor technologies that utilize monomeric fluorescent proteins for exceptional sensitivity and probe
reversibility. In addition, a single-chain construction is used to facilitate quantitative analysis. I recently pioneered
the near-infrared (NIR)-FRET biosensor modality, which included the first simultaneous, orthogonal visualization
of cyan-yellow fluorescent protein-based FRET and NIR-FRET biosensors in single living cells. The resulting
data were the first true multiplex analysis of two important molecular switches in living cells, the Rac1 and RhoA
GTPases. This analysis revealed the direct coordination of these GTPases during cell migration in real-time.
Herein, I propose to study the coordination of Rho GTPases associated with important signaling pathways
by designing new biosensors for specific signaling nodes and utilizing the direct multiplex FRET imaging
approach. Specifically, I will first target the local-level coordination of Rho GTPase signaling in fibroblast cells
during migration, chemotaxis, and directional guidance. The coordination of RhoA versus Rac1 GTPases in
fibroblasts will be investigated by determining the role of a downstream target protein, the formin mDia1, which
is hypothesized to coordinate RhoA and Rac1 during cell motility. The direct multiplex imaging approach will be
used to evaluate pairwise biosensor signals. In addition, the RhoA and Rac1 pathways will be perturbed with
optogenetic tools to determine the GTPase coordination that is important for controlling cellular morphodynamics.
Next, these approaches will be applied to two systems that have important implications for human health and
disease. First, macrophage motility and directional guidance, which requires the coordination of Rho GTPases
during the chemotactic response to inflammatory chemokines, will be studied. Then, the multiplex imaging and
perturbation approaches will be applied to breast cancer invasion and migration, which are critical to controlling
tumor metastasis. Collectively, the coordination between Rho GTPases and the associated molecular signaling
that governs cell motility will be identified through the development of new biosensors that enable direct multiplex
probing of signaling networks."
10906129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 When a patient is readmitted to a different hospital than the one they were previously
discharged from, fragmentation of care occurs. Such fragmented readmissions are associated
with a number of negative patient outcomes, including a nearly two-fold increased risk for
mortality. Preliminary analyses by Dr. Sara Turbow, the PI for this grant, have shown that a
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) was an independent predictor
of interhospital care fragmentation. In Aim 1, she will use Medicare data to estimate the
association between inpatient fragmentation of care and either a) emergency department arrival
via an ambulance or b) coming from a post-acute care facility. We hypothesize that ambulance
use and post-acute care facility residence will contribute to the higher prevalence of interhospital
care fragmentation in older adults with ADRD. In Aim 2, Dr. Turbow will examine the association
between information sharing across hospitals and patient outcomes in older adults with ADRD
by comparing fragmented readmissions between hospitals that share data via a health
information exchange versus those that do not. In Aim 3, she will survey health professionals
and interview health system leaders to ascertain critical barriers and facilitators to information
sharing between healthcare settings. This proposal directly addresses the mission of the
National Institute on Aging and of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease, specifically
to optimize care quality and efficiency for older adults with ADRD, and the applications of this
research have implications for dementia care and health disparities research in ADRD.
 The proposed aims will be completed under the superlative mentorship of Dr.
Mohammed K. Ali (expertise in health services research and implementation science), Dr.
Camille Vaughan (expertise in aging/geriatrics research), Dr. Molly Perkins (expert in qualitative
methods), Dr. Kimberly Rask (expert in health services research/health economics), and Dr.
Steven Culler (Medicare data expert), as well as faculty at Emory’s Goizueta Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center. Emory University has ample resources to allow Dr. Turbow to carry
out her research aims. Her training plan is structured to include formal didactic training at Emory
and online via the UCSF Implementation Science Certification Program. The research aims and
training plan will position Dr. Turbow to become an independently funded health services and
aging researcher."
10906130,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The gastrointestinal tract is composed of a single layer of epithelial cells that is in equipoise with immune cells
and a vast number of microorganisms. Inappropriate responses to these microorganisms, either through
genetic predisposition, altered immune or epithelial responses, or yet to be defined environmental influences,
are postulated to lead to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The immune signals that recognize and respond
to bacterial and viral components of the microbiome remain incompletely understood. Interferons (IFNs) play a
major role in antiviral immune defense in the intestinal epithelium, and are also important in regulating
proliferation, differentiation, survival and effector functions of immune and non-immune cells. There are three
classes of IFNs: type I IFNs (IFNα, β, and others), type II IFN (IFNγ) and type III IFNs, or IFNλs. To date, most
studies investigating the use of IFNs on IBD have focused on type I IFNs and were not found to be effective.
Dr. Ivan Zanoni recently reported that IFNλ decreases oxidative stress and intestinal damage in a murine
model of colitis and that exogenous IFNλ can suppress intestinal inflammation. Importantly, we identified two
unrelated patients with infantile-onset IBD with rare and functionally deleterious mutations in IFNλ2 and IFNλ3.
Of note, each patient's disease improved significantly with age. We have preliminary data that IFNλ2 and
IFNλ3 may be more important in the first months of life than FNλ1, and data illustrating more severe murine
colitis in Ifnλ3-/- mice as compared to wild type mice. Taken together, we hypothesize that INFλs are
essential modulators of mucosal homeostasis, prevent development of IBD, and hold therapeutic
potential. Current therapeutics available for the management of IBD fail to treat a large number of patients.
This work will provide a better understanding of the role of IFNλ in mucosal homeostasis, and may provide the
groundwork to implement novel strategies to treat IBD by manipulating IFNλ signaling. Unraveling the role of
IFNλ in maintaining mucosal homeostasis will be achieved through the following aims: (1) Establishing the
developmental expression of IFNλs, related cytokines and receptors in humans at different ages using bulk
and single cell RNA sequencing technologies (2) Determining the role of IFNλ signaling in predisposition to
development of colitis in vivo using various murine models of colitis; (3) Characterizing the functional
consequences of patient-encoded IFNλ variants in vitro using T84 cells as well as human control and patient-
derived intestinal organoids. This award will enable Dr. Ouahed to acquire necessary structured training to
become proficient in critical skills: RNAseq analysis, murine models of colitis and immune analyses, and
generation/manipulation of intestinal organoids and epithelial analyses, complimented with didactic
coursework, assisting her path to independence as a successful physician-scientist."

p27 is a CDK inhibitor that limits normal cell proliferation. We showed p27 C-terminal phosphorylation at T157
and T198 by AKT increases in mid G1 and p27pT157pT198 (p27pTpT) facilitates interaction with novel protein
partners. We recently showed C-terminal p27pTpT phosphorylation promotes its association with cJun.
Genomic profiling showed p27 is co-recruited with cJun to over half of cJun chromatin binding sites to either
activate or repress target genes. p27/cJun activated targets include TGFB2, and are associated with EMT, and
programs that upregulate stem cells and alter cell adhesion and migration. Profiles of target genes repressed
by p27/cJun suggest that p27pTpT opposes tissue differentiation. A subset of p27/cJun target genes bind to a
STAT3 consensus motif and p27, cJun and STAT3 all appear to bind and co-regulate cMYC. Notably,
p27pTpT is a driver of stem cell potency: cellular p27pTpT upregulates spheres, SOX2, NANOG and cMYC
and tumor initiating cells in vivo. Our TG-p27CK-DD mice transgenic for a p27 phosphomimetic mutant that
fails to bind cyclin/CDKs, show multi-organ overgrowth and increased size, suggesting that p27CK-DD
abrogates WTp27 actions to restrain normal stem and progenitor expansion. This grant investigates the role of
p27 as a transcriptional regulator in normal cells and development. Our data support the hypothesis that
WTp27 plays important transcriptional roles during differentiation, to limit stem and progenitor cell expansion in
various tissues. In contrast, upon C-terminal phosphorylation, p27 interacts with cJun, STAT3 and other factors
to expand or maintain tissue stem or progenitor cells and oppose differentiation. We will compare p27WT,
p27CDK and p27CK-DD MEFS in AIM1 to evaluate how p27 interacts with cJun and STAT3 on chromatin to
govern gene expression across the cell cycle from G0, to mid-G1 and the G1/S phase transition. We will
investigate if increased C-terminal p27 phosphorylation alters co-regulator and target gene selection and
abrogates the co-repressive functions of p27 in quiescent cells. In AIM2, we will separate actively transcribed
euchromatin from transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin and carry out ChIP-seq and ChIP-Mass Spec to
identify the chromatin associated p27 interactome involved in transactivator versus repressor complexes. AIM3
will study mouse development, tissue differentiation, and adult stem and progenitor populations in TG-p27CK-
DD and TG-p27CK- mice. We will test if p27CK-DD confers stronger reprogramming potential on MEFs and
disrupts differentiation of iPSC into embryoid bodies. This work will elucidate a novel function of p27 as a
phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional regulator with implications for tissue stem cell control and potential
applications in regenerative medicine. Controlled modulation of p27, or of p27 target genes identified herein,
might offer potential to expand or regenerate hematologic and other tissues. Understanding how p27/cJun
transcriptional programs regulate tissue development might identify new therapeutic targets to be exploited for
tissue regeneration and illuminate other human diseases at the interface of differentiation and growth control."
10902545,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a critical public health problem.
Of particular concern are the high rates of MDD during adolescence, which have continued to increase in recent
years. Importantly, the emergence of depression during adolescence is associated with future major depressive
episodes in adulthood and risk for suicide. Theorists have proposed that the spike in rates of depression
observed during adolescence may be due, at least in part, to neurobiological and psychosocial changes that
occur during this period, including changes in reward processing. Importantly, aberrant neural reward processing
in adolescents is associated with current depressive symptoms and predicts the onset of future depressive
episodes. However, most of this research has focused on adolescents’ neural responses to monetary reward,
despite research showing that social rewards are especially salient for this age group. Further, a large majority
of this research is confined to laboratory settings and relatively little is known about how laboratory-based
measures of reward processing translate to real-world experiences of pleasure and affect. This proposed study
aims to address the limitations of extant research by examining event related potential (ERP) indices of social
and monetary reward processing in adolescents at heightened risk of developing MDD (maternal history of
MDD). After completing the laboratory-based reward tasks, adolescents will complete 7 days of ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) surveys to assess real-world levels of pleasure and affect in their daily lives.
Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether laboratory-based measures of reward outcome processing predict real-
world levels of consummatory pleasure and affect among adolescents at risk for MDD. Specific Aim 2 is to
evaluate whether monetary or social reward processing is a stronger predictor of real-world reports of pleasure
and daily affect. In addressing these aims, I also seek to address another limitation of existing research.
Specifically, the overwhelming majority of ERP reward processing research focuses on the reward positivity
(RewP), which only indexes one subcomponent of reward outcome processing even though other substages
can be reliably assessed with ERPs (e.g., feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP). Therefore, although primary
analyses will focus on the RewP to be consistent with prior research, exploratory analyses will examine whether
the predictive validity of the feedback-P3 and feedback-LPP. These research aims are complemented by a series
of training goals designed to facilitate the applicant’s development into an independent researcher. These
training goals are to (i) gain expertise in collecting and processing EEG/ERP data using reward paradigms, (ii)
develop specialized skills in designing, collecting, and processing reward-relevant EMA data in adolescents, and
(iii) strengthening the applicant’s knowledge of intensive longitudinal data analysis. This project has the potential
to make significant contributions to the literature on biomarkers of depression risk and will provide the training
necessary for the applicant to become an independent researcher focused on risk for depression in adolescents."

This Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral Fellowship will provide the
trainee, an Epidemiology PhD student at UCSF, with mentored training essential achieving the applicant’s
career goal of becoming a perinatal epidemiologist with expertise in health policy and health services research.
Her training goals are to gain expertise in perinatal epidemiology and outcomes research, advanced quasi-
experimental approaches for health policy research, and methods to measure effects on health disparities.
To improve maternal and newborn outcomes, several US states have implemented numerous state-level
initiatives and policies in recent decades. One set of initiatives were focused on reducing rates of early-term
elective deliveries (EEDs) – non-medically indicated labor inductions and c-sections occurring before 39 weeks
gestational age. EEDs are associated with significant increases in the risk of several newborn complications
and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Studies thus far have found mixed results on the effects of
initiatives on newborn outcomes, and frequently exclude endpoints for maternal outcomes and disparities in
outcomes. Studies thus far are also hindered by data sources that misclassify EEDs and methodologic
limitations that do not allow for generalizability or comparison between EED initiative types.
The goal of the proposed research is to leverage a robust dataset to rigorously evaluate the effects of EED
initiatives on maternal and newborn outcomes. Building on the applicant’s previous perinatal outcomes
research and experience with the proposed dataset, this study will investigate and compare the effects of
different state-level EED initiatives on healthcare utilization and perinatal (maternal and newborn) outcomes
(Aim 1) and effects of these EED initiatives on disparities in outcomes, including by maternal race and ethnicity
(Aim 2). Evidence and methodologic advancements from this study will inform further implementation and
evaluation of state-level perinatal care initiatives. The proposed research is an ideal opportunity for the
applicant to receive mentored training on recent innovations in quasi-experimental designs that will help
overcome limitations of previous studies. The proposed training plan includes mentorship from experts and
leaders in the in fields of perinatal epidemiology and outcomes research, comparative effectiveness studies,
health services and policy research, social and structural determinants of perinatal outcomes, and clinical care.
Research and training in this fellowship proposal are feasible and appropriate for the applicant’s current
expertise and future goals. This fellowship will provide the applicant with the content knowledge, methodologic
skills, and hands-on mentored experience to lay the foundation for an independent research career focused on
holistically evaluating the effects of health services and policy changes on maternal and newborn outcomes.
This training is critical to the applicant’s long-term goal, and NICHD priorities, to conduct research that helps to
improve pregnancy outcomes and ensure lifelong wellness for mothers and their infants."

The most debilitating forms of nervous system injury are those affecting the central nervous system (CNS).
Neuronal circuits damaged by CNS injury exhibit very limited regeneration capacity, leading to enduring
neurological deficits. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the projection neurons of the retina, transmit visual
information via the optic nerve tracts to the brain. In rodent models, optic nerve crush (ONC) induces RGC death,
and surviving RGCs fail to extend axons beyond the site of injury. An established method to promote RGC repair
following ONC is lens injury (LI). Recent research has revealed that a conditioning lens injury (cLI), applied
several days before ONC, results in significantly enhanced RGC protection and regeneration compared to LI
applied concurrently with ONC. However, the cellular and molecular basis underlying cLI-induced RGC repair
remains elusive and requires further investigation. In my preliminary studies, I employed single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) on ocular tissues (retina, lens, and vitreous) under regenerative (cLI) and non-
regenerative (sham-operated) conditions, which led to the identification of a-Crystallins (encoded by Cryaa and
Cryab) as top candidates that are remarkedly upregulated in lens fibroblasts, lens epithelial cells, astrocytes,
and Müller glia. Immunofluorescence labeling of the retina demonstrated that a-Crystallins are enriched in the
optic nerve fiber layer following cLI. Furthermore, the application of recombinant a-Crystallins to primary RGCs
stimulated axon outgrowth in vitro. Importantly, we found post-translational modifications on a-Crystallins that
significantly enhance neurite outgrowth of RGCs. In Aim 1, I will conduct a-Crystallin loss-of-function studies
(Cryaa-/- and Cryab-/- mice) and gain-of-function studies with recombinant and AAV2-transduced wild type and
constitutively active a-Crystallins to test the hypothesis that a-Crystallins are necessary and sufficient for cLI-
induced RGC protection and axon regeneration. In Aim 2, I will focus on RGC intrinsic mechanisms of cLI-
induced axon regeneration. To this end, I have established methods for isolating RGC nuclei from mice subjected
to cLI and sham operation. These RGC nuclei will be used for multi-omics analyses (snRNA-seq and snATAC-
seq) to assess changes in chromatin accessibility and to identify core cLI-induced gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) associated with RGC protection and axon regeneration. By utilizing in silico approaches, I will identify
candidate signaling pathways and GRNS that promote axon outgrowth of injured RGCs. As an intermediary step,
I will evaluate the growth potential of candidate genes and signaling pathways in primary RGC cultures. The
most promising candidates from these in vitro investigations will then undergo testing for their ability to promote
RGC regeneration in vivo. The proposed studies aim to elucidate both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms
underlying the pro-regenerative effects of cLI on RGCs. The identification of such signaling pathways may have
broad implications for CNS neuron protection and axon regeneration."

Spinal cord injuries (SCI) initiate a cascade of complex physiological and molecular mechanisms at and around
the site of injury. Beyond the initial damage, secondary and chronic neuropathological effects triggered by
neuroinflammation and molecular changes at the injury site can severely impact spinal cord regeneration. Some
of the mechanisms of interest include glutamate excitotoxicity, demyelination, glial scar formation, toxic free
radical accumulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. These secondary and chronic pathological effects
can severely impede spinal cord regeneration through inhibition of axonal regrowth and progressive cell death
at the injury site. Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) provides an array of contrasts sensitive to changes that occur
in SCI. Quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging characterizes myelin concentration changes through
measurements of immobile macromolecular content. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides complementary
structural information by evaluating spinal cord axonal tract integrity post-injury. Resting-state functional MRI
(rsfMRI) reports the integrity of gray matter resting state functional networks that are disrupted post-injury.
Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) imaging
generates Z-spectra that reflect changes in the concentrations and/or exchange rates of specific metabolites and
macromolecules, providing high resolution molecular information from the SCI region. In addition, PET imaging
using radiotracers that bind specifically to the translocator protein (TSPO) will provide three-dimensional spatial
maps of neuroinflammatory activity in the injured spine and can validate the interpretation of mpMRI measures.
We hypothesize that using mpMRI, we can detect and quantify relevant structural, functional, and
molecular changes in the spinal cord, longitudinally over time, in a rat injury model, and that imaging
metrics can be used as biomarkers of the effects of therapeutic interventions. These biomarkers will
correlate with animal functional recovery and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of SCI treatments. We
will evaluate the validity of these hypotheses in the proposed study. First, we will optimize and implement CEST
and NOE MR sequence protocols for imaging SCI rats. Next, we will combine mpMRI imaging modalities to
measure the sensitivity of mpMRI for quantifying SCI severity and recovery and for evaluating the efficacy of SCI
treatments, in a treatment study using the neuroprotective drug Riluzole. Finally, we will confirm the structural,
molecular, and behavioral basis of the mpMRI imaging metrics through TSPO PET imaging of
neuroinflammation, motor and somatosensory behavior testing, and histological analysis. The proposed studies
are significant because they will develop, validate, and implement innovative mpMRI methods that can evaluate
and track various neuropathological changes that accompany recovery after SCIs in a clinically relevant animal
model. These methods may then be used to assess novel SCI interventions and treatments, and to provide
comprehensive information on structural, functional, and molecular changes in SCIs over time."

The long-term objective of this project is to understand how the unique structure of the mammalian cone
photoreceptor synapse determines its function in vision. The outer segments of cones, which are specialized
for daylight vision, convert absorbed photons into a voltage signal. In an essential step for visual perception,
the voltage signal spreads to the photoreceptor synaptic terminal where it gates Ca2+ channels that control
the release of the transmitter glutamate onto postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells. The cone synapse is
a site at which parallel processing begins in the visual system. A single cone contacts ~14 bipolar cell types,
which in turn carry signals to over 40 different types of retinal output neurons, the ganglion cells, in the inner
retina. The mammalian cone terminal has a complex and stereotyped spatial organization that incorporates
two unique structures, the invaginating and basal junctions. Transmitter is released from sites atop ~twenty
200-400 nm long membrane invaginations that open onto a ~3 µm diameter basal surface. “On” bipolar cells,
cells that respond at light onset, and horizontal cells contact cones within invaginations, whereas “Off” bipolar
cells, which respond at light offset, contact at the base, although there are minor exceptions to these rules.
The different processing functions of basal and invaginating contacts are poorly understood. By recording
from cones and postsynaptic bipolar cells in slices from the cone-dominant ground squirrel retina, the Aims
seek to understand how the cone visual signal is decomposed by the ~14 different types of bipolar cells at
basal and invaginating cone contacts. The first aim seeks to identify novel types of Off bipolar cells and to
characterize their visual functions. An understanding of parallel processing at the cone synapse relies on a
complete identification of the bipolar cell types and a characterization of their signaling properties. The second
Aim addresses the function of Off bipolar cell kainate receptor desensitization during visual stimuli. Receptor
desensitization during strong stimuli may mediate an adaptation that aids visual processing by matching the
full dynamic range of the cone synapse to the level of light intensity variation in the visual stream. A third Aim
addresses the visual function of basal synapses made by On bipolar cells; a type of connection that goes
against the general pattern described above. Experiments will determine whether basally contacting On
bipolar cells mediate a high threshold signaling pathway like that mediated by basally contacting Off bipolar
cells. Finally, a 4th aim proposes to use a new super-resolution microscopy technique, MINFLUX, to visualize
the proteins that link the cone to bipolar cells across the synaptic cleft at invaginating contacts. The completion
of this work will help us understand the mechanisms underlying the first step in parallel synaptic processing
in the visual system. In addition, these structural and functional studies may provide a scientific basis for cone
transplantation and successful reintegration."

The WHO recommends children under 5 get <1 hour of screen time per day, but few children meet this guideline.
This is partly attributable to the rapid growth of digital media technology (i.e., smartphones, tablets), which make
screen time more available across multiple contexts. Unfortunately, our understanding of the unique ways
children and families use digital media lags behind the rapid adoption of this technology. Therefore, we need
updated paradigms to understand how the content, timing, and context of digital media use impacts health.
There are three key limitations of existing digital media use research (1) an exclusive focus on use duration (2)
reliance on subjective measures and (3) a failure to account for the fact that digital media use effects people
differently depending on context (i.e., heterogeneity). The proposed project will overcome these limitations by
using passive mobile sensing to objectively measure digital media timing, content and duration. We will use
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and accelerometry to measure screen time context. This data will be
used to understand the unique ways screen habits unfold and ultimately influence children’s sleep, activity, and
social/emotional functioning.
The proposed study is a multiyear observational cohort of preschoolers (age 3-5) designed to uncover the
mechanisms underlying children’s digital media use. We will use passive mobile sensing, accelerometry and
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to collect intensive longitudinal data on children’s digital media use,
sleep, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and behavior problems. By collecting this intensive longitudinal data,
we can uncover micro-temporal dynamics - defined as: bi-directional effects that unfold over a short amount of
time (i.e., minutes, hours). Within these micro-temporal dynamics, we aim to identify systems of ‘Granger
causality’: systems where one behavior (i.e., digital media use) predicts future behavior (i.e., sleep). We expect
the Granger causal links between behaviors to vary in direction and magnitude between different children. We
will quantify this heterogeneity by identifying ‘digital phenotypes’: a child-specific web of links between multiple
health behaviors. Lastly, we aim to evaluate the longitudinal association between digital phenotypes and
cardiovascular health risk (obesity) and mental health risk (internalizing/externalizing disorder symptoms). The
utility of digital phenotypes lies in their ability to identify salient intervention targets for tailored just-in-time
interventions for multiple health behaviors. The first step in harnessing these linkages is to identify digital
phenotypes and examine their association with health outcomes over time. This project is innovative in the
simultaneous objective measurement of children’s digital media use, sleep, and activity. This work is significant
because findings will contribute to evidence upon which digital media guidelines are based and inform
personalized intervention strategies."

Funds are being requested for the purchase of an X-Band Continuous-Wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance
Spectrometer, which will enhance the interdisciplinary and multicampus biomedical research capability of the
University of Puerto Rico (UPR) College of Natural Sciences in Chemistry and also the UPR Medical Sciences
Campus Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Department of Physiology and Biophysics. Following
the devastating events of natural disasters and major economic budget cuts, researchers are aiming to expand the
resources available to rebuild and refocus their research efforts to multiply their productivity and maintain
excellence of graduate student development. A state-of-the-art EPR with the sensitivity to directly probe
paramagnetic species in biological materials and living organisms would dramatically expand our ability to
answer important questions that pertain to insight into the development and progression of diseases, drug design
and delivery, and studying structural changes that impact on biomolecular function and interactions. No other
technique can directly study such species with such a high degree of specificity. The absence of a paramagnetic
species does not limit the utility of an EPR to study the activity of biomedically relevant ions, molecules, and
materials as paramagnetic spin labels can be covalently linked to these agents. The instrumentation will be located
in the Proteomics and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance instrumentation space at the Molecular Science Research
Center of the UPR Río Piedras (RP) campus and will be utilized by a diverse team of researchers from UPR Rio
Piedras, Mayagüez, and Centro Medico campuses composed of Drs. Tinoco, Rodríguez-Berrios, Bayro, Palai,
Weiner, Griebenow, Montes, Colón, López-Garriga, Meléndez, Ayala-Peña, and Javadov. This team consists of
early career and senior level researchers. This instrumentation will be made available to other investigators in the
College of Natural Sciences of all institutions of the UPR system including its Medical Sciences campus. It will
also be implemented in the creation of new laboratory experiences for students of the UPR RP Protein

Diabetes mellitus (DM) impairs cerebral waste clearance (CWC) and induces cerebral vascular dysfunction,
resulting in cognitive decline. The relationships between CWC and diabetic status have not been fully
investigated. Cerebral endothelial cells constitutively release exosomes, which mediate intercellular
communication. We have demonstrated that administration of exosomes isolated from cerebral endothelial cells
(CE-Exo) of healthy adult rats to DM rats improves cognitive function, minimizes DM-induced cerebral vascular
dysfunction and increases CWC. Waste clearance from the brain parenchyma has an important role in regulating
neurological diseases7, 15-22. We have found increased impairment of the CWC with severity of DM which highly
correlated to cognitive deficits in DM rats (Fig 2&3)12. Currently, studies of efflux pathways of the soluble β-
amyloid (Aβ) within the brain parenchyma have conflicting results between intramural periarterial drainage along
the opposite direction of arterial flow and glymphatic perivenous efflux7, 23, 24. The glymphatic, vascular and
meningeal lymphatic (ML) pathways are all involved in CWC3, 7, 20-22. We have demonstrated that highly sensitive
MRI methods using the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) enhanced susceptibility weighted imaging (SPIO-
SWI) permit detection of cerebral microvessels and evaluation of CWC in glymphatic, vascular and ML pathways
(Fig 4-6)3, 25, 26. We also performed clinical translation of MRI measurements for CWC and found that the reduced
clearance rate from both the glymphatic and ML pathways was significantly associated with aging in patients14.
However, several critical issues related to clinical translation of CWC have not been resolved. Based on our
novel preliminary data, we posit that the SPIO-SWI technique permits analysis of the relative contributions of the
component vascular, glymphatic and ML systems to CWC, and thereby provides insight into their roles in
mediating cognitive dysfunction in the aged diabetic animal with and without therapeutic intervention. The
validation of MRI CWC measurements in current proposal could resolve the issues for clinical translation. To test
these hypotheses, we will first (Aim 1) investigate the effects of CE-Exo treatment on alterations of DM
associated CWC, vascular, molecular, and cognitive responses using MRI, fluorescent imaging, and immune-
histopathological analysis, and then (Aim 2) investigate the effects of CE-Exo treatment on the component
contributions of efflux pathways amount vascular, glymphatic and ML systems during waste clearance and their
relationships with vascular dysfunction and cognitive deficits in the aged DM animals with and without therapeutic
intervention."

For cancer immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), success depends on sustained
activation of intratumoral effector T cells recognizing tumor antigens. While many of the molecular changes
required for effector T cells to control cancer are known, many key epigenetic and transcriptional features
required for ICT-induced anti-tumor immunity are unknown. We recently found in preclinical sarcoma and
melanoma models that anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 ICT induces strong upregulation of the transcription factor,
Bhlhe40, in tumor antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, which are crucial for ICT-induced tumor rejection and
elimination. We further discovered conditional deletion of Bhlhe40 in CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs), CD4 T
cells, and CD8 T cells rendered mice treated with ICT incapable of rejecting ICT-sensitive tumors. Bhlhe40-
deficient CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited notable reductions in ICT-driven interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production
associated with defects in ICT-induced remodeling of intratumoral macrophages. Gene set enrichment analysis
indicated dysregulated metabolism within certain subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the absence of
Bhlhe40. However, these analyses were done in mice lacking Bhlhe40 in Tregs and conventional CD4 and CD8
T cells. Therefore, it is important to delineate how Bhlhe40 contributes to not only CD8 but also CD4 T cell (which
are now acknowledged to be critical for effective anti-tumor immunity) effector function.
 We will test the central hypothesis that Bhlhe40 is a pivotal transcriptional regulator of both CD4 and CD8 T
cell anti-tumor effector function during anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 ICT and tumor-specific cancer vaccine therapies.
In Aim 1, we will use conventional CD4 or CD8 T cell-specific Bhlhe40 knockout (KO) mice, newly generated
mouse melanoma models that express defined neoantigens, and mouse sarcoma lines to determine how cell-
specific deletion of Bhlhe40 impacts response to anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 ICT or tumor-specific neoantigen
cancer vaccine treatment. We will then analyze tumors from CD4 or CD8 T cell specific Bhlhe40 KO mice and
Bhlhe40 reporter mice by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), and CODEX
multiplex imaging, to assess how loss of Bhlhe40 in CD4 or CD8 T cells alters the immune tumor
microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanism by which Bhlhe40 regulates CD4 and CD8 T cell
function in the context of different immunotherapies by several approaches such as functional assays, single-
cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATACseq), chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIPseq), and luciferase reporter assays. In Aim 3, we will relate our findings in mice to humans by
first manipulating the expression of Bhlhe40 in human CD4 and CD8 T cells to determine how Bhlhe40 regulates
their effector function and then analyzing pre- and post-ICT treatment patient samples. These studies will
contribute to our understanding of how T cells recognizing tumor antigens maintain effector functions during ICT
and therapeutic neoantigen cancer vaccines and could identify Bhlhe40 as a novel therapeutic target."

The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated intermingled health and economic shocks, which were felt deeply in the
service-sector. The service-sector workforce is large, with nearly 20% of the U.S. workforce employed in retail,
grocery, food service and related sectors, and is predominantly low-income and disproportionately women and
people of color. These underserved workers bore the brunt of the pandemic’s unemployment shocks, with
potentially dire consequences for health disparities across the life course. However, the economic crisis was met
by a safety net expansion that could have buffered these negative health consequences. For those who remained
employed, many found themselves on the frontlines of the pandemic, staffing grocery stores, pharmacies, and
fulfillment centers. Adherence to coronavirus mitigation practices, including masking and staying home when
sick, shaped the further course of the pandemic as workplaces such as grocery stores and pharmacies, remained
essential, but risky, locations for the public, especially older community dwelling adults. Community-dwelling
older service workers’ risks depended on both their own adherence to mitigation strategies as well as that of
their younger co-workers and their customers. Yet, there are gaps in knowledge about how the safety net
response buffered any negative health consequences of unemployment for these underserved workers and
about how both public and company masking and paid sick leave policies shaped adherence to coronavirus
mitigation practices in service sector establishments. To fill these gaps, we propose to draw on novel employer-
employee linked data we collected as PIs of The Shift Project from 153,175 service-sector workers surveyed via
12 repeated cross-sections 2017-2023 and 42,734 person-interview observations in three longitudinal panel
surveys 2019-2023. We propose to use these data to accomplish three key aims. First, we match the Shift Project
micro-data with contextual data at multiple levels to construct time-place varying measures of safety net
generosity, workplace risk environments, and company policies. We will prepare a harmonized and integrated
data file that meets FAIR standards to encourage discovery and use of the data. Second, we use quasi-
experimental methods to estimate the degree to which the safety net buffered negative effects of unemployment
on the health of underserved workers. Third, we examine the effects of both public and company paid sick and
masking policies on adherence to coronavirus mitigation practices and how these effects varied by age. In sum,
we propose to harmonize, link, and disseminate innovative and timely large-scale data for a population subgroup
that is underserved and vulnerable to COVID-19 shocks and in a setting of considerable relevance for public
health, and to generate rigorous evidence on the buffering effect of the safety net on unemployment’s negative
health effects and provide a novel view into the role of both public and company policies on adherence to
mitigation practices in the workplace across the life course."

There are several ophthalmological diseases and ailments that perturb the normal water content or hydration
levels of the corneal layer. Among these, Fuchs’ dystrophy, keratoconus, and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)
- a common cause of glaucoma, to name a few examples, can have a drastic impact on the patients’ vision. The
work outlined in this proposal will develop terahertz spectroscopy instruments that enable spatially and spectrally
resolved measurements across the entire corneal surface to map hydration gradients of the tissue in various
disease models. Specifically, our hypothesis is that terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (Thz-TDS) can
simultaneously measure axially and spatially varying hydration gradients due to elevated IOP or surgical
disruption of the endothelial layer of the cornea using spectral multi-layer reflections from various corneal layers.
We will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims:
 (1) We will determine the accuracy of a THz-TDS corneal scanner in hydration measurement of corneal
 phantoms and ex vivo models.
 (2) We will determine the sensitivity and specificity of THz-TDS imaging in mapping corneal hydration
 gradients using two in vivo experimental models.
Results from these studies will determine the potential of THz-TDS technique as a new non-contact corneal
imaging modality to accurately measure and map corneal hydration gradients. Moreover, the developed in vivo
scanning instrument, and the methodology potentially can be used for diagnosis or as a research tool in studying

 GlycoRNAs are newly discovered biopolymers that are comprised of small non-coding RNAs and a sialic-
acid containing N-glycan. These RNAs decorate the mammalian cell surface and exhibit double-stranded regions
that are capable of detection by anti-dsRNA antibodies. Currently, there are no known functions linked to
glycoRNAs. However, diverse pathogens employ glycosidases to breakdown host cell surface glycans to enable
efficient intracellular invasion. Further, intracellular infection results in dramatic transcriptional changes and
increased deployment of glycosylated molecules on the cell surface to aid in host defense. To this point, we
hypothesize that the abundance and diversity of glycoRNA is altered upon intracellular infection. Our
preliminary data show that infection of HeLa or THP-1 cells via Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) or Herpes
Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) results in a dramatic increase in cell surface dsRNA, suggesting a change in glycoRNA
abundance. Building on this data, we aim to investigate this phenomenon both in vitro and in vivo using a sepsis
model. Here, we will use click-chemistry to isolate glycoRNA from splenocytes of C57BL/6J and Toll-like receptor
4 knockout mice injected with lipopolysaccharide or STm. This will allow us to examine how pathogens influence
the expression of glycoRNA at the physiological level. Aim 1 will explore and characterize these changes
through flow cytometry and RNA sequencing by employing click-chemistry isolation of glycoRNA.
 In immunology, the “guard hypothesis” postulates that host-derived sentinel molecules can monitor
(guard) for pathogen invasion by being targeted by virulence factors. Damage or perturbations to these guarded
molecules then activate potent immune responses. We hypothesis that glycoRNAs may function in part as guard
molecules. We found that treating total small RNA fractions from HeLa cells with the N-glycan-specific
glycosidase PNGase F resulted in greater innate immune activation than untreated (glycosylated) RNA. This
effect was abrogated by treatment of this RNA fraction with RNase, suggesting that glycoRNAs are endogenous
RNAs guarded by their associated glycan which prevents recognition as immunostimulatory self-RNA at steady
state. To further characterize this mechanism, we will define the RNA sensors that detect glycoRNA in the
absence of N-glycans and downstream signaling pathways responsible for initiating an innate immune response.
Lastly, we will identify the secondary structures of glycoRNA that confer cellular sensitivity. Thus, Aim 2 will
investigate the mechanism by which N-glycans shield endogenous RNA from triggering an innate
immune response, and our hypothesis that N-glycans serve as a determinant of self- or non-self nucleic
acid. Our proposed experiments will enhance our knowledge of these new cell surface molecules and expand
our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. This fellowship and funding will enable me to explore a newly
discovered field while taking full advantage of the mentorship and training opportunities offered by UConn Health
and the Jackson Laboratory, directly helping to advance my career as an independent researcher."

Adolescents currently engaged in substance use often co-use (e.g., both alcohol and cannabis; AC co-use),
yet few have systematically examined how youth AC co-use patterns change over time (e.g., additive or
substitution effects) in differing recreational cannabis policy contexts. Particularly as it relates to
environmental opportunity and social inequality, factors like socioeconomic status (SES) and may play a
critical role. This project will inform prevention intervention strategies, specifically for young people engaged
in alcohol use, by examining the intersection of comprehensive socioenvironmental opportunity and state-
level cannabis policy, and their associations with adolescent AC co-use transitions. The aims are to identify
latent profiles and longitudinal transition patterns of AC co-use, and to examine how AC profiles and transition
probabilities are associated with multidimensional SES (mSES) and state-level recreational cannabis law
(RCL) in two different policy environments. Disaggregating patterns of AC co-use in young people is essential
to informing public health and clinical practice, as each year more states enact RCLs, and on-the-ground
providers largely operate without information about how to navigate changes in use patterns among this age
group. An exploratory aim will evaluate sociodemographic characteristics in these highly diverse samples
(Mage=16.8; 55% Hispanic/Latino; 10.6% sexual and gender minority status). Here, the applicant will maximize
data from two of her primary mentor's NIAAA-funded longitudinal R01s of underage youth engaged in alcohol
use (N=710) collected across two regions with differing RCLs. The training plan is designed to provide a rich
program of training in advanced longitudinal modeling, adolescent development, contemporary issues in
addiction, and an initial exploration into how patterns may differ for underrepresented and underserved youth.
The proposed project is a natural extension of the applicant’s current program of research, and critically,
would provide essential protected research and training time to develop requisite skills and hone expertise to
launch a career as an independent NIH-funded scientist. Without the F31 support, the applicant will need to
take on teaching obligations in her department, rendering it far more difficult to achieve this same degree of
crucial breadth and depth in training, particularly around writing and dissemination efforts. The applicant will
be mentored by Dr. Feldstein Ewing (Sponsor, University of Rhode Island; URI), an expert in adolescent
addiction and its prevention and treatment. Drs. Manshu Yang (URI) and Tammy Chung (Rutgers University)
will also provide training in AC co-use, latent variable modeling, and longitudinal methods. Drs. Feldstein
Ewing, Yang, and Chung have an over decade of work successfully collaborating, even while housed at
different institutions, supporting a synergistic training environment that will work closely with the applicant to
ensure that she meets and achieves all proposed research and training aims."

Approximately 40% of patients with epilepsy are resistant to drug treatment. These patients may benefit from
targeted surgical interventions, such as surgical resection or neurostimulation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ).
Patients being considered for surgical intervention undergo a series of noninvasive diagnostic tests to localize
their SOZ. If these noninvasive tests cannot delineate the SOZ clearly enough for surgical intervention, patients
undergo intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to more accurately localize their SOZ. Yet, even in patients
who undergo iEEG, SOZ localization and subsequent surgical treatment only leads to seizure freedom in 47-
68% of patients, which can be partially attributed to SOZ mis-localization. Thus, there is a need for more accurate
noninvasive SOZ localization methods to guide iEEG implantation and surgical treatment for improvement of
seizure outcomes after surgical intervention. Resting-state, interictal (between seizure) functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) noninvasively measures fluctuations in blood oxygenation, an indirect measure of
brain activity. In this proposal, we aim to develop two novel interictal fMRI SOZ localization methods that improve
upon current noninvasive methods by leveraging interictal physiological abnormalities of the SOZ. We will
develop these methods in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy as a well-characterized model of focal epilepsy.
Interictal epileptic spikes, large amplitude electrical events, are detected clinically with noninvasive scalp EEG
to localize the SOZ. However, clinical interictal spike localization methods are limited by low sensitivity to detect
spikes and either poor spatial resolution or specialized hardware and extensive preprocessing. There is evidence
that interictal epileptic spikes induce specific dynamic fMRI connectivity patterns, therefore, here we propose to
develop a method to detect and localize interictal epileptic spikes with dynamic fMRI connectivity (Aim 1). We
hypothesize that interictal epileptic spikes identified on scalp EEG induce dynamic fMRI connectivity patterns
that could be used to detect and localize spikes with fMRI alone. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
tomography (PET) is used clinically to image the glucose hypometabolism of epileptic regions, however, this
method has limited utility for SOZ localization due to the moderate specificity of hypometabolism to the SOZ. We
aim to improve the specificity of FDG-PET SOZ localization by combining it with fMRI (Aim 2). We hypothesize
that the SOZ has atypical physiological uncoupling of interictal metabolic (FDG-PET) and hemodynamic (fMRI)
activity that could be used for localization. If successful, these studies will provide more accurate and specific
noninvasive SOZ localization methods that could be integrated into presurgical noninvasive testing to guide both
iEEG implantation and surgical intervention, ultimately improving seizure outcomes after surgical intervention.
Moreover, these studies will investigate the fMRI correlates of interictal electrophysiological and metabolic
abnormalities in focal epilepsy which may provide insights into the pathophysiological underpinnings of fMRI
alterations previously reported in epilepsy."
10900596,"Project Summary and Relevance
 The goal of this project is to develop mechanisms by which ordinary proteins can be turned into ligand-
activated conformational switches. When naturally-occurring proteins of this type are discovered, their
engineering can result in technologies that transform biology. For example, CRISPR-associated protein
catalytic activity is switched on by binding of guide RNA, and calmodulin undergoes a large conformational
change upon ligating calcium. Developing these proteins into DNA manipulation tools and fluorescent calcium
sensors, respectively have revolutionized gene editing and the study of calcium signaling. The current proposal
asks the question, “what else is possible if other proteins and enzymes can be made to switch on/off by binding
of DNA, RNA, or other ligands?”.
 The proposed project takes a combined biophysical, computational, and cellular approach to develop a
general mechanism for linking protein function to ligand binding. Three families of protein switches will be
created. The first is a biosensor that plugs into existing DNA tools (such as aptamers and toehold-mediated
strand displacement hairpins) without any modification to the sensor, to detect a DNA or RNA sequence of
choice. The output is ratiometric (blue/green) luminescence that can be detected by cell phone camera. The
second family employs fibronectin 3 ‘monobodies’ as the input domains and fluorescent proteins as the output
domains to provide a ratiometric FRET response, or large increase in fluorescence intensity, when
encountering an intracellular target. In the third switch design, the enzymatic activity of a bacterial RNase is
turned on by cytomegalovirus (CMV) RNA to kill CMV-infected human cells. This last aim addresses the
pressing need of preventing transplant-related CMV disease.
 Relevance. This study will open the biological activity of the human proteome to potential regulation by
binding of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules. The modular design allows mixing and matching of
different proteins to generate molecules with functionalities not found in nature. Examples include biosensors
for pathogens and disease biomarkers, and an enzyme that kills virally-infected human cells while leaving
uninfected cells unharmed."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) afflicts more than 30,000 patients per year and is rapidly fatal in 95% of cases,
with median survival is less than one year. Belying this grim prognosis, treatment-naive SCLC is highly
sensitive to chemotherapy. However, relapse is nearly inevitable, and relapsed SCLC presents two obstacles
that have been insurmountable for at least 30 years: cross-resistance to chemotherapy, and absence of
biomarker-driven targeted therapy.
Following relapse, resistance often extends beyond etoposide/platinum (EP) to other DNA damaging agents.
Although topotecan is the only approved second-line therapy for SCLC, the NCCN guidelines list 10 agents of
roughly equivalent efficacy. None are particularly effective in unselected patients, and a disease that was once
highly chemosensitive becomes inexorably progressive. However, the molecular determinants of cross-
resistance in SCLC remain unclear. Although critically important, cross-resistance is difficult to study
experimentally, as it requires a model system that faithfully reproduces clinical outcomes, and is adequately
powered to capture inter-tumoral molecular heterogeneity across a population of patients.
We have generated a panel of 44 SCLC patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) from biopsy specimens and
circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Our panel includes successive models from individual patients at time points
before and after specific lines of therapy, with detailed information about the corresponding clinical response.
For both standard chemotherapy and experimental agents in clinical trial, these models faithfully mirror patient
responses. However, unlike the patient experience, multiple strategies can be compared for identical tumors.
We propose to use these models to directly compare three clinical strategies that depend on induction of DNA
damage: standard first line EP, second line topotecan, anad a promising experimental regimen, olaparib plus
temozolomide (OT), currently in a phase I/II trial at MGH. Individually, these PDX population trials are designed
to reveal biomarkers of sensitivity and mechanisms of resistance for promising experimental therapies.
Collectively, through comparative analysis with reference to the clinical histories of each model, they present a
novel opportunity to model cross-resistance, a problem that has beleaguered management of SCLC for over
three decades."

Spoken language rapidly conveys information over time. Current theories hold that listeners make continuous
predictions about the importance and the timing of information as it arrives. Prior psycholinguistic studies have
investigated whether listeners pre-allocate attention to points in time when important information is predicted to
occur, but the results have not been consistent, and the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain
unclear. Non-linguistic studies of auditory and visual perception have shown that people use temporal
predictions to guide attention in time to behaviorally relevant events. This is achieved through two primary
mechanisms: rhythm-based and memory-based predictions. This proposal will take an interdisciplinary
approach, by investigating the role of these perceptual temporal attention mechanisms in language
comprehension through a psycholinguistic theoretical framework. Candidate sources of temporal prediction in
language are the rhythmic regularity of speech (the alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables) and
discourse cues (introduced by the linguistic context). This project will contribute to the lively contemporary
debate in speech neuroscience concerning the importance of neural entrainment, a mechanism of temporal
prediction. There are three specific aims: (1) Examine if rhythm-based temporal predictions arise from greater
rhythmic regularity in speech. (2) Determine whether memory-based temporal predictions are elicited by
discourse cues. (3) Elucidate the respective effects of speech rhythmic regularity and discourse cues on
semantic processing, a core component of language comprehension. Two experiments will employ
electrophysiological (EEG) measures of neural activity to characterize these mechanisms. The fellowship
applicant’s primary training goal is the acquisition of electrophysiological skills for cognitive neuroscience
research, including experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation. She will be supervised by
sponsors Drs. Mangun and Swaab, world leaders in the use of EEG methods to study attention and language,
respectively. Dr. Mangun is the Director of the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain (CMB), an acclaimed hub
for research, methods development, and training using EEG to study cognition. The applicant will benefit from
the rich research and training environment at the CMB, including the NIMH-supported summer training
programs in electrophysiology (led by consultant Dr. Luck) and cognitive neuroscience (led by Dr. Mangun).
She will also be trained in computational modelling by the consultants Drs. Oganian and Breska during a 3-
month visit to Tübingen, Germany. This project will provide a better understanding of the role of temporal
prediction and attention in language comprehension, contributing to theoretical models and methodological
advancements in the cognitive neuroscience of language by reconciling diverging lines of research. Elucidating
the role of temporal prediction in language comprehension in healthy individuals is vital for understanding the
cognitive-neural bases of language disorders, which will inform the development of effective forms of therapy."

Glioblastoma (GB), the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, is invariably fatal. Thus, there is
an urgent need to discover new and meaningful therapeutic strategies for this lethal disease. A major reason for
our current lack of effective therapies is the extensive genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of GB tumors. Within
the epigenetic diversity of GB cells, accumulating evidence has now firmly established the existence of a clinically
important subpopulation of GB cancer cells, called GB stem cells (GSCs), which represents a key cellular
substrate for treatment resistance and disease recurrence. Thus, targeting the GSC pool in tumors is an
important conceptual strategy, which has the potential to generate novel, durable treatments. We and others
have previously shown that the pluripotency-related transcription factor SOX2 plays a critical role in the
expression of malignant GSC phenotypes, including self-renewal capacity, invasiveness, and in vivo tumor
growth. Remarkably, despite the significant genetic heterogeneity between tumors, SOX2 is expressed in almost
all GB tumor cells, including GSCs, implicating this transcription factor as a common epigenetic driver in GB.
Thus, the identification of the mechanisms that regulate SOX2 function in GSCs will not only advance our
knowledge about the fundamental biology of SOX2 in the clinically relevant GSC subpopulation but also lead to
the discovery of SOX2-dependent therapeutic targets that may be effective across different GB tumors and cell
types. Based on published work and preliminary data, we will examine two key mechanisms controlling the SOX2
program in GSCs: post-translational control of SOX2 stability (Aim 1) and specification of SOX2 target gene
expression through local and long-range chromatin interactions (Aim 2). To study these mechanisms, we will
take advantage of two complementary human model systems: a well-characterized library of patient tumor-
derived GSCs and a novel, isogenic, human neural stem cell-based GSC model with defined genetic mutations.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel SOX2-directed therapeutic strategies to disrupt malignant
tumor growth and amplify the efficacy of current treatments."

outstanding summer research internship programs at the Schools of Medicine and Engineering & Applied
Science. Second, we will develop a series of three 25-minute videos designed to introduce clinicians to
systems concepts and approaches toward enabling stronger collaborations between clinicians and systems
biologists. The videos will be piloted for effectiveness within a Clinical and Translational Science Award
program that includes UVA and other health centers in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Third, the SASCO
Outreach Core will enable summer scholar-in-residence positions for faculty of historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) to develop research projects in SASCO laboratories. The goal of this third aim is to both
establish systems-based research projects at HBCUs and increase the visibility of systems approaches in their
curricula. The Outreach Core synergizes with the Center’s Plan to Enhance Diverse Perspectives by engaging
individuals from historically marginalized groups at the undergraduate to faculty levels in SASCO research
themes."

Children with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for serious cerebrovascular complications. The most
prevalent of these complications are silent cerebral infarcts, focal areas of ischemic tissue damage in the brain
associated with cognitive impairment and poor school performance. Despite the significant consequences of
silent cerebral infarcts, they are often detected after ischemic damage has occurred. Clinical protocols to triage
sickle cell patients utilize ultrasound measurements of blood velocity in large cerebral arteries, with high blood
velocity indicating increased risk for stroke. However, there is conflicting evidence whether high blood velocity is
a risk factor for silent cerebral infarcts. Additionally, therapies prescribed to high-risk patients may not protect
against silent cerebral infarcts. We need improved understanding of the vascular impairments associated with
silent cerebral infarcts in sickle cell disease to better prevent and treat this source of neurological injury.
This work proposes MRI measurements of cerebrovascular reactivity as a novel source of hemodynamic
information related to silent cerebral infarct formation. Cerebrovascular reactivity is the blood flow response to a
dilatory stressor and is measured in smaller vessels in the cortex, making it a more local metric of vascular health
than blood velocity. Previous studies have demonstrated impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in adults and
children with sickle cell disease, indicating reduced ability to increase blood flow to meet oxygen demands and
increased likelihood for ischemia. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) evaluate the relationship between blood
velocity in large cerebral arteries and cerebrovascular reactivity in the cortex, and 2) determine if cerebrovascular
reactivity is altered in brain regions close to silent cerebral infarcts. Aim 1 is a step forward from previous work,
contextualizing cerebrovascular reactivity against the clinical standard for cerebrovascular risk assessment in
sickle cell disease. Aim 2 determines whether this additional information improves our understanding of the
spatial distribution of silent infarcts.
The proposed study will provide a comprehensive assessment of cerebral hemodynamics in children with sickle
cell disease and offer preliminary evidence for cerebrovascular reactivity as a hemodynamic biomarker for silent
cerebral infarct occurrence. A hemodynamic biomarker that is coupled to silent cerebral infarcts could inform the
treatment of sickle cell disease and aid in the development of new preventative therapies. In the long term, the
imaging techniques developed in this proposal could serve as an alternative or complementary MRI screening
tool to stratify for silent cerebral infarct risk more effectively."

Risk for substance use disorder (SUD) begins early in the life course. Although preventing and decreasing illicit
and nonmedical drug use among youth is an urgent public health priority, there are currently few evidence-
based prevention strategies feasible for delivery in the primary care setting. We propose a three-year plan to
collect critical pilot data to pilot test and optimize a dyadic intervention that aims to increase family resilience,
strengthen coping skills, help families plan for the future, and prevent youth SUD.
Currently, over 12% of children in the US live in households with at least one parent who has SUD, including
an estimated 3 million children between the ages of 12 and 17. Parental SUD is a known risk factor for the
initiation and progression of substance use in adolescence and young adulthood. At the same time, parental
recovery from SUD has been shown to be protective against youth substance use, particularly when there are
supports in place to promote supportive parent-child relationships, problem solving skills, and effective family
coping strategies. A key premise of our work is that an effective SUD prevention strategy for high-risk youth
therefore needs to incorporate the family unit deliberately in the intervention process. The long-term objective
of this proposed trajectory of work is to prevent substance use among a selective population of youth whose
parents are in recovery from SUD.
The ‘prototype’ for our intervention approach is Family Talk, an evidence-based parent-youth dyadic
intervention that can be delivered within the existing infrastructure of the patient-centered medical home. We
have made preliminary adaptations to the model in preparation for testing. To prepare for a subsequent
efficacy study, we will conduct a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial of the intervention with 40 parent-
youth dyads to optimize the intervention model; evaluate feasibility; obtain empiric estimates of study
parameters to inform the planning of a fully powered randomized controlled trial; and identify plausible
intervention targets using semi-structured qualitative interviews.
The product at the end of this R34 will be an optimized intervention model, ready for efficacy testing, adapted
with parent and youth input. Our ultimate goal is to develop an effective approach to youth substance use
prevention that can be delivered within the infrastructure of the patient-centered medical home. If successful,
this trajectory of work has the potential to identify a novel, family-centered approach to SUD prevention for a
high-risk population of youth whose parents are in recovery from SUD."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects approximately 1% of all children born per year in the United States.
The NHLBI has made significant investments to discover the causes and outcomes of CHD, including research
in the Bench-to-Bassinet (B2B) Consortia that spans fundamental discovery science in the Cardiovascular
Development Consortium (CvDC), sequencing the genomes of clinically phenotyped children with CHD and
their parents in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), and long-term clinical follow-up and
outcomes research in the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN). The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
has rapidly accelerated discoveries in cardiovascular development and the genetics and epigenetics of CHD.
Both the CvDC and the PCGC have extensive NGS datasets. The CvDC DataHub at the University of Utah
currently serves as the programmatic data warehouse and distribution server that organizes NGS datasets and
makes them available online. CvDC datasets are complex, containing NGS experiments from seven ‘model
organism’ species (mice, zebrafish, humans, alligator, turtle, chicken, sheep and frogs) and humans.
Importantly, the experiments in the CvDC explore the molecular etiology of cardiovascular development
through several coordinated -omics approaches, studying changes in the whole-genome transcriptome and in
the epigenome (chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, the DNA methylome and higher-order organization
of chromatin) during cardiac development and in several mutant genetic backgrounds.
The Cardiovascular Development Data Resource Center (CDDRC) will be built on the innovative Mosaic
platform to provide a cloud-based collaborative space for organizing, visualizing and understanding genomic
data, and for pointing analytic tools to datasets housed anywhere on the cloud. The CDDRC is designed by
experts in computational sciences and bioinformatics, in consultation with leaders in the CvDC, PCGC and
PHN to be used by non-experts, basic scientists, human geneticists and clinicians. The University of Utah is
one of a few institutions in the country that has leadership in all three B2B consortia, reflecting the depth and
diversity of our expertise and our commitment to cross-disciplinary collaborations. The CDDRC will provide a
suite of cloud-compatible tools and a coordinated and a harmonized set of datasets transported from the
previous CvDC DataHub, imported from current CvDC projects, and recruited from the cardiovascular
development and pediatric CHD research communities. The CDDRC will facilitate dynamic and investigator-
interactive interfaces with multiple -omics datasets from humans and multiple model organisms, resulting in
collaborative discoveries of the genetic and epigenetic causes of CHD. In addition, our program will have
educational components in Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of CHD genetics and genomics, and
an outreach program in CHD computational biology for students from underrepresented groups."
10899947,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Synaptic development in the human brain is strikingly prolonged. This extended developmental timing has been
hypothesized to contribute to the uniqueness of the human brain, explaining some of our extraordinary capacity
for complex thinking but also our propensity for neuropsychiatric disease. Until recently though, testing the
functional impact of synaptic neoteny was limited, as the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon
were largely unknown. A molecular candidate is Slit-Robo Rho-GTPase activating protein 2A (SRGAP2A) that
is found in the genome of all mammals and has undergone two large segmental gene duplications that encode
SRGAP2B and SRGAP2C in humans only. The ancestral gene, SRGAP2A, encodes a postsynaptic protein that
promotes the rate of excitatory and inhibitory synapse maturation, while the human-specific SRGAP2B/C inhibit
all known functions of SRGAP2A to significantly extend synaptic maturation in mouse and human cortical
pyramidal neurons (CPNs). Disrupted timing of synaptic maturation has been associated with diseases such as
intellectual disability (ID), for example, with haploinsufficiency in the Synaptic GTPase Activating Protein 1
(SynGAP1) gene. SynGAP1 encodes for a post-synaptic protein that exerts a function opposite to SRGAP2A by
slowing down the pace of synaptic maturation. Recently, our lab demonstrated that SRGAP2A and SynGAP1
cross-inhibit their postsynaptic accumulation and this cross-inhibition sets the tempo of synaptic maturation in
human and mouse CPNs, demonstrating the need to study ID mutations in the context of human-specific genetic
modifiers. These genetic manipulations in which the timing of excitatory synaptic maturation can be accelerated
(SynGAP1+/-), prolonged (SRGAP2+/-), or rescued (SRGAP2+/-; SynGAP1+/-) provide a unique opportunity to test
the functional impacts of changing the timing of synaptic maturation on the timing of circuit and behavioral
maturation. Aim 1 will utilize CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approaches and electrophysiology to further characterize
the morphological and functional maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic maturation in these mice. Aim
2 will determine how the timing of synaptic maturation impacts cortical circuit maturation by measuring the timing
of neuronal activity desynchronization using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the
effect of synaptic maturation timing on the temporal emergence of adult-like behavioral repertoires using an
unbiased approach called Motion Sequencing. The proposed studies will provide critical insights into our
understanding of human-specific synaptic neoteny and its consequences on the phenotypic expression of
neurodevelopmental disorders uniquely affecting humans."

The overall goal of this proposal is to improve histotripsy treatments of liver tumors by developing an accurate,
clinically translatable workflow for targeting liver tumors transcostally. Globally, there are ~780,000 deaths from
liver cancer each year and in the US, this is expected to rise by more than 150% in the next 30 years. Histotripsy
is an emerging noninvasive, nonthermal and nonionizing focal tumor treatment that has recently undergone a
successful Phase I human clinical trial for treatment of liver tumors. It uses focused, short duration ultrasound
pulses to produce tissue cavitation at a focal point. Cavitation occurs from nanometer scale gas pockets present
in tissues, which rapidly expand and collapse, causing a high stress and strain that mechanically disrupts
adjacent tissues and cells. Histotripsy damage is a binary process where tissue is either destroyed or it isn’t,
providing many benefits over current thermal ablation techniques. A critical limitation of histotripsy is the sole
use of ultrasound to visualize and target the tumors. Targeting with diagnostic US limits treatments to a subcostal
approach due acoustic blockage from the rib cage, leaving an estimated ~50% of liver tumors non-visualizable
and therefore, untreatable. With the recent development of cone-beam CT-guided histotripsy, tumors can be
visualized throughout the liver, including beneath ribs, but cannot be accurately targeted due to acoustic
aberrations from intervening ribs potentially altering treatment size and location. In this proposal, we will develop
an accurate, clinically translatable workflow for targeting liver tumors for transcostal histotripsy. This will be
accomplished by first quantifying the effect intervening ribs have on targeting accuracy through ex-vivo and in-
vivo experiments (porcine model) (Aim 1). Secondly, a robust machine learning model will be developed to
predict targeting offsets, which will be trained and validated with ex-vivo, in-vivo, and in-silico datasets (Aim 2).
Finally, the model will be incorporated and tested to deliver patient-specific treatment plans in rabbit VX2 liver
tumors (Aim 3). This proposal includes radiographic image analysis of ex-vivo and in-vivo data, histopathologic
assessment of in-vivo treatments (Aims 1 and 3) and development and validation of a robust machine learning
algorithm to create a multi-dimensional analysis of a novel targeting method for histotripsy treatments. An
accurate and robust targeting method for performing transcostal histotripsy of liver tumors is crucial to expanding
the cohort of patients eligible for the therapy. It has the potential to almost double the number of patients with
liver tumors eligible for the treatment and the technique is translatable to tumors in other organs (eg, kidney and
pancreas) as well."

 Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor β (PDGFRβ) is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for the survival,
proliferation, differentiation and migration of mesenchymal cells in development. PDGF binding to PDGFRβ
induces receptor dimerization, which allows a conformational change in the kinase domain of the receptor and
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the PDGFRβ intracellular domain. Activating mutations in PDGFRB
have been recently discovered in humans. These activating mutations cause the receptor kinase domain to
remain in a constitutively active state even without ligand binding or receptor dimerization. Penttinen Syndrome
is an ultra-rare disease caused by a V665A point mutation in the kinase domain of PDGFRβ. Craniofacial
phenotypes appear during childhood including craniosynostosis, thin calvarium, Wormian bones, and midface
retrusion. Little is currently known regarding the full range of phenotypes associated with the V665A mutation.
Even less is known about how this excess of PDGFRβ signaling leads to human disease. To address this gap
in knowledge, a mouse model with a conditional V665A mutation in the Pdgfrb gene has been generated.
Reminiscent of Penttinen Syndrome patients, V665A mice (V) exhibit craniofacial defects. Additionally,
preliminary studies show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is overexpressed and
phosphorylated in cranial mesenchyme. It is hypothesized that constitutive PDGFRβ-V665A signaling through
STAT1 interferes with cranial development by inhibiting key transcription factors required for mesenchymal
progenitors to form meninges. First, this proposal will identify the cellular mechanisms of craniofacial defects in
V665A mutants (Aim 1) by assessing apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cranial
mesenchyme during embryo development, by investigating whether these processes are normalized by deletion
of STAT1, and using lineage-specific Cre mice to determine the cellular origin of the defects. Second, it will
identify molecular mechanisms (Aim 2) using bulk RNA sequencing and Cleavage Under Targets & Release
Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) on cranial mesenchyme from control and PDGFR?-V665A mutant embryos. These
studies will expand the current understanding of PDGFRβ signaling and will illuminate how elevated signaling
leads to craniofacial defects in humans. Furthermore, the results of these studies may inform the adjacent fields
of cancer and cardiovascular disease as there is evidence of upregulated PDGF signaling in these diseases."
10876163,"Project Summary
Fear learning and regulatory processes have been the focus of intense scientific inquiry in recent years, as
converging evidence shows these processes play a crucial role in the emergence and treatment of stress and
anxiety disorders. Much research has focused on fear extinction learning, in which an individual learns to
update their representation of a conditioned fear stimulus after multiple presentations of that stimulus unpaired
with an aversive outcome. Exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy is based on this form of learning.
While this form of therapy is highly effective, return of fear is common after treatment. To further optimize
exposure-based therapies, it’s important to better understand factors that mediate fear extinction learning
performance. One such factor is anxiety/stress. Research shows stress elicited prior to extinction can enhance
or attenuate extinction performance. But the paradigms used in these studies elicit acute physiological stress,
not the kind of anxious anticipation that characterizes threat-related disorders. States of anxious anticipation
could play a unique modulatory role on fear extinction learning performance. Furthermore, there is evidence
for sex-specific differences in stress sensitivity, suggesting a potential interactive effect of anxiety and sex on
fear extinction learning. Finally, evidence suggests individual differences in intolerance of uncertainty play a
role in modulating fear regulatory processes. Here, we will use a Pavlovian fear learning paradigm to test the
impact of anticipatory anxiety on fear extinction learning and extinction retrieval. We will also measure
neurobiological correlates of anxious anticipation and test the extent to which any differences in extinction
learning are associated with different levels, balance and timing of noradrenergic and glucocorticoid
expression. To address the substantial sex-specific disparity in prevalence of fear-related disorders, we will
test the interactive effects of anxiety and biological sex on fear extinction learning. Finally, we will examine
potential interactive effects of individual variability in Intolerance of Uncertainty, independent of trait anxiety,
and states of anxious anticipation on fear extinction learning. This study is in line with the mission and goals of
the NIH in several ways. For one, by studying anxious states, biological sex and trait differences as mediators
of fear extinction learning, this research will contribute to a growing knowledge base that’s being used to
develop more personalized treatment approaches for fear-related disorders. This is in accordance with the
broad goals of advancing brain science to better understand mental illness and to improve therapeutic
interventions, both of which are central to NIH’s strategic plan for research. The Negative Valence Systems
and Arousal and Regulatory Systems parts of the RDoC Matrix served as a guiding force in the development of
this proposal. Finally, this project will provide outstanding training opportunities for undergraduate students,
including many underrepresented minorities and students from disadvantaged backgrounds at York College
(CUNY), in accordance with NIH’s Notice of Interest in Diversity (NOT-OD-20-031)."
10877704,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 People who work evening, night or rotating shifts (i.e. “nonstandard” work hours) represent one in five
U.S. employees and are alarmingly 44% more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to people
who work standard day shifts. Circadian misalignment is one mechanism suggested to increases the risk of
obesity and diabetes in people who work non-standard hours, and is highly prevalent and often unavoidable in
modern, 24-hour society (e.g. shift work, long work hours, jet lag, medical residency, emergency responders,
military personnel, Daylight Savings Time changes, etc). Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms have been
linked to insulin resistance, increased energy intake, weight gain, and increased total body, abdominal and
intrahepatic fat content, yet there have been limited attempts at identifying strategies or countermeasures to
prevent the impact of such disruption on T2D risk in a sizeable proportion of the population.
 Therefore, our long-term goal is to identify and develop effective, behavioral countermeasures to
combat the increased risk for metabolic diseases associated with sleep and circadian disruption when these
behaviors are unavoidable. The overall objective for this project is to test the impact of time-restricted feeding
to a 7h period in the day as a noninvasive countermeasure to the metabolic impairments associated with
circadian misalignment. Our central hypothesis is that time-restricted feeding to the daytime period will prevent
metabolic impairments during circadian misalignment compared to a condition where energy is consumed
throughout the day and night. The rationale for the proposed project is that defining a non-invasive, scalable
and feasible countermeasure to circadian misalignment could mitigate the risk of obesity and T2D.
 To test our overall hypothesis, will use a randomized crossover study with a rigorous inpatient diet-,
activity and light-controlled protocol in 32 healthy men and women. We will determine the impact of time-
restricted feeding during circadian misalignment on 1) muscle tissue insulin sensitivity and gene expression;
and 2) muscle tissue lipid accumulation and circulating nocturnal FFA and glucose concentrations.
 Findings from this study represent a critical advancement in the fields of translational circadian and
metabolic physiology by identifying and testing a countermeasure to circadian misalignment. Achievement of
our proposed aims could lead to the development of new intervention strategies for chronic disease prevention
and management. The knowledge to be gained offers the potential to support cost-effective programs that may
inform our healthcare approach to metabolic disease prevention in populations at risk for these diseases such
as shift workers, individuals with sleep disorders and anyone who eats outside of daytime hours."

10877824,"Project Summary
Since 2007, more than 40 glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration to treat diabetes. These newer GLDs have been proven to have higher cardiorenal benefits than
older classes when applied in people at high risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease. However, the
introduction of these high-cost GLDs has led to significant quality and equity concerns in diabetes care: socially
disadvantaged individuals tend to have limited access to newer GLDs due to barriers related to social
attributes (e.g., income, education), resulting in gaps and disparities in achieving optimal health outcomes.
There is, therefore, an urgent need to improve the quality of care and equity in using newer GLDs among
millions of Americans living with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Previous studies have found that programs that improve the quality of care by promoting treatment in targeted
clinically high-benefit user groups lead to equity improvement because high-benefit users from socially
disadvantaged subgroups often have larger gaps in care thus benefit more from these programs. However,
critical knowledge gaps exist in identifying the clinically high-benefit users of newer GLDs and designing policy-
level interventions that can adequately motivate patients’ newer GLDs use while having good long-term health
and economic outcomes. Thus, the OBJECTIVE of this proposed project is to identify clinically high-benefit
T2D patient subgroups for newer GLDs and generate empirical economic evidence for designing policy-level
interventions to improve the quality of care and health equity in T2D care.
High-quality comparative effectiveness research (CER) requires the patients to have complete data records
which can track event encounters and treatment exposure with high accuracy. These individuals were often
referred to as “loyal patients.” In this proposed project, we will develop a computable phenotype (CP) for “loyal
patients” using OneFlorida EHRs and cross-network validate the CP using REACHnet EHRs (Aim 1). To
identify clinically high-benefit T2D patient subgroups for newer GLDs, we will conduct comparative
effectiveness and safety analyses of newer GLDs versus guideline-recommended alternatives across patient
subgroups using rigorous causal inference methods and a machine-learning (ML) approach. The high-benefit
T2D patient subgroups will be identified using EHRs of “loyal patients” from OneFlorida and cross-validated in
REACHnet (Aim 2). At last, we will evaluate the impact of potential policy-level interventions for promoting
newer GLDs use in high-benefit users on health, economics, and equity outcomes. Leveraging an advanced
ML algorithm developed by PI, we will also identify the ideal cost-sharing structure at a health-plan level to
maximize drug adherence while reducing the payers' burden.
The proposed research is significant because it will provide solutions for an emergent public health issue in
quality of care and health equity in diabetes management. This study is innovative because we will use cutting-
edge machine-learning methods, simulation models, instrumental variables, and two of the largest PCORnet
EHRs to tackle a challenging and innovative research question."

countries shows that this can reduced by half through effective screening, treatment, and control of risk factors.
Despite the government providing universal health coverage, free health services, and essential medicines,
less than 30% of eligible patients participate in the free chronic disease medication program and less than 10%
are still participating one year after initiation. Gaps exist in the evidence for the effectiveness of
proven interventions in the areas of comprehensive and cost-effective implementation strategies that engage
multiple stakeholders, and interventions that include links between keys steps in the awareness, treatment,
and control cascade. In prior work, we showed that community health workers (CHWs) improve screening
and linkage to care using a validated mHealth screening tool and electronic scheduling apps but it did not
lead to improved prescription or adherence to medications. We propose assessing if linking all steps in the
care continuum will reduce absolute CVD risk through improvement of risk factor control. In order to fill
three major gaps in evidence-based care we will assess implementation effectiveness through the following
specific aims: (1) Use a Systems Level Framework to adapt and evaluate our multi-level intervention
focusing on system structure, feedback loops, and key structural elements. We will engage all key
stakeholders involved in the provision of primary care health services at the national, provincial, clinic,
and community levels in a formative evaluation. The Comprehensive Framework for Implementation
Research will identify adaptations prior to intervention implementation in a cluster randomized control trial
(RCT) and to facilitate context-specific adaptations once the trial commences. (2) Assess the
effectiveness and costs of a multicomponent strategy linking key aspects of the CVD care
continuum, in a RCT with two arms across three provinces. The primary outcome is mean difference in
absolute 10-year CVD risk. We will compare usual, paper based guidelines to the intervention, which is a
global data management system linking digital mHealth screening tool for CHWs, electronic appointment
scheduling, point of care testing (POCT) for lipids, clinical decision support for medication initiation, and a
SMS reminder system for adherence to medications and life-style changes. (3) Assess the horizontal
scaling of the mHealth tool, the sustainability, and reach of the intervention. After the RCT, the
horizontal scaling and long-term sustainability of the intervention will be assessed using the REAIM
framework. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention using the Harvard CVD
PREDICT Model calibrated to Argentina. Combined with the qualitative (formative evaluation) and quantitative
(RCT), these results will provide a comprehensive understanding of the implementation of the intervention. All
findings will be disseminated through a series of meetings with key stakeholders, publications in peer-
reviewed journals, and key scientific meetings."

The burden of America's opioid crisis has heavily fallen on children, a vulnerable population increasingly
exposed to opioids in utero or childhood through parental opioid use (POU). POU exposure in utero may lead
to a newborn experiencing neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, while POU exposure in childhood may lead
to a child experiencing maltreatment and family separation due to parental drug overdose mortality, parental
institutionalization, or foster care placement. Life course theory postulates that early life adversity, especially in
utero and early childhood, may lead to lifelong physical and mental health, substance use, behavioral, and
socioeconomic problems. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award application proposes a
training and research plan that will support Dr. Angélica Meinhofer on a path towards independence, focused
on elucidating the impact of exposure to POU in early life (in utero up to age 8) on mental health disorders,
chronic conditions, infectious diseases, injuries, and healthcare utilization in early and middle childhood. The
training plan supplements Dr. Meinhofer's prior expertise in opioid use disorders, health economics, and policy
evaluation with training in (1) child health with a life course perspective, (2) behavioral health systems and
services for children and families, (3) epidemiology and biostatistics methods, and (4) complex data
management and linkage algorithms. Dr. Meinhofer will achieve the proposed training objectives with a
combination of formal coursework, workshops, and hands-on experience, as well as the mentorship of Dr.
Bruce Schackman, Dr. Yuhua Bao, Dr. Katherine Keyes, and Dr. Rachel Dunifon. Drawing from the Medicaid
Analytic eXtract (MAX) linked with other datasets and combining a longitudinal, population-based study
design with difference-in-differences and propensity score methods, Dr. Meinhofer will use the knowledge and
skills acquired through these training activities to achieve the following aims: (1) Estimate the association
between exposure to opioids in utero and physical and mental health, and healthcare utilization in early
childhood; (2) Estimate the association between exposure to parental drug overdose mortality in early
childhood and physical and mental health, injuries, and healthcare utilization in early and middle childhood;
and (3) Estimate the association between exposure to parental opioid use disorders medication treatment in
early childhood and physical and mental health, injuries, and healthcare utilization in early and middle
childhood. Understanding how early life exposure to POU may affect offspring outcomes over the life course
provides a strong foundation upon which clinicians and policymakers can design a more proactive,
coordinated, family-centered, and overall more effective agenda. The proposed K01 Award will provide Dr.
Meinhofer with the resources, training, and mentoring needed to become an R01-funded independent
investigator leading a multidisciplinary research program to inform policies for improving the wellbeing of
children and families affected by parental substance use."

tomography (CT) scans done to establish the cause of patients' respiratory symptomatology. This problem of
diagnostic specificity is exacerbated in Tanzania and Uganda on account of the high incidence of tuberculosis
(TB) which can cause a chronic granulomatous reaction in the lungs manifesting as benign pulmonary nodules
on CT and X-rays. Skilled personnel to acquire good quality chest x-ray and CT images and to interpret them is
lacking in most tertiary health centers in Uganda and Tanzania. Additionally, the number of people living with
HIV AIDS continues to rise, and in 2014, it was reported that Tanzania had 1,411,829 people living with HIV
AIDS. However, very little is known about lung cancer and HIV in Africa. With the currently observed increasing
incidence rates of lung cancer, there is an urgent need to study the link between lung cancer and HIV in Uganda
and Tanzania. An additional intriguing question is whether the same radiographic criteria for lung cancer
screening should be uniformly applied across both HIV+ and HIV- patients.
 Our group has been developing new classes of radiomic (computerized feature analysis of radiographic
scans) features for improved discrimination of malignant from benign lung nodules. For instance, we have shown
that the tortuosity of nodule vasculature is substantially different between benign and malignant nodules.
Additionally, we have shown that radiomic features of the peri-nodular surface (immediately outside the lung
nodule on CT and X-rays) were associated with degree of immune response on biopsy tissue specimens. Given
that HIV patients tend to have a low immune cell population, a reasonable conjecture is that the radiomic
signature on radiographic scans will reflect the absence of an immune signature.
 In this project we will develop a radiomics based machine classifier called LunIRiS (Lung Image Risk
Score) for predicting risk of malignancy for a nodule on a chest CT or X-ray scan. We hypothesize that the new
radiomic biomarkers can enable improved non-invasive lung diagnosis in Uganda and Tanzania which has a
higher prevalence of TB and hence TB induced granulomas. Additionally, we will seek to employ these tools to
identify possibly differences in the radiographic phenotype on CT and chest X-rays between HIV+ and HIV- lung
cancer patients and to employ these differences to develop HIV status specific lung cancer screening models.
Finally, the fourth objective will be to create a web-based deployment of LunIRiS to enable decision support and
teleradiology based services between Cleveland and Uganda and Tanzania for improving lung nodule diagnosis
on screening LDCT scans. This partnership will allow for transference of technology and radiology expertise
(through the web portal) for improved lung cancer screening in Uganda and Tanzania."

Neuromodulators control the state of an animal’s brain and thus behavior through the activation of G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although the role of neuromodulation has been appreciated for decades, the
chemical logic of neuromodulation has remained elusive due to inadequate tools to study it. Recent advances
in single-cell transcriptomics make it now clear that individual neurons co-express a huge diversity of
neuromodulatory GPCRs, yet GPCRs transduce signaling primarily by coupling to only three classes of G-
protein. This poses the question - does a neuron ‘know’ which of its many co-expressed receptors was
activated? And if so, how? I hypothesize that individual neurons are able to distinguish this chemical diversity,
even through shared signaling pathways, by utilizing spatiotemporal differences in GPCR signaling. To test
this, I will first determine which receptors are functionally co-expressed in primary hippocampal neuron
cultures, through a spatial-transcriptomic and functional screen. Then, I will compare response properties
focusing on Gs-coupled receptors by taking advantage of a powerful palette of biosensors to interrogate their
intracellular signaling with high spatial and temporal resolution. Finally, I will ask how these receptors are
utilized in intact circuits by using spatial-transcriptomics and live imaging of cellular activity in acute brain
slices. These findings will motivate my long term research goal of developing a subcellular understanding of
neuromodulation, which is key to understanding neural circuits in both healthy and diseased states. In addition,
this proposal includes a rigorous training plan and a team of collaborators that will bridge my research from
molecular to systems neuroscience. It includes training in quantitative and computational methods that will both
assist in my research aims and facilitate my development as a scientist. Through the excellence in research
and postdoctoral support at UCSF, the training environment in the von Zastrow lab, and the planned activities
listed in this proposal, this fellowship will prepare me for a career as an independent scientist invested in the
priorities of the BRAIN Initiative."
10901318,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) ranks among the most lethal of human cancers. Standard-of-care therapies offer only
palliation and molecularly targeted treatments have shown little benefit for patients. The failure to achieve
tumor control is partly due to the presence of GBM stem cells (GSCs). These stem-like cells self-renew and
differentiate into diverse cell types within the tumor, generating intratumoral heterogeneity and contribute to
angiogenesis and immune escape. Although the impact of GSCs remains controversial, defining their
molecular regulation may offer novel therapeutic paradigms to improve the clinical care of patients afflicted
with GBMs and other brain tumors.
We and others have found that GSCs are distinguished from their differentiated progeny and normal neural
stem cells at multiple levels of regulation, including transcription, epigenetic, epitranscriptomics, translational,
and post-translational mechanisms. In preliminary studies, GSCs display enhanced protein synthesis relative
to differentiated progeny and neural stem cells, suggesting that efficient mRNA translation may contribute to
tumorigenesis. During translation, tRNAs decipher genetic codes by base pairing with mRNA codons and
transfer the corresponding amino acids to the growing peptide chain. Post-transcriptional tRNA modifications
regulate their translational functions, which are cell-type specific and influenced by environmental cues.
Aberrant modifications alter tRNAs stability, structure, and folding to restrict or expand decoding.
This proposal focuses on a currently understudied area of tRNA modification in GBMs. Comparing expression
profiles of disease-related tRNA-modifying enzymes, I identified differentially expressed tRNA-modifying
enzymes and marks in patient-derived GBM surgical samples and cultures. As selected amino acids serve
as co-factors for tRNA modifications, I hypothesize that dietary restriction of amino acids can reprogram the
tRNA landscape. Indeed, in preliminary studies genetic targeting of tRNA modification enzymes or amino
acid restriction reduced GSC proliferation, self-renewal, and in vivo tumor growth. tRNA modifications can
specifically target a subset of tRNAs, so I also hypothesize that altered tRNA modifications change
homeostasis of tRNA pools and lead to codon-biased reprogramming of translation that drive oncogenic
processes in GBM. To test this hypothesis, I will use mass spectrometry to detect changes in tRNA
modifications and ribosome profiling to understand downstream proteomic changes upon tRNA enzyme
knockdown and diet restriction. Collectively, this proposal will provide molecular insights into roles of tRNA
modifications in cancer stem cell maintenance and inform development of novel therapies for GBM."
10904717,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men
and women. Although outcomes are excellent for patients with tumors confined to the kidney, patients with
advanced disease face unfavorable outcomes despite several approved therapies. This underscores the need
for new treatment strategies. We have identified elevations of the oncometabolite L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG)
in a significant proportion of RCCs. Oncometabolites are small molecules that aberrantly accumulate in cancer
cells and can impact tumors in many ways. Our studies reveal that L-2HG is a potent driver of RCC growth
leading us to investigate the mechanisms by which this small molecule exerts its oncogenic activity. Delineating
these effects will inform novel strategies for oncometabolite-driven kidney cancer. Our preliminary studies have
uncovered two novel findings. First, L-2HG is a powerful regulator of the epitranscriptome. In particular, our
preliminary studies demonstrate that L-2HG promotes accumulation of the RNA mark, N6-methyladenosine
(m6A). m6A is the most prevalent nucleotide modification in eukaryotic mRNA and can profoundly impact gene
expression (e.g. mRNA stability, translation). Second, L-2HG remodels tumor metabolism. Our compelling
preliminary data indicate that these two findings are intricately linked leading us to propose the innovative
hypothesis that L-2HG induced RNA hypermethylation remodels metabolism to drive tumor growth but creates
metabolic liabilities. In Aim 1 we will determine the molecular underpinning by which L-2HG promotes RNA
methylation and the functional significance of this effect. In Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanisms by which L-
2HG remodels metabolism with specific focus on glucose utilization and its support of anabolic activities. In Aim
3, we will assess the impact of L-2HG induced metabolic remodeling on tumor growth. In addition, we will
determine if this remodeling creates metabolic vulnerabilities. Leveraging our expertise in the field, we will
incorporate novel models generated by our group and apply state of the art methodologies such as ribosome
profiling to study the biology of L-2HG. The proposal work is significant as it will likely lead to novel approaches
that target either the epitranscriptome and/or tumor metabolism. The proposal is timely given recent proof-of-
principle studies demonstrating that these approaches are pharmacologically targetable. We have assembled
a multidisciplinary team required for the successful completion of the proposed studies. Given the prevalence
of high L-2HG RCC, we are poised to advance the field with findings that will impact a significant proportion of
kidney cancer patients."
10901415,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading global cause of end-stage liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma; fatal outcomes that can be prevented when serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
clearance is achieved, which rarely occurs with available treatments. HBsAg seroclearance is therefore the
primary goal for next generation therapies. Whereas most adults who develop acute hepatitis B will clear HBsAg
and produce HBsAg-specific antibodies (HBsAb), most young children and neonates fail to clear HBsAg and
develop life-long infection. Most adults with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therefore acquired infection in early life
when the antiviral immune response proved ineffective. Understanding the immunologic differences responsible
for the age gradient in HBsAg seroclearance provides a roadmap for identifying therapeutic targets for redirecting
the HBV immune response towards HBsAg seroclearance.
 To achieve this objective, I will utilize both a well-established mouse model that recapitulates age-related
serological outcomes observed in human HBV infections as well as already collected cytometry and single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from an antiviral therapy withdrawal clinical trial. By employing these
complementary sources of biological information in direct mouse-human comparison, I have the unique
opportunity to make clinically relevant interrogations into the mechanisms of hepatic antigen presentation and
the activation of CD4+ T cells by hepatic conventional dendritic cell (cDCs) that leads to HBsAg seroclearance.
These studies will also identify and test potential therapeutic targets that alter the hepatic immune priming
environment to augment the rate of HBsAg seroclearance in our mouse model.
 My proposal is composed of three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1 I will investigate the role of several co-
stimulatory signaling pathways to an age-dependent capacity of hepatic cDCs to activate CD4+ T cells in vitro.
Also, I will use scRNAseq data to identify transcriptomic differences in antigen presenting cell populations that
are associated with HBsAg seroclearance in both mice and humans. In Specific Aim 2 I will use
immunohistochemistry to image age-dependent immune cell interactions in hepatic tissues of mice and test
whether these differences are indicative of age-dependent differences in T cell trafficking and organization in the
liver parenchyma. Also, I will study CD4+ T cells from both mice and humans responding to HBV to again identify
shared transcriptomic differences associated with HBsAg seroclearance. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, I will attempt
to rescue HBsAg seroclearance by bypassing defects in CD4+ T cell priming or treating mice with agonistic
antibodies that target T cell co-stimulatory pathways identified in our preliminary investigations.
 By synergistically analyzing data from our mouse model and human clinical trial, my research aims to provide
comprehensive insights into the intricate immune mechanisms influencing HBV seroclearance. By unraveling
these complexities, I seek to identify promising therapeutic avenues that could pave the way for a clinical cure."
10901279,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Germinal centers (GCs) are the site of affinity maturation, a prototypical Darwinian process that is required to
generate the potent antibodies that protect against infectious disease. Over the past decades, work by several
groups, including our own, has led to a comprehensive general understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that drive evolution in the GC. However, this mechanistic understanding has yet to reach sufficient
granularity to allow for accurate prediction of the outcomes of GC evolution and efficient guidance of GC B cells
along predetermined mutational trajectories. Several population-level phenomena observed in GCs remain
poorly understood, including the apparent stochasticity of “clonal bursts,” proliferative sprees in which the entire
GC is taken over by the descendants of a single cell in a matter of a few days, the continuous presence of B
cells with low affinities in GCs even at late stages of the reaction, and the apparent inability of GCs to find certain
somatic mutations despite their benefit in terms of affinity. Greater understanding of these apparently aberrant
evolutionary pathways may improve our ability to predict and potentially control the output of the GC reaction. In
this application, we develop a full toolset consisting of a mouse monoclonal for Ig genes encoding an antibody
to a classic protein antigen, a deep mutational scan (DMS) experiment in which the effects on affinity of every
possible mutation in both chains of this Ig are measured experimentally, and a computational framework that
allows us to assign affinities to any Ig sequence that we recover from these monoclonal GC B cells. We will use
these tools to conduct replicated evolution experiments on hundreds of GCs, reconstructing the evolutionary
paths and affinities of thousands of B cells in the course of GC maturation. We propose to use this approach to
gain insight into how B cell evolution plays out within GCs in vivo, focusing on the interplay between
reproducibility and stochasticity in evolution. Understanding such evolutionary aspects will be important for the
field’s efforts to guide B cell clones through defined affinity maturation trajectories through vaccination."

Black family caregivers of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and/or related dementias (ADRD), have an
increased mortality risk related to pre-existing health conditions and stress. Targeted, community-based health
interventions that help Black ADRD caregivers to effectively manage their own health and use their preferred
ways of coping, or cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage stress, can improve their overall health,
perceived ability to provide care for a person with ADRD (self-efficacy), and increases the likelihood that they
will experience benefits from caregiving. The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award aims to
train a junior nurse scientist with expertise in qualitative methods how to effectively use longitudinal study
designs to develop and test a community-based clinical trial that will improve health outcomes for Black ADRD
caregivers. By describing the relationships between the adaptive coping strategies used by Black ADRD
caregivers and self-reported outcomes including: 1) self-efficacy in caregiving, 2) perceived rewards, and 3)
overall health, an appropriate model may be identified that will effectively shape the structure of an
intervention. Focus groups comprised of current and former Black ADRD caregivers will further inform the
intervention design. Finally, a pilot of the proposed intervention will take place to evaluate process outcomes
such as success with recruitment, ability to deliver a telephonically supported intervention, and ability to
measure study outcomes. This study addresses a clinical void in culturally responsive interventions developed
for Black ADRD caregivers and supports advanced training that will lead to Stage I efficacy testing of the
intervention."

Aging is the largest risk factor for a majority of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias. Despite growing incidence for such disorders, zero therapeutics are capable of reversing
progression of aging-related cognitive decline seen in disease and healthy aging. Through the use of
heterochronic parabiosis however, or the surgical joining of circulatory systems between young and old mice,
our group demonstrated that blood-borne factors from young animals are capable of reversing many deleterious
phenotypes seen in the aged brain. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive improvement
post-parabiosis may uncover novel therapeutic avenues for aging-related neurodegeneration.
 One hallmark of aging linked to the onset of AD is the collapse of protein homeostasis (proteostasis)
networks that regulate the folding of newly synthesized proteins via molecular chaperones as well as the
degradation of pathologic misfolded proteins. During aging, cellular proteostatic capacity declines, leading to an
increase in protein aggregates with physiological consequences driven by activation of stress response
pathways in downstream cell types. Recently, by profiling transcriptional changes occurring in the aging mouse
brain, our group identified chaperones that decrease in brain endothelial cells (BECs) with age, while
simultaneously, in the same cells, levels of stress-inducible genes known to increase upon sensing misfolded
proteins (e.g. Hspa1a, Hsp90aa1) were elevated – signatures which reversed post-parabiosis. Although BECs
are some of the most vulnerable cells in AD, with many patients exhibiting altered blood-brain barrier (BBB)
integrity, proteostasis machinery of these critical barrier cells has not been investigated.
 Taken together, in aging BECs, (1) molecular chaperones decrease, while (2) stress-inducible heat shock
proteins (HSPs) increase, potentially reflecting the presence of misfolded proteins throughout the aged brain. To
this end, we first seek to identify proteins that aggregate in the brain during aging and upon parabiosis via mass
spectrometry. In doing so, we will profile aging-associated proteins which aggregate in a deleterious, yet
reversible manner. Will then assess the ability of identified aggregation-prone proteins to activate stress
response pathways in BECs. While our first aim asks, what is responsible for activation of stress-inducible HSP
expression in aged BECs, our second asks what impact does increased HSP expression have on BEC function?
This will be assessed by modulating Hspa1a (the most differentially expressed HSP in aging) levels using primary
murine and human BECs alongside AD mutation-containing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
BECs via lentiviral constructs. In parallel, we will modulate levels of Hspa1a in vivo specifically within BECs of
mice via adeno-associated viral vectors. Expression of BEC markers and function will then be measured.
 The experiments outlined herein investigate roles for proteostasis and related stress response machinery
in the aging brain, potentially identifying novel avenues for BEC/BBB-targeting AD and dementia therapeutics."

This is an application for the competitive renewal of an Institutional Training Grant in Neural Injury and
Plasticity (NIP). We request support for 4 advanced predoctoral students who will be trained in research on
neural injury and plasticity by faculty participating in the Center for Neural Injury and Recovery (CNIR) at
Georgetown University. The purpose of this training program is to prepare scientists to investigate fundamental
mechanisms of neural injury, by trauma or neurodegenerative processes and to understand basic mechanisms
of neural plasticity that may be functionally beneficial to the repair processes after neural injury. Our goal is to
train researchers who will be capable of and committed to a deeper understanding of responses to neural
injury and plasticity. An experienced and well-funded group of 20 faculty members with a range of research
interests and expertise in neural injury and plasticity will participate in this training program. Most students will
enter graduate school through the Georgetown University Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience (IPN). In
the first two years they will take course work and rotate through the laboratories of potential mentors. Those
interested in the NIP Program will take one or more specifically relevant courses and begin to participate in the
NIP Journal Club. In the second year, students will formally apply to the NIP Training Program with the outline
of a thesis research proposal approved by a potential mentor or co-mentors from the NIP Training Faculty. As
NIP Trainees they will participate in NIP Specific Training which includes: Experimental Design & Statistical
Methodology Workshops (4x’s year); FAIR data Workshops (data curation & unbiased analyses; 4x’s year);
monthly meetings focused on in-depth discussions of neurodisorders/aspects specific to neural injury and
plasticity (trainee’s paired with faculty experts); weekly NIP Journal Club and extended discussions on rigor,
integrative reasoning and statistical literacy training; professional development training (i.e., elevator pitches,
grant writing and presentation skills, effective communication skills, IDPs, career opportunities). Trainees will
report results from their research in yearly student seminars, presentations at national meetings, and as
publications in peer-reviewed journals. With respect to public health, this program will create a cadre of
neuroscientists trained for research and/or management of research programs, through which new and more
effective treatments for acute and degenerative disorders of the nervous system can develop."
10881973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reproductive success and survival of progeny in organisms that undergo sexual reproduction are contingent on social
interactions, and in humans of course these behaviors are also critical for mental well-being and success in our professional
lives. There have been significant advances in understanding how the nervous system of diverse animals, ranging from
worms to mammals, enables successful display of social interactions. In mice for example, central components of neural
circuits underlying reproductive behavior, territorial aggression, and parental care have been clearly identified in both
males and females using molecular genetic approaches. Recent studies have also provided insights into how specific
chemosensory cues act on these neural circuits to guide ongoing social interactions. How social interactions and their
outcomes are internally sensed to modulate downstream long term changes in the organism is less well understood.
Mammalian females show dramatic changes following reproductive behavior as they transition from seeking mates to
preparing for pregnancy, childbirth, and subsequent nursing. The neural circuits that sense and mediate these major
transitions are poorly characterized. Our goal is to characterize these neural circuits mechanistically in order to
understand how they sense changes in peripheral, visceral reproductive organs to guide subsequent behavioral
transitions. In unpublished findings, we have identified a population of neurons in the female mouse brain that specifically
senses successful culmination of reproductive behavior but not the social interactions that precede it. In Aim 1 of this
project, we propose to image ongoing activity of these neurons to define how and when they sense this behavioral
endpoint. In Aim 2, we will functionally characterize these neurons to understand their contribution to post-reproductive
behavior related transitions in females. In Aim 3, we will characterize projection targets of, and presynaptic inputs to,
these neurons in order to understand mechanistically how this neural circuit senses an internal event to mediate these
transitions; in addition, we will use molecular genetic approaches to determine the identity of these neurons. If successful,
our project will provide insights into neural circuit mechanisms that regulate flexibility in female mouse social behaviors
centered around reproduction. Women also experience major transitions in behavior and physiology centered around
reproduction, and our work has the potential to shed light on this important aspect of human biology in health as well as
potentially the many disease conditions that can impact women during this process."
10881979,"SUMMARY
Dopamine and serotonin systems in the human brain represent two key neuromodulatory signalling systems that
impact mood, value-based decision-making, learning, and a host of other cognitive functions. Despite their
importance, there is no consensus view from a psychological or computational perspective concerning their
exact information-processing functions. Consequently, there is a scarceness of strategies to treat disorders that
afflict these systems. We believe that this gap exists primarily because of methodological limitations. While there
are many fast methods for recording action potential activity and local field potentials, similar progress for tracking
`the other end of the problem' - neurochemical dynamics - has lagged far behind. This is unfortunate since just
considering the catecholamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, the worldwide health burden of
dysfunction in these neuromodulatory systems is immense approaching 400 million people worldwide if one
includes just Major Depression and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders (WHO, 2017).
The overall goal of this project is to investigate the computational and neuromodulatory substrates of interactive
social processes hypothesized to be trans-diagnostic RDoC constructs. We will utilize two levels of analysis
(molecules/circuits and behavioral/computational) across two RDoC constructs (systems for social
processes: perception and understanding of others, subconstruct understanding mental states, and positive
valence systems: reward learning, subconstruct reward prediction error) to make inroads into understanding
the computational and neural underpinnings of social interaction in humans. Crucially, the interactive social
tasks used in this proposal generate an important class of learning signal – a reward prediction error signal –
but expressed in the context of an inter-personal interaction. Our two levels of analysis employ (1) computational
models of human (two-agent) social exchange estimated from detailed, observed behavior and (2) unique sub-
second measurements of dopamine and serotonin from human striatum (three separate sites: caudate, putamen,
ventral striatum) during the window-of-opportunity afforded by deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrode
implantation surgery for Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremors, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder."

Genome sequencing has led to rapid advances in the diagnosis of pediatric rare diseases, but current
approaches fail to diagnose 60-70% of all cases. Efforts toward the interpretation of disease variants has
tended to focus on a relatively small set of rare or de novo coding variants implicated in Mendelian rare
disease; in this proposal, we outline approaches to substantially expand variant interpretation methods beyond
the exome and encompassing complex, non-Mendelian disease processes. We have previously provided
integrated functional genomic resources and computational tools to connect variants to rare disease
phenotypes. Our large-scale i2QTL induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) resource provides a map of
developmental gene regulation across 1,490 cell lines, uncovering differential isoform expression, novel
splicing and regulatory effects in known rare disease genes, including in those not expressed in somatic
tissues. Furthermore, we recently released the IOGC model for connecting rare variants to function through
genomewide assays of multiple molecular phenotypes, providing a systematic method to uncover large-effect
rare variants in both coding and non-coding regions. Integrated with population-scale disease biobanks, we
have shown how these variants provide a powerful system to map the combined downstream consequences
on both cis- and trans-regulatory networks, identifying dysregulated core disease gene modules associated
with extreme effects on disease risk. In this proposal, we will conduct a comprehensive genomic and functional
assessment of pediatric patients from across the Midwest enrolled in the Genomic Answers for Kids (GA4K)
initiative at Children’s Mercy Hospital who have a suspected rare disease not explained by exome sequencing
(N=1,860). We have already embarked on generating functional profiles across disease tissues and patient-
derived iPSCs using multiple molecular assays, currently consisting of WGS (N=1,860), PacBio Long-Read
HiFi WGS (N=384), single-cell ATAC-seq (N=433) and single-cell RNA-seq (N=528). These assays will allow
us to systematically evaluate their use in identifying rare variants associated with downstream molecular
dysregulation in rare disease. We will then develop new statistical approaches integrating our pediatric rare
disease variant-to-function maps to uncover causal diagnostic variation explaining complex rare disease
phenotypes. This proposal builds on the PI’s previous contributions in integrated functional genomics research
within the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network and GTEx consortiums. Now, within the diverse, large-scale
GA4K initiative, the PI is leading efforts to catalyze next-generation diagnostics in pediatric rare disease
genomics in collaboration with research and clinical teams. Overall, we expect our research program will lead
to the improved diagnosis of pediatric rare diseases through the precise identification of underlying causal
genetic disease processes."

The US government is the world’s largest bilateral funder of health sector interventions in dollar terms. The
USA’s funding for HPSR was provided through its various agencies with a remit on global health, like the
National Institutes of Health, the Centres for Disease Control and the US Agency for International
Development. To further support this position, the University of Jos/Jos University Teaching Hospital has
received 80% of its funding from the US Government, from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Center for Disease Control (CDC), Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, Carnegie Foundation of New York, Families and Foundations that have
sponsored Cancer Researches.
It is therefore, imperative, to constantly, understand the funding requirements, guidelines for applications and
grants management systems for these US agencies, with particular attention to the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as an agency. The
University of Jos/Jos University Teaching Hospital, grant application has increased with 30% over the last 2
years, and the funding from the NIAID, has also increased, though as sub-contracts. Quite a number of
policies for Systems of Award Management (SAM.Gov), eRA Commons, Payment Management Systems
(PMS), Grants.gov, login.gov, NCAGE and dynamic institutes changes in funding guidelines, has occurred
in the last 2 years and are still changing. If Research Administrators and Finance Managers of NIH projects
do not keep abreast of these changes, it will affect their respective institutions’ chances of seeking and
managing funded projects.
Through this project, the University of Jos/Jos University Teaching Hospital will build on the successes of
trainings and business tools instituted in the phase 1 of the project, to develop train new/junior administrators

Sponsored Programs Staff, to conduct training for two administrators, and other administrators in
Nigeria/West Africa. The partnership will also support the development of an electronic system for grant
submission and management as well as develop online and web resources, to support grants administration
and grantsmanship in the UniJos/JUTH during the project sustainability period."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited.
Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting
for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce
secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a
complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune
responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable
response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection
for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can
safely be observed reducing potential harms.
Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where
she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised
learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified
immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central
hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical
phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with
actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule
immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic
approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models
incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute
neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale
(Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test
their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set).
Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype
recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be
enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping
(including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct
independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma."
10898792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CANCER IMMUNOLOGY (CI) PROGRAM
The Cancer Immunology (CI) Program of The Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) is comprised of 30 members who
share a common goal to investigate the premise that immune-mediated dysregulation adversely impacts the
TME. They represent 15 Departments and 7 Institutes. As of February 2019, CI program members were
awarded $8.8 million in direct cost funding, with NCI support of $2.5 million and peer-reviewed cancer related
support of $5 million. In 2018, the program published 72 papers of which 30% were intra- and 18% were inter-
programmatic.
The major scientific themes of the CI program are to investigate: 1. Immune dysregulation in the Tumor
Microenvironment (TME); 2. Develop models to reverse immune dysfunction and restore immune balance; and
3. Validate correlates of response in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Cancer progression is
characterized by gradual dysregulation of the immune system at multiple levels that directly contributes to
unchecked tumor growth. While the role of T cell dysfunction is well acknowledged, evidence is accumulating
that the innate immune system is analogously hijacked to enable tumor growth. In this regard, CI Program
members are focused on identifying new mechanisms whereby the tumor microenvironment (TME) impacts the
function of innate immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells, in addition to tumor-reactive
T cells.
Accordingly, the CI program has three main scientific goals. The first is to identify genomic, molecular and
cellular pathways underlying immune dysfunction in the TME. CI members use preclinical model systems,
CRISPR screens and human tumor lesions, to identify novel mechanisms/targets underlying immune
dysregulation and prioritize targets of immunotherapy resistance/response ultimately tested in novel clinical
trials. Second, CI members strive to develop scientifically based strategies that will improve and/or expand
current immunotherapeutic platforms, and identify immune biomarkers of risk and response to treatment. The
overarching goal is to progress discoveries that are made into innovative clinical trials to test and validate
proposed correlates of resistance and response. A third goal is to develop novel clinically applicable immune
targets to effectively control or eradicate cancers. CI members work in partnership and inter-programmatically
to validate correlates of resistance to immunotherapy."
10898794,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL (CPC) PROGRAM
The Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program of The Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) is comprised of 38
members who share a common goal to reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality and improve the
lives of cancer patients, with emphasis on the population in the impact catchment area of TCI. Collaboratively,
they study cancer risk factors, early detection and screening and healthcare delivery.
They represent 20 Departments and 11 Institutes. As of February 2019, CPC program members were awarded
$6.7 million in direct cost funding, with NCI support of $2.1 million and peer-reviewed cancer related support of
$5.4 million. In 2018, the program published 119 papers of which 34% were intra- and 10% were inter-
programmatic.
CPC members conduct collaborative research that addresses the three themes of the program: 1) Risk Factor
Evaluation and Mitigation, 2) Cancer Early Detection and Screening, and 3) Healthcare Delivery. The aims of
the program are to evaluate and mitigate cancer risk factors with special attention to those most prevalent in
the catchment area, to develop effective early detection and screening strategies for groups at higher risk while
addressing health disparities, and to improve the quality of care and quality of life of people affected by cancer
through healthcare delivery."
10898795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cancer Mechanisms (CM) Program of The Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) is comprised of 49 members who
share a common goal to catalyze basic research pertinent to cancer-relevant mechanistic discovery with the
ultimate goal of generating new knowledge that will lead to improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention
of primary cancer and systemic cancer recurrence in our unique catchment area across three key themes: 1.
CELL AND NICHE BIOLOGY, 2. CELL SIGNALING NETWORKS and 3. CHROMATIN AND GENE
REGULATION (see Figure 1 in the Research Strategy).
Principal investigators in CM represent 15 Departments and 10 Institutes. As of February 2019, CM program
members were awarded over $17 million in direct cost funding, with NCI support of $4.7 million and peer-
reviewed cancer-related support of $13.7 million. In 2018, the program published 82 papers of which 22% were
intra- and 17% were inter-programmatic.
Our premise is that basic research focused on genetic, epigenetic, biochemical, micro-environmental, and
developmental pathways that drive primary cancer initiation and maintenance, minimal residual disease,
dormancy and overt metastasis, will reveal novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to address each of these
stages across both liquid and solid tumors. We aim to elucidate critical mechanisms across the three CM
themes and foster intra- and inter-program collaborations in order to accelerate the transfer of discoveries into
translational and clinical efforts. We will achieve this goal using orchestrated intra-programmatic efforts within
CM themes (e.g. working groups, monthly meetings), and inter-programmatic collaborations with other
programs such as Cancer Clinical Investigation (CCI), Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) and Cancer
Immunology (CI) or with disease focus groups such as Liver Cancer. In particular, our new strategic plan
allows CM investigators, upon identifying targets, biomarkers or molecules for therapeutic intervention, to work
closely with the newly created CCI program, which facilitates an accelerated translational or clinical path.
Finally, our strategic plan will facilitate new collaborative research, training and education opportunities within
our program and in our community (via efforts with CPC), high-impact publications, MPI/P01 submissions,
clinical trials and translational output through partnership with CCI, and other team efforts that encompass
CM's exceptional science."

Evidence indicates that individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) often receive
suboptimal care at the end of life (EOL). Although patient factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, caregiver
support) clearly affect the quality of EOL care, studies also demonstrate wide variations in how physicians and
health systems treat terminally-ill patients. However, existing studies on the quality of palliative and EOL care
have been focused primarily on patients with cancer, and evidence is limited as to the quality of EOL care for
persons with ADRD. Indeed, little is known about physician and health system factors that are associated
with the quality of palliative and EOL care for persons with ADRD. These knowledge gaps have hindered
efforts to develop interventions that can effectively improve the quality of EOL care for persons with ADRD.
The proposed R01 will create a comprehensive, multi-level database that includes detailed information about
patients, physicians, and health systems, by linking three large, nationally-representative datasets: (1)
Medicare claims data (patient factors), (2) Doximity Physician Database (physician factors), and (3) RAND
Health System Database (health system factors). In Aim 1, using this innovative database, we will identify
physician factors (e.g., age, sex, clinical experience, specialty, residency and fellowship training in geriatrics
and/or palliative care) that are associated with the quality of EOL care (defined as (1) the receipt of advance
care planning, palliative care, and hospice, (2) aggressiveness of EOL care, and (3) patient outcomes) for
persons with ADRD. In Aim 2, we will identify health system factors (e.g., academic medical centers, profit
status, size, region, ACO status) associated with the quality of EOL care for persons with ADRD. In Aim 3,
focusing on physicians who practice at multiple health systems (about 21% of physicians practice at multiple
health systems), we will investigate whether health system factors influence physicians' aggressiveness of
EOL care for persons with ADRD. The proposed R01 will provide a unique opportunity to advance the field by
better understanding the mechanisms of how physicians and health systems affect the quality of EOL care
provided to persons with ADRD, with a special focus on mutable physician factors (e.g., education and training
in geriatrics and/or palliative care) and health system factors (e.g., financial incentives) that contribute to the
quality of EOL care. This project will provide a strong evidence base for developing interventions (e.g., CME for
physicians targeted at palliative and EOL care for persons with ADRD, financial incentives for ACOs), which
can effectively improve the quality of care for persons with ADRD at the EOL. The research team consists of
multiple NIH-funded researchers with expertise in all relevant fields (health services research using big data,
Alzheimer's disease and dementia research, palliative and EOL care research, and health system research) to
conduct this innovative research. The proposed study aligns well with the NIA's FOA to address clinical and
translational research gaps to improve quality EOL care for people with ADRD and their families."

Amblyopia (‘lazy eye’) is a neuro-development disorder of the visual cortex that occurs early in life and affects
about 3% of the population worldwide. Amblyopia is associated with reduced visual acuity and contrast
sensitivity in the non-dominant eye. In addition, the majority of individuals with amblyopia do not have
measurable stereopsis or the ability to perceive depth from binocular information, which negatively impacts
many tasks of daily life including eye-hand coordination and navigation. While studies have shown that about
25% of the amblyopic population does have residual stereopsis, the retinal locus that mediates this function is
unknown. This proposal tests the hypothesis that when stereopsis is present in amblyopia, it is the periphery
and not the central visual field that mediates depth perception. The first aim uses a novel procedure to map
stereopsis in both central and peripheral locations to determine whether residual stereopsis is in fact mediated
by the periphery. Our pilot data suggest that it is the periphery that mediates stereopsis in amblyopia. We will
also determine whether this peripheral stereopsis accounts for fusional vergence, the movement of the two
eyes to fuse monocular images to form a binocular percept. The second aim examines the relation between
residual stereopsis and the documented suppression of the non-dominant eye under conditions of binocular
viewing. We will measure the suppression zone for each individual and relate it to the zone of stereo-deficiency
measured for that same individual. This within-participant comparison is essential to understanding the relation
between suppression and stereo-deficiency in this special group of amblyopic individuals who have residual
stereopsis. This group comprises about 50% of those with anisometropia (unequal refractive error), and about
10-40% of those with strabismus (eye deviation). This study will characterize each observer’s capacity for
stereopsis across the visual field including the periphery, which has been ignored previously. The third aim will
use electroencephalography (EEG) combined with a procedure to localize cortical source that produces the
signals to understand the neural basis of suppression in individuals with and without stereopsis, and how well
the non-dominant eye signal is represented on its own, and in the presence of a stimulus in the other eye, as
well as how the two eyes’ signals are combined at different levels of the cortical hierarchy. If the peripheral
visual field has a significant contribution to stereopsis in amblyopia, our study will establish the importance of
clinically evaluating the potential for stereopsis in the periphery and for training peripheral locations to improve
stereopsis."

Despite the availability of a variety of intervention approaches for substance use disorders (SUD), many indi-
viduals do not benefit from existing interventions either because they are not offered at the time in which they
can be most beneficial and/or they are not tailored to the changing needs of individuals. Modern technologies
such as mobile and wearable devices provide unprecedented opportunities to deliver just-in-time adaptive in-
terventions (JITAIs)–an intervention design that adapts intervention delivery to an individual’s rapidly changing
internal state and context, in real-time, real-world settings. However, new research methodologies are needed
to capitalize upon these opportunities and inform a new generation of interventions for SUD. Recent advances
in Micro-Randomized Trials (MRTs) support the collection of data that can empirically inform the construction of
JITAIs. Although the MRT is a major step forward in methodology for building empirically- based JITAIs, new data
analytic methods are needed to fully realize the potential of these data. Specifically, there are several important
gaps in existing data analytic approaches. First, these methods can be used to evaluate a set of pre-specified
JITAIs and assess intervention effects on proximal outcomes (e.g., next-day self-reported substance use) but not
to construct an optimal JITAI with respect to a distal outcome (e.g., substance use by a 6-month follow-up). This
represents a major gap given that long-term benefits are the primary motivation of SUD treatments. Second,
existing methods are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, which may provide biased estimates of the effec-
tiveness of an intervention when individuals are not fully engaged. The latter is a major challenge in developing
effective JITAIs given that engagement in mobile health (mHealth) interventions is often suboptimal and declines
over time. When the rate or the pattern of intervention engagement in the study vary from the rate or the pattern
of engagement achieved when implementing the intervention in real-world, the results obtained by ITT analyses
might not be reproducible. Third, there is no variable selection method in MRT settings to identify the important
tailoring variables. These gaps can seriously limit the usefulness and generalizability of the results obtained from
MRT data. We propose to close these gaps by developing new methods that can help SUD investigators leverage
MRT data to construct a JITAI that is most beneficial in terms of a distal outcome (Aim 1). We further propose
to develop new methods that accommodate intervention engagement when estimating the optimal JITAI (Aim 2).
We will also develop a method that enables investigators to identify important tailoring variables for inclusion in
the optimal JITAI (Aim 3). We will apply these methods to rich data from 3 funded studies, each employing an
MRT to inform a JITAI for substance use. These data sets will be used to motivate the new methodologies, as
well as to illustrate their utility as we disseminate them to SUD investigators via open-source, easy-to-use statis-
tical software (Aim 4). The successful completion of this work will facilitate the development of empirically-based,
effective, interpretable and generalizable JITAIs to prevent and treat SUD and potentially other chronic disorders."

The goal of the Leadership and Administrative Core is to provide, not only administrative
oversight of the Center, but to also advance research in geriatric palliative care (GPC) and its
translation through a framework of connected activities that starts with creating a pipeline of
trainees, supporting their research development, and ends with efforts to disseminate the work
to improve the lives of older persons and their families. The core specific aims are to foster and
support scientific innovation in GPC and to disseminate research ready for clinical translation; to
assist and oversee the Research Education Component and the Pilot and Exploratory Studies
Core in identifying, selecting, and monitoring junior investigators and pilot studies; to
assist, oversee, and coordinate 3 resource cores in identifying methodologic themes that will
advance research in GPC; to integrate activities and facilitate interchange in GPC among
the OAIC cores and investigators; to coordinate the OAIC's work with research activities of other
programs and institutions; and to provide administrative and communications support,
coordination of human subjects review, and fiscal management for the cores and projects
involved in this OAIC. In the renewal, we expand the size, breadth, and diversity of the OAIC's
leadership team, and we continue and expand existing successful efforts of the OAIC. New to
this renewal, we propose 1) to create a new Resource Core that will leverage a range of existing
data sources to support research that will advance our understanding of the longitudinal course
of serious illness on older adults and their caregivers; 2) to thematically expand research in the
intersection of serious illness and dementia; and implementation science that will cut across
the MS-OAIC cores; around two new themes (the intersection of dementia and serious illness;
and implementation science) that will involve all cores; 3) to create a new Pepper Palliative Care
research network; and 4) to undertake a collaborative effort to improve the process of
monitoring serious adverse events in clinical studies involving subjects with serious illness. By
strategically leveraging resources from other programs, this core maximizes the impact of a
modest investment to create an OAIC that is comprehensive in scope, significant in local
impact, collaborative with other OAICs and NIA programs, and national in its reach."

PILOT AND EXPLORATORY STUDIES CORE (PESC)
Evidence exists that patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other serious illness experience profoundly distressing symptoms that overwhelm them and their families. Pilot funding is needed in geriatric palliative care (GPC) to support investigators as they test the feasibility of new methodological or interventional approaches, to examine data for initial signals that support continuing to definitive studies, and to help junior investigators make the transition to independent funding. In this OAIC renewal application we propose a Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) that builds upon our Mount Sinai OAIC 2015-19 experience that will accomplish the following aims: 1) support pilot and exploratory studies that
a) examine the relationship between distressing symptoms and independence, function, and disability; b) develop interventions directed at distressing symptoms, quality of life, function, and independence for older adults with ADRD and other serious and chronic illness, and c) advance methods for the study of care of older adults with ADRD and other serious illness; 2) support the development of preliminary data in aging and palliative care that will lead to the development of larger research projects and career development awards focused on improving care and promoting independence for older adults with ADRD and other serious illness;
3) support junior faculty who are embarking on research careers in palliative care and aging, as well as mid- level and senior faculty who are embarking on research projects requiring pilot data or who are refocusing their work to fit within the OAIC theme; and 4) foster collaborative research among investigators from varied disciplines, specialties, and institutions. To accomplish these aims the PESC will: 1) solicit pilot studies from investigators within and outside the OAIC, with particular outreach to junior faculty; 2) review and select projects that fit the OAIC themes and support career development; 3) monitor study progress; and 4) assist in planning independent grant applications. We will give special consideration to projects that address two new cross-cutting OAIC themes: 1) the intersection between dementia and serious illness and 2) implementation science, and we will prioritize women and minority applicants. We will fund standard pilot applications (size:
$50-75,000; duration: 1-2 years), and small pilot applications (size: $10-$25K; duration: 1 year), to permit rapid generation of pilot data and rapid response to RFAs. Mount Sinai’s faculty and programs in geriatrics, palliative care, population health, neurology, dementia, and psychiatry, and its affiliations with the Bronx VA Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), The Hebrew Home Research Division, The New Jewish Home Research Institute on Aging, and University of Rochester, will be a large source of potential PESC investigators."

Population Research and Methods Core (RC-PRM)
The Population Research and Methods Core (RC-PRM) employs a multi-pronged approach to support Mount Sinai Older American Independence Center (MS-OAIC) investigators confronted with methodological and analytic issues that occur in the study of older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other serious illness. This core has been highly productive in providing support for numerous OAIC investigators through our research consultancy program, research methods training program, and mentoring, all with an over-arching theme of supporting population-based research. For this application, we have assembled a cadre of experts, some who have served as past consultants and some who are new, with a broad range of knowledge and expertise to serve as potential consultants to investigators. We have added new initiatives to support dementia research including collaboration with consultants who are leaders in dementia research, and new training modules focusing on capacity for consent, instrument selection, subject retention, caregiving measures and outcomes, and longitudinal analysis of cohorts with ADRD. We have expanded our
training for both faculty and master’s trained analytic staff, focusing on observational research methods, and have added new training and support in implementation science. Resources and expertise will be provided in a variety of ways and throughout all phases of the research process - from study design to interpretation and presentation of findings. The RC-PRM will provide analytic support for four proposed pilot and exploratory studies and one external project, each of which address the research goals of the OAIC. In addition, RC-PRM will conduct a developmental project employing latent class growth modeling to explore burdensome treatment trajectories for those with ADRD laying the foundation for future work exploring the intersection of dementia, function, and multimorbidity on burdensome treatments from dementia diagnosis to death. The RC-PRM specific aims are: 1) To provide rigorous methodological and analytic support to OAIC investigators; 2) To apply advanced research and statistical methodology (e.g., latent class analysis, propensity scores, instrumental variable estimation, competing risk analysis) used in other fields but not commonly applied to aging-related research; 3) To collaborate closely with the REC and PESC to ensure that junior faculty obtain research methods training to advance their current knowledge and expertise and to promote their independence; 4) To develop infrastructure for population-based research through faculty and analytic staff training specific to population-based research methods; and 5) To expand our consultancy program and research methods training to the areas of dementia and implementation science. Through consultations with experts on a range of topics addressing the methodological and statistical issues encountered in the study of seriously ill older adults and the development of research infrastructure, this Core aims to advance the rigor of geriatric palliative care research and support future geriatric palliative care research endeavors."

POPULATION DATA USE AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCE CORE (RC-PDM) 
The overarching goal of the Mount Sinai Older American Independence Center (OAIC) is to improve independence and quality of life for older adults with serious illness. The Population Data Use and Management Resource Core (RC-PDM) will leverage a range of existing data sources including the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), and the Medicare Current Beneficiaries Study (MCBS) to support research that will advance our understanding of the longitudinal course of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other serious illness for older adults and their caregivers. These high-quality data sources have sufficient sample sizes and durations of follow-up that allow for rigorous examination of clinical research questions of importance to seriously ill older adults, including those with ADRD, their caregivers, clinicians, and policy makers. Furthermore, the RC-PDM capitalizes on our experience using other data sources, including Veterans Health Administration (VA) data and the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse, which offers rich patient-level data drawn from the electronic health record. Led by Drs. Kelley and Ornstein, the RC-PDM complements the Population Research and Methods (RC-PRM) and Measurement Methods and Analyses (RC-MMA) Cores’ analytic and methodologic resources by providing data management and operational support to OAIC investigators. RC-PDM will engage in initiatives to specifically encourage population-based research in ADRD including implementing a validated algorithm to identify those with probable dementia using detailed cognitive and functional measures in combination with demographic and self-reported health characteristics, creating longitudinal cohorts of those with dementia, and supporting an external project to assemble a diverse, urban cohort of persons with dementia, linked to Medicare and Medicaid data, to examine predictors of disease progression and end-of-life treatment intensity. In addition, the RC-PDM will build infrastructure and operational support for a developmental project using geospatial analyses to examine ADRD and provide new infrastructure and support for population-based research by developing an inventory of datasets with harmonized measures of key constructs including ADRD for the study of older adults. The RC-PDM’s work with these data will support the research faculty within MS-OAIC and other Pepper Centers as part of our Pepper Trandisciplinary EXpertise To Improve Needed Geriatric Palliative Care (TEXTING-PC) research network, including analyses for pilot studies, career development award projects, and preliminary data for R01 applications. These goals will be accomplished through the following activities: consolidating population data management activities, acquiring new data sources, building and maintaining all infrastructure, and performing data updates, cleaning and linkages; harmonizing measures of ADRD and other key constructs across datasets; and ensuring that OAIC junior faculty have access to data, with emphasis on studies of dementia and implementation science."

RC-MMA will support the OAIC's effort to establish a comprehensive program of research on
older patients with serious illness, including cognitive impairment, and train leaders in geriatric
palliative care research by providing measurement evaluation and selection for core projects. In
accordance with the cross-cutting theme: measurement of cognition in patients with ADRD and
of implementation outcomes, research challenges in this patient population will be addressed.
These include difficulty fielding lengthy assessments among seriously ill, frail, and/or cognitively
impaired persons and family members who are burdened. It is also unclear whether observed
racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes reflect true differences or cultural bias in the
measures. Relative to the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) initiative to improve the quality of patient-reported outcomes in geriatric palliative
care research, the RC-MMA will address existing measurement challenges through the use of
item response theory (IRT) to provide information used to construct a) short-form surveys, b)
item banks and c) computerized adaptive tests, and determine differential item functioning to
assess the extent to which individuals of different race/ethnicities with the same level of an
attribute have a different probability of response. Building on our previous work in item banking,
and with PROMIS measures, the Core will (a) assist investigators from the Mount Sinai OAIC
and other Pepper centers in evaluating measures, and, where appropriate, in the selection and
use of IRT-derived measures (b) collaborate with the Columbia University Alzheimer's disease
Resource Center for Minority Aging Research in the conduct of research among caregivers to
older Hispanic persons with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (c) support the two other
resource cores and OAIC investigators by applying psychometric techniques to items on
geriatric palliative care domains from identified data sets of older adults with serious illness (d)
conduct IRT analyses on items from ongoing studies of older adults and (e) disseminate
information through construction of and sharing measurement evaluation grids. Additionally,
through a future Developmental Project (DP), the RC-MMA will perform psychometric analyses
of measures obtained in ongoing studies of older adults with serious illness in the areas of
stress, burden and biomarkers among Latino caregivers. The RC-MMA will host Research
Education Component investigators for hands-on mentoring. Measurement information will be
disseminated through: a) publications, b) measurement cores from other OAICs, and c)
continuation of the RC-MMA web site with links to key sites for measurement research."

The emerging, interdisciplinary field of bioinspired materials focuses on developing a fundamental
understanding of the synthesis, self-assembly, hierarchical organization, and function of naturally occurring
materials and uses this understanding to develop artificial materials for a broad range of applications, including
the delivery of therapeutics, tissue engineering, and living materials. Many of these topics are of significant
interest to NIBIB. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Bioinspired Materials, which will take place
June 16-21, 2024 at the Les Diablerets Conference Center in Les Diablerets, Switzerland, seeks to capture the
excitement of this burgeoning field with a cutting-edge scientific program and a diverse roster of invited
speakers and discussion leaders that includes distinguished experts and novices to the field, in the unique
format of a Gordon Conference that guarantees an intimate cross-fertilization of ideas. The conference is
intended to focus on unpublished data, define new directions in the discipline, and create a cohesive
community by promoting interactions between early-stage investigators and established senior investigators.
More than half of the program of the 2024 GRC on Bioinspired Materials meeting is devoted to the
development and application of novel materials that focus on applications to human health. In the preliminary
program, 36% of the confirmed speakers are women, 20% are early-stage investigators, and we estimate that
28% belong to UM groups. The aims of the conference are to: 1) Provide a platform for the exchange of
cutting-edge work on Bioinspired Materials and their applications, including therapeutics, tissue engineering,
and living materials; 2) Bring together a diverse group of speakers that include widely acknowledged thought
leaders and early-stage investigators; 3) Promote cross-disciplinary fertilization of new ideas in the format of a
GRC, which is a unique mixture of formal oral presentations, in-depth discussions, and informal networking in
an intimate setting; 4) Create a sense of community by promoting interactions between young scientists and
early-stage investigators with prominent senior investigators through oral and poster sessions, and through
informal interactions such as social activities during the afternoons and evenings; 5) Nurture future researchers
of the field by offering a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which will precede the GRC (June 15-16, 2024)
and will offer students and postdocs with comparable levels of education and experience the opportunity to
gather, present and discuss their research findings; 6) Encourage inclusion and diversity in the bioinspired
materials community through an inclusive conference, as well as a Power Hour – a unique platform found at
GRCs - devoted to discussing strategies for the advancement of women and members of underrepresented
minority groups in bioinspired materials science. The support requested from NIH will be used to cover portions
of the international travel and registration of US graduate students, postdocs, early-stage investigators,
women, and members of underrepresented minority groups to participate in the GRC and GRS."

In the United States overdose deaths remain at near record highs, largely due to the proliferation of fentanyl in
the illicit opioid supply. Increasing access to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, to people at high risk of
experiencing or witnessing an overdose is a public health intervention shown to reduce overdose death. Nearly
half of the US states have a provision related to prescribing naloxone to patients at risk, namely patients
prescribed medication for opioid use disorder, known as co-prescription. However, research suggests most
states are not distributing or co-prescribing enough naloxone to prevent 80% of witnessed overdose deaths.
While the most recent federal approval of the first over-the counter (OTC) naloxone formulation will help
increase access for people who can afford OTC naloxone, it is unknown how this approval may affect access
for people receiving medication treatment for OUD in primary care. Co-prescribing naloxone in primary care
has the potential to fill what has been a persistent gap in the overdose crisis response. There is growing
literature that pharmacists can help to increase naloxone co-prescription. The NIDA Clinical Trials Network
0116 study (PI: Marsch) is ongoing and aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of
implementing a pharmacist-integrated model of medication treatment for OUD (PrIMO) in four primary care
sites in four states. The objective of this F31 application is to investigate whether PrIMO may increase primary
care capacity for co-prescribing naloxone within the parent study. The research project aims to: (1) Describe
federal, state, and clinic-level policies and current OUD interventions which impact co-prescribing naloxone
within four PrIMO primary care sites in four states. (2) Investigate care team knowledge and attitudes regarding
naloxone, emerging OTC naloxone guidance, and patient overdose across PrIMO implementation, and (3)
Evaluate naloxone co-prescribing to patients receiving medication treatment for OUD by patient demographics,
provider type, health insurance, urine drug test results, and (b) test if these associations become stronger or
weaker across PrIMO implementation. The training plan outlines four learning objectives: (1) gaining
descriptive and historical knowledge of the breadth of naloxone policies across different states in the U.S, (2)
proficiency with performing longitudinal qualitative interviews with participants as well as proficiency with
qualitative analysis techniques relevant to clinical trial implementation and evaluation. (3) proficiency with multi-
level modeling relevant to primary care electronic medical record data and (4) developing as a professional
academic scientist. These objectives will be achieved with the support and commitment of the mentor,
consultant team, and institution. This proposal supports the applicants long-term research agenda to reduce
opioid overdose deaths by facilitating greater access to naloxone and evidence-based models of OUD care."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal cancer, and obesity is associated with an 89% increased risk
of HCC. Because of the need for safer and more effective HCC drugs, the increasing prevalence of obesity, and
the complex relationship between obesity and HCC, obesity-associated HCC is an emerging, challenging issue.
The level and composition of bile acids (BAs) play a key role in metabolic diseases and HCC. Cytochrome P450
family 8 subfamily B polypeptide 1 (CYP8B1), a protein expressed only in the liver, is vital in forming cholic acid
(CA), the 12α-hydroxylated (12α-OH) primary BA. Hence, CYP8B1 activity increases the ratio of 12α-OH to non-
12α-OH BAs, which is linked to metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)) and HCC in rodents and humans. High levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA),
a secondary BA derived from CA by gut microbiota, promotes obesity-associated HCC in mice and are present
in the hepatocytes of obesity-induced HCC mice and livers of patients with NASH, which drastically increases
the risk of HCC. Currently, there are no reported selective inhibitors of CYP8B1.
This proposal is based on our substantial preliminary data. Using an oncogene-induced HCC mouse model, we
determined that Cyp8b1 knockout (KO) mice develop less aggressive HCC relative to wild-type (WT) mice. We
also identified multiple promising CYP8B1 inhibitors via a high-throughput screening (HTS) using a novel
biochemical assay and selectivity assays. Based on the structures of the promising CYP8B1 inhibitors from the
HTS and the CYP8B1/inhibitor binding modes from our molecular docking studies, I designed and synthesized
several novel compounds displaying selective and potent inhibition of CYP8B1 activity in our biochemical assay,
cell-based assay, selectivity assays, and preliminary mouse studies. Additionally, we successfully obtained
diffraction quality crystals of CYP8B1 and CYP8B1/inhibitor to determine the binding modes with greater
accuracy, which will allow me to develop more effective CYP8B1 inhibitors. I hypothesize that CYP8B1 plays a
crucial role in the development of obesity-associated HCC and that novel CYP8B1 inhibitors will significantly
decrease the ratio of 12α-OH to non-12α-OH BAs and dramatically reduce the levels of DCA, thereby
suppressing the development of obesity-associated HCC. I propose two aims to test my hypothesis. In Aim 1, I
will determine the role of CYP8B1 by examining the HCC growth in obesity-associated HCC WT and Cyp8b1
KO mice and by evaluating the HCC suppression in the obesity-associated HCC WT and Cyp8b1 KO mice
treated with a novel CYP8B1 inhibitor. In Aim 2, I will perform further chemical modifications and structure-
activity relationship studies in order to develop lead candidates with greater potency, selectivity, and efficacy. By
determining the role of CYP8B1 in obesity-associated HCC and developing novel CYP8B1 inhibitors, I will
develop a new therapeutic strategy and potential drug candidates for the treatment of obesity-associated HCC."

This first competitive renewal application seeks to continue NHLBI funding for a T32 Training
Grant at one of the premier fellowship training programs in Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine in the
United States (U.S.). The specialty focuses on respiratory diseases, the most common cause of
emergency department visits and hospitalizations among children in the U.S. Approximately
1,194 board-certified pediatric pulmonologists (or only ~4.6% of the 25,957 board certified
pediatric subspecialists in 2019) serve this large population of children. Few pediatric
pulmonologists have had research mentors or academic role models with a strong track record
of excellence in research. In spite of a well-recognized need to train more scientists and
physician-scientists in this field, there are currently only four T32 training grants in Pediatric
Pulmonary Medicine in the U.S. Over the last decade, our fellowship program has markedly
contributed to the small cadre of physician-scientists and scientists in pediatric pulmonary medicine. Such
contributions have been enhanced by NHLBI funding of our training program since 2016, as all 7 graduates
of this T32 Training Program over the past 4.5 years are in an academic track and have been
highly productive, as measured by the number of publications directly resulting from
participation in the T32 program, as well as by subsequent funding from intramural and/or
extramural sources, including career development awards from the NHLBI, the American Heart
Association, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Our interdisciplinary training program is built on
the strong research environment at the University of Pittsburgh and provides trainees with the
fundamental tools and skills to design, implement, and interpret meaningful research projects.
Faculty mentors are highly interactive, academically productive, and truly dedicated to the
training of scientists and physician-scientists. The goal of this proposal is to continue to provide
a prime source of well-trained physician-scientists and Ph.D. scientists to conduct cutting-edge
research in pediatric pulmonary diseases. To achieve this mission, we seek to provide, within a
single center, the research role models, mentorship, and rich environment necessary for
nurturing such individuals and ensuring their success."
10894669,"Project Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating and aggressive brain tumor in adults, with patients surviving a
median of only 14.6 months. Hidden behind the blood-brain and blood tumor-barrier (BBTB), the glioma cells
migrating away from the tumor and invading surrounding brain tissue, are the source of recurrence. The
invasive cells are not readily accessible to most drug therapeutics, and targeting these cells is an essential
goal for achieving better treatment outcomes. Nanoparticles hold promise for drug delivery, but their
penetration of the BBTB is limited, and the efficiency of targeting invasive cells remains unknown. We recently
discovered that fluorescent indocarbocyanine lipids (ICLs) formulated in PEGylated Lipid Nanoparticles (PLNs)
exhibit highly efficient glioma extravasation, with a single injection resulting in accumulation in ~60% of tumor
cells and up to 30% of injected dose per gram of brain tumor. Furthermore, data in highly invasive models
demonstrate PLNs reach invasive cells at the tumor/brain margin. These findings offer a unique opportunity to
comprehensively understand the mechanism of accumulation of lipid nanoparticles and improve drug delivery
to invasive gliomas. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Study the trafficking mechanism of ICLs
across the BBTB and in tumors. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that lipids migrate in tumors via
extracellular vesicles; 2) Understand the role of lipid structure and formulation in targeting glioma cells
and the tumor immune microenvironment. This aim will test if accumulation in invasive cells and
immunosuppressive cells can be further improved through lipid chemistry, formulation and targeting to glioma
marker IL13R2; 3) Exploit ICLs to understand and improve small molecule delivery to invasive
gliomas. We will explore our previously developed chemistry to conjugate small molecules to ICLs to improve
their delivery, drug release, and therapeutic efficacy of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib in invasive
mouse and patient-derived glioma models. These studies will expand our understanding of the drug delivery
process and guide treatment of invasive gliomas with brain tumor-penetrating nanomedicine."

This new application proposes a research training program in cancer disparities and health equity across
the cancer control continuum at the University of Miami (UM) Miller School of Medicine (MSOM) and the
NCI-designated Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester). The South Florida Cancer Control
Training in Disparities and Equity (South Florida C-TIDE) is interdisciplinary program that targets training in
multilevel determinants (e.g., biological, medical, social, psychosocial) of cancer etiology, prevention, risk,
progression, adjustment, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and other health- and patient-reported
outcomes (PROs). The primary goal is to develop the next generation of cancer disparities researchers
by providing exceptional training to support postdoctoral fellows across the cancer control continuum
to develop independent, successful, high-impact research in cancer health disparities and equity. Two
training tracks will be offered: Track A: Multilevel determinants of cancer disparities in etiology, risk, and
outcomes; and Track B: Innovative interventions to reduce disparities and improve outcomes across the
cancer continuum. Trainees will select a primary track of emphasis; although, training will cut across both
domains. The program goals are achieved via mentored, didactic, and experiential exposures within MSOM,
Sylvester and the center’s catchment area. The program will be supported by 24 primary mentors who are
funded PIs with grants totaling $16.4M in annual cancer-relevant funding. Mentors include 15 PhDs, 6
MDs, and 4 MD/PhDs across 8 departments. Additionally, 13 mostly junior faculty with relevant expertise will
serve as associate mentors. Collectively, mentors have outstanding expertise in cancer epigenetics,
tumor biology, and biobehavioral mechanisms; sociocultural, behavioral, and psychosocial
determinants of health; community-based screening, lifestyle modification and symptom management,
and survivorship interventions. Training (e.g., didactics, seminars, online modules) aligns with the
competencies to be gained (e.g., social determinants of cancer disparities, intervention science, grant writing)
and capitalizes on Sylvester and MSOM’s access to specific subgroups (e.g., occupational, sexual/gender
identity, race/ethnicity, elderly) and expertise in applied methods (e.g., community-based participatory
research, social epidemiology, epigenetics, psychosocial oncology, eHealth, sociocultural processes). Training
is complemented by enrollment in the Master of Public Health (MPH) or Master of Science in Clinical and
Translational Investigation (MSCTI). C-TIDE will support 3 fellows per year for a total of 15. Most applicants
are expected to have a PhD in a relevant behavioral or social science; some will be MDs with relevant
expertise and interests. Individual development plans (IDPs) will be created for trainees to facilitate oversight
by mentors. Internal, External and Executive Boards, and Diversity and Inclusion, and Arbitration committees
will provide ongoing evaluation and feedback to ensure that the goals of C-TIDE are effectively met."
10894697,"Project Summary/Abstract
Bacterial pathogens use type III secretion systems to translocate effectors into host cells to promote virulence.
Type III secretion can also activate compensatory innate immune responses that are host protective. For
example, type III secretion can trigger inflammasome assembly in host cells, resulting in release of the cytokine
IL-1b. Virulent pathogens can inhibit compensatory protective immune responses triggered by type III secretion
but how this is achieved at the cellular and molecular levels in vivo remains poorly understood. To address this
knowledge gap, this project seeks to determine at the cellular and molecular levels how type III secretion
effectors in virulent Yersinia species inhibit a protective inflammasome pathway in vivo. Yersinia uses two
effectors, YopM and YopJ, to inhibit the pyrin inflammasome. It is not known if YopM and YopJ promote virulence
by inhibiting the pyrin inflammasome in a cell specific manner. During invasive infections of lymphoid tissues
Yersinia grow as extracellular microcolonies in direct contact with neutrophils within an organize immune
structure known as a pyogranuloma. Pyogranulomas can be considered battlefields where Yersinia virulence
factors combat protective immune responses in neutrophils acting as foot soldiers. Yersinia mutants lacking
YopM and YopJ have a significant survival defect in lymphoid tissues suggesting that these effectors inhibit the
pyrin inflammasome in pyogranuloma neutrophils. Additionally, IL-1b is important for host protection against
infection by Yersinia lacking YopM and YopJ. Based on these published data and preliminary results we
hypothesize that YopM and YopJ promote Yersinia virulence by inhibiting the pyrin inflammasome in neutrophils
to prevent release of IL-1b in pyogranulomas. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1. YopM binds to pyrin in
infected host cells and in purified form, but the molecular basis of this interaction is undefined. Based on
published and preliminary we hypothesize that YopM targets the pyrin domain to inhibit the inflammasome in
vivo and promote Yersinia virulence. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 2. Completion of these aims will fill
important knowledge gaps, move Yersinia pathogenesis research forward, have a broad impact on the field of
neutrophil inflammasomes and inform new therapeutic strategies aimed at augmenting protective neutrophil
inflammasome responses to bacterial pathogens."
10894740,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a chronic infection and airway inflammatory disease with
systemic manifestations affecting multiple aspects of our patients' lives. Similar to other chronic inflammatory
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, the impact of pulmonary MAC disease (pMACd) varies between
individuals with regards to presentation, course and response to therapy. Lifelong management is often
required, as recurrence is common. The treatment burden is high with patients typically taking 3-5 antibiotics
for 18-24 months. In clinical practice, sputum culture results, radiographic findings, and symptoms drive
treatment decisions. While conversion of sputum culture to negative implies microbiologic success, it does not
imply infection eradication and it is inadequate to assess the full impact of this disease on our patients' lives.
Importantly, the US Food and Drug Administration does not consider culture conversion an adequate endpoint
in therapeutic trials for pMACd. As this disease has become recognized to be increasing in incidence and its
tremendous unmet need for antibiotics highlighted, a pipeline of new therapeutics for this orphan disease has
recently materialized. However randomized clinical trials are currently stymied by a lack of validated outcome
measures. Objective measures of function, health-related quality of life, radiographic changes and biomarkers
are needed as clinical outcomes. Further, the heterogeneity of this disease's natural history is reflected by the
fact that culture, radiography, and symptomatology often do not change together. A combined outcome
measure along several domains (symptoms, radiologic, etc.) would better capture disease activity and could be
useful both clinically as well as in clinical trials of new therapeutics. Currently, there are no validated outcome
measures in pMACd and potential outcomes are not measured consistently across all studies. In order to
facilitate development of a future combined disease activity measure, this proposal aims to identify a set of
core outcome domains and the best available instruments for a minimum core outcome measurement set that
can be consistently collected across future clinical trials. First, we will identify a set of core outcome domains
for pMACd essential to patients, caregivers, patient advocates, clinical experts, and researchers through an
international consensus process using the Delphi methodology. Second, we will evaluate the impact of
pulmonary MAC treatment on various available measurement instruments that represent the identified core
outcome domains, by utilizing available clinical datasets. Third, we will identify a minimum core outcome
measurement instrument set essential for future pMACd clinical trials through the international Delphi
consensus process. This will enable comparisons between clinical trials and meta-analyses, both important in
a rare disease such as pulmonary MAC. The results of this project will contribute significantly to an
improvement in clinical care, future therapeutic trials and observational research, in addition to facilitating
future development of a combined disease activity measure in pMACd."
10894742,"Abstract
In the US most (~70%) annual newly diagnosed HIV infections are among substance-using sexual minority
cisgender men (MSM) and gender minority transgender women (TW).1 TW/MSM are more likely to report or be
diagnosed with a substance use disorder (SUD) than their cisgender or heterosexual counterparts2-5 and the
presence of a SUD substantially increases risk of HIV infection in both groups.6-16Although PrEP is highly
effective, initiation, adherence, and persistence are exclusively behavioral outcomes, and the biomedical benefits
of PrEP are abrogated by substance use. SUD is also associated with reduced quality-of-life, and increased
overdose deaths, utilization of high-cost healthcare services, engagement in a street economy, and cycles of
incarceration.17-26 This application builds upon the highly promising findings from our open-label Phase I A.S.K.-
PrEP (Assistance Services Knowledge-PrEP) pilot, which utilized PrEP navigation with text message (SMS)
support to increase PrEP initiation among TW/MSM. The Phase II study will implement a RCT with a Stepped
Care design of ASK-PREP vs. standard of care (SOC) to determine optimal intervention response among
TW/MSM with a SUD (N=285; n=95 TW; n=190 MSM) for advancement along the PrEP Care Continuum.
Participants will be randomized (3:1) to Stepped Care (n=214) or SOC (n=71). Participants in the Stepped Care
arm will receive the same ASK-PrEP intervention that was delivered in the pilot study and will be assessed at 3-
months for intervention response; responders will be maintained in ASK-PrEP, while non-responders will receive
added attention to their SUD via contingency management (CM). Non-responders will be re-randomized (1:1) to
either a) receive ASK-PrEP + CM, or b) shift the primary focus to their SUD (CM alone). The ASK-PrEP
navigation intervention is based on mechanisms of the Reasoned Action Approach, SMS support is based in
Social Support Theory, and CM is based on behavioral economics. The specific aims are to: 1) Evaluate a Stepped
Care approach promoting advancement along the PrEP Care Continuum (initiation, adherence, persistence),
and reductions in substance use among TW/MSM with a SUD; 2) Estimate the cost of implementing and
sustaining each intervention and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the value of each
intervention relative to SOC, and to each other, from the healthcare-sector, state-policymaker, and societal
perspectives; Secondary Aim 1) Determine the individual effects of specific substances, routes of administration,
severity of SUD, social and structural determinants of health, and differing individual-level characteristics as
moderators of outcomes; and Exploratory Aim) Evaluate intervention engagement and response by chosen PrEP
modality (oral daily or long-acting injectable). The “intent-to-treat” RCT uses repeated assessments at baseline
and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post enrollment. The study will be conducted in Los Angeles County, an EHE
priority County.27, 28 This study could have significant public health impact by identifying scalable and effective
PrEP interventions that match intensity and participant needs to maximize efficacy while minimizing costs."
10894744,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Physiological and metabolic health relies on the circadian alignment of biological processes with the
environment. Since the first documented study of circadian rhythms in the 18th century using a plant system,
model organisms have been critical for defining the transcriptional mechanism of the oscillator and revealing the
importance of the clock on fitness. Most of this work is based on whole organism or organ level studies leaving
many mechanistic questions about how cell specific gene regulation leads to coordination of cellular clocks and
a concerted physiological response. We know that gene regulatory networks are effective at modeling gene
expression dynamics but resolving cell-type specific networks with time resolution remains a significant
challenge.
 To delineate regulatory connections across cell-types, a single cell view is needed to develop network
models that reflect the true cell state rather than the variation among groups of cells or tissues. Only with these
cell specific networks can we begin to develop testable hypotheses about what regulatory variation underlies
physiological responses. This proposal describes a research strategy that leverages the genetic and molecular
power of the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana and the latest single cell technologies to 1) Identify the
cell-types with distinct oscillators and their underlying regulatory networks, 2) Dissect how cell-type specific
circadian regulatory networks maintain a synchronized physiological response, and 3) Perturb cell-type specific
circadian gene regulatory networks and evaluate their physiological consequences.
 Over the next five years, our goals are to delineate single cell circadian gene regulatory networks across
an entire organ with spatial resolution. Our Arabidopsis model system will be used to dissect how distinct cell
type specific circadian regulation controls a physiological response. Through perturbations to tissue specific
gene regulatory networks we will gain a better understanding of how cellular gene programming is coordinated.
Our long-term goal is to develop Arabidopsis into a model for understanding how cell specific gene regulatory
networks influence inter-tissue communication. This research will generate valuable insight into how we interpret
the influence of circadian gene regulatory variation on human health and the application of targeted therapies."
10894785,"Unlike other death pathways, protein mediators of drug-induced necrotic cell death were poorly defined.
Necrosis activates immune cells, inducing immunogenic cell death. Therefore, understanding necrosis
provides new avenues for enhancing drug development and cancer immunotherapy. Our anticancer drugs
BHPI and ErSO act via estrogen receptor α (ERα) to induce lethal necrosis-inducing hyperactivation of the
anticipatory Unfolded Protein Response (a-UPR). In orthotopic xenografts and a PDX, ErSO eradicates
primary and metastatic therapy-resistant ERα+ breast cancer, induces near complete regression of lethal
breast cancer in brain, and of endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, and kills most ovarian cancer cells in
patient malignant ascites. From CRISPR screens against BHPI and ErSO, we identified the Ca2+ activated,
plasma membrane Na+ channel TRPM4 as the executioner protein that BHPI and ErSO use to induce
necrosis and the likely membrane flexibility modulator FGD3. BHPI and ErSO-induced elevated Ca2+ opens
the TRPM4 channel, eliciting a rapid influx of external Na+, Cl- and accompanying water. This swells the
cells, causing osmotic stress, which hyperactivates the UPR, leading to ATP depletion, FGD3 enhanced
membrane rupture and necrotic cell death. TRPM4 knockout abolished ATP depletion, sustained UPR
hyperactivation, cell swelling and death. Notably, TRPM4 knockout also inhibited necrosis induced by
unrelated anticancer therapies, the mitochondrial targeting oncolytic peptide, LTX-315, the Ca2+ channel
targeting agent, Englerin A and Ca2+ electroporation (CaEP). Aim 1. Identify and functionally characterize
known and additional shared components of the TRPM4 pathway. We will combine data from completed
CRISPR screens, new screens using LTX-315, Englerin A, and CaEP and RNA-seq data from our recently
developed ErSO resistant cell lines. Aim 2. Using cell and tumor studies, test the hypothesis that diverse
necrosis-inducing anticancer therapies, in which Ca2+ levels are increased by transient a-UPR activation or
other mechanisms, share a common pathway that converges on the UPR-TRPM4-FGD3 pathway. To
extend UPR activation therapies to ERα- cancers, test the idea that the clinically promising, mechanistically
obscure, necrosis-inducing therapy, Ca2+ electroporation, works in part through the UPR-TRPM4-FGD3
necrosis pathway. Aim 3. Using syngeneic mouse models establish whether necrosis-inducing agents
extend the reach of immunotherapy to rapidly lethal breast cancer that has metastasized to brain and does
not express neoantigens. Aim 4. Mechanisms of resistance to necrosis inducing cancer drugs are largely
unexplored. Using our Myc down-regulated reversibly quiescent cells, we will identify ErSO resistance
mechanisms and test whether loss of Myc in the quiescent cells is due to a-UPR mediated ATP depletion
activating AMPK, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis via eEF2. These studies will establish a new
pathway of immunogenic anticancer therapy-induced necrotic cell death through the UPR."
10904866,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The ability to predict vulnerabilities given the molecular features of a
patient’s tumor is central to operationalizing cancer precision medicine. While sequencing of patient tumors is
increasingly common, researchers, clinicians, and drug developers currently lack the ability to identify which
somatically altered genes and variants are required for tumor survival and/or confer a requirement for other
genes (synthetic lethality). The “Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap)” project directly addresses this
challenge. This effort, which continues to generate and release pre-publication data on a quarterly basis
without restriction, currently encompasses over 1,000 genomically annotated cancer cell lines and organoid
models, over 750 genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 viability screens, and large scale drug repurposing screens
totaling over 1,000,000 data points. In addition, we have created a wide range of computational algorithms to
discover dependencies and to infer them from molecular features.
To ensure that the scientific community can easily use these data and tools to make scientific discoveries, we
launched the pilot of depmap.org on April 2018. This pilot aimed to learn how best to support the analysis
and visualization of such data (whether created at the Broad Institute or elsewhere) by researchers everywhere.
The pilot proved to be a success: currently, depmap.org has 62,000 users and is visited by >800 unique
researchers from >200 laboratories daily.
Here, we propose the advanced development of depmap.org to address the emerging needs of distinct user
communities:
 ● cancer biologists: use depmap.org to discover the function of genes and variants and how these
 induce network changes that result in vulnerabilities (users have limited programming experience, we will
 emphasize user experience, enabling the upload of researchers’ own data and the interoperability with
 other experimental research tools);
 ● translational cancer researchers: use depmap.org to prioritize new targets from CRISPR data and
 mechanism of action of existing drugs within specific tumor type contexts to advance drug discovery
 (users have limited programming experience, we will emphasize user experience and tumor-type
 functionality, connectivity with cBioPortal and patient data);
 ● computationalists: aim to develop new predictive modeling applications and data analysis tools
 that can be readily shared back with the depmap.org community (users have extensive programing
 experience, we will emphasize creating application programming interface (API) protocols and support
 sharing of new computational tools back with depmap.org)
Our revised proposal focuses on three complementary Specific Aims:
In Aim 1, we will develop new functionalities to support pre-defined scientific inquiries of cancer
biologists and translational researchers. Here, we will (a) enable users to prioritize cancer targets via the
integrated analysis of drug and CRISPR viability data, (b) create tools to connect patient tumors with cell models,
(c) develop mechanism of action functionality and (d) support tumor- and genotype-specific inquiries. In Aim 2,
we will develop new visualization and interactive analysis tools for cancer biologists and translational
researchers as well as APIs for advanced computationalists. This will include data generated by multiple
institutions as well as new functionality for interoperability with user uploaded data and APIs to export harmonized
data for outside analysis. In Aim 3, we will develop a set of resources to train and engage a diverse user
community. This work will include a major training and outreach program and real-time communication channels
for user feedback and support.
This ITCR proposal will put us on a path towards the routine use of depmap.org by a majority of cancer
researchers worldwide. If funded, this proposal would represent the only dedicated source of funds to support
the maintenance and expansion of this popular portal which simply cannot be sustained at the needed level
without dedicated funding. As such, it will have a significant impact on both basic and translational cancer
research and enable computationalists and biologists to continue to make key cancer discoveries."
10904879,"Project Summary
Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite
established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-
related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for
groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low
socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing
clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases
and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.
 Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing
biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to
test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We
have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes.
Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an
ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.
 In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how
to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer
screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at
sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.
 In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and
identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test
the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge
interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk
patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).
 In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter
Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of
personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1),
evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic
minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR
interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient
characteristics (Aim 3)."
10904881,"Cherenkov imaging incorporating surface imaging for TSET
Abstract
Whole-body skin electron radiotherapy has been clinically demonstrated to be effective to treat mycosis
fungoides. However, due to setup positioning uncertainties and potential patient movements during
total skin electron therapy (TSET), dose delivered to the patient skin tissue can deviate from dose
prescription. Cherenkov emission from tissue has recently been demonstrated, providing a mapping
related to the radiation delivery to skin tissue. The signal is optimally captured by time-gated intensified
cameras, synchronized to the linear accelerator pulses, allowing rejection of the majority of background
room light, and providing real time video of each radiotherapy treatment with high dose rates. The
implementation of Cherenkov imaging offers an excellent technology to detect abnormalities in the
treatment, which would otherwise go unnoticed. This proposal seeks to advance this technology as a
verification tool through a clinical trial to monitor the daily treatment delivery of TSET patients and
develop proper corrections that can be applied to the acquired signal to ensure it is quantitatively
accurate in documenting delivered skin dose. Three of the most dominant factors, which alter the
linearity between dose and Cherenkov signal, are the corrections for perspective direction, tissue
curvature, and tissue optical properties. These important corrections are quantified in this pilot study of
TSET, in partnership with DoseOptics LLC, the company that developed the Cherenkov imaging
technology for radiation verification, to perfect technology for daily monitoring of radiation delivery. We
will compare the dosimetry accuracy of Cherenkov imaging by comparing measurements in-vivo at 9
locations using OSLD and Scintillator detectors. In addition, we will perform measurements in optical
phantoms of known tissue optical properties at TSE treatment conditions and Monte-Carlo simulation
studies to quantity the three correction factors. We will also develop techniques to overlay skin dose
obtained from corrected Cherenkov image to patient-specific surface anatomy based on surface 3D
body contour data obtained before TSE treatment to assess the actual skin dose distribution for daily
TSE treatment and perform a comprehensive comparison of dose distribution based on MC-based
treatment planning system. Taking together, this project will advance on the most compelling systems
for radiotherapy imaging in decades. The core of the project is combined technology systems, testing
the utility in the setting of TSET."
10906283,"Summary
Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial
pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless
to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial
hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens
resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be
addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and
bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic
biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable
host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those
with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill
bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for
biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific
aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced
phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing
unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2)
azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for
bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a
patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine
learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The
model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail
fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host
ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved
regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative
because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional
phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular
bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design
and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for
advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom
phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow
researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria."
10906292,"ABSTRACT
As cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death and disproportionately affects Black
communities in the U.S., there is an urgent need to address cardiovascular racial disparities. Individual-level
social determinants of health (iSDH; e.g., poverty and education) and neighborhood-level SDH (nSDH) have
been linked to CVD risk factors, as well as subclinical and clinical outcomes. Exposure to SDH may start from
young age and accumulate over the lifespan. However, most studies on SDH and CVD have focused on either
older adults or the elderly, while racial disparity studies have focused on self-reported race. Longitudinal studies
of SDH from young age that also consider genetic ancestry in relation to CVD racial disparity are urgently needed.
Furthermore, current indices to measure SDH do not take specific health outcomes into account and thus provide
limited information for these outcomes. The underlying biological mechanisms between SDH and CVD remain
largely unknown. Epigenetic markers have been associated with social disadvantages and CVD outcomes, and
epigenetic processes represent a potential biological mediator between SDH and CVD racial disparity. However,
most prior studies are cross-sectional and limited to one or two time points and/or use samples collected after
disease development. These limitations hinder us from studying the dynamic nature of epigenomic biomarkers
and their temporal and/or mediating role on the process from SDH exposure to subclinical CVD at middle age,
and then into clinical CVD later in life. In the proposed study, we address these gaps using a social epigenetic
approach to understand the impact of the individual- and neighborhood-level SDH on DNA methylation markers
and the mediating/temporal role of SDH-associated DNA methylation markers in CVD development and disparity.
We are uniquely poised to conduct this study because we can leverage existing resources from the Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. CARDIA is a community-based biracial cohort of
individuals enrolled at ages 18–30 years from four large U.S. cities with large variations in social disadvantages,
currently followed every 5 years for >35 years. Specifically, we propose (1) to develop iSDH and nSDH indices,
and trajectories specific to subclinical CVD; (2) to identify SDH-associated DNAm biomarkers and examine their
roles in CVD risk and disparity using TOPMed ready-to-use longitudinal epigenomic data; (3) to examine genetic
roles in SDH-associated DNAm biomarkers in relation to CVD risk and disparity using TOPMed ready-to-use
WGS data; and (4) to validate our findings in other TOPMed cohorts, and deploy a user-friendly web application.
By evaluating multiple modifiable risk factors of CVD related to SDH, the findings from this highly time- and cost-
effective study will be invaluable for targeting high-need populations, tailoring interventions at the individual and
neighborhood levels, and distributing resources to tackle social disadvantages in the U.S. and worldwide."

 A growing body of research implicates memory systems, such as the hippocampus, in reward
computations related to exploration and reward-seeking behaviors. Episodic memory formation relies on flexible
neural coding to form memories in changing environments. How are reward mechanisms involved in memory
formation within the hippocampus, a region required for episodic memory formation? Previous work has
suggested that hippocampal place cells—cells that fire at a specific location in the environment—overrepresent
goal locations where animals receive rewards. Further studies show that a subpopulation of place cells will form
fields and potentiate (i.e., increase their firing rate) at locations of head scanning, an investigatory behavior.
These studies, however, did not examine the mechanisms of rewards alone or unexpected reward changes in
evoking head scanning and place field formation. Although it is known that reward inputs preferentially project to
CA1 over CA3, how rewards evoke head scanning and subsequent place field formation across hippocampal
subfields CA1 and CA3 have not been explored.
 To test this relationship, I will use in vivo electrophysiology recordings via silicon probes in hippocampal
CA1 and CA3 during navigation tasks. Rewards will be delivered using an intracranial stimulating electrode to
the medial forebrain bundle, a region that projects from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area to
the nucleus accumbens. For our first aim, I will evaluate the timescale and presence of goal overrepresentation
in CA1 and CA3. I will explore the hypothesis that head scans predict place field formation at rewarded goals
rapidly across both regions. For our second aim, I will assess the role of reward expectation in head scanning
exploration and place field potentiation. I will test the hypothesis that unexpected rewards will evoke more head
scanning and place field potentiation than expected rewards. Further, I will test how place field potentiation in
CA1 differs from that of CA3 at expected and unexpected reward locations. I expect that CA1 place fields will
potentiate more to unexpected increases in reward and weaken more to unexpected removal of reward than
CA3 place fields. By controlling reward delivery timing, this project will reveal the role of expected and
unexpected rewards in head scan initiation and place field formation. Together, the results of this project will
establish a spatiotemporal framework for reward exploration in episodic memory encoding. This project directly
investigates mechanisms of complex behaviors important for developing therapeutics aligned with the NIMH
mission. This proposal will support technical training endeavors, in electrophysiology, animal pose tracking, and
intracranial electrical stimulation. This fellowship will also provide training on science communication, reward
learning theory, data interpretation, sophisticated methods of statistical analysis, and academic career
development. Johns Hopkins University provides an ideal research environment to complete the proposed study
due to collaborations, technical resources, and diverse intellectual communities."
10903500,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Astrocytes are known to be dysfunctional in Huntington’s disease (HD); however, further research is needed
to understand how these star-like cells develop in the context of HD. HD is a devastating, progressive, genetic
neurodegenerative disease, and recent work suggests mutant Huntingtin (mHTT), the cause of disease, may
trigger early molecular and cellular changes during neurodevelopment that sets up susceptibility. Data suggests
mHTT impacts the maturation of neural cells into adult life and throughout disease progression. While HD is
primarily characterized by the degeneration of medium spiny neurons in the striatum and atrophy of the cortex,
astrocytes have become a prominent cell type of interest as a contributor to the onset and progression of the
disease. Astrocytes guard and support the brain by stabilizing the blood-brain barrier, responding to stressors,
and regulating ions and neurotransmitter homeostasis, all of which are dysregulated in HD. Our lab at UC Irvine
has shown developmental deficits using single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) in HD human induced PSC-
derived astrocytes (iAstros) and in rapidly progressing R6/2 HD mouse cortex and striatum. We also confirmed
that HD iAstros have decreased RNA and protein of transcription factors (TFs) SOX9 and ATF3, results that
support a role for these TFs in dysregulated maturation and developmental pathways. Lacking in the snRNAseq
from mice is spatial information, thus I conducted spatial transcriptomics of postnatal day 0 (P0), 4-week and 12-
week-old control and R6/2 mice and found early dysregulation of astrocytic developmental genes and a possible
role for neuronal-derived signaling factors in astrocyte developmental impairment. Several questions remain: 1)
whether HD astrocyte dysmaturation is an initial delay of maturation or a persistent impairment, 2) what is
mechanistically driving spatial maturation impairments, and 3) what the impact is of astrocyte deficits on
neighboring cells. I hypothesize that early impairments in astrocyte maturation set up susceptibility to HD
progression later in life. To begin to address these gaps in knowledge, in Aim 1, I will investigate the role of
dysregulated TFs, SOX9 and ATF3, with overexpression and knockdown in iAstros and assess cellular
maturation, function, morphology, and transcriptomic pathways. Aim 2 then utilizes the spatial transcriptomics
data integrated with snRNAseq to evaluate temporal and spatial regulators of regional changes with a focus on
astrocyte development and maturation, and the contributions of neuronal-astrocyte signaling. I will infer cellular
communication between neurons and astrocytes through ligand-receptor analysis and functionally validate my
preliminary findings in vitro with iAstros. This proposal uses innovative approaches to provide the scientific
community with a novel investigation of dysfunctional astrocytic developmental trajectories in HD with the aim of
influencing early therapeutic interventions to impact the onset or progression of disease. My laboratory
environment at UCI and individualized mentorship from my sponsors supporting my research skills in perturbing
in vitro cell models and bioinformatics analysis will help to burgeon my growth as a young scientist."

This application seeks partial funding for three years of cochlear implant (CI) clinical research
conferences to be convened by the American Cochlear Implant Alliance in July 2024 (Vancouver,
Canada), April 2025 (Boston) and May 2026 (Washington, DC). The CI meetings provide a unique
opportunity for CI clinicians from across the continuum of care (i.e., ENTs, audiologists, speech
pathologists, psychologists), educators, and scientists to learn together. With the rapid rate of change in
the field and concerns on how to manage the growing number of new recipients with expanded
indications, alongside of an installed base of patients who must be cared for over their lifetime,
conference interests have expanded to include research to practice topics on serving this population in a
challenging and changing healthcare environment.
Attendees will have the opportunity to explore current and emerging topics that significantly impact CI
outcomes and delivery mechanisms for patients across the lifespan. Podium presentations, panel
discussions, featured talks, and posters will highlight clinical research on: team approach to patient
management including expanded indications of special needs populations; cognitive impacts of CI in
older adults; managing bilingual patients and families; innovative models of service delivery for CI
programs (including telehealth); roles of therapy, education, and family engagement in the CI process
for adults and children; advances in CI technology and surgical techniques; hearing preservation; CI
in single sided deafness, role of vestibular assessment in the CI process; and gene therapy, genetics,
and alternative methods of managing hearing loss. The impact of the whole team in the CI process
will be examined. This aim is unique to this conference and will provide an in-depth critical
assessment of the various factors that impact on outcomes for patients across the lifespan. As adults
of all ages have become a larger proportion of the cochlear implant population, our focus will address
the diversity and needs of the adult population, alongside of children.
Students may apply for waived registration and financial support and may enter a student poster
competition with interviews conducted by an interdisciplinary committee. An afternoon symposium for
(re)habilitation professionals and others on CI teams providing clinical or educational services to children
and their families will be offered. Among the pediatric topics to be explored are listening and literacy and
provision of CI in single sided deafness. Adult rehabilitation post CI will address adults’ specific needs.
Research and clinical practice will be explored for both populations."
10879381,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 2.8 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) yearly in the United States, with over
500,000 emergency room visits being attributed to childhood-acquired brain trauma (<14 years of age).
Survivors often endure long-term cognitive and emotional disabilities that reduce quality of life and the ability to
return to school/workforce. Current and past research has largely overlooked complex attention impairments
post-TBI, especially in conjunction with overlapping clinical comorbidities, which may exacerbate injury effects.
We aim to remedy the paucity of studies examining comorbidities of TBI by exploring how hypertension/high
blood pressure, a common underlying condition, can affect TBI-related neurological, physiological, and
cognitive impairments. An estimated 50% of the adult population is diagnosed with hypertension, which can
lead to heart attacks, blocked or damaged arteries, reduced blood flow to the muscles, strokes, and premature
death. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate preclinical models of TBI that are also affected by
hypertension (i.e., hypertensive rats) to better characterize neurological, physiological, and cognitive
impairments, in an effort to enhance bench-to-bedside translatability by more closely reflecting the existing
clinical landscape. This study explores the effects of TBI on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR), a widely
used animal model of hypertension, by administering a battery of behavioral assays across different modalities,
such as motor coordination/balance, higher-order sustained and flexible attention, and anxiety-like symptoms.
Moreover, it is important to determine whether being subjected to TBI during pediatric (i.e., prior to
developing stable hypertension at 16 weeks of age) or adult age (i.e., after hypertension onset) alters
physiological, emotional, and cognitive outcomes long term. The aims are designed to 1) determine
interactions of moderate parietal TBI and age-at-impact (pediatric versus adulthood) on motor function (rotarod
test), sustained attention and impulsivity (3-choice serial reaction time task), cognitive flexibility (attentional set-
shifting test), and anxiety-like responses (elevated plus-maze test, shock-probe defensive burying) in SHR
versus normotensive male and female adult rats, and 2) evaluate TBI-induced and sex-related differences in
histological assessments of lesion volumes, neuronal survival, and neuroinflammation markers in SHR versus
normotensive rats. Studies will be conducted in both male and normal cycling female rats, an approach that is
clinically relevant. Women represent up to 45% of the TBI cases, thus evaluating normal cycling female rats
parallels the real world, where injuries occur independent of menstrual cycles. The findings from this R21
Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant will serve as proof-of-concept for significant future funding support
from the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, or the US Department of Veterans
Affairs, as dissecting the impact that underlying conditions such as hypertension may have on TBI preclinically
is critical to further developing clinically-relevant therapies."
10879380,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Fentanyl addiction is a highly heritable disease and a critical public health crisis. In 2022, fentanyl overdose
was the leading cause of death for US adults aged 18 - 45. This striking statistic underscores the urgent need
to discover and characterize the genetic drivers of fentanyl addiction. In this regard, drug-induced incentive
sensitization in brain reward systems is a fundamental addiction vector. This hypothesis (the incentive
sensitization theory of addiction) posits that, over time, brain reward systems become hypersensitized to the
environmental stimuli that accompany drug use. The consequence is pathological incentive motivation (i.e.,
“wanting”) for the drug upon exposure to the drug-paired stimuli. Although fentanyl addiction and incentive
sensitization are highly heritable in humans and mice, the genetic role of incentive sensitization in fentanyl
addiction is unknown. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the genetic mechanisms through which
incentive sensitization drives addiction-like fentanyl taking and seeking. This goal will be accomplished through
the integration of advanced mouse resources, gold standard behavior and neurophysiology assays, and
cutting-edge transcriptomics. The Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel, which contains
90% of mouse alleles, will be used to maximize genetic and phenotypic diversity. In Aim 1, we will use
intravenous fentanyl self-administration to identify genetic mechanisms underlying classical pharmacological
phenotypes and addiction-like behaviors in male and female mice from 40 CC strains. In Aim 2, we will use
Pavlovian conditioned approach and RNA-seq to identify genetic and nucleus accumbens transcriptomic
mechanisms underlying incentive sensitization in male and female mice from 40 CC strains. In Aim 3, we will
use snRNA-seq, Iso-seq, electrophysiology, and voltammetry to identify cell-type and isoform specific addiction
mechanisms in two CC strains exhibiting extreme nucleus accumbens-driven vulnerability and resistance,
respectively, to both IV fentanyl and IV cocaine self-administration. Using data from these three aims, a
comprehensive systems genetics analysis including QTL mapping, eQTL mapping, genetic correlation, and
differential expression will be performed to identify cell-type specific and isoform specific transcriptomic
signatures in nucleus accumbens that predict both pathological incentive motivation and addiction-like fentanyl
self-administration. Successful completion of these aims will provide a foundation for future deep
characterization of identified mechanisms and a lasting community resource enabling genetic correlational
analysis among the CC panel across phenotypes, experiments, and laboratories. Ultimately, this work will
contribute to the development of novel, more effective addiction treatments."
10879383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growing evidence suggests that agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate
nucleus play an important role in health and disease. In response to hormonal, nutrient, and neural-related
input, these neurons, when activated potently stimulate feeding and engage a broad array of other metabolic
and behavioral functions. Our recent findings suggest that rather than being a homogeneous population, AgRP
neurons are a heterogeneous population that contain functionally distinct subsets of AgRP neurons that
conduct distinct biological functions. Specifically, using a single-cell transcriptomics approach with RNAScope,
our Co-PI, Dr. Tune H. Pers, University of Copenhagen, has shown that multiple subsets of AgRP neurons
exist, and these exhibit differential responses to various physiological stimuli such as leptin and glucose. This
work supports our recent findings which shows that whereas fasting activates the majority of AgRP neurons,
acute cold-exposure only activates a small subset. Moreover, our findings further show that AgRP neurons are
required for cold-induced increases in energy intake, but not energy expenditure, suggesting that those AgRP
neurons involved in feeding are distinct from those involved in energy expenditure. We therefore hypothesize
that in response to different afferent input, distinct subpopulations of AgRP neurons project to separate brain
regions to mediate their biological effects. Proposed aims seek: 1) to identify and transcriptionally characterize
distinct subsets of AgRP neurons and 2) to map the projections and responsiveness of transcriptionally distinct
AgRP neuron subsets. This project leverages the complementary expertise and resources of the Morton and
Pers laboratories to create synergy that is essential to the success of this project. Dr. Morton has extensive
experience examining the role of the brain in the regulation of energy- and glucose homeostasis, while Dr.
Pers has expertise in transcriptomics and computation techniques. Thus, to accomplish this, we will use a
combination of mouse genetic, viral and immunohistochemical techniques along with single-cell RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) strategies and bioinformatic analysis. Together, this work will fundamentally advance
our knowledge and understanding of the AgRP neurocircuits that regulate feeding, relative to other biological
functions, and create opportunities to develop novel strategies for the treatment of obesity."

Project EAGER is an ambitious collaborative initiative between California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) and
the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) that will guide cohorts of CSUF students toward graduate programs
in genomics. It recognizes the crucial role of effective mentorship, particularly during the undergraduate years,
in shaping aspiring scientists’ career trajectories. While focusing on undergraduate mentorship and research
opportunities, Project EAGER acknowledges that career aspirations are often formed or altered at this level, and
research experiences play a pivotal role. However, not all undergraduates have equal access to such oppor-
tunities due to disparities between institutions. Underserved institutions typically have limited research options
compared to research-intensive universities like UCB. Additionally, students from diverse backgrounds, includ-
ing underrepresented groups, face unique challenges in pursuing STEM careers, including limited knowledge of
genomics opportunities and societal pressures favoring traditional paths.
 To address these challenges, Project EAGER employs a comprehensive approach that integrates specialized
coursework, laboratory experiences, and individualized mentorship. Yearly, eight students are selected as cohorts
based on their academic records and interest in genomics. The program spans multiple phases, starting with
specialized CSUF courses to prepare students for subsequent summer laboratory work at UCB. The curriculum
includes theoretical coursework co-taught by UCB faculty via virtual platforms, ensuring a strong foundation in the
field. Ongoing engagement with the UCB faculty mentors, including virtual meetings and consultations, facilitates
continuous mentorship and research collaboration. The second summer focuses on further research and project
completion at UCB.
 Students benefit from the guidance and mentorship of the Project EAGER team, comprising PIs from CSUF
and UCB, as well as mentors from the UCB laboratory and the wider research community. This multi-faceted
mentorship approach ensures students have diverse support networks for their professional and personal growth.
The program aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed for success in graduate programs and
genomics careers. Project EAGER also strives to foster a supportive and inclusive environment. By promoting
mentorship, research engagement, and diversity, it empowers students to realize their potential in genomics. Ul-
timately, Project EAGER aims to cultivate a community of researchers prepared for graduate studies and capable
of making significant contributions to the field’s advancement."

Although rates of congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS) have declined since the 2015–2016 Zika virus
(ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil, transmission of the virus still occurs, with nearly 9,000 cases reported already in
2023. Without global eradication, the threat of another large outbreak exists. Longitudinal research is
necessary to better understand the long-term impact of CZS and factors associated with various health
outcomes. For this application, we will extend our successful collaboration between RTI International and
Altino Ventura Foundation (FAV), to include the University of North Carolina and Purdue University to bring
new, expanded expertise in imaging, EEG, and heart rate sustained attention. We will continue to evaluate
the impact of severe CZS on the medical and developmental outcomes for 187 children who have been
followed since birth. Our cohort, now entering middle childhood, is the largest sample of children with well-
documented CZS to be followed longitudinally since infancy. We will examine the evolution of the primary
clinical signs of CZS (brain, ocular, orthopedic) and assess the long-term medical, developmental, and
mental health outcomes for children with CZS and their families using innovative approaches, such as a
novel heart-rate variability paradigm, that address specific challenges in accurately assessing the
development of children with severe disabilities. Lastly, we will examine malleable predictors of outcomes for
children and their families. This study has the potential to contribute to global knowledge that could lead to
improved outcomes for children and families living with CZS and for children impacted by other conditions
with similar clinical findings."
10880487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The recent advancement of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) enables highly focused dose
delivery to tumors while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Both past and emerging clinical evidence has
strengthened the role of radiotherapy in lung cancer management, and SBRT is considered the standard of
care for many diagnoses. However, radiation-induced toxicity, especially for cases with centrally located lung
tumors, poses a lingering challenge to lung SBRT. The respiration-induced motion of lung tumors and
surrounding organs-at-risk (OARs) introduces substantial uncertainties to the delivery accuracy of lung SBRT,
causing under-dosing to tumors and over-irradiation to surrounding OARs. The current motion management
techniques, including internal-target-volume (ITV)-based treatment, respiratory phase gating, breath hold, and
motion tracking, all suffer from various sources of uncertainty and inaccuracy, potentially resulting in large dose
deviations that miss the tumor and damage normal tissues. Obtaining intra-treatment tumor and OAR
motion/deformation, and using such information to derive the actually delivered doses to optimize remaining
radiotherapy treatments, will systematically address the intra-treatment motion challenge. However,
reconstructing intra-treatment dynamic and volumetric images for motion/deformation tracking remains an
unmet clinical need, mostly due to the challenging spatiotemporal inverse problem of reconstructing volumetric
images from extremely under-sampled signals. In addition, currently, there are no existing techniques and
workflows that use the actually delivered dose to optimize future SBRT plans and deliveries. The overarching
goal of this project is to develop an intra-treatment dynamic imaging and plan adaptation (IDIPA) system,
which is composed of two sub-systems, spatial and temporal implicit neural representation (STINR) and
dosimetry-guided plan adaptation (DGPA). STINR solves dynamic cone-beam CT (CBCT) images and intra-
treatment deformation vector fields (DVFs) from x-ray projections with each x-ray projection corresponding to a
dynamic CBCT volume and a DVF. The solved dynamic CBCTs and DVFs will then be used by DGPA for
treatment dose calculation, dose accumulation, and dosimetry-guided plan adaptation. The STINR sub-system
uses an Artificial Intelligence-driven method to address the substantial challenge of dynamic CBCT
reconstruction. The DGPA sub-system features the first closed-loop, dosimetry-guided optimization framework
that uses delivered doses to adapt the following plans to ensure the treatment doses will be delivered to where
it is intended. We have three Specific Aims for this project: 1) Develop and optimize the dynamic CBCT
imaging sub-system (STINR), 2) Develop and optimize the dosimetry-guided plan adaptation sub-system
(DGPA), and 3). Evaluate the overall IDIPA system via a clinical study. The success of the project will result in
the first end-to-end system to improve the dose delivery accuracy of lung radiotherapy under intra-treatment
motion, and to unleash the full potential of SBRT in advancing lung cancer care."
10889448,"Project Summary
Laryngeal injury, defined as glottic mucosal ulceration or granulation or subglottic granulation/stenosis, leads to
respiratory failure and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. More than 55,000 adults are treated daily in
ICUs and 13-20 million worldwide require intubation each year. Current treatment often requires multiple
surgeries with or without tracheostomy. Recently, adjuvant glucocorticoid use has been reported, as they are
known to improve airway inflammation. However, these treatments require repeated injections with an interval
varying from every week to 5 weeks with a total of 3 to 25 injections, which is a significant burden to the patients.
Therefore, there is a critical unmet need in delivering glucocorticoid non-invasively in a dose-controlled manner
to the lesion. In addition, investigation into the tracheal microbiome suggests a contributing role of
laryngotracheal microbiota to mucosal inflammation and the pathogenesis of tracheal stenosis. We will develop
a novel injectable co-delivery implant that can deliver glucocorticoid and antimicrobial over time either in a
sustained release fashion or in a laser-light activated approach effectively for 6 weeks in a leporine preclinical
model. Our in vivo preliminary work showed minimal immune responses from the injectable implant in the
leporine upper airway after 6-week implantation. In the first aim, we will optimize our injectable co-delivery implant
drug delivery system for the ex vivo trachea tissues and measure any local immune response in healthy leporine.
In the second aim, we will employ the implant in a trachea injury model to quantify its healing impacts compared
to no treatment or single glucocorticoid and antimicrobial injections. Simultaneously, the upper respiratory
microbiome will be analyzed to determine the microbiome changes and the efficacy in reducing bacteria utilizing
our implants compared to a single glucocorticoid injection. This work lays the foundation for optimized, dose
controllable therapeutic delivery to the airway and improved drug delivery."
10900678,"Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses
that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a
complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses
far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep')
artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but
also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists
have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the
human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the
biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been
slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals,
such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal
applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages
for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid
fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory
input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge,
we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network
dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing
layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge
approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural
population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to
yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits."
10899287,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The proposed stage II intervention efficacy trail is designed to address two significant co-occurring issues for
fathers with substance use (SU) problems: Intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment together
defined as family violence (FV). SU treatment programs are an important avenue to reduce family violence
because SU treatment alone does not result in an end to these behaviors. Currently available interventions have
had little success in reducing male FV. Fathers for Change, an integrated outpatient intervention, shows promise
as an intervention model targeting the intersection of SU and FV. The intervention uses men's roles as fathers
as a motivation for change and targets emotional dysregulation as the common factor associated with all three
problems. It is composed of 9 core topics designed to increase motivation and reflective functioning and target
poor emotion regulation followed by 4 co-parent topics and 5 father-child topics for a total of 18 sessions. This
project will test the efficacy of Fathers for Change model in reducing SU and FV compared to a comparable dose
of Individual Drug Counseling post-treatment, 3- and 6-month following treatment for fathers with substance use
disorders seen in either community or VA SU treatment settings. Emotion dysregulation will be examined as the
mechanisms through which Fathers for Change reduces SU and FV. The study will test differential outcomes for
high and low risk clients in preparation for implementation in community settings. If Fathers for Change
demonstrates efficacy in reducing SU and FV simultaneously the intervention can readily be integrated into the
more than 2500 outpatient SU treatment programs nationally. Reductions in SU and FV will have major public
health and criminal justice implications."

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most well researched and most effective treatment for IBS that
targets the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis, and preliminary data show that this therapeutic effect is
associated with a reduction of brainstem connectivity with other brain networks and a change in relative
abundance of Bacteroides taxa. The increased prevalence of IBS in women, the higher rate of comorbid non-
GI pain conditions, as well as the higher prevalence in female IBS of increased sensitivity to a variety of
internal and external stimuli (multisensory sensitivity) suggest the presence of important sex differences in
some of these BGM mechanisms. Research performed by the UCLA SCOR during previous funding has
established an increased responsiveness of the CRF-Locus Coeruleus system in female IBS subjects,
suggesting that this noradrenergic brainstem system plays an important role in IBS pathophysiology. In
addition, our earlier research has begun to identify clinical, functional and cortical brain mechanisms that may
underlie these sex effects. Based on these preliminary data, the overall goal of this Project is to use CBT as a
probe to study the relationship between specific disease-related alterations of the brain, brainstem, the gut
microbiome, and symptomatic outcome, and identify the role of sex differences in these relationships. We will
study male and female IBS patients before and after CBT or usual care using the advanced neuroimaging and
microbiome technologies of the overall SCOR to test the following: Aim A. will identify sex differences in the
impact of CBT on the connectivity between brainstem nuclei and brain networks and between these networks
at rest and after provocation. Aim B. will identify sex differences in the impact of CBT on gut microbiome
parameters and Aim C will identify clinical, brain and gut microbiome predictors of CBT outcomes."
10903932,"The Clinical Core seeks to build upon the extraordinary data resource that has been acquired since 1948 across
the six Framingham Heart Study cohorts. Importantly, in terms of scientific premise, is that many
vascular/metabolic, lifestyle, plasma and genetic measures have been collected longitudinally for up to nearly 7
decades that include the periods of early to mid-life and can be leveraged to identify new and expand on known
risk factors and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive resiliency, some of which will be pursued
through the three projects proposed within this U19 application. Both the breadth and depth of the FHS cognitive
aging and dementia data provides a phenotypic repository, that in combination with autopsy data from the
Neuropathology Core can be shared through the Data Core and can be further leveraged by the broader research
community to inform detection and prevention strategies that will attenuate risk for AD decades later. Aim 1 will
continue surveillance and diagnosis of all cohorts for incident dementia through the conduct of clinical
examinations (neuropsychology, neurology) for those flagged as at risk for dementia/AD, maintain the weekly
consensus diagnosis meetings to identify new cases of dementia and major subtypes (e.g., AD, vascular
dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy Body) and MCI subtypes (amnestic single domain, amnestic multi-
domain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multi-domain) and determine final cognitive status for all
FHS participants after death, including no documented evidence of dementia (e.g., died cognitively intact and
thus potentially meeting criteria for cognitive resilience). Aim 2 will extend longitudinal characterization of
cognition across all surviving members of FHS cohorts through repeat administration of the same
neuropsychological (NP) test protocol administered since 1999. The NP assessments will also include
administration of NP tests added in 2005 as well as deeper NP phenotyping that includes coding of
error/extraneous responses and novel derived measures from digital voice and digital pen recordings to capture
spoken and written responses, respectively. Aim 3 will extend longitudinal characterization of brain structure
through repeat acquisition of brain MRI scans using the MRI protocol administered since 1999 and include
acquisition of diffusion tensor imaging protocol added in 2008. Novel measures of the hypothalamus and white
matter integrity will be acquired in addition to traditional AD-related cortical and subcortical regions of interests.
Aim 4 will continue to maintain FHS' brain donation program operations, including antemortem clinical
assessments and post-mortem diagnostic evaluations of all cases that come to autopsy and the convening of
clinicopathological meetings to harmonize clinical versus neuropathological diagnoses."
10903934,"The Framingham Heart Study (FHS), initiated by the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI) to identify
determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke in 1948, has created a rich source of comprehensive
data, including demographic, health, lifestyle, social networks, genetic, serum, plasma biomarkers, cognitive and
neuroimaging data that together can be evaluated to deeply and longitudinally characterize CVD, stroke and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. While these data present an unprecedented opportunity to address scientific
questions of AD risk across the entire disease spectrum (e.g., asymptomatic, preclinical, clinical) as well as
factors associated with cognitive resilience, management and sharing of all these data have relied on ad-hoc
operations funded through multiple National Institute on Aging (NIA) R01 grants that have become more difficult
to administrate as clinical data collection and data sharing efforts expanded. Further, due to the extremely
complex structure of FHS data, it has been difficult for external (and internal) investigators to understand the
characteristics of the data and the most appropriate use of the data even after they receive them. The proposed
Data Core will (1) establish a comprehensive and secure database of FHS AD-related phenotypic data that will
integrate all existing AD data available to date as well as new data collected from the Clinical and Neuropathology
Cores and Projects 1-3 (Aim 1); (2) review, modify and direct quality control pipelines for all data assembled in
Aim 1 and harmonize and curate all data to produce a centralized set of data that is ready for analysis and
sharing (Aim 2); (3) accelerate data sharing by transferring data from Clinical and Neuropathology cores and
Projects 1-3 to the FHS National Heart Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded data repository on a quarterly basis;
prepare data to deposit in the publicly available National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Database
of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and NHLBI's Data Repository Information Coordinating Center
(BioLINCC); and facilitate data sharing with collaborators by pre-prepping all phenotypic data for FHS NHLBI
funded contract staff to disseminate (Aim 3); and (4) support the proposed Projects 1-3 by updating datasets
with newly acquired data from Clinical and Neuropathology Cores and providing statistical design and analytical
support, including explaining data, structures, recommending methods for combining different data formats for
analyses, and assisting with the development of computer scripts that are needed to perform the proposed
statistical analyses, particularly longitudinal and trajectory analyses (Aim 4)."
10903936,"In 1997, the FHS began its brain donation program, and has 568 currently enrolled subjects and 241 who have
come to autopsy. As a community-aging brain bank, there is a spectrum of pathologies present, including a
significant number of participants that were cognitively intact at the time of death (e.g., CDR 0; 32%), mild
cognitively impaired (19%), or demented (48%), including 34.2% with possible or probable AD. This spectrum of
disease allows for the study of heterogeneous pathologies on clinical outcomes. Traditional pathological methods
used to characterize the distribution of amyloid and tau throughout the brain are semi-quantitative and the
diagnosis of AD is dependent on meeting specified thresholds of density and regional involvement.
Neuropathological characterization of vascular disease into standard quantification methods is still not uniform
and quantification of other pathologies (e.g., Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease,
etc.) relies on estimation of regional density and a summary impression of overall distribution patterns. Accurate
assessment of pathological burden is further complicated by the prevalence of mixed pathologies, which
increases with advanced age. Digital technologies offer an exciting opportunity to attenuate the limitations of
traditional semi-quantitative methods and provide a level of measurement that is significantly enhanced in its
precision and objectivity. The proposed Neuropathology Core proposes to continue neuropathological
characterization of FHS participants who come to autopsy integrating longitudinally applied semi-quantification
methods with new technologies to allow precise quantification of AD and cerebrovascular pathologies. The aims
of the Neuropathology Core are (1) perform state-of-the-art diagnostic neuropathology, (2) develop novel
methods for qualitative and quantitative histopathological characterization of the tissue, (3) optimally store and
distribute brain tissue, and (4) provide neuropathological data for Project 3 and other ancillary studies by both
Framingham Heart Study-Brain Aging Program (FHS-BAP) and external investigators. FHS' neuropathological
protocol is already aligned with the Boston University Alzheimer Disease Center (BU ADC) in biospecimen
collection, blocking, staining and storage, and will be further aligned with 7 other brain bank cohorts through a
newly funded U54 led by Neuropathology Core Leader, Ann McKee and co-Leader Thor Stein. In addition, a
digital library of the pathology slides will be generated for each participant and through the Data Core, will be
made publicly available."
10903938,"The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a call to detect the disease earlier in
its course. However, AD's insidious onset that can span many years, adds complexity to making an early
diagnosis. It is widely accepted that even among individuals with well-documented AD risk factors (e.g., age,
sex, low education, APOE ε4, high cardiovascular risk, high plasma Aβ40/42 ratio, tau pathology), diagnosis is not
inevitable. By way of its longstanding investigation of cognitive aging and dementia/AD, the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS) has amassed arguably one of richest databases acquired from a community-based cohort. Across
its multi- generational cohorts, participants have undergone up to 7 decades of regular health examinations that
document many co-morbid features linked to future risk of late life cognitive decline and dementia. Because AD-
related processes are likely initiated many years before onset of disease symptoms, one primary objective of
this project is to better elucidate mid-life vascular and inflammatory traits that are associated with AD risk.
Additional unique goals of this project are to leverage this unprecedented resource to identify factors associated
with longitudinal trajectories of cognitive decline, with longitudinal trajectories of neurodegeneration as measured
by MRI, and with resilience to developing cognitive decline. To achieve these goals, we will first apply prediction
modeling approaches to identify measured and derived traits associated with AD and related endophenotypes.
From the extensive list of demographic, lifestyle, vascular/metabolic, plasma and omics measures (including
whole genome, transcriptome, and methylome) already captured as part of the FHS, we will use traditional model
building (guided by a priori determined AD pathways) and data driven approaches to identify traits associated
with (a) MCI, dementia and AD, (b) longitudinal trajectories of cognitive decline, (c) longitudinal trajectories of
structural MRI indices, and (d) AD-related neuropathological indices. We will perform pleiotropy GWAS to identify
shared genetic underpinnings of significantly correlated traits in initial analyses and test whether using digital
neuropsychological phenotypes strengthen findings. Next, using the same database of previously measured
traits, we will apply prediction modeling approaches to identify measured and derived traits associated with
cognitive resistance, as defined by lack of conversion to dementia. Finally, we will identify vascular and
inflammatory moderators of genetic influences by performing Mendelian randomization to assess the causal
relationship between vascular risk factors (e.g., blood glucose, lipid fractions, blood pressure, BMI, cigarette
smoking) and inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, IL-β, TNFα, IL6) and AD using existing GWAS summary
statistics. For vascular and inflammatory risk factors with significant causal effects, we will assess gene ˣ
environment interactions with variants in targeted genes previously implicated in AD. The novel factors identified
in this project will inform AD prognostication as well as provide insight into disease mechanisms and new targets
for prevention and therapy, heralding a personalized medicine approach to AD."
10903941,"ABSTRACT
Not all persons who have a high genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) become symptomatic, even those
who reach extreme old age (e.g., 90+ years old). This observation suggests that genetic vulnerability to AD is
moderated by other factors. Identifying these factors, particularly those that are modifiable, could lead to
effective AD treatments and risk reduction strategies. We conjecture that peripheral chronic low-grade
inflammation is a major factor that influences expression of AD-related genes. Further, we hypothesize that
AD risk genes affect proinflammatory reactions in both peripheral and central systems that accelerate
accumulation of AD-related pathologies in the brain. This idea is supported by our recent Framingham Heart
Study (FHS) investigation of longitudinal measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) from which we derived a
threshold to define chronic low-grade inflammation (CLI) as a chronic proinflammatory burden. We found that
CLI was associated with increased risk and earlier onset of AD among APOE ε4 carriers [1]. In addition, some
AD risk genes influence both AD risk and peripheral inflammation. For example, PLXNA4 variants are
associated with AD risk [2] and PlxnA4 also has a role in inflammatory processes. The central hypothesis
for this study is that genetic vulnerability in concert with CLI has an important role in AD pathogenesis.
To test this hypothesis, we will capitalize on the comprehensively characterized FHS cohort and its associated
brain bank and prospective serial AD-related brain MRI and biomarker data to evaluate the correlation of CLI
with changes in cognition and brain structure, as well as with incident AD, up to several decades later.
Specifically, we will 1) Evaluate the association of genetic variants with AD risk in the presence of chronic
peripheral inflammation in the FHS cohort; 2) Identify blood biomarkers associated with AD among FHS
participants with AD genetic risk variants and CLI, and evaluate their correlation with AD-related brain
pathology; 3) Validate associations established in Aims 1 and 2 between AD-related peripheral and brain
inflammation in other datasets including the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium cohorts, the Alzheimer
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University, and
the Korean National Center for Research in Dementia. If we find differences in the incidence of AD based on
biomarker profiles between carriers and non-carriers of particular AD-associated genetic variants among
persons who have CLI, our study will provide rationale for the mechanisms of AD genetic risk for the disease.
We anticipate that results from this study will provide insight for developing a personalized approach for treating
and preventing AD."
10903942,"The pathologies underlying Alzheimer disease (AD) are common in the aged population and can occur more
than a decade prior to clinical symptoms. In addition, aging increases the likelihood of multiple pathologies which
may all contribute to cognitive impairment. Recent studies demonstrate that apolipoprotein E (APOE) and
classical complement pathway genes are involved in synaptic loss and tau pathology. The objective of this project
is to investigate role of APOE and complement pathway genes in determining glial, neuroinflammatory, and
neuropathological alterations that ultimately lead to altered cognitive and imaging biomarker trajectories. We
propose a cross-disciplinary approach in 3 specific aims. For Aim 1, we will determine how genetic and
transcriptional risk profiles of complement pathway genes and their interaction with APOE genotype contribute
to synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular disease, and tau pathology in AD using the entire FHS
cohort as well as within deceased FHS participants with brain donation (current number of autopsy cases is 241;
with blood and brain tissue, n=208). For Aim 2, we will determine how glial and neuroinflammatory phenotypes
associated with AD and cerebrovascular disease result in distinctive patterns of astrocytosis, microgliosis, and
neuroinflammation that lead to AD and AD-related disorders using newly defined phenotypes together with
traditional pathological measures developed in collaboration with the Neuropathology Core. For Aim 3, we will
validate clinical implications by determining associations of the identified genetic variants and alternative
transcripts and novel cellular phenotypes from Aims 1 and 2 with longitudinal changes of imaging biomarkers
and cognitive function (n=3,189) as well as with quantitative vascular risk factors (e.g., blood glucose, lipid
fractions, blood pressure, BMI, cigarette smoking). We anticipate that results from this project will provide
opportunities for developing new genetic screening markers and biomarkers and insights about potential novel
therapeutic targets for AD."

10903759,"Project Summary
In contrast to other tumor suppressors, 75% of p53 alterations in human cancers are missense mutations in the
DNA-binding domain that generate abnormally stabilized mutant proteins (‘mutp53’). The research program of
Unit Director Dr. Ute Moll’s laboratory generated new mouse models that definitively proved that certain hotspot
missense mutant p53 proteins not only lose their tumor suppressor function, but acquire broad oncogenic gain-
of-function (GOF) activities (‘mutp53GOF’). Our humanized p53R248Q knockin mice (’Q’ mice) provided the
long-sought compelling phenotype of faster onset of all spontaneously arising tumor types and significantly
shorter survival compared to p53null littermates. Importantly, our finding translates to human cancers. In Li-
Fraumeni patients harboring p53 germline mutations, the Q allele dramatically accelerates tumor onset by 10.5
years and leads to increased mortality compared to p53null-like Li-Fraumeni patients. Moreover, TCGA data
suggest that sporadic cancer patients harboring specific GOF alleles have higher death rates than patients with
p53 mutations that are functionally null. GOF contributes to malignant progression with increased proliferation,
invasion, metastasis, chemoresistance, stroma remodeling and reprogrammed metabolism. As central
translational progress, our lab also established that these mice develop strong exploitable dependency on
continued high expression of mutp53 for tumor growth, maintenance and metastasis. We showed that genetic
or pharmacologic (via Hsp90 inhibitors) ablation of mutp53 in autochthonous lymphomas and colorectal cancers
triggers strong cytotoxicity in different hotspot GOF knockin mice, translating to tumor regression, inhibition of
invasion and major gains in survival, even in the absence of wildtype p53. My research builds on these strong
pre-clinical and clinical findings to further explore mutp53GOF and its exploitability in a broader cancer context.
Given the exceptionally high frequency of TP53 mutations across all cancer types, this therapeutic concept is
highly relevant for a wide population of cancer patients. As a research Investigator in the Moll laboratory, I am
actively pursuing two areas of research. 1) I have been leading research on evaluating the therapeutic potential
of mutp53 ablation in other major sporadic carcinomas by testing autochthonous mouse models of liver and
pancreatic cancer. 2) I designed and characterized a new ‘wtp53 to mutp53 switch’ mouse strain and I lead work
identifying the molecular basis of mutp53 GOF-driven tumor formation in vivo using time-resolved ChIPseq/single
cell RNAseq and functional proteome analyses. My ultimate goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets for
mutp53 cancers. In addition to performing bench research to address these biologic and translational questions,
my responsibilities include training of postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students; technology development
for the group and oversight of the lab's infrastructure and large mouse colony. I also manage collaborations with
other groups."
10903760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The successful sequencing of the human genome and the evolution of human health services research in the
post-genomic era combined with startling advances in imaging technology have offered unprecedented
opportunities to transform patient care in cardiovascular diseases. Over the past decade, Weill Cornell Medicine
(WCM) has made major investments in biomedical research, as well as research training and infrastructure.
WCM requests support for the research training of 4 clinical and non-clinical postdoctoral fellows in a new
multidisciplinary research training program (MRTP) in Cardiovascular Disease, with WCM providing funding for
an additional training slot. The objective is to recruit outstanding candidates with solid foundations in basic
science and/or clinical research and train them to apply their knowledge and skills towards addressing important
clinically unmet needs in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases.
MRTP trainees will receive program support for 3 years during which they will follow a structured and rigorous
postdoctoral training program. The MRTP will be a joint effort of 20 eminent preceptors from WCM, Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the Rockefeller University (RU), which constitute a dense network
of collaborative researchers, who are international leaders in fields directly relevant to cardiovascular physiology
and disease. These preceptors have been organized into 2 themed, but interconnected units of research training:
molecular and cell signaling and cardiovascular imaging. These training units will enable the development of
content-specific educational programming, as well as increase the efficiency administration within the training
program. Oversight will be provided by a Research Training Executive Committee consisting of the Program
Director and two Associate Program Directors, who will also serve as leaders of the training units, as well as 3
additional members who will provide specific guidance on clinical/epidemiologic research, on achieving and
maintaining diversity within the training program, and on mentoring. We have also assembled an outstanding
roster of internal and external advisory board members with a mandate to evaluate the program and provide
specific recommendations to improve both its quality and efficiency. The MRTP's highly personalized training
program will include 1) individual development plans; 2) rigorous research training; 3) hands-on experience in
cutting-edge methodologies; and 4) an integrated curriculum. Trainees will further benefit from the extensive
institutional resources of WCM, MSKCC and RU. Based upon the levels of interest in our fellowship programs,
we anticipate a substantial pool of highly qualified clinical and non-clinical candidates for the proposed MRTP,
which will maintain a strong diversity focus. Through its rigorous, structured and highly personalized curriculum,
this new training program seeks to train future leaders in cardiovascular disease research who are prepared to
translate their findings towards improving patient care."

10903935,"Project Summary
In this project we propose to develop a benchtop cryogen-free 23.5-T high-temperature superconducting (HTS)
magnet for 1-GHz microcoil nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Higher-field magnet offers better
resolution and sensitivity, enabling analysis of larger molecules like complex proteins, however currently
available ≥1-GHz NMR magnets are very expensive and require a vast installation site, limiting ≥1-GHz NMR
spectroscopy to a few labs in the world. A benchtop microcoil NMR magnet by definition is compact and thus its
cost will be less by nearly an order of magnitude than that of the standard NMR magnet, and placeable on a
workbench. Also, LHe-free operation enables the user to be independent from a cooling source in short supply.
As a preliminary work (R21GM129688), we have completed a 12.5-mm-cold-bore HTS REBCO magnet
prototype and successfully operated it up to 25 T at 10 K cooled by a cryocooler only, without liquid helium,
verifying our high-field REBCO magnet design with the proposed screening-current reduction method. Based on
these preliminary results and pioneering design concept, we will first design and build a cryogen-free, shielded
all-REBCO 23.5-T/25-mm-RT-bore magnet having a 5-gauss fringe field radius of 1.5 m, and then convert this
non-NMR-field 23.5-T magnet to a benchtop 1-GHz microcoil NMR magnet having a high homogeneity of <0.1
ppm over a 5-mm-diameter, 10-mm-length cylindrical volume. We also intend to use an in-house built NMR
probe to demonstrate the proposed magnet. This benchtop magnet will incorporate all the innovative design and
operation concepts validated by the prototype magnet in our preliminary R21 program: 1) all-HTS composition
and operation at above 4.2 K cooled only by a cryocooler, the first ever >4.2-K operation among all ultra-high-
field superconducting magnets; 2) extremely-thin-copper-layered no-Insulation winding technique that makes a
REBCO magnet very compact, mechanically robust, and self-protecting; 3) a single coil formation that leads,
compared with the traditional multi-nested high-field NMR magnet, to simpler and more affordable manufacturing
processes; 4) operational temperature-controlled screening-current reduction method which reduces peak
stresses within the REBCO coil and field errors; and 5) cryogenic design for conduction-cooling operation. We
intend to adopt a passive shielding by using iron to reduce the 5-gauss radius within 1.5 m. To achieve a target
field homogeneity, we will adopt three—superconducting, ferromagnetic, and room-temperature—shimming
technique which will be complemented by our 1.3-GHz/54-mm high-resolution NMR magnet, currently under
development at the FBML, for which we are developing innovative field-shimming techniques. We envision this
benchtop cryogen-free 1-GHz microcoil NMR magnet will become a very powerful and affordable research tool
for the NMR based structural biology community who eagerly anticipates higher operating frequencies. We
believe that the enabling technologies of our proposed benchtop magnet is poised to lead HTS magnet
technology to liquid-helium-free >1-GHz NMR magnets."
10903937,"Abstract
A hallmark of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is the unpredictable variation in individual health response from those
who are asymptomatic to those with life-threatening and refractory respiratory illness, and finally those with long
lasting symptoms, here defined as Long COVID. The core symptoms of Long COVID are remarkably like chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) with multisystem complaints including debilitating fatigue, fluctuating heart rate and
headache. In CFS, an infectious trigger has been suspected but not proven and onset often follows flu-like
symptoms. As disease mechanisms are not understood, the treatment options are currently symptomatic.
Between 0.2-0.4% of the population suffer from CFS. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the biological
mechanisms and risk factors for Long COVID and test the hypothesis that Long COVID is a subtype of chronic
fatigue syndrome. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we will use data from three different biobanks, a Long
COVID genetics working group we have built and through a CFS consortium. In Aim 1, we will examine genetic
risk factors and comorbidities through the Long COVID working group comprising 46 cohorts and over 1.5 million
individuals. In addition, we will do a meta-analysis of CFS across three Biobanks (N = 740,000). This analysis
will elucidate the connection between CFS and Long COVID and identify risk variants for both diseases. In Aim
2, we will explore contribution from immune molecules that fine tune response to pathogens. The immune
defense relies on specific cells to prevent infection or to destroy viral and bacterial agents and the body's own
infected cells alike. This aim will examine if the genetic variants that protect from infections, COVID-19, or
comorbidities, predispose to Long COVID. We will specifically focus on those regions that have large explanatory
power such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in addition to exploring associations genome-wide at
established COVID-19 loci. This aim will reveal which immune traits increase risk or protect from Long COVID
and CFS, elucidating the type of immune responses responsible for disease development. In Aim 3, we will
estimate heritability and shared genetic vs. environmental risk. We will estimate the proportion of environmental
and genetic factors behind CFS and Long COVID through analysis of siblings, twins, and the general population
in FinnGen and UK Biobank. This aim distinguishes the risk contribution from environmental risk and genetics in
the context of a shared environment providing insight into the strength of shared environmental vs. genetic
factors that are needed for disease development. The proposed work elucidates risk factors and comorbidities
that contribute to CFS and Long COVID including the possibly shared disease etiology, symptomatology, and
comorbidity. The project provides biological insights for future disease treatment and facilitates early disease
diagnosis."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Developmental Core is the driving force of the DC CFAR mission to intensify our multi-institutional effort to
promote and support research that contributes to ending the HIV epidemic in Washington, DC and beyond in
partnership with government and community. The Core has been led by a highly experienced team of senior
HIV researchers since the inception of the CFAR in 2010: Drs. Michael Bukrinsky (GW, Director), Sylvia Silver
(GW, Co-Director) and Anthony Wutoh (HU, Co-Director). The Specific Aims of the Core are: 1) to promote
and support innovative, collaborative and multidisciplinary HIV research that is pertinent to the epidemic in
Washington, DC through the Pilot Awards, Transitioning Investigator and microgrants programs; 2) to lead a
dynamic mentoring program for early stage and transitioning HIV investigators with an emphasis on women
and underrepresented minorities; and 3) to provide educational and networking activities that promote
multidisciplinary and cross-institutional collaboration in HIV research.
Since 2010, the Developmental Core has reviewed 165 pilot award applications and funded 63 for $2.8M. Pilot
awards granted from 2010-2016 for $1.3M have resulted in $11.2M in new NIH grants representing a 761%
return on investment. Fifty-six percent of all DC CFAR pilot award recipients have been women and 23% have
been underrepresented minorities. Since 2018, the Core has reviewed eight applications from non-HIV R01-
funded transitioning investigators, funding two for $200,000, and has awarded 36 microgrants for $68K since
2010. The Core's mentoring, educational and training programs complement the awards program by providing
comprehensive support to DC-based HIV researchers including individualized Core services, grantwriting
workshops, mentoring workshops, specific aims reviews, journal club webinars, networking opportunities and
citywide research seminars."
10904978,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
The innovation of our research proposal focuses on three main areas: 1) primary prevention; 2) screening; and
3) personalized medicine. Currently, several studies in the US and Africa have demonstrated that HIV-1 infection
increases the risk of lifetime cancer risk, particularly lung cancer. The etiology of lung cancer among HIV-1
infected individuals is unknown, but of great importance given the number of individuals who live infected with
HIV-1. Here we will investigate potential risk factors for lung cancer such as geospatial residence, indoor and
outdoor air quality, and smoking behavior to better understand the underlying risk factors. This general
knowledge will serve to develop primary prevention programs designed to reduce adverse exposures thus
lowering the onset of lung cancer disease. Beyond primary prevention, our proposal will assess clinical features
associated with lung cancer risk and progression among those infected by HIV-1. This will provide the opportunity
to develop screening programs based on HIV-1 infection status thus detecting disease at an earlier phase and
decreasing the overall mortality. For example, TB may present as lung nodules during chest x-rays and patients
who actually have lung cancer have a delay in the diagnosis of lung cancer and life-saving treatments.
Understanding this relationship will better enable physicians and health providers to provide comprehensive
screening. Lastly, our proposal will expand the concept of personalized medicine by providing a descriptive
analysis of somatic genomic mutations among lung cancer cases infected with HIV-1. This will provide the basis
to examine for differences and provide optimal care under current guidelines."
10904979,"ABSTRACT – Project 2
We will assess molecular risks and co-incidence of lung cancer, HIV and accelerated aging as a factor in lung
cancer incidence and progression in HIV infected patients. We will define the somatic mutations of lung cancer,
link them to HIV subtype and explore the hypothesized role of DNA methylome aging in HIV- infected versus
uninfected individuals as an associative factor that could potentially be utilized as a future biomarker to predict
likelihood of lung cancer development or disease progression. These data will provide the first comprehensive
assessment of somatic mutation burden in East African lung cancer, which will guide access to therapeutically
effective agents to target actionable lung cancer mutations. These will be linked to risk factors associated with
HIV including immunosuppression, immune protection, and accelerated aging that may increase the risk of
cancer in HIV+ individuals. These will help to discern whether epidemiological factors from Project 1 can project
risk for lung cancer at the molecular level and whether, together, we can identify prominent factors linking
epidemiologic risk, HIV-1 infection, and lung cancer in East Africa."
10904917,"Many fundamental cellular functions depend on a variety of RNA structures conserved through evolution, and
other functional RNA structures are expected to be discovered. A signature of a conserved RNA structure is
found in alignments where paired positions display correlated substitutions (covariation) that preserve the base
pair. This evolutionary signal can be used both to predict RNA structure and to identify new conserved RNAs.
 Recent publications and preliminary results have made three important advances: A statistical covariation
test that identiﬁes signiﬁcant covariation over background covariation due to phylogeny. This test, implemented
in a method called R-scape (RNA Structural Covariation Above Phylogenetic Expectation), provides information
and control over the rate of false positive predictions. A power of covariation calculation, recently published,
that identiﬁes “negative” pairs with power (variation) but insigniﬁcant covariation, unlikely to form RNA base pairs.
A new cascading folding algorithm, named CaCoFold (Cascade covariation/variation Constrained Folding)
also recently published, that combines all positive and negative evolutionary information into complex structures
including all types of pseudoknots and triplets. In human, the efﬁcacy of these advances has been tested by ac-
curately predicting the structures of the human non-coding RNAs MALAT1 and telomerase RNA, and by inferring
that the non-coding RNAs HOTAIR and XIST do not have a conserved structure.
 These three advances give us a competitive advantage to perform unbiased genome-wide screens for con-
served structural RNAs in vertebrates with accurate 3D structure prediction. Previous vertebrate screens
for structural RNAs have been hindered by thousand of false positive predictions. In contrast, our new covariation
statistical test allows for controlling the rate of false positives. R-scape has already been used to ﬁnd struc-
tural RNAs in bacteria and viruses. Our recent eukaryotic pilot screen in fungi has identiﬁed 17 novel structural
RNAs. We hypothesize that many structural RNAs with implications for human health and disease are still to be
discovered, and that we now have the tools to ﬁnd and characterize these RNAs.
 This proposal has three speciﬁc aims that will advance the study of structural RNA biology, and the discov-
ery of novel biological mechanisms involving RNA structures. The ﬁrst aim proposes systematic genome-wide
searches to ﬁnd novel conserved vertebrate RNA structures in human. The second aim proposes to combine
revolutionary 3D structure prediction methods in machine learning with the signals used by CaCoFold into a
state of the art RNA folding method for the accurate prediction of 3D RNA structures. The third aim introduces a
method to identify RNA structures in ultra conserved vertebrate UTRs where there is no covariation signal,
and our current method lacks power. We expect our work will unveil primate-speciﬁc novel regulatory mecha-
nisms. Novel human RNA structures found to have causal variants associated with disease will be prioritized for
experimental veriﬁcation."
10901411,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most commonly inherited kidney disease in the
world. It is characterized by large fluid-filled cysts that disrupt kidney function, eventually leading to end stage
kidney disease. Previous literature indicates that kidney resident macrophages (KRM) are cyst-associated in
human clinical samples and are also found in cystic regions of ADPKD mouse models. KRM accelerate ADPKD
as depletion of KRM reduces cystic index and disease progression in mouse models of the disease. Together,
these data suggest that targeting KRM may have a clinical impact in patients. Unfortunately, it is currently not
feasible to give patients macrophage depleting agents for long periods as these compounds lack specificity,
depleting macrophage populations in multiple tissues. This is an important point as macrophages perform critical
functions as part of an organism’s innate immune defense. Additionally, ADPKD progresses slowly and patients
experience gradual cyst growth and loss of kidney function over several decades of life, thereby requiring long-
term intervention. These data highlight that alternative approaches for long-term, kidney-specific resident
macrophage depletion are desperately needed. In this application, I propose to study niche filling as a means to
achieve long term, kidney specific resident macrophage depletion. This will be achieved by determining the
mechanism of KRM niche filling after temporary depletion and through identification of factors, such as Cx3cr1,
that we propose are critical for KRM niche filling. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that following
temporary depletion, the KRM niche is repopulated via the recruitment and differentiation of bone marrow-
derived Ly6chi monocytes and that this process requires Cx3cr1. In Aim 1, I will map out the kinetics and
mechanism of KRM niche after temporary depletion in a mouse model of ADPKD. In Aim 2, I will test if loss of
Cx3cr1 in monocytes is able to delay KRM niche filling and the progression of cystic disease. My long-term goal
is to understand the mechanism of KRM niche filling and translationally apply KRM-centric findings to clinical
cases of ADPKD."
10904720,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is one of the greatest contributors to low back pain, yet how the IVD can
generate pain remains poorly understood. To date, our knowledge of “cross-talk” between degenerating IVD and
sensory nerves involved in transmitting pain is limited to findings of altered protein and RNA expression in tissues
of the IVD, the spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Recent advances in the imaging of sensory neuron
activation via recording of Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent indicators, together with pre-clinical models of IVD
degeneration, now enable the study of temporal and spatial changes in neuronal function and their “cross-talk”
to changes in the degenerating IVD.
 We propose to evaluate action potential-driven Ca2+ transients and molecular changes in sensory
neurons in a mouse model of injury-induced IVD degeneration. In Specific Aim 1, we will document
temporal changes to pain-related behaviors and sensitivity in Thy1-GCaMP6s mice following puncture of a
lumbar IVD to induce IVD degeneration. These mice carry a transgene for the calcium-sensitive fluorophore,
GCaMP6s, that is expressed in sensory nerves of the DRG. We will also evaluate the presence of neuronal
markers and key ion channels in innervating DRGs, and anatomic changes and nerve fiber infiltration in IVDs,
to test for changes with IVD degeneration as compared to sham controls. This work will document molecular
changes to IVD and DRGs for this model from 6 to 52 weeks of IVD degeneration, and test for relationships
between injured IVD and the innervating lumbar DRGs as a first measure of “cross-talk.” In Specific Aim 2, we
will evaluate action potential-driven Ca2+ transients in lumbar DRG neurons in the IVD degeneration model of
Specific Aim 1. We will record Ca2+ transients in intact DRG of Thy1-GCaMP6s mice in vitro following electric
field stimulation, and measure threshold voltage, 50% maximum (IC50), and numbers of responding DRG
neurons and their nearest neighbor response. DRGs will also be tested before and after incubation with sodium
channel blockers to screen for remodeling of specific ion channel function with periods of IVD degeneration. Our
goal is to identify temporal and spatial changes in DRG function and “cross-talk” with changes of IVD
degeneration. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate sensory stimuli-induced responses in the DRG of
living mice using in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Working with 2-photon confocal microscopy and motion
correction algorithms developed for brain imaging, we will identify the threshold response of DRG neurons in
Thy1-GCaMP6s mice with and without IVD degeneration, following in vivo stimulation of brush, pinch, heat and
cold. Our goal is to test for relationships between in vivo activation of lumbar DRG neurons with behavioral and
sensitivity changes following onset of IVD degeneration. Completion of this study would identify functional
changes to sensory neurons at sites distant to the degenerated IVD and reveal new information about IVD-
nervous system “cross-talk” that may suggest novel interventions for treatment of discogenic pain."
10904924,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and youth who are cyberbullied are twice as
likely to exhibit suicidal thoughts and behaviors as those who are not cyberbullied. Cyberbullying (CB) is
strongly associated with suicidal ideation, a phenomenon known to fluctuate rapidly, which suggests need to
intervene proximally to instances of CB to reduce suicide risk. There is public health need to reduce suicide
risk among cyberbullied adolescents, especially underserved adolescents (i.e., youth from minority
backgrounds) who face higher rates of CB and suicidal thoughts and behavior. Yet, current interventions are
limited in their capacity to meet the needs of underserved youth and to intervene in moments of high
vulnerability. The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide
the applicant, a behavioral health scientist and clinical social worker, with the skills necessary to bridge the gap
between CB intervention and suicide prevention with stakeholder-informed and empirically driven digital
interventions for adolescents. To accomplish this long-term goal, a multidisciplinary training plan will provide
the applicant with expertise in: (1) design, conduct, and analysis of online clinical trials; (2) theory, research,
and methods of adolescent CB assessment and intervention; and (3) methods of enhancing underserved
adolescents’ utilization of digital interventions using human centered design (HCD) and brief motivational
interventions. The applicant will receive mentoring in a strong multidisciplinary environment with accomplished
experts in the fields of adolescent suicide prevention, CB research, HCD, and online clinical trials. Formal
training and coursework will advance training in clinical trial design and conduct (ethics and social media-
based recruitment), and analysis (mediation and moderation analysis and evaluation of machine learning [ML]
models for clinical trials), CB research, and methods for enhancing engagement (HCD and motivational
interviewing). A complementary research plan will focus on development and testing of imHere4U, a just-in-
time, suicide prevention intervention for cyberbullied adolescents. Based on pilot data suggesting acceptability
of imHere4U among cyberbullied youth, parents, and professionals, we propose three aims. Aim 1:
Cyberbullied adolescents (N=20; >35% underserved) will participate in iterative design to optimize a digital
product for their needs. Aim 2: Recently cyberbullied adolescents (N=80; >35% underserved) will participate in
an online RCT testing imHere4U plus Questionnaires of online interactions vs. Questionnaires alone. Aim 3:
We will examine the feasibility of using a ML algorithm to deliver feedback to adolescents on their supportive
and bullying online interactions. This trial will test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of imHere4U, essential
data for a subsequent R01 application to test imHere4U’s efficacy within a larger sample and dissemination
outcomes. Results from this investigation are expected to lead to an efficacious intervention that fills a critical
gap in service delivery by intervening when and where CB occurs to prevent adolescent suicide risk."
10904935,"Project Summary
Neuropathic pain afflicts well over half of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Current treatments for MS
were designed to delay motor symptom progression, but do not address MS associated neuropathic pain
(MSNP). This is due in part to a lack of understanding about the underlying mechanisms that drive MSNP. The
pathophysiology of MS includes proinflammatory microglial activation that is recapitulated in the experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Both pharmacological inhibition and genetic
knockout of microglia-specific proteins prevented the development of or suppressed established neuropathic
pain behaviors in non-MS models of neuropathic pain. These studies indicate that microglia activation mediates
the behavioral signs of MSNP. Fingolimod is an FDA approved MS drug that reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia
in several rodent models of chronic pain, including peripheral neuropathic pain; however, the site and mechanism
of antiallodynic action of fingolimod in central neuropathic pain, e.g., MSNP, remains unknown. Our laboratory
reported that repeated administration of intraperitoneal fingolimod attenuated neuropathic pain-like behaviors in
EAE, and these effects could be blocked by sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) antagonists or
mimicked S1PR1 agonists. Our results raised the idea that fingolimod acts as an agonist at S1PR1 to elicit
antiallodynic effects in EAE.
Fingolimod reduces microglial activation in MS and primary cell culture. Because Gi-GPCR activation in microglia
inhibits or blocks inflammation, and S1PR1 is a Gi-GPCR, I propose the overall hypothesis that fingolimod
leads to S1PR1 activation and subsequent microglial inhibition that explains its anti-allodynic effects in EAE.
Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that spinal microglia-dependent mechanisms maintain MSNP. I will deplete
microglia in the whole CNS or spinal cord (Aim 1.1/1.2) and chemogenetically inhibit spinal microglia (Aim 1.3)
in EAE mice. I predict that each approach will attenuate EAE-induced allodynia. Specific Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that the spinal S1PR1 agonist actions of fingolimod reverse MSNP behavior through inhibition of EAE
induced activation of pro-inflammatory microglia. Aim 2.1 predicts that intrathecal injection of fingolimod will
reduce EAE-induced allodynia, and that this can be blocked by pre-administration of S1PR1 antagonists. Aim
2.2 predicts fingolimod will stimulate spinal G-protein coupling (assessed with in situ [35S]GTPγS binding assays)
that is blocked with S1PR1 antagonists and increased in EAE, indicating an S1PR1 dependent mechanism that
allows fingolimod to exert greater analgesic actions in EAE compared to controls. Aim 2.3 predicts that knockout
of S1PR1 on microglia will prevent the antiallodynic effects of intrathecal fingolimod and S1PR1 agonists in EAE.
This would indicate that fingolimod mediates MSNP through a microglial S1PR1-dependent mechanism."
10904945,"The Columbia University Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) Resource and Coordinating Center (RCC) has
been highly successful in coordinating SOBC research efforts, developing digital tools to promote the
experimental medicine approach, and disseminating SOBC research practices and products. We now propose
to expand on the tools we have developed, to create novel opportunities for basic and applied/clinical science to
converge on mechanisms of behavior change. Further, we will continue to serve as a hub for scientists within
and outside the SOBC Network to collect, organize, evaluate, discuss, and disseminate rigorous behavioral
science. In close collaboration with NIH and the SOBC Network we will:
-Expand the SOBC Measures Repository to include both intervention materials and measures of
behavioral outcomes—alongside measures of mechanisms. Open the Repository for curation by all
scientists, and promote self-sustaining user engagement through delivery of digital tools to (a)
organize constructs into visual taxonomies and (b) leverage systematic review data to identify novel
opportunities for mechanistic research. Rapidly test and optimize Repository tools and features.
-Bring basic and applied/clinical scientists together to promote discovery and improve measurement
tools and practices, through collaboration, research syntheses, and support of pilot research.
-Conduct outreach and dissemination of the SOBC experimental medicine approach and mechanistic
research broadly, through drafting and disseminating best practice guidelines, and developing tools
for incorporating and communicating mechanisms-focused research. We will also continue to create
engaging conference workshops, webinars, educational video/web/podcast content, and engage with
national and international scientific organizations through meetings and joint communications.
-Integrate SOBC with related efforts, and detail the role of SOBC/early phase mechanism-focused
optimization in the ORBIT framework, NIH Stage Model, and the RE-AIM model.
-Conduct systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of the behavior change literature, to test the
impact of applying the experimental medicine approach on research products, and to identify
additional potential targets for future validation or research.
The SOBC program has begun a profound shift in how behavioral scientists think about behavior
change. Over the past 5 years, we played a key role in shaping the SOBC message and building tools to
help researchers apply it. Now we propose to ensure its lasting impact by making those tools more
rigorous, intuitive, and usable—and by making them accessible to the broader field. Our goal is to make
the case for behavioral science to adopt the experimental medicine approach by showing that it
improves research impact, and by making adoption so simple that it becomes the default approach."

Gap junction channels are critical to vision by maintaining homeostasis in the lens and propagating electrical
signals in the retina. Age-related stress and genetic mutations in connexins 46 and 50 (Cx46/50) in the lens and
connexin 36 (Cx36) in the retina have been linked to cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathies. Despite their vital
importance to vision biology, we still lack effective pharmacological tools to elucidate the physiological and
pathophysiological roles of gap junctions and their potential as therapeutic targets. Current small molecule
modulators of gap junctions lack potency and isoform specificity, often interacting with and inhibiting other ion
channels, eliciting unwanted off-target effects. Drug development has been slow in this field due to the lack of
high-resolution structures of gap junctions in complex with a drug-like molecule. Recent advances in single
particle Cryo-EM have enabled us to solve the structures of ion channels to near-atomic resolution and capture
inhibitor-bound states. The Aims of this proposal will leverage these recent advances, in combination with
fragment antigen-binding (Fab) technologies to deconvolute the mechanism of inhibitory action against native
heteromeric gap junctions. To glean insight into the selectivity potential of gap junction inhibitors, this proposal
will target the structural effects of mefloquine (MFQ) against the major gap junctions in the visual system. MFQ
is one of the few drugs that exhibits gap junction selectivity against Cx50 and Cx36 isoforms. Remarkably, MFQ
does not show appreciable binding to the highly related isoform, Cx46. In Aim 1, I will resolve the atomic
structures of homomeric Cx36 and Cx50 in complex with MFQ. Comparative analysis to structures of Cx46 and
Cx26 (no binding) and Cx43 (semi-inhibitory) will be used to identify interactions that are critical for MFQ
selectivity and drive structure-guided mutation studies to validate the selectivity mechanism in vitro. Remarkably,
MFQ inhibits native heteromeric gap junction channels composed of Cx46/50. In Aim 2, I will utilize high-affinity
Fabs to identify co-assembly patterns of native mammalian lens gap junctions in the presence of MFQ to
understand how this inhibition is achieved, and potentially elucidate the proposed cooperativity. Mechanistic
insights garnered from these works will aid in designing the next generation of gap junction pharmacological
probes to better understand the precise roles of gap junctions in vision health and disease."
10901480,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious public health problem with modest treatment response,
which may, in part, be due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation. One way to improve these clinical
outcomes is to investigate the role of particular features of MDD that are tied to specific pathogenic
mechanisms - work that would help identify novel and focal treatment targets. Psychomotor disturbance (e.g.,
agitation [PmA] and retardation [PmR]) is a particularly significant feature of MDD as it relates to more severe
depression and worse treatment response. However, traditional assessment approaches of psychomotor
disturbance (e.g., self- and observer-reports) are limited as they (a) miss less overt, but relevant abnormalities,
and (b) are susceptible to bias. A more promising approach is using motoric features of the voice extracted
from standardized speech tasks. These vocal motor features are promising indicators of psychomotor
disturbances in MDD as they are objective, non-intrusive, mediated by neural circuits involved in coordinated
motor control, computed automatically, and easily assessed in the “real-world” (and thus able to be used in
real-time mobile assessments and treatments).
 Aim 1 of this proposal is therefore to test whether vocal indicators of PmR (speech rate) and PmA
(variability in speech rate) (a) are abnormal in MDD and (b) can be measured naturalistically by participants
talking into their smartphones “outside of the lab.” Aim 2 will test the validity of vocal motor measures as
indicators of psychomotor disturbance by evaluating their association with mechanistically relevant measures
of PmA and PmR (i.e., laboratory instrumental measures, actigraphy, EEG/ERPs). Aim 3 will follow-up
subjects two times over 12 months to evaluate whether motor symptoms (as assessed by the voice) change in
tandem with overall depressive symptoms and social and role functioning over time; and/or whether baseline
PmR/PmA predicts course of depression and functioning. Finding that motor and overall depression severity
co-vary over time, or that the motor variables predict subsequent change in overall depression severity is
particularly clinically significant as it would support the potential clinical utility of the proposed novel, reliable,
and easily administered motor assessments.
 To test these aims, the proposed project will recruit individuals (age 18-45) with current MDD (n = 100),
remitted MDD (n = 100) and controls (n = 50). Including a remitted MDD group is particularly significant as it
will provide evidence that psychomotor disturbance is independent of acute depressive symptoms, and allows
us to explore whether vocal indicators of PmR and/or PmA predict relapse (in the remitted MDD group) and/or
remission (in the current MDD group). In sum, the present proposal has the potential to identify novel, easily
assessed, cheap, and scalable treatment markers of psychomotor disturbance – work that will ultimately
improve the monitoring and treatment of a devastating and prevalent psychiatric condition."

Alcohol-associated Liver Disease (ALD)-related mortality rates have increased 23% in the United States since
2019. While there remain concurrent increases in both the prevalence and mortality from alcohol misuse, patients
have no therapeutic options outside from liver transplantation. Despite what is known about the pathogenesis of
ALD, the mechanisms underlying the acceleration across the spectrum of liver disease remain poorly
understood. It is known that patients with progressive ALD have progressive scarring of the liver and is the main
predictor of patient outcomes. Excessive tissue scarring is characterized by highly cross-linked extracellular
matrix (ECM) in response to injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the tissue resident fibroblast, play a key role in
the initiation, progression, and resolution of liver fibrosis by transdifferentiating into activated myofibroblasts that
secrete ECM in response to chronic injury, yet the mechanisms involved in HSC transdifferentiation are not well
characterized. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate novel mechanisms of alcohol-induced fibrotic gene
reprogramming in the liver and identify specific factors amplifying HSC activation in the diseased liver. While the
uncontrolled regulation of Wnt/-catenin signaling is a hallmark of various hepatic pathologies including liver
cancer, there are limited studies investigating alcohol exposure on canonical -catenin activation in specifically
HSCs. Importantly, in canonical -catenin-dependent pathways, the association and release of the yes-
associated protein-1 (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator (TAZ) (YAP/TAZ) from the -catenin destruction complex
occurs in human embryonic kidney cells, yet it remains unknown if the convergence of these pathways occur in
HSCs to drive their transdifferentiation in models of ALD. Our preliminary in vitro data show increased expression
of -catenin and the transducers of Wnts, Frizzled (Fzd) receptors 1, 2, and 7, during spontaneous activation in
primary mouse HSCs. Despite this knowledge, the exact role of Wnts driving the pathogenesis of fibrosis in
models of ALD remain unclear. Our working hypothesis is that alcohol increases the expression of Wnts,
leading to Wnt-dependent canonical -catenin activation, via YAP/TAZ, to promote hepatic stellate cell
activation and production of ECM during the early pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in ALD. To test this, in
Aim 1 we will determine if canonical Wnt ligands promote HSC transdifferentiation, in ex vivo models of alcohol
exposure. Following treatment with ethanol and exogenous Wnt ligands, we will characterize HSC activation and
fibrotic gene expression. We will then define if ethanol exposure impacts the sequestration and association of
YAP/TAZ in the -catenin destruction complex to promote HSC transdifferentiation. In Aim 2, we will characterize
the role of canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs using wild-type (C57BL/6J) and LRP6 knockout mice after ethanol
exposure to measure primary outcomes related to hepatic fibrosis by gene and protein expression."

 This project is a novel study of psoriasis in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Although clinical
observations and existing literature contend that psoriasis is a common skin condition in DS, there is no
supportive population-based research. Studies exploring disease severity and treatments are limited to case
reports or small case series. There is likely an immunologic basis for this association: interferon (IFN) gamma
is believed to be a significant cause of psoriasis and individuals with DS often have a hyperactive IFN pathway
due to the triplication of chromosome 21. Improving our understanding of psoriasis in people with DS is
paramount. We need to better understand the burden of disease across the age range, capture disease
severity, and evaluate medical management.
 Psoriasis is not a condition limited to the skin, but rather a disease of systemic inflammation associated
with multiple comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular disease and cardiometabolic risk factors including
obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Recent guidelines by the
American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have identified psoriasis as an enhanced
risk-inducing factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although these cardiovascular associations
have been well established in the general population, the link between cardiometabolic risk and cardiovascular
disease in individuals with DS and psoriasis is unknown. This potential association between psoriasis and
cardiometabolic health is of particular interest since individuals with DS are considered protected against
cardiovascular disease. Could psoriasis be an exception to the presumed resiliency in people with DS or reveal
an exception to the established elevated risk in the general population? Either association would promote
further investigation into the immunology and pathophysiology behind the association and prompt reevaluation
of cardiovascular monitoring and medical management in patients with DS and psoriasis.
 To investigate this hypothesis, we propose utilizing Epic Cosmos, the largest integrated data platform of
clinical health information in the United States with records from over 96,000 individuals with DS and
approximately 2,000 patients with DS and psoriasis. We will use Epic Cosmos to 1) Evaluate the
demographics, occurrence, treatment, and severity of psoriasis in DS patients and 2) Determine the
association of cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular events in DS patients with psoriasis and without.
Skin conditions in DS should be considered a window into systemic health. We will establish the importance of
thinking beyond “the visible” by examining cutaneous disorders, such as psoriasis, for their greater systemic
impact. The innovative use of Cosmos will advance a novel and important translational methodology that can
be leveraged for future projects within the DS research community."

 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal urologic malignancies with approximately 81,800
new cases and 15,000 deaths estimated in 2023. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) along with melanoma has
traditionally been viewed as an immunotherapy responsive disease with a storied history of immunotherapy
treatments including high dose interleukin 2 (IL2), interferon, and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Indeed, RCC
was one of the first tumor types to garner FDA approval for PD1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). However,
unlike melanoma, most RCC tumors do not have a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) to potentially explain
their immunotherapy responsiveness. We and others have sought to explain this unanswered question and
have demonstrated that non-canonical tumor associated antigens like endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) may in
part explain ICI response in RCC. Nonetheless, ERV expression is unlikely to fully explain ccRCC ICI response
and only 25% of RCC patients respond to single-agent ICI. Therefore, further enhancing ICI response will be
clinically meaningful.
 A collaboration between the Kim and Dominguez labs has uncovered another potentially robust source
of tumor associated antigens - retained introns. We have noted that ccRCC tumors have the highest level of
retained introns (RI) across all TCGA tumors, that RI levels are secondary to suppressed non-sense mediated
decay (NMD) activity, and that one can subset ccRCC into RI-high and normal-like tumors. Moreover, we have
found that mTOR signaling plays a key role in regulating NMD and intron retention and that mTOR inhibition
can promote intron retention. Finally, our preliminary data demonstrates, in a clinical dataset, that ICI
responsive tumors are enriched in a RI-high phenotype. In this proposal we will assess how NMD is regulated
in ccRCC (Aim 1), determine the impact of suppressed NMD on ccRCC tumorigenicity (Aim 2), and determine
the impact of NMD suppression and resultant enhanced intron retention on the tumor immune
microenvironment and ICI response (Aim 3). Successful completion of our proposal will establish sound
scientific premise for combining two FDA approved RCC therapies (mTOR inhibition and ICI) to promote
expression of highly foreign neoantigens from retained introns (neo-RI-antigens), which should provoke a
robust, antigen-driven immune response that can be leveraged to enhance immune checkpoint blockade."

The development of microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents is one of the biggest public health issues of the
21st century. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) cause more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections in the
U.S. each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. The principal ways of antibiotic resistance
development are related to the intrinsic bacteria’s ability to evolve rapidly through mutations to either modify
these targets or the pathways for their synthesis, alter or degrade the antibiotic, or pump the antibiotic out of the
cell. Moreover, of critical importance is that all of these resistance mechanisms are encoded by antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs), which are stable molecules encoded in the DNA and can be passed to daughter cells
or transported by horizontal gene transfer to neighboring pathogens. Despite tremendous efforts utilizing a wide
range of antibiotic discovery platform strategies, their success has been at best incremental. Therefore, there is
a critical need to develop effective approaches to simultaneously eliminate both ARB and ARGs. Recently, the
use of nanomaterials with antimicrobial activity has been explored as a new alternative against ARB and ARGs.
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been reported to have myriad applications as antimicrobial agents. In
addition, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is also a feasible strategy to eliminate ARB and ARGs. The remarkable
features of AgNPs such as large surface area, capability to carry and release Ag+ ions, and ability to modulate
the microbial influx/efflux pumps; and PDI like efficient generation of ROS and the fact that does not generate
further resistance make these treatment modalities a promising alternative for the inactivation of ARB and ARGs.
We hypothesize that by combining both approaches, PDI and AgNPs, in the same platform a synergistic effect
to eliminate ARB and destroy ARGs will be achieved. The main goal of this project is to develop a light-activated
silver nanoparticulate system for the effective treatment of ARB and ARGs. This project consists of three aims:
in Aim 1, we will synthesize and characterize protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-loaded AgNPs. This aim will demonstrate
that fabricating a rationally designed AgNP platform will enable a large payload of PpIX to be carried in a stable
formulation with tunable surface properties. For Aim 2, we will investigate the chemical and colloidal stability of
PpIX-AgNP materials under different culture medium and light irradiation conditions. This aim will provide key
information for the optimization of the platform and the influence of the environment on the generation of ROS
and Ag+ ions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will study the antimicrobial efficacy of PpIX-AgNPs against a panel of ARB,
the ARGs degradation kinetics and the nanoparticles cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. The information obtained
in this aim will allow us to move forward this platform to therapeutic applications."

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common human sarcoma and typically arises from the
stomach or small intestine. The cancer generally has a single mutation, either in KIT or PDGFRA. Imatinib
and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that attack the oncoproteins associated with these mutated genes are
effective, but resistance develops around 18 months and cure is rare. There are no other effective
treatments so new therapeutic approaches are needed. Over the last 13 years, we have extensively
studied the immune response to GIST in a genetically engineered “knockin” mouse model and over 300
fresh human GIST surgical specimens. To investigate the antitumor immune response in greater depth,
we have just performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 50,000 intratumoral immune cells from tumors
of mice that were treated with vehicle or imatinib. We discovered that gdT cells are enriched in the tumor
compared with blood and spleen. We have preliminary data that gdT cells suppress GIST growth in vivo,
at least in part due to IL-17 secretion. Furthermore, imatinib therapy enhanced their IL-17 production. We
also found that gdT cells infiltrate human GIST and they produce IL-17, similar to the mouse model. The
importance of gdT cells in human GIST, or any sarcoma for that matter, is unknown. We have preliminary
data that the presence of gdT cells correlates positively with overall survival in GIST patients. We
hypothesize that gdT cells play a critical role in the antitumor immune response to GIST and can be
manipulated for therapeutic efficacy. In this proposal, we will investigate the importance of gdT cells in
mouse and human GIST by first defining the mechanism of gdT cell suppression of murine GIST. Next, we
will determine how imatinib affects intratumoral gdT cells in murine GIST. Interestingly, unsupervised
clustering of the single-cell RNA expression revealed 2 main subsets of intratumoral gdT cells in our mouse
model. We will study their different function. We will establish the translational relevance of gdT cells in
GIST. We will test several gdT cell activating agents in combination with imatinib in our mouse model.
Furthermore, we will study the function of gdT cells isolated from fresh human GIST surgical specimens
and correlate their presence to clinicopathologic variables and immune infiltrate. Lastly, we propose to
perform scRNAseq on intratumoral immune cells from fresh human GISTs. Our single-cell RNA
sequencing data have given us an unprecedented look into the complexity of the immune response to
GIST and have formed the basis for numerous hypotheses in this proposal. While we are focused on GIST,
we expect that our findings will have relevance to gdT cells in other human cancers."

Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein that bypasses the
normal capillary circulation, often resulting in a tangle of vessels called a nidus. This abnormal connection
causes high-pressure shunting of arterial blood directly to the venous circulation, placing excessive stress on
the venous wall. Overstressed veins may enlarge, stretch, and eventually rupture leading to catastrophic
bleeding. While AVMs can be congenital or traumatic in etiology, they can occur anywhere in the body (e.g.,
brain, spine, liver, pelvis and lung); however, they are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality when
they occur in the central nervous system (CNS). For treatment, most patients are not surgical candidates for
resection either because of comorbidities or it is deemed too risky to resect given the location of the AVM. In
these patients, and in patients that present with acute bleeding, endovascular embolization is the preferred
method of treatment. However, current FDA approved embolics are of the liquid type and they are only
approved for use in the CNS prior to surgical resection to reduce bleeding risk during surgery. As a
consequence, physicians are left in a position to use these liquid embolics off-label; they are used for
embolization as the definitive treatment in those that cannot receive surgery and in those patients that present
with acute bleeding. These liquid embolics (Onyx and Trufill) are far from perfect; they have recanalization
rates of up to 36%, they are associated with leakage during injection that can cause non-target embolization,
angiotoxicity and the possibility of necrosis. They are also challenging to deliver, they lack the
universality to block wide range of vasculature sizes, they require lengthy pre-treatment prior to use (i.e.,
vortex for 30 min) and they lack intrinsic radiopacity for visualization on X-ray. Its administration requires
more experienced operators as unpredictable polymerization may lead to nontarget embolization; even more
concerning, the catheter can become entrapped within the polymerized embolic. While liquid embolics offer
advantages over open-surgical repair, these drawbacks limit their widespread use. We hypothesize that by
using a bioengineered gel embolic material (neuroGEM) that is non-toxic, durable (no recanalization), non-
adhesive (avoiding catheter entrapment), and easier to use (hand-held injectable, no pretreatment, visible on
X-ray), we would change the standard of medical practice. We aim to make a paradigm shift in the treatment
of potentially fatal AVMs using a minimally invasive biomaterial-based platform to fill AVM vasculature
using microcatheters with groundbreaking shear-thinning biomaterials. In Aim 1, we will develop neuroGEM
compositions for effective AVM embolization. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the therapeutic effect of neuroGEM in
rats. Finally in Aim 3, we will evaluate the performance of neuroGEM in vivo in porcine AVM model of
embolization."
10881996,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Action potentials are temporal changes of the electrical voltage across the cell membrane, which are crucial for
the physiological function of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. In the human heart, cardiac
action potentials coordinate the synchronous contraction and relaxation of billions of cardiomyocytes. The
waveforms of intracellular action potentials reflect the coordination of a multitude of ion channels, some of which
are affected by pharmaceutical drugs to collectively contribute toward proarrhythmic risks. The waveforms of
intracellular action potentials also reflect the subtype such as atrial-, ventricular-, or nodal-like cardiomyocytes,
or their maturation status. Measurements of intracellular action potentials are mostly performed by the patch
clamp technique, which is accurate but invasive, one cell at a time, laborious, and requires specialized expertise.
Due to its low throughput and invasive nature, patch clamp is not suitable for drug screening or functional
characterization of human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.
In the last decade, vertically-aligned and solid-state nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs) have emerged as promising
tools with the potential of achieving parallelizable and minimally invasive cardiac AP recording from monolayers
of stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes. However, despite the significant progress and the strong interest, the NEA
technology has largely been confined to research groups that develop the technologies, instead of being broadly
adopted by the research community. We identified several critical challenges that have hindered such effort. In
this proposal, through the partnership between an academic lab and a startup company, we aim to overcome
these challenges and develop a robust electrophysiological tool that enables reliable, scalable, and long-term
intracellular recording of cardiomyocytes. The goal of this proposal aims to transition the NEA technology from
a demonstration of possibility to a status useful to end-users."
10892781,"Summary
Brain microvessels play an important role in the neurovascular coupling (NVC). Mitochondria are energy sensors
of cells. My work for the first time demonstrated the link between mitochondrial depolarization and activation of
nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Recently, we have made a novel discovery of a neuronal NOS (nNOS) isoform in
endothelial cells that uniquely produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). The nNOS is co-expressed with NO-
producing eNOS in endothelial cells and both isoforms are involved in the bidirectional regulation of
mitochondria. Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of cerebrovascular dysfunction and dementia.
Importantly, hypoglycemia is a dangerous side effect of DM treatments, particularly insulin-therapy. Patients with
DM often experience mild hypoglycemia, but these episodes are unaccounted for in determining the
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We achieved a technological breakthrough utilizing Seahorse XFe24
analyzer and determined the mitochondrial respiration and cellular bioenergetics of brain microvessels. We made
a novel observation that five episodes of recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) impaired the microvascular mitochondrial
function. Notably, single episode of acute mild or severe hypoglycemia as well as Impairments of NOS activity
was found to mediate RH-induced alterations of cellular bioenergetics. Thus, we hypothesize that mild RH
disrupts NVC by promoting microvascular mitochondrial dysfunction leading to impaired cognitive function. We
further hypothesize that increased nNOS-induced oxidative stress coupled with reduced eNOS-derived NO
contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction following RH. We propose to use streptozotocin treated C57Bl/6 mice
and db/db mice with leptin receptor mutation as models of diabetes with untreated mice as controls. In addition,
we will employ eNOS knockout and inducible endothelial cell specific nNOS knockout mice to investigate the
role of NOS isoforms in RH-induced microvascular dysfunction. Each animal will be subjected to five episodes
(one per day) of mild (blood glucose 70-80 mg/dl) or severe (blood glucose 40-54 mg/dl) insulin-induced
hypoglycemia or saline control. Aim 1 is to demonstrate that mild and severe RH (in vivo) can increase the
production of NOS-derived ROS and display RH-induced functional mitochondrial respiration deficits in cerebral
microvessels (ex vivo). Aim 2 is to establish the impact of RH on NVC in vivo. We will determine the RH-induced
deficits in NVC by measuring the changes in arteriolar and capillary diameter in response to neuronal activation
(whisker stimulation) in awake mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. Aim 3 is to determine the
impact of RH on cognitive function using novel texture discrimination task and modified Y-maze test. The results
of this proposal would identify the mechanistic link between mild RH and the cerebral microvascular mitochondria
dysfunction and challenge the existing dogma to demonstrate that mild RH is equally detrimental as severe RH
in contributing to the DM-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction, impaired NV, and cognitive dysfunction."

Strong autofluorescence (AF) signal from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has high potential for
noninvasive, spatially and molecularly precise early detection, and longitudinal follow-up. Subcellular signal
sources of RPE AF are lipofuscin (LF) granules, many also containing melanin (melanolipofuscin, ML). New
concepts of human RPE cell biology make fulfilling the potential of fundus AF more possible than ever. Each
adult human perifoveal RPE cell has >1400 organelles that generate reflectivity for optical coherence
tomography (OCT). Half are LF or ML that also generate fundus AF (FAF) signal to blue-green exciting light.
Melanosomes (M) preferentially localize to apical processes and may contribute their own FAF signal. The
congruent topographies of FAF and photoreceptors has been confirmed and detailed, with low signal in the
fovea and strong signal at a ring of high rod density encircling fovea and optic nerve head. At this ring is also
an abundance of well-studied bisretinoid fluorophore A2E. By OCT, hyperreflective foci conferring high
progression risk include RPE anteriorly migrating into the retina. A far-reaching new finding from the previous
project period is that foveal RPE is dominated by ML, thus imparting a specific molecular signature to RPE at
this cone-rich site. Consistent with regional molecular differences in RPE, our imaging mass spectrometry
(IMS) studies revealed lipid signals specific to RPE in central macula. Unresolved questions are whether
multiple fluorophores localize to each organelle, what organelle emits FAF signal with near-infrared (NIR)
excitation, and what molecules are responsible for macular AF. We hypothesize that major fluorophores driving
macular FAF signal are bisretinoids localized to specific organelle subtypes, which in turn are regionally
distributed in accordance with the distribution of cones and rods. Drs. Curcio, Ach, and Schey, members of the
multidisciplinary Hyperspectral Retinal Autofluorescence Team (HYRAFT) with expertise in AMD pathology,
clinical imaging and microscopy, and analytic chemistry, respectively, propose studies in human donor eyes to
address these knowledge gaps. In RPE-choroid flat mounts and tissue cross-sections of aged normal (N=20)
and AMD (N=25) eyes subject to ex vivo OCT, Aim 1 will fortify a regional and morphologic basis of FAF
imaging using tissue cross-sections to use imaging mass spectrometry to identify lipid signals including
fluorophores. In these tissues Aim 2 will enumerate and determine emission spectra of LF, ML, and F in 3-
dimensions using high-resolution structured illumination microscopy and a NIR-sensitive camera. Aim 3 will
use discontinuous sucrose gradients to isolate RPE organelles in pooled maculas and peripheries (80 normal
eyes, 40 donors) to extract fluorophores, separate them with fluorescent thin layer chromatography, and
identify fluorophores using liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry. Results will directly translate
to molecularly informed clinical FAF imaging by many technologies, in AMD and other retinal disorders."
10892787,"A normal and robust immune system relies on the development of a diverse repertoire of T cells that are tolerant of self-
tissues. The thymus is a critical site for the development and education of T cell to promote tolerance to self and thus
prevent autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis. Within the thymus, the Autoimmune Regulator
(Aire) gene is a key player in the maintenance of immune tolerance as evident by its identification as the defective gene in
the human autoimmune syndrome Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1. Aire acts within specialized medullary
thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) to promote the expression of hundreds of self-antigens for the purpose of removing
developing self-reactive T cells in a process known as negative selection. Recently however, we have uncovered new
populations of mTECs that develop from cells that formerly expressed Aire that we have termed post-Aire-expressing (post-
Aire) cells. These cells appear to fall into 2 subsets: (1) a keratinocyte-like cell that is associated with Hassall's corpuscles
and (2) a tuft-like cell similar to specialized intestinal tuft cells. These cells show distinct patterns of gene expression with
intermediate levels of self-antigen expression compared to conventional mTECs, suggesting that they may play a distinct
and complementary role in mediating T cell tolerance in the thymus. We have developed a powerful set of genetic tools and
mouse reporter lines that allows us to mark, follow and purify these unique cells in order to study their function in the thymus
and their contribution to immune tolerance. We hypothesize that post-Aire cells in the thymus represent a unique subset of
thymic epithelial cells that mediate the maturation and development of tolerogenic T cell populations. Therefore, we propose
to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) Define markers of cell identity and key pathways of cell
development in thymic tuft cells, (2) Examine the effect of post-Aire mTEC's on T cell selection and thymocyte development,
and (3) Assess the contributions of post-Aire mTECs to immune tolerance in vivo. These studies will allow us to uncover the
development and function of these novel cells within the thymus as well as their contribution to T cell selection and
maturation as well as induction of other important immune regulators, such as T regulatory and invariant natural killer cells.
In this way, we hope to understand the role of these cells in the promoting immune tolerance and how they may be
employed in the prevention of autoimmune disease."
10898006,"Project Summary
With the availability of the high-through sequencing technology, the scientific community is now
able to investigate complex phenotypes at both organismal and molecular levels. Nevertheless,
it is still considerably difficult to perform controlled experiments and randomized trials to
investigate the causal relationships between phenotypes at different levels. It is therefore critically
important to perform causal inference based on the observational data. In this project, we will
develop computational methods to facilitate systematic investigation of causal molecular
mechanisms underlying complex disease process. Specifically, we will target three outstanding
scientific issues: i) casual inference of molecular mechanisms of complex diseases; ii) analytic
approaches for risk prediction utilizing genomic information and causal molecular mechanisms,
and iii) statistical assessment of reproducibility in high-throughput genomic experiments. Finally,
we will build user-friendly computational software packages and make them available to the broad
community of biological and medical scientists."

10898690,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for one of every three deaths each year in the U.S. A substantial pro-
portion of patients with cardiovascular disease develop myocardial dysfunction. Imaging tools that permit early
detection of abnormal hemodynamics and/or mechanics provide an opportunity to initiate targeted therapeutics
and diminish the burden of disease. Mice are the most common model organism for translational CVD studies
of the mammalian heart. Ultrasound (US) is now extensively used in small animals to obtain cardiac functional
parameters. However, advanced US intracardiac vector-ﬂow imaging techniques that are gaining traction for hu-
man CVD, such as cardiomyopathies, have yet to translate to preclinical use, thus, limiting the functional cardiac
parameters that can be obtained from mice. The ability to employ US vector-ﬂow methods to simultaneously re-
solve complex, intracardiac blood ﬂow patterns and cardiac mechanics at sub-millisec temporal resolution, prior
to overt structural and functional abnormalities, would add a new preclinical tool to study the interplay between
blood ﬂow, cardiac mechanics and adaptation in CVD mouse models.
The goal of this project is to develop a novel, 30-MHz, 2D CMUT, row-column (RC) high-frequency-ultrasound
array and a plane-wave vector-ﬂow imaging approach capable of sub-ms, full-frame image capture for intracardiac
imaging in mice. Unlike a standard linear array, the 2D CMUT array will allow dynamic, hands-free selection
of the optimal scan plane and the ability to acquire data in orthogonal image planes. In addition, the CMUT
array will allow us to collect data in adjacent planes to provide a 3D view of ﬂow dynamics within the murine
heart. To validate our system and demonstrate the utility for small-animal imaging, we will study intracardiac left
ventricle (LV) blood ﬂow patterns in two highly related mouse strains that nonetheless display divergent responses
(progressive hypertrophy vs. dilatation and failure) to abnormal pressure overload induced by the well-established
model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). We hypothesize that our vector-ﬂow system will be able to quantify
abnormal left ventricle ﬂow patterns relative to sham control mice and that we will be able to detect ﬂow disruption
prior to changes in traditional functional echo or strain measures. Importantly, we also hypothesize that distinct
ﬂow pattern signatures can be identiﬁed early in the course of disease that will permit discrimination between
hearts that are destined to develop progressive hypertrophy vs. dilation. The ability to detect subtle phenotypic
changes in common mouse models of CVD that are a result of early-stage diseases or therapies may translate
to earlier and more aggressive treatment of patients at highest risk of pressure-overload induced heart failure."
10898693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost all brain imaging studies now collect multiple imaging modalities, in an effort to derive measures of both
structure and function from diverse imaging sequences. While quantitative data scientists have focused on
machine learning approaches for predicting outcomes using multi-modal imaging, rigorous statistical methods
for examining the relationship between imaging modalities have lagged behind. At present, the lack of statistical
methodologies for assessing inter-modal coupling (IMCo) has left investigators with ad hoc solutions that lack
statistical power and are prone to type I error, posing a threat to scientific rigor and reproducibility. In this
application, we propose robust methods that leverage subject-specific measurements and use nonlinear
modeling to address complex relationships in brain maps or networks, while accounting for important covariates
(Aim 1). Furthermore, we will develop powerful approaches for assessing whether effects of interest (e.g.,
psychopathology, development) are enriched within brain networks (Aim 2). Assessment of this coupling
between statistical associations and brain networks will capitalize upon tools from statistical genomics (e.g.,
gene set enrichment analysis) to provide principled methods for conducting enrichment analyses using high-
dimensional, personalized brain networks. Finally, we will use these tools to delineate how trans-diagnostic
executive dysfunction in youth with mental illness is related to abnormalities in structure-function coupling within
brain networks (Aim 3). To do this, we will leverage three massive data resources: the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; n=1,601), the Healthy Brain Network (n=3,200), and the Human
Connectome-Development (HCP-D; n=1,300) study Taken together, the proposed work builds upon the notable
success in the first project period, promising to yield rigorous and generalizable methods for delineating the
relationships between complementary measures of brain structure and function."
10898694,"ABSTRACT: Valid measures of diet are essential for monitoring and improving human health. One simple
measure is dietary diversity (i.e., the number of different foods eaten over a period of time), which can serve as
a marker of nutritional inadequacies. Surveys of dietary diversity, however, are limited by current assessment
techniques that rely on dietary self-report. Another approach to surveying dietary diversity would be to use
biomarkers or biochemical indicators of diet. However, a dietary biomarker that specifically captures overall
dietary diversity has yet to be developed. Here, we will develop and validate a new technique, known as DNA
metabarcoding, for enumerating the number of dietary plant and animal species individuals consume (dietary
species richness). Our approach builds on a conceptual insight made by ecologists studying complex feeding
practices in wild animal populations, which is that dietary DNA survives digestion and can be detected in stool
using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our preliminary studies support the promise of this approach: we have
successfully amplified and sequenced more than a hundred dietary species from over a thousand human stool
samples collected across multiple countries. Our pilot work has also shown significant correlations between the
number of dietary species captured by DNA metabarcoding and survey-based indices of dietary diversity and
quality. To further establish DNA metabarcoding as a reliable and useful marker of dietary diversity, our team of
experts in fecal genomics, nutritional epidemiology, and biostatistics will pursue two Specific Aims. First, we will
optimize DNA metabarcoding for assessing intake of dietary animal species. This Aim will build on our existing
protocols for metabarcoding analysis of dietary plants. We will perform bench-top experiments under well-
controlled lab settings using mixtures of intact and processed foods. We will then test our most promising
protocols using a repository of stool samples collected from human cohorts undergoing controlled feeding.
Second, we will test the validity and utility of measuring dietary diversity using DNA metabarcoding. This Aim will
apply the technique to: 1) a cohort of primarily African-American/Hispanic youth from low-income families
enrolled in a study of obesity treatment; and, 2) a cohort of 1,000 individuals of African descent from five countries
with varying dietary habits and cardiometabolic disease risk. We will use these studies to validate that
metabarcoding species richness reflects existing measures of dietary diversity measured by recall-based
surveys of dietary intake. These real-world cohorts will further allow us to integrate metabarcoding data into
models of metabolic disease risk, examine temporal trends in metabarcoding results, and identify potential
geographic and socioeconomic determinants of dietary species richness."
10898711,"ABSTRACT
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a highly common chronic inflammatory skin disease initiated by skin exposure
to a hapten, which triggers local neuroinflammatory responses and promotes the activation of pathogenic Type
1 biased effector T cells that sustain the chronicity of the disease. There is an unmet need for specific
immunotherapies to treat ACD, and development of these treatments requires a thorough understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of the disease.
 During hapten penetration of the skin, signaling the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) by the proinflammatory
neuropeptides substance P and hemokinin-1 promotes cutaneous inflammation. This proinflammatory skin
environment is required for the T cell-stimulatory and Type 1 biasing function of resident dendritic cells (DCs).
Because lacking NK1R in mice impairs the development of ACD it has been proposed that blockade of the
receptor could be beneficial to treat the disease. Understanding the impact of NK1R-signaling in the immune
response to haptens is of fundamental relevance for therapies attempting to inhibit the function of the receptor
to treat ACD. Nonetheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms and the pathogenic consequences of hapten-
mediated NK1R activation in the skin remain to be elucidated.
 Keratinocytes constitute the first line of defense affected by contact sensitizers and they have per se a
relevant role in innate and adaptive components of skin-initiated immune responses. Keratinocytes are the main
cell subset that expresses constitutively the NK1R. Using NK1Rfl/fl mice, we published that specific deletion of
the NK1R in keratinocytes impairs the synthesis and secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine necessary for the activation
of T-cell stimulatory DCs, and inhibits the innate and adaptive immune responses of ACD. Therefore, we
hypothesize that: “Keratinocytes are early cell targets of hapten-mediated NK1R-signaling, and that they
are required to generate the proinflammatory skin environment that supports the innate and effector
immune responses of ACD”. We will address this hypothesis in the following specific aims. Specific aim 1 will
analyze the mechanisms of the proinflammatory effects caused by NK1R-signaling in keratinocytes exposed to
haptens. Specific aim 2 will analyze the mechanisms of intercellular communication by which keratinocytes
interact with skin resident DCs to promote their T cell stimulatory functions during hapten initiated skin
inflammation. Specific aim 3 will analyze the role of the NK1R-signaling exclusively in keratinocytes in the
generation of the effector and memory T cells of ACD. Our studies include in vitro and in-vivo mouse models
and ex-vivo human skin models to test the translational relevance of our experiments. If successful, the data
generated through this application will provide highly relevant missing information for the development of efficient
specific therapies for the prevention and treatment of ACD."
10898735,"The role and mechanism of action of Vpr (Viral Protein R), an accessory protein encoded by HIV-
1, has been enigmatic for decades. Vpr causes cell cycle arrest at G2/M, triggers a DNA damage
response, and enhances viral gene expression. It exerts these activities by targeting host
protein(s) for degradation, hijacking cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL4) to induce
their depletion. We recently identified a host protein CCDC137, also known as cPERP-B, as a
key target protein depleted by Vpr in a CRL4 complex dependent manner. Specifically, CCDC137
depletion by RNA interference recapitulates the aforementioned effects of Vpr on host and virus.
In this project we seek to study the molecular details of how CCDC137 represses HIV-1 gene
expression as well as how it controls cell cycle progression and the DNA damage response. In
Aim 1, we will determine whether CCDC137 depletion is a conserved feature of Vpr proteins from
diverse HIV and SIV strains, map the CCDC137 determinants required for Vpr-induced depletion,
and assess the effect of Vpr from diverse viruses on viral gene expression. In addition, we will
define host proteins required for CCDC137 depletion by Vpr. Aim 2 is centered on the
mechanisms of CCDC137-mediated repression of HIV-1 gene expression. We will delineate cis-
acting sequences required for CCDC137-mediated repression and evaluate the effect of
integration and integration site selection on the Vpr/CCDC137-regulated HIV-1 gene expression.
We will also combine screening methods (proteomics, yeast 2-hybrid, and CRISPR functional
screens) to identify CCDC137 interacting cofactor(s) to illuminate the mechanism of how
CCDC137 inhibits HIV-1 gene expression. In Aim 3 we will investigate how CCDC137 prevents
DNA damage response and controls cell cycle progression. In particular, we will determine
whether CCDC137 protects chromosomal DNA and delineate host factor(s) cooperating with
CCDC137 to modulate the DNA damage response."
10902538,"Project Summary /Abstract
Viruses present one of the most efficient mechanisms for intracellular cargo (i.e. viral genome)
delivery in which interactions at the virus-host cell interface dictate the delivery pathway. For
instance, enveloped viruses- those that are 'wrapped' in a lipid bilayer, deliver their genetic cargo
by first interacting with extracellular receptors, triggering a reaction cascade that results in fusion
of the virus- and host cell lipid membranes and cargo release into the cytosol. Harnessing the
efficiency of this translocation mechanism would drastically improve cellular uptake of therapeutic
and bioactive cargo, currently a major obstacle in both agricultural and pharmaceutical
communities, each with major impact on human health. The research proposed in this fellowship
aims to repurpose viral fusion machinery for delivering user-defined cargo to cells containing the
appropriate receptors. More specifically, several virus-derived proteins have been chosen
including Hemagglutinin (HA) - from Influenza, glycoprotein G (NiV-G) and fusion protein F (NiV-
F) - from Nipah virus, and Spike protein - from SARS-CoV-2. These proteins represent a small
selection of model proteins, all of which interact with different receptor types found on the cellular
surface, providing a potential handle for targeting cells that abundantly display the specific
receptors. To circumvent challenges associated with using infectious viruses or isolating
membrane proteins, we will concurrently adapt existing cell-free synthesis (CFPS) techniques to
produce membrane proteins and efficiently insert them into our delivery vehicles of choice-
liposomes. The short-term goals of this project are to demonstrate 1) virus fusion-protein activity
and delivery, and 2) improved efficiency of virus membrane insertion into liposomes using the
adapted CFPS methodologies. The long-term goals include tuning the biodistribution capabilities,
afforded by the virus-derived proteins, to deliver cargo to discrete and specific locations within the
human body or other organism. This fellowship will provide the applicant with the financial support
needed to design and test the proteoliposome-based delivery system and develop ideas that will
aid the applicant's independent research program in the field of virus-inspired biomaterials."

By 2050, the estimated cost of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the US is estimated at 1.6
trillion dollars. Thus, it is crucial to understand the factors contributing to the development of ADRD to identify
strategies for prevention or intervention. Stress is a multidimensional construct that can occur at various points
across the life course (early and later-life), either accumulating gradually over time or manifesting suddenly with
an immediate impact. Although stress has been associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, there is
limited research on the potential association between stress and the risk of cognitive decline and ADRD, or on
biomarkers of ADRD pathology. Moreover, few studies have assessed sex differences even though both stress
and ADRD differ by sex. In this proposal, stress will be defined as occurring across the life-course as well as an
individual's perception of psychological stress. The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine the
associations of early and later-life stress on later-life cognition and plasma biomarkers of ADRD
pathology including Abeta 40 [Aβ40], Abeta 42 [Aβ42], Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein [GFAP], and Neurofilament
light [NfL], phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217), and whether associations
are modified by sex. To examine these associations, we will cross-sectionally examine the relationship between
life course stress and cognition (Aim 1) or plasma biomarkers of ADRD pathology (Aim 2). We will also assess
whether sex modifies the association. Moreover, we will examine these associations among participants
without dementia, recruited into the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). The ADRC
consists of community-dwelling individuals, who are clinically well-characterized, have completed seven different
stress questionnaires, and provided a blood sample. The applicant will receive training in advanced methods in
epidemiology, biostatistics, sex differences, and how life course stress impacts health. Additionally, they will also
develop an understanding of ADRD clinical diagnosis and cognitive outcomes, while acquiring the necessary
skills to interpret plasma ADRD biomarkers – all of which are essential for achieving the proposed aims.
Mentorship will be provided by a multidisciplinary team of researchers and physicians at Wake Forest University
School of Medicine. The team will provide the applicant with feedback regarding project implementation, data
collection and analysis, and manuscript preparation. The proposed aims have the potential to provide essential
insight into the impact of life course stress on later-life cognition and by understanding which measures of stress
influence ADRD markers. Future interventions can be targeted towards those at highest risk."

Adolescence is an important period for neural and cognitive development. Many perceptual and cognitive
abilities rely on inputs from higher cortical regions, which are known to develop well into early adulthood,
sending feedback in a top-down manner to lower sensory regions, such as primary visual cortex (V1). How
these feedback projections develop during adolescence is poorly understood. Moreover, the adolescent
development of top-down projections to V1 may have important implications for higher order visual
processing, which is disrupted in a number of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This project
investigates the development of top-down inputs to V1 during adolescence in a mouse model, focusing on
projections from the anterior cingulate area (ACa; a region of mouse prefrontal cortex) through the lens of
visual context processing, a complex form of visual processing dependent on cortical feedback. We
hypothesize that ACa input to V1 becomes increasingly refined during adolescence, permitting the maturation
of visual context processing. The specific aims of this project are (i) to characterize ACa innervation of V1
across adolescence, both structurally and functionally, and (ii) to investigate a role for ACa-V1 circuit
development in visual context processing. Aim 1 will characterize the structural development of ACa axons
and synapses in V1 (Aim 1.1) and the activity of these inputs in V1 during contextually varied visual stimuli
across adolescence (Aim 1.2), using confocal and two-photon microscopy, respectively. Aim 2 will employ a
chronic chemogenetic approach to test the necessity of ACa feedback to V1 specifically in the adolescent phase
for the emergence of mature neural circuitry and visual context processing. Through this project, we seek to
generate novel insight into the development of top-down cortical circuits for visual processing and how this
period of circuit development may be a susceptible window during which disrupted visual processing
emerges in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. To achieve these goals, the candidate will receive
training from a skilled team of technical and scientific advisors; specifically, the candidate will gain insight
from the sponsor’s technical experience with two-photon imaging, electrophysiology, and circuit analysis in
the field of visual systems neuroscience, the senior co-sponsor’s developmental and stereological expertise,
and a collaborator’s confocal and synaptic quantification knowledge. Georgia State University provides a well-
equipped and collaborative environment in which to conduct this research. Training will be enhanced by
intramural and extramural opportunities for science education, mentorship, and advocacy."
10903132,"Auditory hallucinations (AH) are core symptoms of psychosis for which treatment is often ineffective or poorly
tolerated. A first step towards developing more selective and safer biological interventions is to elucidate AH
mechanisms at a neurobiological circuit level, a level at which AH are currently poorly understood. Here, we
use a novel computational circuit-level model combined with translational experiments in humans and mice to
identify circuit mechanisms underlying AH. Dorsal-striatal dopamine (DA) excess is implicated in AH, and AH
severity correlates with a task behavioral phenotype consisting of increased false alarms (endorsing auditory
sounds that are not present in signal-detection tasks) reported with high confidence. In mice, stimulating DA
release in the dorsal striatum also induces this AH-like phenotype of high-confidence false alarms in a similar
signal-detection task. These findings are consistent with computational models whereby AH result from
exaggerated perceptual prior expectations and suggest a role for their implementation in dorsal striatum.
However, the precise relationships between model-proposed cognitive computations and circuit neurobiology
are unclear. Important gaps include how dorsal-striatal DA and medium spiny neuron activity contribute to
perceptual learning and AH-like percepts, as well as potential additional roles of reward-based processes in
ventral striatum. To address these gaps, we have developed a first-of-its-kind computational corticostriatal
circuit model of AH which recapitulates documented behavioral and neural phenotypes associated with
perceptual and reward tasks, and which additionally generates DA-dependent AH-like false alarms. Informed
by this model, here we will use human data from antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia (Aim 1) and
mouse data including a mouse model of genetic risk for schizophrenia (Aim 2), combined with a translational
signal-detection paradigm, to test quantitative predictions from our AH circuit model. Aim 1 (humans) will use
behavior, fMRI and neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to test for distinct contributions of perceptual learning to AH
and their implementation by dorsal-striatal circuits and dopaminergic nigral regions innervating dorsal striatum.
Aim 2 (mice) will use DA sensors, neuronal recordings, and optogenetic stimulation to parse the specific
contributions of dorsal and ventral-striatal DA and medium spiny neurons to perceptual learning and AH-like
false alarms. Exploratory Aim 3 will develop circuit-model extensions incorporating additional circuit elements
(e.g., direct D1 and indirect D2 pathways, cholinergic interneurons) to help further explain circuit mechanisms
of existing D2 and candidate non-D2 antipsychotic drugs. This multidisciplinary project will thus use
translational and computational methods combining the strengths of clinical and preclinical research, and of
theory- and data-driven methods, to advance our knowledge about circuit mechanisms of psychosis. By
outlining circuit-level dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic targets, it will further pave the way for developing
novel treatment approaches with enhanced selectivity and tolerability."

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized treatment for B cell malignancies by
targeting T cytotoxicity to the site of the tumor. Despite the success of CAR-T cells in B cell malignancies, more
than half of patients receiving CAR-T cell treatment fail to achieve long term disease control. Therapeutic
failure can be attributed to many causes including the inverse relationship between CAR-T cell manufacturing
duration and the resulting anti-tumor potency. Additionally, CAR-T cell manufacturing poses barriers to access
such as cost and difficulty meeting supply demand equilibrium. To engineer the next generation of CAR-T cells
with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and greater patient access, I will generate CD19.28z CAR-T cells in vivo
using modified lentiviral particles engineered to express a T cell targeting antibody fragment, referred to in this
proposal as the Programmable Antibody-mediated Cellular Knock-In of T cells (PACK-IT) system. The PACK-IT
system will be used to explore my central hypothesis: engineering T cells in vivo is feasible and will deliver a
more efficacious CAR-T cells (PACK-IT CAR-T cells) with distinct biologic features, reducing cost and
increasing access. I have demonstrated feasibility of the PACK-IT system to generate functional CD19.28z
CAR T cells in vitro and extended the use of the PACK-IT system to successfully transduce T cells in tumor
bearing mice. Based on the proof-of-concept experiments, I propose to (i) optimize the PACK-IT system in
terms of transduction efficiency, phenotype, and anti-tumor potency of resulting CAR-T cells, (ii) in vivo
comparison of PACK-IT CAR-T cells and those made via conventional manufacturing, and (iii) assess the
impact of armoring PACK-IT CAR-T cells with drug regulatable cytokine receptors on anti-tumor potency in
immunocompetent hosts. Collectively, the proposed work will result in a method to produce CAR-T cells in
vivo, allow rigorous characterization of the impact of eliminating the ex vivo manufacturing process, and
develop PACK-IT CAR-T cells armed with regulatable cytokine receptors to boost T cell function in vivo. The
proposed work will take place at Stanford University School of Medicine, a leading institution in immunology
and immunotherapy and a setting that emphasizes innovation. Dr. Crystal Mackall is the ideal sponsor for this

mentorship from Drs. Howard Chang (genome wide sequencing, engineered lentiviral vectors), Christopher
Barnes (structural virology), and Anusha Kalbasi (engineered cytokine receptors)."

 Filoviruses are prime examples of zoonotic viruses that cause fulminant hemorrhagic diseases in humans
and nonhuman primates (NHP), resulting in death in up to 90% of human case. The filoviridae family contains
six genera in which several species are known to have high fatality rates, all of which are within
the Marburgvirus or Ebolavirus genera and will therefore be the focus of this proposal. The largest ever 2014
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease outbreak in West Africa underscored the development and regulatory approval of
antiviral countermeasures, including an emergency-use vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. While
these countermeasures are highly beneficial to block EBOV infection and interfere with disease progression at
early stages, they are less suitable for the treatment of late-stage EBOV disease (EVD), which is less studied.
Late-stage disease is characterized by gastrointestinal manifestations including diarrhea. At present, no
available animal models, including the classical NHP model, can recapitulate the gastrointestinal symptoms of
EVD patients. To elucidate the role of the intestinal epithelium in disease initiation and progression, we propose
to establish an intestinal filovirus infection model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
human intestinal organoids (HIOs).
 We hypothesize that infection with EBOV and MARV compromises barrier integrity of the intestinal
epithelium and causes abnormal ion flux as the basis for gastrointestinal dysfunction and diarrhea. This
project proposes the establishment of a polarized 2-dimentional HIO transwell system that will be used to study
the pathophysiological effects of filovirus infection on intestinal epithelial integrity. In Aim 1, we will characterize
filovirus-mediated injury by analyzing (1) intestinal barrier and (2) tight junction integrity. We hypothesize that the
sepsis-like syndrome that occurs in some patients with severe disease may be due to loss of epithelial barrier
integrity in the intestine. In Aim 2, we intend to validate the role of individual genes by genetic ablation and test
potential drug candidates as modulators of intestinal epithelial function. We hypothesize that if tight junctions are
compromised in infected HIOs, then treatment with small molecule inhibitors targeted at ion exchanger would
reverse the leaky junctions by blocking the receptor responsible for the disassemble of the junction. The aims
proposed in this study will result in an improved model which more closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal epithelial
phenotypes, and thus can be used to inform novel therapeutics targeted at late-stage filovirus infection.
 The successful, longstanding mentorship of Drs. Mostoslavsky and Mühlberger, the collaborative support of
the CReM, the availability of the NEIDL research facilities and the rigorous MTM training program will provide
me with the tools and support needed to successfully complete my dissertation work. These departments instill
important values about the rigorous approach to academic science by supporting technical training, writing
workshops and seminar and lecture series."

Vitamin D is an essential nutrient whose active hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), regulates
vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated gene expression to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption, to maintain
intestinal barrier function, to suppress colonic inflammation and to suppress carcinogenesis. However, intestinal
resistance to vitamin D develops with advancing age. This reduces intestinal Ca absorption in rodents and in
humans but it is not clear how age-associated intestinal vitamin D resistance affects other aspects of intestinal
vitamin D action. Thus, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms for how intestinal 1,25(OH)2D
action changes across the lifespan. Our long-term goal is to determine how vitamin D regulates intestinal
biology across the lifespan to modulate classical (Ca absorption) and non-classical (cancer, inflammation)
vitamin D endpoints. Our studies from the past grant period were the first to show the complexity of 1,25(OH)2D-
regulated gene regulation across the functional compartments of the intestine (i.e. small intestine (SI) crypt, SI
villus, colon). Our new preliminary data demonstrate that advanced age can suppress the intestinal induction of
some, but not all, vitamin D target genes. Thus, we hypothesize that age-related intestinal resistance to
1,25(OH)2D is due to context-dependent interference of VDR transcriptional mechanisms. To address this
hypothesis, we have designed three aims: Aim 1: Determine how 1,25(OH)2D genomic action is modified
across the lifespan to result in age-associated intestinal vitamin D resistance. Based on our pilot data, we
hypothesize that the impact of aging on vitamin D-dependent gene expression is not uniform across genes or by
intestinal compartment (i.e. SI/colon, crypt/villi). We will use state-of-the-art genomic approaches to study age-
and compartment-specific changes in intestinal vitamin D action. Aim 2: Determine how VDR genomic action
depends upon other transcription factors and co-regulators across the lifespan. We will conduct studies
to reveal the critical, VDR-interacting proteins that define compartment- and age-sensitive regulation of intestinal
gene expression and functionally test their roles in organoid models. Aim 3: Test whether targeting 1,25(OH)2D
to the proximal colon can enhance Ca absorption and reduce age-related bone loss. We will determine
whether colon-targeted forms of 1,25(OH)2D can enhance Ca absorption in mice to prevent trabecular bone loss
in adults and increased cortical porosity in old mice. Our proposed studies provide the unique opportunity to
determine (a) the scope of genes and regulatory regions impacted by aging in the intestine, (b) the role of
intestine-specific transcription factors and co-activators in age-associated intestinal vitamin D resistance, and (c)
whether colon-targeted forms of 1,25(OH)2D can have health benefits by overcoming age-associated vitamin D
resistance and Ca malabsorption. When complete, this research will serve as a scientific foundation for
developing strategies to improve intestinal vitamin D action, especially in older populations at high risk for
developing diseases like osteoporosis as well as colon cancer, and inflammatory bowel syndromes."

More than 100 million people in the United States currently show signs of clinical depression, approximately
three times more than before the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. Currently, the main treatment options for such
depressed individuals include pharmacological and psychological interventions, the acute and long-term
effectiveness of which are significantly limited: up to one-third of patients develop treatment-resistant
depression. Noninvasive neurostimulation therapies such as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
(rTMS)–where a magnetic coil placed over the cortex is used to focally stimulate the brain–have recently
emerged as promising low-risk interventions for treatment-resistant depression. However, the mechanisms and
appropriate parameters for this treatment remain poorly understood. In the best cases, rTMS can have
dramatic effects, changing the course of a patient's life in hours. In many cases, however, it has little to no
measurable effect. This raises the obvious question: why do current rTMS protocols work well for some
individuals but not for others? Could we adapt protocols to work well for everyone, potentially providing reliable
personalized treatment or even a lasting cure? A growing literature suggests this is possible if we learn to tailor
treatment to individual differences in human neurophysiology. Here we propose an innovative and unique
approach towards precision psychiatric neurostimulation: personalized modeling of treatment using
“Generative Digital Twins”. To affordably build and scale Generative Digital Twins, we propose combining high
density electroencephalography (HD-EEG)–which is non-invasive, inexpensive, and easily deployable–to
measure longitudinal changes in brain connectivity during an accelerated rTMS treatment protocol for
depression. Then, using controllable generative neural networks that allow detailed predictive simulations of
individual response trajectories given rTMS treatment, we can begin to predict outcomes prior to treatment,
understand individual responses, and personalize treatment parameters."

The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have
partnered to integrate advanced imaging and sensing coupled with computing needed to translate
technological innovation to address the global cardiometabolic disease. The UCLA/Caltech integrated
Theranostic Engineering to Advance Metabolic Medicine (iTEAM) Program represents a new paradigm that
will be formalized into a 2-year, structured curriculum with an emphasis on recruiting the under-represented
post-doctoral engineers or physical scientists into leadership roles in academia and industry. The
convergence of the fundamental strengths of Caltech and clinical strengths of UCLA is conducive to
individualize training in 1) advanced sensing or 2) imaging coupled with computing to address 3)
cardiometabolic disease. The iTEAM program is partnering with industry leaders (Amgen, Johnson &
Johnson, Medtronic, and Edwards Lifesciences) for internship, mentorship, and leadership programs. Both the
Caltech Diversity Center and UCLA Faculty Diversity & Development Office have supported workshops on
Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) for women and underrepresented minorities. To
implement this UCLA/Caltech iTEAM program, we have developed a mentoring and self-evaluating structure in
the inclusion of 21 primary and co-mentors, 13 consulting mentors, and 10 industry leaders (42% female).
Each iTEAM scholar will have co-mentorships: a primary mentor from enabling technologies and a secondary
from cardiometabolic medicine and/or industry. In Year 1, iTEAM scholars will: 1) Participate in an initial two-
day workshop including mentors, program leaders, clinicians, physician-scientists, and industry leaders to
explore projects, expectations, mentorship, and goals; 2) Meet one-to-one with the Program Director(s) to
finalize a primary (imaging or sensing) and a co-mentor (cardiometabolic disease or industry); 3) Develop an
Individualized Development Plans (IDP) with the Advising & Training Committee to finalize the project; and 4)
Strengthen fundamental knowledge in advanced imaging, sensors, or computation and didactic training for
ethics in biomedical research and publications. In Year 2, iTEAM scholars will be afforded 1) the opportunity to
present work-in-progress and provide feedback in quarterly meetings with a primary mentor and with a co-
mentor, 2) an option to participate in a certificate in Pathways in Clinical and Translational Research from the
UCLA Clinical Translational Science Institute (CTSI) or Law and Technology for FDA regulatory science

People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH) remain at increased risk of developing
head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) due to oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, despite
adequate management of HIV with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Clinical observations have indicated
increased risk of oral HPV infection and pathology in PLWH after they begin taking ART and concurrent with a
significant drop in HIV viral burden. Prior in vitro studies using 3D experimental tissue models that mimic stratified
squamous epithelium have suggested that exposure of the tissue to ART agents disrupts the structural integrity
of the tissue and enhances susceptibility to HPV infection. These findings have not been corroborated in clinical
studies using relevant oral mucosal samples from PLWH. We hypothesize that ART damages the integrity of the
oral mucosa and enhances acquisition of HPV infection in vivo. Further, we posit that individuals that are taking
ART for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection will exhibit tissue damage and HPV
susceptibility similar to that of PLWH who are taking ART to manage their HIV infection. Three specific aims are
proposed to investigate these hypotheses: 1) to compare the prevalence and incidence of oral HPV infection in
PLWH taking ART and people taking ART for PrEP to risk-matched HIV seronegative, ART-naïve controls; 2) to
examine the architecture of oral mucosal tissue in subjects taking ART/PrEP for evidence of damage to the
integrity of the mucosal barrier; and 3) to determine the effect of taking ART/PrEP on tissue susceptibility to HPV
infection by experimental challenge of patient oral biopsy-derived 3D tissues with HPV16 in vitro. These studies
will, for the first time, discern the role of ART apart from HIV infection on oral mucosa integrity and susceptibility
to oral HPV infection. This is significant because understanding the interplay between HIV, ART and HPV will
reveal new opportunities to prevent HNSCC that take into consideration the effects of ART on patient risk."

Workers on nuclear sites face health and safety threats from known and unknown hazards.
Evolving job conditions (e.g. disposing of nuclear waste from plant decommissioning) pose new
and increased threats. Workers on these jobs need training to protect themselves, the
community, and the environment. Training not only reduces job site accidents, injuries, and
fatalities, but it is also required under various government regulations.
Under the proposed program, LIUNA Training and Education Fund (LIUNA Training) will
provide training to help workers identify job site hazards; protect themselves, the community
and the environment; prepare for unanticipated job site incidents and support disaster response
actions. Targeted workers perform a variety of jobs, such as waste containment, reduction, and
removal, building demolition, construction and/or reconstruction and renovation, radiation
monitoring and decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
Affiliated training partners will conduct the training and certification of workers and DOE staff.
Other subject matter experts will collaborate with LIUNA Training on quality assurance, health
and safety issues, scientific and technological advances, and efforts to disseminate model
programs. Training will target Construction Craft Laborers, and other construction trades,
environmental contractors and government personnel when appropriate. Special outreach will
target minority, disadvantaged and non- or limited-English speaking workers.
Training will be provided by 8 partner centers located in the following areas: West Valley, NY;
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in KY; Oak Ridge in TN; Savannah River in SC; Los Alamos
National Laboratory in NM; Nevada Test Site, Idaho National Laboratory and Hanford in WA.
Training will target employer and worker needs in each location and prepare workers for
possible events in their geographic region. LIUNA Training and partners will provide 90
training weeks with approximately 2,120 trainees during the first program year and similar
levels during the remaining four years. Training may include Hazardous Waste Worker and
Refresher, Nuclear Power Plant Worker and Nuclear Technician among others.
The grant program will train and certify instructors, provide competency-based credentials, and
foster effective educational and training models. Collaborative efforts with DOE NTC, industry,
and workforce development organizations will help advance training needs and innovations and
improve overall quality and effectiveness of the DOE Worker Training Program at large."
10894789,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represents a major chronic health problem in the US and abroad. MRI studies of AD
demonstrated a decrease in the size of the hippocampus and other brain structures associated with learning
and memory. Toxic proteins, like Aß and tau, accumulate in these brain regions, and MRS and PET imaging
studies consistently showed metabolic deficits and oxidative stress in brains of patients with AD. BDNF can
improve metabolism, promotes neuronal plasticity and restore brain functions. However, BDNF cannot easily
cross an intact blood brain barrier (BBB) and is unstable in the blood or when delivered orally. In SBIR Phase 1
& 2, ExQor developed a nanotechnology platform that provides an innovative approach for treatment of AD. It
consists of 2 components: a clathrin nanoparticle (CNP) and attached brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF). CNPs successfully bypassed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) intranasally (i.n.) and CNS concentrations
of BDNF were up to 400-fold higher than reported in previous BDNF i.n. studies. CNPs restored memory and
regenerated hippocampal regions by increasing neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and dendritic integrity in a
mouse model of AD. CNP effects were detected in the mouse hippocampus with two different MR
neuroimaging modalities. Voxel based morphometry showed CNP-enhanced hippocampal gray matter
densities. Proton MR spectroscopy showed that CNP decreased lactate, alanine, aspartate, myoinositol and
glutathione concentrations, indicating CNP reversed anaerobic metabolism, gliosis, and oxidative stress in the
mouse hippocampus. CNP also increased choline-containing compounds associated with increased
neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity.
The goal of this effort is to scale-up production of BDNF-clathrin nanoparticles (CNPs), perform
pharmacokinetic and safety studies required for IND, and confirm efficacy in the second animal model of AD.
In Phase IIb SBIR, a series of in vivo studies will ascertain CNP distribution, safety and efficacy. TgF344-AD
rats will be treated with CNPs or placebo early in the course of the disease for 6 months, and cognitive testing
and MRI and 1H MRS will be performed after treatments. We plan to demonstrate the feasibility of this novel
nanotechnology to enhance learning and memory, increase gray matter densities, and reverse metabolic
abnormalities and oxidative stress associated with AD.
This research project will provide new, noninvasive nanotechnology tools for early treatment of AD. The new
nanotechnology will be able to enhance neuronal metabolism and plasticity, protect brain and restore brain
functions more quickly and completely than existing treatment methods, while using much lower therapeutic
drug doses and causing fewer side effects. The development of a stable, targeted molecular nanoparticle may
also provide a major new tool for research of biomarkers in AD. This novel nanotechnology may serve as the
basis for a next generation drug-delivery system that can specifically target relevant brain systems, and may
have utility as an imaging agent to enhance diagnosis and monitor progression of AD."

ABSTRACT
ITM 3.0: ADVANCING HEALTH TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY THROUGHOUT METROPOLITAN CHICAGO
The University of Chicago – Rush University Institute for Translational Medicine (ITM) was created in 2007 to
assemble, integrate, and create the intellectual, administrative, and physical resources required to catalyze
research and research training in Clinical and Translational Science. We have trained university scientists and
health care providers as well as stakeholders from concerned communities to work together to determine the
biological, behavioral, and social determinants of disease; to develop and test interventions directed toward
those mechanisms; and to achieve these goals in a way that is rigorous, efficient, ethical, respectful of, and
responsive to our communities’ priorities and values. The ITM has capitalized on outstanding intellectual and
physical resources throughout UChicago, Rush, and ITM affiliate institutions – Loyola University Chicago,
NorthShore University HealthSystem, Advocate Aurora Health Care, and Illinois Institute of Technology – and
on substantial multi-institutional investments to build the sustainable infrastructure for a transformative,
energetic, and self-improving home for clinical and translational research.
Now, we pursue a bold guiding vision for “ITM 3.0” – that reversing the adverse health consequences of
structural racism requires accounting for and mitigating the social, environmental, behavioral, and
psychological factors (the entire lived experience, which we will call the “sociome”) through which
structural racism impairs health. Focus on the sociome is critical because: 1) sociome factors interact with
human biology to exacerbate or cause disease and injury, and 2) illness of any origin can compound the
negative effects of adverse sociome factors. Since both sociome and biological systems, and their
interactions, determine health, our CTSA hub must provide investigators, trainees, and stakeholders with the
resources and knowledge to account for and address health disruptors throughout both systems. Our
strategy to implement this vision is to create new training mechanisms, research platforms,
communications channels, and safeguards against harm to ensure that all ITM investigators and
institutions approach health problems with a wider-angle sociome lens in an ethical way. Then, our
scientific, institutional, and community stakeholders can together design, test, and disseminate biological
and/or sociome-directed interventions at the levels of individual, community, and society to improve
mutually defined health concerns. ITM 3.0 will work hand-in-hand with partners throughout Chicagoland and
the nation, combining academic rigor with community wisdom to conceptualize, develop and deploy
innovative, just, and ethical interventions/practices to achieve our common goal, and so lessen the health
impact of structural racism.

The UPMC Clinical Center for the Study of Diabetes after Acute Pancreatitis (UPMC CC), a multidisciplinary
research program at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC, seeks to be a founding member of the Type 1
Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). UPMC CC’s organizational structure allows
comprehensive characterization of patients with pancreatic disorders from an epidemiological, clinical and
translational perspective. Its strengths include outstanding faculty with vast expertise in all areas relevant to the
T1DAPC, high patient volumes, infrastructure to conduct high-quality clinical and translational studies, and a
track record of strong and successful collaborations, leadership and contributions to multicenter studies and
consortiums. The well-established, efficient and effective clinical and research infrastructure for patient accrual,
sample processing, data management and transfer, and analysis will support the program. The studies proposed
in this application will directly address the overriding objective of the T1DAPC. These explore a new concept that
post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus AP (PAP-DM) occurs rapidly because of previously unrecognized
ongoing loss of beta cells function after the AP episode is resolved. We will determine how rapidly PAP-DM
develops after AP, the natural history of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity after AP, and the contribution
of beta cell autoimmunity to the pathogenesis of DM after AP and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Specific aims: Aim
1) Determine the risk of and characteristics associated with PAP-DM. We will recruit and prospectively follow
up non-diabetic patients who recover from AP and compare the incidence of PAP-DM to controls. Aim 2)
Determine the natural history of changes in beta cell function after resolution of AP. Using the cohorts of Aim
1 (AP and controls), this aim will determine if clinically silent, ongoing beta cell loss occurs during the first year
after AP resolution and whether it correlates with the onset of PAP-DM. Additionally, this aim will determine
whether beta cell loss is accompanied by changes in insulin sensitivity and whether it correlates with beta-cell
autoimmunity and biomarkers of exocrine pancreas inflammation. Aim 3) Quantify the contribution of beta
cell autoimmunity to DM in patients with CP. Existing data and stored serum samples from other NIDDK-
sponsored cohorts (NAPS2, PROCEED) will be used to measure beta cell autoantibodies in patients with CP who
have DM and compare with patients without DM and non-diabetic healthy controls. The proposed studies will
provide crucial information to design personalized-medicine approaches to prevent and treat PAP-DM based on
pathophysiology. The studies will lay the groundwork for future research on PAP-DM. To ensure its success and
effectiveness, the T1DAPC can count on the solid foundation of world-class faculty, extensive clinical resources,
high patient volumes, clinical and translational research experience, ability to work with multiple centers as
either leaders or participants in pancreatic research, and record of accomplishments."

 While antifibrotic therapies continue to advance, they fall short when treating large or chronic wounds.
Essential to developing new regenerative strategies is a comprehensive understanding of how cell proliferation
is activated, maintained, and eventually terminated to accurately restore missing tissue. The objective of this
proposal is to determine the cell autonomous mechanisms that permit and control proliferation during complex
tissue regeneration in highly regenerative mammals (spiny mice and rabbits). Spiny mice are unique among
rodents in their ability to regenerate complex skin and musculoskeletal tissues and as such, they represent a
promising model for pinpointing molecular and cellular mechanisms that prevent regeneration in humans.
Fascinatingly, primary dermal fibroblasts from spiny mice and rabbits maintain proliferation in the face of reactive
oxygen species, gamma irradiation, and contact inhibition. These same conditions induce senescence or
quiescence in primary dermal fibroblasts from poorly regenerative mammals (lab mice and rats). This proposal
uses cells from these species to identify how identical signals trigger regeneration in some species and scarring
in others. Further, this proposal utilizes spiny mouse ear pinna regeneration, a highly reproducible and tractable
model of mammalian skin and musculoskeletal regeneration, to further explore pro-regenerative signals in vivo.
In Aim 1, I will examine how stress signals are differentially transduced by cells to determine how fibroblasts
from highly regenerative mammals maintain proliferation in senescence inducing conditions in vitro. I will then
use spiny mouse ear pinna regeneration to determine how this differential stress transduction leads to activation
and maintenance of regenerative response following injury in vivo. In Aim 2, I will identify the mechanisms that
permit primary fibroblasts from spiny mice and rabbits to proliferate at very high cell densities in vitro. I will then
use spiny mouse ear pinna regeneration to determine how these mechanisms regulate proliferation and tissue
size in vivo. I hypothesize that cells from highly regenerative mammals differentially activate signaling pathways
that facilitate cell cycle progression in response to stress and maintain this activity in excess of inhibitory signals
that terminate proliferation in non-regenerative mammals. These studies will generate RNA-seq datasets and
identify candidate genes that will drive discovery in the field and form a basis for my own independent research.
By studying proliferative control during regeneration, we can build a blueprint for the recapitulation of
regeneration in human medicine."

Metformin (MET), the most widely prescribed medication for treating type 2 diabetes, is increasingly recognized
for its healthspan extension effects. If MET is to be an effective healthspan extending drug, it is critical to
understand the effects of MET during periods of relative health and how it interacts with other healthspan-related
interventions such as exercise. Studies that have examined the MET-exercise interaction overwhelmingly show
that MET inhibits the positive effects of aerobic exercise training (AET), but the mechanisms behind this effect
are still unknown. Our recent clinical trial also demonstrated that subjects with the highest mitochondrial complex
1 supported respiratory function and insulin sensitivity were the most negatively affected by MET treatment with
an exercise intervention. The proposed study will determine if the detrimental effects of MET treatment on
skeletal muscle adaptations to AET involves altered calcium handling. Calcium handling is imperative for
mitochondrial function, adaptations to exercise, and muscle health during aging. This project is significant
because it further defines the context-specificity of MET benefits on healthspan. We hypothesize that MET
treatment will impede calcium flux into the mitochondria during exercise training in aging rats, inhibiting the
positive adaptations to AET. To test this hypothesis, we will use a rat model with genetic selection for high
intrinsic aerobic capacity (HCR) because they represent, by many outcomes, healthy human subjects. The
Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine how MET treatment alters mitochondrial calcium flux during AET and 2)
Determine if MET treatment during AET alters the turnover of calcium handling proteins and structures regulating
calcium kinetics. We will assess in vivo cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium kinetics using 2-photon fluorescence
microscopy. Changes to mitochondrial calcium flux and function of skeletal muscle with and without 12 weeks of
AET and/or MET will be measured using an Oroboros O2K. To determine if MET changes adaptations to AET,
we will develop a targeted mitochondrial proteomics panel to measure the quantity and turnover of mitochondrial
and calcium-handling proteins. We will also use a novel optic clearing technique in combination with light sheet
microscopy to establish changes to mitochondrial-associated membrane contacts (MAM) structure and location
with and without MET. We expect that with MET treatment, animals will have a lower rate of mitochondrial
calcium uptake coupled with lower respiration, and that this inhibition will be more prominent in the exercised
animals. Additionally, we expect MET will negatively impact the mitochondrial proteome related to calcium flux
and hinder improvements associated with MAM number and distance to calcium release units in response to
exercise. Successful completion of these aims will allow us to uncover mechanisms that contribute to the
inhibition of AET adaptations with MET treatment in aging animals. Key training aspects include novel
bioenergetic, flux and proteomic assessments of calcium handling in mitochondria that are crucial for my
development to an independent investigator focused on targeting mitochondria for muscle aging."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all blood and immune cells throughout life. Aging HSCs exhibit
diminished regenerative function, myeloid-biased differentiation, and clonal outgrowth, which contribute to
compromised immunity and increased incidence of bone marrow (BM) failure, and hematological malignancies
in the aged population. Recent findings demonstrated that HSCs require strict regulation of protein homeostasis
(proteostasis) to maintain self-renewal potential, but this declines with age. Translation is the most error prone
step in gene expression and is a prominent source of proteostasis dysfunction. Previous studies demonstrated
that HSCs depend on lower protein synthesis rates to preserve proteostasis, and increasing protein synthesis
diminishes proteome quality and impairs HSC function. This raises the possibility that HSCs depend on
enhanced translation fidelity, and that increasing fidelity could mitigate age-related changes in proteostasis and
declines in HSC function. Our central hypothesis is that young adult HSCs have higher translation fidelity
compared to restricted progenitors and old adult HSCs, and interventions that enhance translation fidelity will
improve HSC fitness and longevity. To directly test this hypothesis, I generated a fluorescence-based translation
fidelity reporter mouse, and in Aim 1 I will compare translation fidelity in young and old HSCs and progenitors in
vivo. To examine the impact of enhancing fidelity, I generated a mouse model with high-fidelity ribosomes
(Rps23K60R/K60R). Using this model, I will test if enhancing translation fidelity protects HSCs from the proteostasis
disrupting effects associated with increased protein synthesis in a Pten-deficient mouse model in vivo. In Aim 2,
I will test if enhancing translation fidelity improves age-associated declines in HSC function by performing
comprehensive hematopoietic analyses and competitive transplantation assays. I will also determine if
enhancing translation fidelity extends HSC longevity in serial transplantation assays. Finally, I will extend
preliminary RNA-sequencing data to confirm that enhancing translation fidelity promotes improved proteostasis
maintenance in aging HSCs using a suite of single cell assays to quantify misfolded and unfolded protein.
Collectively, these studies will determine if translation fidelity varies across cell types within the blood and is
altered upon aging or in the presence of HSC disrupting pathogenic mutations. Research outcomes will reveal
if modulating translation fidelity is a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance stem cell fitness in older adults."

Infants and young children amass a vocabulary at a remarkable pace during the first 3 years. The size of
vocabulary, and the rate of its growth predict future outcomes including academic achievement. Research on
vocabulary development has largely focused on the cognitive processes underlying how young children learn
new words, but we know remarkably little about the processes that support young children's retention of words
over long delays to eventually become integrated into their lexicon. The examination of the neural processes
supporting young children's retention will shed new light on contributing processes.
We propose that the hippocampus enables learning and initial retention of the arbitrary association between
words and their referents, but that additional cortical mechanisms in the anterior medial temporal lobe and
medial prefrontal cortex are critical to respectively support longer retention and abstraction of meaning across
multiple exposures. Further, we propose that opportunities to repeat and generalize which present in the child's
environment are particularly likely to engage these cortical mechanisms in young children. Finally, we propose
that neural activations capture processes underlying individual differences in vocabulary development. We
developed novel functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experimental paradigms that are appropriate
for use in toddlers ages 25 to 35 months, a period during which toddlers learn hundreds of words. We will
leverage targeted memory reactivation occurring during natural nocturnal sleep to elucidate neural
mechanisms contributing to word retention and to predict vocabulary size and growth between 2 and 3 years of
age.
Relevance for Public Health: The acquisition of a vocabulary is critical for communication and understanding,
and its size and growth predict various outcomes, including reading ability. Language acquisition is impaired in
several neurodevelopmental disorders underscoring that a characterization of memory and vocabulary
development is key to understanding adaptive functioning in various populations of children. This research will
contribute to provide a stronger conceptual, empirical, and methodological foundation for examining
populations of children who exhibit altered language development and memory difficulties due to a variety of
conditions (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down's Syndrome)."

brain circuit plasticity and associated molecular mechanisms that specifically underlie drug seeking.
Nonetheless, despite several decades of research, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying strong cravings
for drugs after abstinence are not fully elucidated. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is associated with
various complex behaviors including working memory, impulsivity, goal-directed action, and decision-making.
Given the diverse roles of the PFC and its efferent and afferent connections to limbic reward circuitry, the PFC
is capable of integrating and transmitting drug-relevant signals throughout the brain as the addiction
progresses. In particular, several reports show that ventral PFC subregions modulate drug-seeking and
extinction behavior and are a viable target for deep brain stimulation to reduce addictive behaviors. However, it
is largely unknown how PFC sub-circuitries contribute to drug addiction differentially and whether specific cell
types, especially distinct types of interneurons, within the PFC are differentially responsible for drug-seeking
after withdrawal and extinction. In this proposed research, we will investigate the role of different interneurons
in the infralimbic (ventral) cortex for the seeking and the extinction of cocaine after withdrawal in our newly
developed head-fixed drug self-administration paradigm. First, we will directly monitor the activity of different
types of interneurons, parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SST)-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-
expressing neurons, in infralimbic cortex (IL) during cocaine self-administration at single-neuron resolution
using multiphoton photon microscopy. Second, we will directly manipulate the activity of distinct interneurons at
the specific timing of drug self-administration to examine the causal roles of these neurons in drug self-
administration. Third, we will examine how cortical outputs are regulated by distinct interneurons during drug
self-administration. Excitingly, we already acquired preliminary results showing the differential roles of distinct
interneurons in cocaine self-administration. Overall, we believe that the successful completion of this project
will yield significant benefits by establishing a framework for the research of drug addiction in a circuit-specific
manner, as well as by facilitating the development of a treatment approach for drug addiction."

The Problem: Cellular immunotherapies targeting surface proteins are one the most exciting new modalities in
cancer. However, most tumors lack surface targets with acceptable efficacy and toxicity profiles.
Our Solution to the Problem: In work currently accepted at Nature Cancer, to address this unmet need we
developed a new technology called “structural surfaceomics”. This approach is designed to systematically
probe an entirely new class of tumor-selective immunotherapy targets: those based on the cancer-specific, 3-
dimensional conformation of plasma membrane proteins. To develop this methodology, we used our joint
expertise in cell surface proteomics (Wiita) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (Huang). We initially applied
this strategy to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a deadly blood cancer with no known optimal cellular therapy
targets. Using structural surfaceomics on AML models followed by patient sample validation, we identified the
active conformation of integrin-β2 (aITGB2) as a promising, previously unknown AML target. Via recombinant
antibody selection, we developed an engineered T-cell therapy (CAR-T) targeting aITGB2. We found this CAR-
T had a highly favorable efficacy vs. toxicity profile compared to other AML targets under clinical investigation.
We are now pursuing further preclinical development of this CAR-T as a therapy for AML patients.
Overall Hypothesis and Aims: We hypothesize that tumor-specific surface protein conformations are actually
widespread, and the structural surfaceomics technology has the potential to uncover these antigens. The
objective of our proposal is two-fold: 1) further advance the technical and analytical aspects of the structural
surfaceomics technology, to improve our ability to identify cancer-specific surface protein conformations across
a broader range of indications; and 2) identify how we can even further improve therapeutic targeting of this
conformation-specific surface antigen aITGB2 in AML, even beyond our current approach. To achieve these
goals, Aim 1 will define the landscape of surface protein conformations via enhanced structural surfaceomics
across several different tumor models, with validation in primary patient samples. This work will ultimately
develop a pipeline to move from target discovery to potential therapeutic. Aim 2 will focus on identifying the
mechanistic basis for conformation-specific targeting of integrin-β2 in AML with our current cellular therapy.
Impact: Findings in Aim 1 will be broadly impactful toward the adoption and dissemination of the structural
surfaceomics technology. These results will ideally not only identify new immunotherapy targets in cancer, but
open the door to probing surface protein conformations in any biological system. An Aim 2 will inform design of
a further optimized cellular therapy for potential clinical translation, directly benefitting AML patients.
The Team: The PIs have an uncommon combination of expertise in implemented proteomic methods as well
as blood cancer and cellular therapy development. Co-Investigators at UCSF and IIT Bombay are leading
experts in integrin biology, structural biology, computational structural biology, and computational proteomics."
10906026,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT
Despite increases in treatment intensity, children with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) have poor survival and
significant post-therapy toxicities. The candidate is an Instructor in Pediatrics with 80% protected time for
research who is committed to developing novel therapeutics that are desperately needed to improve the lives of
children with NB. This is a challenge due to the paucity of currently targetable oncogenic mutations in this tumor.
A recent survey identified the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzyme EP300, but not its paralog, CBP, as a
selective dependency in NB. This identifies an opportunity to inhibit EP300 without severe toxicity, as CBP may
compensate for EP300 in many normal cells. To this end, the candidate has developed a proteolysis-targeted
chimaera (PROTAC) on-target molecule (“JQAD1”) that degrades EP300 with limited effects on CBP in vitro and
in vivo. JQAD1 causes tumor growth delay in vivo with limited toxicity, and is therefore an excellent starting point
for developing combinatorial strategies for tumor cell killing. Thus, this proposal builds on a strong foundation of
preliminary data to address the central hypothesis that optimized EP300-targeting strategies can be developed
to maximize NB cell death while limiting off-target toxicity using structurally-guided chemical biology with faithful
in vivo NB modeling. This will be pursued in two specific aims: 1) To experimentally determine the most potent
combinations of EP300 degraders and chemotherapies in vitro and in vivo; and 2) To develop improved potency
second-generation JQAD compounds with enhanced on- and off-target specificity. In the first aim, to
appropriately prepare EP300 degraders for clinical use, experiments will identify effective combinations of
conventional chemotherapy agents and JQAD1. The mechanisms of combinatorial compound function, and
tractability of this approach will be established in vitro and in PDX models reflecting the biological and clinical
heterogeneity of NB. In the second aim, second-generation JQAD molecules will be generated using structurally-
based compound development,. These will be tested for effects on EP300 using novel fluorescent in-cell assays,
and in mechanistic assays of EP300 function. This proposal is innovative because it uses mechanistic
approaches involving state-of-the-art gene knockins, compound development and PROTAC technologies to
identify methods to maximize tumor cell death and minimize toxicity. It is significant because targeting EP300
alone represents an ideal strategy to kill NB cells and limit toxicity to normal tissues. This proposal is designed
to provide intensive training and mentoring in chemical biology, animal modeling and experimental therapeutics,
as well as mentoring in grant writing, leadership training and managerial skills, thereby conferring the necessary
skills for an optimal transition to independence. The environment for this proposal is ideal, including scientific
experts necessary to complete this work, a strong institutional commitment and ideal guidance of his mentors,
Drs. Kim Stegmaier and Jun Qi. Thus, this proposal will facilitate his career goals of becoming an independent,
laboratory-based clinician-scientist focused on discovery and therapeutic targeting in cancer."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major U.S. health problem with 12-month and lifetime prevalence being 13.9%
and 29.1%, respectively. AUD is partly caused by genetic factors with the estimated heritability being about 50%.
Therefore, identification of genes related AUD can help us elucidate the genetic mechanisms of AUD and
develop novel prevention and treatment strategies. While recent large-scale genome wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified multiple AUD-associated genes, these genes only explain a small portion of heritability,
indicating that many additional genes with small effects remain to be discovered. AUD is a heterogeneous
disorder with multiple interacting genetic and environmental influences. Therefore, two individuals could receive
the same AUD diagnosis, but have multiple different symptoms. One strategy to interrogate heterogeneous
disorders is the inclusion of more homogenous endophenotypes, which deconstruct diagnostic categories into
component features that may be more amenable to genetic research and provide a cost-effective way to increase
statistical power without dramatically increasing the sample size. Alcohol sensitivity and tolerance are two
important contributing features to the development and maintenance of AUD in humans, can be effectively
measured in mice, and are known to be at least partly genetically mediated in both species.
In this study, we propose a systematic and translational strategy to identify and validate variants and genes
related to alcohol sensitivity and tolerance using both human and Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. In Aim 1, we will
perform GWAS of alcohol sensitivity and tolerance in both European and African ancestry populations after
adjusting for the effects of alcohol metabolism genes. Next, we will use high throughput reporter assays in
multiple cell lines representing four major brain cells to identify functional variants with sub-threshold P values.
We will then use a Mendelian randomization framework to identify target genes of those functional variants. In
Aim 2, we will perform QTL, eQTL, and gene expression-trait correlation analyses to identify genetic variants
associated with ethanol sensitivity and tolerance in DO mice. DO mice are genetically heterogeneous with large
amounts of recombination that provide high mapping resolution approximating that of a human GWAS, but with
a much smaller sample size. In Aim 3, we will employ our newly developed VariantGraph database to identify
variants and genes with shared regulatory effects across mouse and human. The findings will advance our
knowledge of the genetic architecture of alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and will shed light on AUD etiologies."
10879707,"SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle atrophy continues to be a serious consequence of many diseases and conditions for which there
is no effective treatment. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF1 (Trim63), is selectively expressed in striated muscle
and has been shown to be elevated in a myriad of atrophy-inducing conditions in both rodent and human muscle
and thus is routinely used as a marker of muscle atrophy. Given that MuRF1 is associated with multiple forms of
atrophy, and deletion can lead to partial muscle sparing, MuRF1 has been considered a strong candidate for
drug development for the treatment of muscle atrophy. However, targeting specific E3 ligases has been difficult
to achieve and thus a greater understanding of the downstream targets of MuRF1 could identify new targets for
drug development. We have recently shown that overexpression of a full length MuRF1 plasmid into multiple
hindlimb muscles of the mouse using in vivo electroporation induces significant atrophy of muscle fibers by 14
days. In an initial discovery effort, we used unbiased ubiquitin modification site-mapping (di-glycine (di-Gly)
remnants proteomics followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry and identified 169
lysine sites on 56 proteins that were differentially ubiquitinated in response to MuRF1 overexpression in skeletal
muscle. The list of putative MuRF1 substrates includes many proteins not previously linked to MuRF1. Further,
many of the putative MuRF1 substrates were ubiquitinated on a single lysine residue and were not immediately
targeted for degradation. Our recent data challenges the deeply entrenched dogma that thick filament proteins
are the sole targets of MuRF1 and that the role of MuRF1-mediated ubiquitylation is solely protein degradation.
The overall objective of the current proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which MuRF1 induces muscle
atrophy. We will use diGly remnant affinity proteomics and deuterium oxide labeling in wild type and MuRF1
knock out mice at rest and following a time-course of denervation to test the hypothesis that upregulation of
MuRF1 results in the disassembly of the sarcomere through targeted ubiquitylation of specific proteins resulting
in increased turnover of the myofibrillar proteins and a loss of fiber cross-sectional area and muscle atrophy.
Further, we hypothesize that ubiquitylation of myofibrillar proteins occurs in a stepwise manner with ubiquitylation
by MuRF1 being a priming step for further ubiquitylation by other E3 ligases. The deliverables from this
investigation will likely generate a paradigm shift in our understanding of how MuRF1 regulates muscle atrophy
and may lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of muscle wasting."
10879708,"Pathophysiology of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), including vascular cognitive impairment, remains enigmatic, and this project will take a novel focus by addressing the possible role of calcification of the intracranial vasculature. We will analyze the consequences of neurovascular calcification (NVC) on brain parenchyma and subsequent impact on cognition in a high-risk population of aging and chronic kidney disease (CKD) subjects/patients. We will delineate the specific pattern of calcification (intimal vs medial arterial/arteriolar and capillary) and analyze ischemic and hemorrhagic injury in autopsy human brain. We will also examine the process of NVC in mouse brain, its impact on parenchymal injury and cognitive impairment, and determine how it may be treated or prevented. Vascular calcification is age-dependent, and we will focus on aging in our studies. Because CKD is known to profoundly advance calcification of vasculature, we will also focus on CKD in our studies. The project team has expertise in stroke neurology, vascular neurobiology, nephrology, neuropathology, and biostatistics, all relevant to the proposal: Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between NVC and microvascular disease in CKD of aging.
Hypothesis 1A: NVC (medial vs intimal/capillary) predicts microvascular ischemic injury in autopsy brain of aged CKD subjects.
Hypothesis 1B: NVC (medial vs intimal/capillary) predicts microvascular hemorrhagic injury in autopsy brain of aged CKD subjects.
Specific Aim 2: To determine a) the effects of NVC on brain parenchyma and cognitive performance, and b) the mechanistic treatment of NVC, in aged CKD mice.
Hypothesis 2A: NVC worsens microvascular parenchymal injury and VCID with cognitive decline in aged CKD mice.
Hypothesis 2B: Anti-calcification therapies decrease NVC and parenchymal injury and improve cognitive performance in aged CKD mice.
Our proposed project combines human autopsy investigation with a relevant mouse model, designed to produce project synergy in which observations from the human study inform the mouse investigation and mouse studies suggest targetable mechanisms of NVC in human brain. Incorporation of the mouse model provides the advantage of a trial of targeted therapy for NVC, which is to the best of our knowledge the first such attempt. Our human autopsy study will compare CKD vs non-CKD subjects, and thus insights will be generated for both the CKD and non-CKD population. Completion of this project by our unique mutli- disciplinary team should pave the way for more comprehensive studies of NVC and its treatment, providing new directions in the scientific approach to ameliorating VCID, including vascular cognitive impairment."

Down syndrome (DS) is associated with executive function (EF) challenges throughout the lifespan. Although
early intervention has the potential for positive downstream effects on adaptation in DS, to date, intervention
approaches have not proactively aimed to strengthen EF foundations in ways that capitalize on early
neuroplasticity in this population. This R61/33 proposal will refine and test the effects of EXPO (EXecutive
Function Play Opportunities), a 12-week caregiver-mediated intervention designed to strengthen EF in young
children with DS. EXPO is tailored to the behavioral strengths and challenges associated with DS, thus reducing
cognitive and linguistic barriers to EF intervention participation. A preliminary implementation of EXPO during
Spring/Summer 2023 has demonstrated promising feasibility and acceptability trends, as well as preliminary
efficacy trends at the overall group level. Additionally, heterogeneity in child intervention response was also
observed, which likely corresponds to varying degrees of delay in developmental skill acquisition observed in this
population during childhood. In line with the growing recognition of the need for personalized and precision
approaches to intervention, in this project, we will transform EXPO into an adaptive intervention to better meet
the needs of children who are slower to respond to the current intervention design. During the R61 phase, we
will incorporate usability and feasibility caregiver feedback and the preliminary efficacy data from the
Spring/Summer 2023 trial to refine the structure, organization, and materials of EXPO. We anticipate that we
will develop two adaptive EXPO pathways to be subsequently tested and compared: (1) lengthening the duration
of EXPO to allow for more practice of each skill, and (2) augmenting EXPO with activities that strengthen play
foundations necessary for EXPO engagement (e.g., establishing social routines). During the R33 phase, we will
test the EXPO adaptive intervention conditions via a two-arm, Singly Randomized Trial. Findings from this
R61/33 project will yield a novel adaptive EF intervention designed to meet a wide range of needs within the
population of young children with DS, in preparation for a large Randomized Controlled Trial."
10883678,"Consortia of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have often organized around specific phenotypes
such as diabetes to discover associations with genetic variants. In contrast, the Cohorts for Heart and Aging
Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium was formed from large population-based cohort
studies to facilitate prospectively-planned GWAS meta-analyses of a wide range of phenotypes. Expanded
from the original 5 studies to 10, CHARGE cohorts have repeated measures of risk factors, subclinical
disease measures, and cardiovascular events. Their collaboration represents a unique resource for
identifying and validating genetic loci associated with a variety of cardiovascular and aging phenotypes.
Since 2011, HL105756 has supported the CHARGE consortium, which has 977 publications, many in high-
impact journals, more than 51,000 citations, and an h-index of 113. In recent years, investigators from the
CHARGE cohorts have obtained not only additional genetic data—both whole-genome sequence (WGS)
data on 54,771 participants and whole-exome sequence (WES) data on 26,383; but also a variety of omics
data, some at multiple time points, including 1) 53,780 DNA methylation assays on 38,682 participants; 2)
17,175 gene expression assays on 13,305; 3) 43,660 metabolomic assays on 34,110; and 4) 52,707
proteomics assays on 36,043. CHARGE and its 38 active Working Groups (WGs), which collaborate and
coordinate with NIH programs such as the NHLBI’s TOPMed, are well positioned to accommodate new
directions in genetic epidemiology—large-scale collaborations for discovery and the use of various methods
and omics data to define function. New to this application are the participation by the Million Veteran
Program, the transition of the CHARGE Analysis Commons to run on the NHLBI’s BioData Catalyst
ecosystem, and the addition of the CHARGE Polygenic Risk Scores, Academic Biobank, and Proteomics
WGs. The goals of this competing renewal are to accelerate discovery of mechanisms underlying diseases
of the cardiovascular system through robust analysis of genomic data and to discover the function of the
associated variants through analytic methods and integration with existing and emerging omics data. The
aims of this competing renewal application are: 1) to provide coordinating-center-like administrative support
for CHARGE, its committees, and WGs; 2) to organize two major meetings per year as well as ancillary
workshops; 3) to organize monthly webinars; 4) to provide CHARGE-meeting travel awards for early-career
investigators who submit the best abstracts; 5) to provide administrative support for the Analysis Commons
and the CHARGE dbGaP Summary Results Website; and 6) to provide modest support for the participating
cohorts and committees. For early-career investigators, who have often championed CHARGE analyses
and manuscripts, the CHARGE consortium has become a de facto international training ground for
collaborative epidemiological efforts in the genetics of aging and CVD."
10898172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is among the most common congenital infections, occurring in
approximately 1 out of every 200 pregnancies. Congenital HCMV infection can lead to a wide range of
developmental complications including intrauterine growth restriction, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly,
and fetal demise. To infect and directly damage the developing fetus, HCMV must cross the placenta, which is
the primary barrier between maternal and fetal circulation. HCMV infection has also been proposed to impair
several critical functions of trophoblasts, the predominant cell type of the placenta, suggesting HCMV infection
could indirectly damage the fetus through placental dysfunction. However, due to limited models of HCMV
infection at the maternal-fetal interface we currently have an incomplete understanding of 1) how trophoblasts
defend against HCMV and 2) how HCMV infection alters normal trophoblast function.
I propose to use trophoblast organoids (TOs) to model HCMV infection. TOs are a novel model that recapitulates
many key aspects of the cellular and immunological complexity of the human placenta. Our lab has reported that
TOs are refractory to HCMV replication. My preliminary data demonstrate that this occurs post-viral entry,
signifying that trophoblasts may express cell-intrinsic factors that restrict HCMV replication. I have preliminarily
identified that the transcription factor DUX4 and its target gene TRIM43 (a recently described herpesvirus
restriction factor) are uniquely induced following HCMV infection in TOs, suggesting this pathway may contribute
to trophoblast resistance to HCMV replication. Aberrant expression of DUX4 in adult muscle cells alters normal
cellular function and drives pathology in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. My preliminary data suggest
that DUX4 expression in trophoblasts may similarly impair normal trophoblast function. The objectives of this
proposal are to identify factors that restrict HCMV replication in trophoblasts, uncover the impacts of HCMV
infection on normal trophoblast function, and build upon TOs as a model of HCMV infection at the maternal-fetal
interface. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to determine if TRIM43 and DUX4 restrict HCMV
replication in TOs and 2) define the impacts of HCMV-induced DUX4 expression on trophoblast function.
Aim 1 will define the expression kinetics of TRIM43 and DUX4 in TOs following HCMV infection. It will then test
whether TRIM43 and DUX4 restrict HCMV replication in TOs. Finally, this aim will test whether TRIM43 and
DUX4 restrict the replication of other teratogenic herpesviruses in TOs. Aim 2 will map the trophoblast cell type-
specific transcriptional response to DUX4 expression to define potential mechanisms by which HCMV can cause
dysfunction in trophoblasts. Aim 2 will test whether HCMV-induced DUX4 expression impairs trophoblast
differentiation as well as key functions of trophoblasts such as hormone secretion and invasion. Completing the
proposed aims will provide training in several key areas, better equipping me to progress towards independence
as a scientist."
10899702,"The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a fully functional, implantable human salivary gland for patients
suffering from xerostomia, or chronic dry mouth, subsequent to radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.
Our team recently developed an immunosuppressed, irradiated human-in-miniswine animal model for preclinical
translation of a patented tissue engineered salivary tissue replacement we call the 3D-ST. This large
animal model is suitable for testing cell-based projects designed to restore salivary function that includes both
water secretion and protein/enzyme production needed to initiate digestion and maintain health of the oral
cavity. Complementing this, a radiated nude rat model we developed serves as a useful model for testing
product designs purposed to maximize biointegration including both vasculature and nerve needed for longterm
organ success. Our successful interdisciplinary team includes the Farach-Carson/Wu team at UTHealth,
the Lombaert team in Michigan, and the Swegal surgical team in Pittsburgh. Functioning at three sites, we
developed a demonstrated workflow for experimental success that takes advantage of the unique facilities at
each site. This proposal builds on our exciting supporting data using irradiated models to demonstrate the
ability of transplanted hS/PCs in the 3D-ST to restore salivary secretory function. While our work to date
showed long term (3-4 months) viability of implanted human/stem progenitor cells (hS/PCs) in the 3D-ST
construct in both immunosuppressed miniswine and nude rats, a significant hurdle remains to foster complete,
permanent biointegration of the 3D-ST with the host implant bed. Biointegration of vasculature with salivary
acini is needed to provide nutrition and to supply the fluid component of saliva. Stable innervation is critical for
glandular morphogenesis, achievement of cell polarity for directional secretion, and restoration of autonomic
stimulation of secretion. This proposal builds on our exciting supporting data to encourage transplanted human
hS/PCs to reestablish salivary secretory function and moves our focus from design optimization and implant
viability to successful functional biointegration using our two irradiated models. We hypothesize that both
vasculature and peripheral nerve integration of the 3D-ST can be achieved to stabilize the differentiated
salivary phenotype. The two aims will: 1) use a quantitative scoring system to evaluate biointegration of
vasculature and autonomic nervous system into implanted 3D-STs in irradiated animal models and determine
impact on salivary cell phenotype; and 2) evaluate the ability of the transplanted 3D-ST to restore salivary
function. Successful achievement of these aims will improve existing xenotransplant models for testing a
variety of adult stem/progenitor cell-based therapies to replace exocrine organs and open the door to first-inhuman
trials for relief of xerostomia."

The paucity of faculty from underrepresented minority (URM) groups at research-intensive institutions
represents a missed opportunity for engaging the nation’s diverse intellectual capital in solving
complex problems at the frontiers of molecular life sciences research. As a scholarly society, the
ASBMB (American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) has been at the forefront of
embracing diversity building by sponsoring career development and skills-building programs through
its Minority Affairs Committee. The experience and the infrastructure embedded within the ASBMB will
be leveraged to build a supportive community of practice for K99/R00 MOSAIC scholars, informed by
social science theory-based coaching approaches. With a membership of ~12,000, the scientific
bandwidth of the ASBMB mirrors that of the NIGMS mission itself, providing the appropriate scientific
environment for nurturing the career development of MOSAIC scholars. Recognizing the documented
importance of role models, an outstanding group of dedicated URM scientists has been assembled to
serve as coaches and program advisors under the energetic leadership of the ASBMB’s Chief
Executive, Ms. Barbara Gordon. The goals of the MOSAIC program will be achieved by: (i) Building a
supportive community of practice, guided by mentors with distinguished records of scientific and
funding success who have been trained in diversity and cultural-sensitive coaching practices. (ii)
Providing a suite of career development opportunities and sponsorship to support the personal and
professional development of MOSAIC scholars. (iii) Enhancing professional networks via the early
career reviewer program on the Journal of Biological Chemistry editorial board and linkages through
the minority affairs committee and the broader ASBMB community. (iv) Enhancing accountability by
convening a forum with faculty at host institutions of MOSAIC scholars, for exchanging evidence-
based best practices for improving mentoring and increasing success in recruitment and retention of
URM scientists. (v) Evaluating components of the MOSAIC program to assess how they contribute to
outcomes (e.g. professional progression, publications and grant awards), and disseminating lessons
learned that are transferable to other training efforts. By successfully completing these aims, the
ASBMB’s program will contribute to enhancing diversity in faculty ranks at research-intensive
academic institutions."
10900706,"Summary/ Abstract
Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) are a significant problem among older women: 13% of female
Medicare beneficiaries experience at least one UTI annually and >40% of these develop chronic recurrent UTI.
Although UTIs are significantly reduced by vaginal estrogen therapy (VET), 50% of those using VET continue
to experience UTI recurrences. It is unknown why some women benefit from VET while others do not. This
application focuses on interrogating two mechanisms likely to be central to the effectiveness of VET. The first
is the urogenital microbiota: an increase in vaginal lactobacilli is the purported mechanism by which VET
reduces rUTI. However, recent studies suggest that not all lactobacilli are equally beneficial: vaginal microbiota
dominated by L. crispatus may be more protective (possibly via the production of D-lactic acid, which inhibits E.
coli growth). Important and unanswered questions include how VET influences specific Lactobacillus spp.,
whether changes to specific Lactobacillus spp are the key to successful prophylaxis, and how VET affects the
urinary microbiota, which may play a critical role in UTI susceptibility. A second mechanism addressed by this
application is the host vaginal and urinary immune response. Estrogen appears to influence localized
urogenital immune responses, including Th17 and Th1 versus Th2 pathway signaling. Animal studies suggest
that these compartmentalized immune responses play a critical role in UTI susceptibility, but human data are
lacking. This application will address these unanswered questions. Postmenopausal women with rUTI will be
treated with VET. Samples collected before and after VET will characterize vaginal and urinary microbiota (16S
rRNA gene sequencing), soluble mediators of inflammation in both compartments, and vaginal D-lactic acid.
Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will investigate the impact of VET on the urogenital microbiota and urogenital
immune responses, respectively. Aim 3 will characterize the urogenital environments of participants who
continue to experience rUTI during VET versus those who remain UTI-free. The accomplishment of these aims
will provide pilot data for a larger and more definitive clinical trial. Thus, this application is responsive to
program announcement PAS-20-160, which supports small clinical trials to provide critical preliminary data.
This proposed research will provide data needed to plan a rigorous, adequately powered trial to identify the
characteristics associated with successful rUTI prevention. These proposed studies are a key step toward our
goals of identifying biomarkers that reliably predict a successful response to rUTI prophylaxis and ascertaining
the biological conditions required for successful UTI prevention. Ultimately, an understanding of the
mechanisms of rUTI prevention will allow the development of novel and effective prevention strategies for
postmenopausal women suffering from rUTI."
10900708,"Project Summary
Mitochondria are critical for neuronal function and must be reliably distributed throughout the entire neuron. To
maintain healthy, properly distributed mitochondria, neurons must coordinate mitochondrial dynamics,
including motility, fission and fusion, and degradation, over space and time. The broad goal of this proposal is
to define mechanisms for spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial dynamics in neurons in vivo. To that end, we
will employ an innovative in vivo imaging approach to measure mitochondrial dynamics in well-defined motion
vision neurons in Drosophila. By combining our in vivo measurements with mathematical modeling, we will
gain mechanistic insight into how neurons maintain mitochondrial homeostasis at the systems level. We
propose three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine how neurons maintain steady-state mitochondrial
distribution patterns despite high levels of mitochondrial motility within complex neuronal morphologies.
Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that neuronal architectures are optimized for the robust self-
organization of specific mitochondrial localization patterns. We will use experimental measurements of in vivo
mitochondrial motility and neuronal branching patterns to develop a quantitative model linking large-scale
mitochondrial distributions to branch scaling rules. We will test this model by predicting mitochondrial
localization patterns from experimental measurements of neuronal architecture across morphologically and
functionally diverse Drosophila visual system neurons. We will then test our model predictions by comparing to
ground truth measurements of mitochondrial distributions in EM datasets. In Aim 2 we will investigate how
proper spatiotemporal control of mitochondrial fission and fusion contributes to the maintenance of healthy
mitochondria in distal axons and dendrites. We will test the hypothesis that neurons optimize fission and fusion
rates to both maximize complementation across mitochondria and ensure efficient delivery of newly-
synthesized mitochondrial proteins to distal axons and dendrites. Finally, in Aim 3 we will probe the relationship
between neuronal activity and mitophagy rates in neurons in vivo. Altogether, this proposal promises to provide
a critical mechanistic framework for understanding how neurons regulate mitochondrial movement, fission and
fusion, and degradation to maintain healthy, properly distributed mitochondrial populations in vivo, providing
new insight into the molecular and cellular basis for neurodegenerative diseases."
10903981,"The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (ISC3) is to apply 
insights from behavioral economics to rapidly accelerate the pace at which we deploy evidence-based practices 
for patients with cancer, thereby improving cancer care quality and outcomes. Our Research Program, led by 
Drs. Beidas (implementation science expert) and Buttenheim (behavioral economics expert), will oversee the 
development and testing of implementation strategies within the Implementation Laboratory. Our implementation 
strategy design and testing approach includes the patient and clinician as targets, and is informed by behavioral 
economics to ‘nudge’ individuals to make optimal decisions for implementing evidence-based care. The Penn 
ISC3 is built on three principles. First, implementation science has not leveraged the rich literature from behav- 
ioral economics, which has elucidated many of the heuristics that underlie decisions and behaviors contributing 
to suboptimal health outcomes. Approaches from behavioral economics have not been applied systematically 
alongside implementation science to improve cancer care; these approaches aim to accelerate uptake of evi- 
dence-based practices. Second, implementation science has not applied methods to fail fast and learn quickly, 
which we will incorporate through the application of rapid cycle approaches. Third, research to identify mecha- 
nisms of the implementation strategies to improve uptake of evidence-based practices is in its infancy. The 
Research Program includes investigators with expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, can- 
cer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we 
propose three Signature Pilot Projects (SPPs) and two Methods Projects that both support the SPPs and ad- 
vance the science of implementation with an eye towards rapid learning. SPP 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- 
and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs in patients

the informatics and data management organization to execute and complete these studies. The overall Director 
for the IL will be Lawrence N. Shulman, M.D., Deputy Director for Clinical Services of the Abramson Cancer 
Center (ACC) at Penn and Director of the Center for Global Cancer Medicine. He oversees strategic develop- 
ment of cancer services for the ACC and its affiliated hospitals and clinics (i.e., all members of the IL) and leads 
the Cancer Quality program for Penn Medicine, which oversees system-wide initiatives designed to improve the 
quality of cancer care. MPI Dr. Justin Bekelman will co-lead the IL with Dr. Shulman. The overarching objective 
of the IL will be to manage the diverse clinical sites that provide cancer care under Penn Medicine to ensure the 
successful completion of the planned and future studies in the Research Program and to oversee the Penn ISC3 
informatics and data management infrastructure. Penn Medicine includes five hospitals (the Hospital of the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, 
and Lancaster General Hospital, and four community-based cancer practices (Regional Hematology Oncology 
Associates, Valley Forge Medical Center, Radnor Medical Center [staffed by clinicians from Pennsylvania Hos- 
pital], and Cherry Hill Medical Center). Within these 9 sites, there are over 200 clinicians that serve more than 
15,000 new cancer patients annually. Since the Research Program will rely heavily on the electronic medical 
record (EMR) for implementation strategy delivery and data collection, the IL will also provide the leadership, 
technical assistance, and resources needed in clinical informatics. Dr. Peter Gabriel, Chief Oncology Informatics 
Officer (COIO) for Penn Medicine, and Associate Director for Data Science for the ACC, and his team will provide

10904000,"The visual function assessment module allows non-invasive assessment of eye structure and function, which is
critical for clinically-relevant studies of the visual system employing animal models. It affords investigators the
tools necessary to systematically interrogate normal visual function and the consequences on vision when
normal processes go awry. The expertise and instrumentation available in this module exceed resources of
individual investigators’ laboratories and provide access to equipment that, if purchased by a single investigator,
would rapidly deplete precious resources. The module provides skilled expertise, training and essential, state-
of-the-art equipment to perform the following assessments: (1) electroretinography (ERG), (2) optokinetic
tracking response (OKR), (3) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), (4) fundoscopy, (5)
fluorescein angiography (FA), (6) slit-lamp biomicroscopy, (7) intraocular pressure (IOP). For ERGs, the module
offers the expertise of a highly skilled PhD electrophysiologist who can perform sophisticated retinal function
evaluation and it also offers training for investigators in execution of routine ERGs. A PhD level scientist directs
the module and provides training for laboratory personnel for other assessments (OCT, FA, OKR etc).
Instruments available in this module include the Celeris Fully Integrated High Throughput ERG Testing system,
the Phoenix MICRON Ganzfield ERG, the Bioptigen Spectral Domain Ophthalmic Imaging System (Envisu
R2200), the image-guided MICRON IV OCT, two Phoenix MICRON IV in vivo high-resolution retinal imaging
microscopes for FA and fundoscopy, the Topcon SL-DR slit-lamp and two hand-held tonometers for rapid IOP
assessment. These instruments have been widely used by a number of Culver VDI investigators resulting in
collaborations and shared publications/presentations that fully justify formalizing these services as a module.
Access to this equipment will enhance vision research for established NEI investigators, first-time NEI R01
investigators, and scientists new to the field of vision research. The activities of the core will be achieved through
the following aims: Aim 1. Provide core investigators access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for in vivo visual
function analysis and in vivo imaging of the visual system. Aim 2. Provide expert technical assistance and
training in the use of the shared instrumentation within the module. Aim 3. Maintain module instrumentation in
good working condition, manage usage in a manner that will facilitate productivity, collaboration and the
development of novel projects that address major sight-threatening diseases."

instrumentation available in this module far exceed resources of individual investigators’ laboratories. Histologic
services offered by a highly skilled technician include guidance in isolation/orientation/fixation/embedding of
ocular tissues (or cells), routine and specialized sectioning and staining, as well as training for immunodetection
studies. A PhD level scientist with extensive expertise in the visual system is available for electron microscopic
studies permitting ultrastructural analysis of ocular tissue as well as protein-protein interactions at the subcellular
level. This module features state-of-the-art imaging instrumentation including access to super resolution
microscopy, multiple confocal microscopes (upright, inverted, multiphoton) and laser capture microdissection. A
highly skilled PhD level scientist, with excellent background in vision research, oversees these instruments and
will assist investigators in generating high quality, reliable, reproducible data. She will assist users with
production of publication-quality images. The module will provide technical expertise and instrumentation to

of electron microscopy and image capture. Support of this module will provide resources needed by nearly all of
our vision researchers to engage in high impact research and discovery for patients suffering from blindness and
visual disorders."
10904003,"The gene expression and proteomics module will provide investigators with expertise in designing and
performing studies of global gene expression profiles and proteomic alterations related to diseases of the visual

global gene expression patterns. These technologies include spotted cDNA or oligonucleotide arrays, Affymetrix
GeneChip microarrays, Illumina BeadChip microarrays, and most recently next-generation sequencing
technologies including RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This Core
will use RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq for gene expression studies. Similarly, the development of Liquid-
Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) over the last decade has revolutionized proteomic analyses
through its unprecedented depth, speed and accuracy even with small volume samples. One of the latest
breakthroughs in this technology is the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer, which allows researchers to
extend the limits of proteomic analyses including post-translational modifications. We have this instrument at
Augusta University and recently, we have successfully established a protocol for the analysis of the aqueous
humor proteome using this device. These latest sequencing and mass-spec technologies, used to evaluate gene
expression and protein levels, can be intimidating to researchers, whose scientific expertise lies elsewhere. The
new technologies also present challenges associated with high throughput data analyses and interpretation. To
circumvent these hurdles, the gene expression and proteomics module is intended to guide researchers in
experimental design, sample preparation, thoughtful selection of appropriate technology, and bioinformatics
support for sequencing and proteomic profiling. In addition, the core will also help researchers with the
interpretation of results and designing further experiments for confirmation/validation of findings. The goal of
this module is to guide vision researchers with high throughput gene expression analyses (using sequencing)
and proteomic analyses (using mass-spectrometry) of ocular tissues. The services offered in this module reflect
keen awareness of the nuances related to experimentation with specialized ocular tissues and will be
accomplished in two aims. Aim 1: Provide core investigators with expert consultation, tailored to analysis of the
visual system, on experimental design, sample preparation and selection of technology to conduct gene
expression studies and/or proteomic analyses of ocular tissues. Aim 2: Provide core investigators with excellent
bioinformatics support in analyzing the large data sets that are generated following high throughput gene
expression or proteomic analyses of ocular tissues."
10899910,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis is the most commonly used federally illicit drug in the US, with rates increasing, particularly in young
adults. Since 2012, 22 states legalized cannabis for non-medical (i.e., recreational) use and have established
regulatory oversight for product safety. Meanwhile, derived psychoactive cannabis products (DPCPs; e.g., Delta-
8 THC) entered the US market as a result of the 2018 US Farm Bill, which classified cannabis products with
<0.3% Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by dry weight as hemp, making DPCPs federally legal, but
unregulated. Although some states have prohibited or regulated DPCPs, others have not addressed DPCP
legality. As a result of this complex and/or ambiguous regulatory context, DPCPs introduce new public health
concerns (e.g., use in young people, contaminants, poisonings). This line of research aims to advance evidence-
based policy and practice to reduce cannabis and DPCP use, its consequences, and related inequities. Guided
by a multilevel Social Determinants of Health lens, we will examine legal, commercial, and individual
determinants of cannabis and DPCP use outcomes. While research on the impact of legalizing non-medical
cannabis on cannabis use has yielded mixed results, cannabis marketing/retail are well-documented
determinants of cannabis perceptions (e.g., risk, social norms), use motives, and use outcomes. Limited
research has focused on DPCPs given their recent emergence. There may be similarities in determinants of
DPCP vs. cannabis use (e.g., sociodemographic correlates). However, there may be key legal and commercial
determinants that differ; for example, DPCPs may be more popular in states without legal non-medical cannabis,
and DPCPs may use distinct marketing strategies. Given the complex federal vs. state policy/regulatory context
of cannabis and DPCPs, it is crucial to understand determinants and their impact on individual cannabis and
DPCP use outcomes in order to inform laws/regulations and interventions to address use and related inequities.
Our specific aims are to: 1) examine cannabis and DPCP marketing characteristics over time (2018-2024) with
regard to regulatory context and potential target consumers, using existing marketing surveillance data; 2)
examine associations between cannabis and DPCP state policy, marketing, individual determinants
(perceptions, use motives), use, and related consequences (e.g., driving after use), using longitudinal data of
4,000 young adults ages 18-34 in an ongoing R01; and 3) qualitatively assess young adults’ cannabis- and
DPCP-specific experiences with, and perceptions of, legal and commercial determinants of cannabis and DPCP
use (via semi-structured interviews). Building on Dr. LoParco’s existing knowledge and skills, the training goals
focus on: 1) legal and commercial determinants of health; 2) qualitative/mixed methods research and advanced
quantitative analysis; and 3) professional development. This study will yield novel, high-impact, policy-relevant
findings and uses rigorous methods to address NIDA research priorities and will facilitate the successful launch
of Dr. LoParco’s independent research career focused on cannabis policy, industry, and population impact."
10900182,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Gene expression is a complex process involving transcription, translation, and the turnover of mRNAs
and proteins. Proper spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression and protein abundance plays a crucial role
in guiding the differentiation of the fertilized egg into a complex animal. Understanding the regulation of protein
dynamics can provide valuable insights into the differentiation of germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm,
ectoderm), as well as the development of specialized cells and tissues.
 However, quantifying lineage-specific protein dynamics in developing embryos is challenging due to
technical limitations in single-cell proteomics and the inherent heterogeneity of embryonic tissues. As a result,
researchers have often used mRNA levels as a proxy for protein expression, but this approach has significant
limitations due to the poor correlation between mRNA and protein levels. This discrepancy highlights the
importance of posttranscriptional mechanisms, such as protein degradation and translation efficiencies, in
determining cell fate.
 To address these issues and enhance our understanding of embryogenesis, it is crucial to measure
proteome dynamics during cell differentiation directly. These measurements will provide a more
comprehensive and accurate view of the intricate processes at play during embryonic development. This study
proposes using genetically modified morphogen-flattened Drosophila embryos expressing four morphogens
uniformly. These embryos contain a uniform cell type at gastrulation, different for each morphogen-flattened
embryo. The focus will be on quantifying protein dynamics and posttranscriptional regulation within the
ectoderm germ layer. My approach involves deep multiplexed proteomics and single-cell RNAseq to analyze
proteome differentiation and stochastic cell fate diversification (Aim 1 & 2). Additionally, by achieving the
desired outcomes of measuring posttranscriptional regulation (translation efficiency and protein turnover) in
Aim 3, the proposed mathematical model will provide valuable insights into mRNA-protein dynamics during cell
differentiation in developing embryos, which will address some of the discrepancies between the two.
 In conclusion, this proposal aims to decipher the mechanisms of embryonic cell-type differentiation by
using morphogen-flattened embryos and employing an integrative analysis of genomics and proteomics
measurements. This comprehensive approach will yield valuable insights into the intricate interplay of
transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation during development, enhancing our understanding of the
fundamental principles in embryonic development and informing strategies for manipulating cell fate in
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering."

10901726,"Project Summary:
Monoterpenoid bisindole alkaloids are a broad class of natural products that includes members which have been
demonstrated to disrupt protein–protein interactions in human cancer cells. These dimeric compounds consist
of two independently biosynthesized monoterpenoid indole alkaloids unified by a C–C bond. Bisindole alkaloids
display an assortment of biological activities, such as nitrous oxide synthase inhibition and multidrug resistance
reversal, and includes the FDA-approved anticancer drugs vinblastine and vincristine. Despite their potential to
serve as pharmaceuticals or lead compounds, there have been relatively few total syntheses of any members of
this class; this is due to the challenges encountered with synthesizing the two complex and structurally unique
monomers followed by unifying them into a sterically congested product. Furthermore, most approaches to date
have relied on biomimetic strategies, which are not amenable to synthesizing analogs to explore the structure-
activity relationship of these molecules. The studies described in this proposal seek to develop modular and
convergent strategies for the enantioselective syntheses of bisindole dimers and non-natural analogs. The
rationale for the proposed research is that efficient access to bisindole alkaloids will increase their accessibility
and allow for in-depth biological evaluation. Furthermore, a modular approach can be adapted for the synthesis
of analogs to enable structure activity relationship studies into this potent class of molecules. This will be realized
through two specific aims centered on the synthesis and evaluation of these complex, biologically relevant
molecules. In Aim 1, a robust enantioselective total synthesis of melodinine J, a never-before-synthesized
bisindole dimer which has demonstrated cytotoxicity levels similar to the chemotherapeutic vinorelbine, will be
developed. The route will feature a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric alkylation and target highly oxidized indole
alkaloids, derivatives of which have been implicated to bind to tubulin. The synthesis will expand the scope of
the Petasis reaction as a robust means to unite the two monomers in a late-stage, convergent manner. Aim 2
will involve the generation of a library of non-natural bisindole alkaloids to enable biological assays and structure-
activity relationship studies. Strategies will be developed for the modular, assembly-line synthesis of analogs
that can vary the nature of the linker with fine-tuned precision. This work would positively affect human health by
deepening our molecular-level understanding of the roles these potent compounds and their linkers play in
mediating biological processes."
10904637,"The Gatlinburg Conference on Research in ID/DD is an annual scientific meeting designed to advance
translational biobehavioral research on intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The meeting provides
a forum for investigators at all career stages to present and discuss cutting-edge biobehavioral research and
theory. The conference focuses on communicating state-of-the-art advances in our understanding of the
causes and consequences of various disorders involving intellectual disability, as well as to reveal new
interventions designed to ameliorate specific disorders. Each year’s conference has a scientific theme that is
explored through plenary lectures, although symposia or poster sessions address a broad range of topics on
IDD from basic to translational and applied science. The themes are designed to expose participants to
theoretical frameworks, methods, and findings from other disciplines and fields of study, including from basic
and translational neuroscience, as well as fields focused on cultural influences on development and IDD.
Historically, the specific aims of the Gatlinburg Conference have been to (a) promote the exchange of scientific
findings, theoretical perspectives, and methodological innovations and thereby accelerate, and encourage
innovation in, translational research on IDD, (b) facilitate collaborative interdisciplinary research on IDD, (c)
ensure that biobehavioral scientists are exposed to relevant translational and basic science findings, methods,
and perspectives from neurobiology and medicine, thereby enriching their research and further supporting
interdisciplinarity, and (d) serve as an interdisciplinary training and career development resource for graduate
students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. More recently the aims have been modified to include
goals to increase the diversity of the IDD research community by supporting the development of early career
scientists from under-represented groups. These successful aims are largely unchanged from the previously
funded application; however, the current proposal includes several innovations related to communication of
science to nonscientific audiences, and an emphasis on rigor and reproducibility in research, both of which
dovetail well with the conference’s longstanding emphasis on the development of junior scientists."
10904639,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In contrast to other resistant bacteria, virtually no antibiotics are in the pipeline to deal with XDR A. baumannii.
There is a critical need for new strategies to prevent and treat these infections. We spent the first grant period
raising MAbs to A. baumannii capsule, and have now identified 4 anti-capsular MAbs (2 of which were used to
generate a bi-specific MAb, leaving us with 3 MAb molecules) that collectively bind to 80-90% of US clinical
isolates and protect mice from lethal infection. These 3 lead candidates are all highly potent, achieving 100%
protection in bacteremia models at single doses of ≤ 50 µg. They are also protective in pneumonia models of
infection, and synergize with antibacterials. Furthermore, the bi-specific MAb has increased potency compared
to each of its individual MAbs, and retains binding for all target strains, and efficacy in vivo. This lead three-
MAb therapeutic has begun translation into full GMP and toxicity, planning for a future Phase I clinical trial.
 Our goals for the renewal are to enhance feasibility of clinical development and deployment of the
MAbs by closing any coverage gaps against international strains, defining surrogate efficacy markers, and
validating key assays to support clinical trials and future clinical deployment. We have obtained a new global
strain collection, and entered into key partnerships to further these aims, including experts at multi-valent MAb
synthesis, clinical microbiology laboratory operations, and statistics. Our Aims are to:
Specific Aim 1: Define and optimize strain coverage and surrogate efficacy markers for international
clinical strains of A. baumannii. We have collected 50 strains each from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, China,
Europe, and South America. We will survey our 3 MAbs against all acquired strains, assessing flow binding
and macrophage uptake, and will assess efficacy in our IV bacteremia model for representative strains. We
will raise news MAbs as needed to close international strain coverage gaps.
Specific Aim 2: Validate bioassays to enable clinical trials of the MAbs, including potency and human
surrogate efficacy markers. We will validate LC-MS/MS for the specific amino acid sequences of our
variable regions to quantify our MAbs when spiked into human blood, distinct from background antibodies. We
will adapt our well-established HL-60 assays to quantify opsonic activity of MAb in human plasma. Finally, we
will use multiplex Luminex assays to quantify cytokine modulation of fresh human leukocytes.
Specific Aim 3: Optimize a rapid in vitro binding assay as a “susceptibility testing”-equivalent to
support clinical trials and deployment of the MAbs. We will validate rapid, high throughput flow binding
assays to correlate with protection in mice as a “susceptibility-test equivalent”.
Novel solutions for A. baumannii infections are a critical unmet need. We have developed a promising MAb
regimen that improves outcomes during blood and lung infection in mice. We will define global strain
coverage, close any identified gaps, and develop bioassays to support clinical testing of the MAbs."

The purpose of this program is to provide rigorous multidisciplinary research training for physician-scientists
and PhD postdoctoral fellows in cardiovascular research. Our training program incorporates two guiding
principles: 1) biomedical research requires teams of investigators with diverse scientific backgrounds and
complementary expertise, and 2) there are no shortcuts to a career in cardiovascular research; rigorous
didactic training, structured mentorship, a focused research project, and constructive feedback are required.
The program is centered in the University of Pennsylvania Cardiovascular Institute (CVI), which includes 115
members across multiple university departments performing a broad spectrum of cardiovascular science.
Considerable support from the School of Medicine is committed to the program, including integrated basic and
translational research space and core laboratories in the Smilow Center for Translational Research. This
renewal application will support 7 MD, MD/PhD, and PhD postdoctoral fellows per year performing 2-3 years of
dedicated research training. Thirty-eight NIH-funded Penn CVI faculty in the Departments of Medicine,
Surgery, Cell and Developmental Biology, Genetics, Physiology, Systems Pharmacology and Therapeutics,
and Bioengineering serve as trainers and mentors. Three tracks have been created. The Basic Track prepares
trainees for careers in cardiovascular science using laboratory approaches. The Clinical/Translational Track
prepares trainees for research careers at the interface of laboratory science and clinical investigation, including
deep-phenotyping in human subjects, applied genomics, novel devices, and therapeutics. The
Outcomes/Health Services Research Track prepares trainees for careers that leverage big data to improve
health care delivery. The core of our curriculum is a supervised research preceptorship. Training is
supplemented with didactic classwork, lectures, seminars, skills classes, and Master’s level research training.
Over the past 15 years metrics of the program’s success include: 1) recruitment of outstanding MD, MD/PhD
and PhD trainees, 2) > 95% of trainees completing the program (several having obtained advanced degrees),
3) an average of 4.3 manuscripts published per trainee (many in high-impact journals), 4) a vast majority of
trainees moving on to research careers or additional postdoctoral studies. Programmatic enhancements
include new leadership and discovery units in the Penn CVI; new translational programs in the Cardiovascular
Division; an expanded roster of Program Directors, Co-Directors, and Faculty Trainers, including women, URM
and early career trainers; a renewed external advisory committee; new themes, including bioinformatics, data
science, social determinants of disease, and the impact of COVID-19; and new structures to promote cross-
disciplinary interaction, team science, and peer mentoring. Finally, we have substantially updated our plans to
recruit and retain diverse trainees, fully leveraging institutional, departmental, and divisional initiatives."
10901452,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (PCLM) is present in 50% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and has a median survival of <6 months. Recent studies in mice found that modulating
the gut microbiome can reduce PCLM tumor burden by augmenting anti-tumor immunity. The gut microbiome is
constantly producing antigens the travel to the liver. This suggests that gut microbiome modulation induces
PCLM anti-tumor immunity by altering the antigens presented in the liver, however the mechanism is unclear.
Mucosal Associate Invariant T (MAIT) cells are an innate subset of T cells which can be classified into two
phenotypes: an “anti-tumor” MAIT1 or a “pro-tumor” MAIT17 phenotype. MAIT cells closely interact with gut
microbiome derived antigens through their activation mechanisms, and this can shift their phenotype. Direct
activation leads to a MAIT17 phenotype, involving interactions with microbial riboflavin synthesis pathway-
derived metabolite ligands presented on antigen presenting cells (APCs) via MHCI related protein (MR1).
Indirect activation induces a MAIT1 phenotype by stimulating MAIT cell IL-12 and IL-18 receptors15. These
cytokines are released by APCs upon stimulation by microbial-produced ligands. Consequently, the goal of this
project is to harness the gut microbiome to modulate MAIT cell phenotypes towards treatment of PCLM.
Preliminary data suggests that MR1 expression is upregulated in the PCLM tumor microenvironment (TME)
which promotes a pro-tumor MAIT17 phenotype via direct MAIT cell activation. This suggests an abundance of
gut microbiome derived MR1 ligands in the PCLM TME. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that gut microbiome
dysregulation provides MR1 ligands to the PCLM TME which promotes PCLM via inducing a MAIT 17 phenotype.
We will test this by 1) Correlating the abundance of MR1 ligands in the PCLM TME with the MAIT17 phenotype;
2) Determining the gut microbiome composition of mice with PCLM by shotgun metagenomic sequencings; 3)
characterizing how a MAIT17 phenotype promotes PCLM tumor burden by single cell RNA sequencing.
Further preliminary data shows that promoting a MAIT1 phenotype reduces PCLM tumor burden. Also, gut
microbiome depletion by antibiotic treatment (ABX) promotes a MAIT1 phenotype, which likely promotes anti-
tumor TH1 cells, in the liver. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that ABX reduces MR1 ligands in the PCLM TME which
promotes a MAIT1 phenotype and anti-tumor immunity. We will test this by 1) Investigating the MAIT cell
phenotype in PCLM+ABX mice and validating by fecal microbiome transfers; 2) Determining the gut microbiome
composition following ABX; 3) Probing anti-tumor immunity in the PCLM+ABX TME by imaging mass cytometry.
These studies will identify MAIT cells as the missing link between the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immunity
and will affect how PCLM and other liver conditions are treated. This research plan and my outlined training plan
are supported by exceptional institutional support and by an exceptional mentorship team. This will provide an
unmatched multidisciplinary research and clinical training experience that perfectly aligns with my career goals."
10901501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Anarthria, a loss of the ability to articulate speech, can be a severe symptom of neurological conditions,
including paralysis, stroke, and motor neuron disease. Invasive speech neuroprostheses that decode cortical
activity into intended speech have potential to restore naturalistic and rapid communication to patients with
anarthria and paralysis by bypassing diseased motor pathways. Speech decoding has expanded rapidly in recent
years. Multiple studies have demonstrated that English phrases may be decoded from cortical activity in
participants with anarthria. While these are critical milestones, an ideal speech neuroprosthesis would fully
restore communication to any person living with paralysis, regardless of their language background.
 Currently, over half the world is bilingual with proficiency in at least two languages. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative research has demonstrated that bilingual speakers use each language in distinct social contexts
and report that their two languages contribute unique dimensions to their overall personality and worldview.
Despite this, prior speech decoding studies have exclusively focused on monolingual decoding. A key challenge
in developing a bilingual speech neuroprosthesis is decoding the intended language of the user in addition to
specific phrase content. Prior neuroscientific studies of bilingual speech have not provided a clear consensus on
the representation and localization of cortical activity patterns that are language-specific or shared across
languages. Thus, to develop a bilingual neuroprosthesis, we must first understand the basic cortical mechanisms
that underlie bilingual speech. Based on our preliminary data and prior literature, we hypothesize that lexical
access is language-specific and supported by higher-order speech regions (i.e., inferior frontal gyrus) whereas
vocal-tract articulation is shared and supported by the speech sensorimotor cortex (SMC). We hypothesize that
these representations will be sufficient to decode both intended language and specific phrase content in
participants with anarthria. SMC articulatory activity, specifically, may facilitate rapid generalizability of decoders
across languages.
 To test these hypotheses, we propose studying bilingual speakers and bilingual participants with
anarthria, using high spatio-temporal resolution electrocorticography (ECoG). In aim 1, we will record cortical
activity while bilingual speakers produce a large set of unique English and Spanish phrases, allowing us to
assess whether shared or language-specific cortical activity underlies bilingual lexical access and articulation. In
aim 2, we will develop algorithms, in bilingual participants with anarthria, to decode cortical activity into intended
language and phrases. Finally, in aim 3, we will explore which cortical representations and regions allow content
decoders to rapidly generalize across languages, reducing training times for system users."

with negative consequences including binge drinking and an increased risk for developing Alcohol Use Disorder
(AUD). However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the rewarding effects of alcohol in social contexts
are largely unknown. Of note, in contrast to real-world settings, paradigms employed in extant neuroimaging
research predominantly feature solitary drinking followed by isolated recording settings. This stark discrepancy
between laboratory and real-world drinking contexts may hinder scientists from directly examining the
foundational research question of what makes alcohol rewarding. The long-term objective of the proposed study
is to address this research gap, using novel alcohol administration methods combined with electrophysiological
measures through a hyperscanning EEG setup (i.e., simultaneous recording of EEG signals across multiple
participants) in the context of in-vivo social settings. Specifically, in line with NIAAA Strategic Plan (Goal 1.1),
the proposed project aims to evaluate the neural correlates of social and affective reward gained from alcohol in
social contexts as well as to assess whether this reward differs across individual-level (e.g., social anxiety, social
bonding) and group-level (social familiarity) factors. The proposed research represents a unique contribution to
my sponsor’s ongoing Ro1 study which, once completed, will represent among the larger multi-dose alcohol
administration studies conducted to date. In the parent project, participants (N=240) attend three laboratory
sessions involving alcohol administration in groups of two. The proposed project examines a subset of these
participants, exploring the effects of alcohol dose (0.00%, 0.03%, and 0.09% target BAC) and social familiarity
(“fast friends” vs. strangers) as factors manipulated both within and between participants, respectively.
Following beverage administration, dyads will participate in a music-listening task together while their EEG
signals are acquired simultaneously. Participants will additionally complete self-report measures of social reward
using multiple indicators, including reports of affective experience, positive mood, and social bonding. The
results of this study promise a range of theoretical and clinical implications, advancing theoretical models of
AUD vulnerability within a bio-psycho-social framework and informing prevention and intervention programs
by identifying real-world “high-risk” settings associated with enhanced alcohol reinforcement. In addition, and
of note, this award will provide critical training to an emerging predoctoral researcher in advanced programming
and research skills while at the same time offering experience in modern EEG/ERP methods to develop the
applicant’s expertise in the area of etiological factors undergirding the development of AUD."
10900904,"PROJECT SUMMARY. In adult vertebrates, various populations of radial glia-like cells (RGLCs) have been
associated with neurogenesis, playing a similar role to that of their embryonic counterparts, the radial glia, from
which they originate. These cells have also been shown to play a pivotal role in driving nervous system
regeneration in echinoderms, a group of animals with extensive capacity for regenerating their central nervous
system (CNS). In these animals, RGLCs give rise to glia and neurons of regenerated radial nerve cords (RNCs).
RNCs are ganglionated nerves, similar to the vertebrate spinal cord, composed of neurons, glia, and fiber tracts.
The sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima, a member of the Echinodermata phylum, has been extensively studied
to understand the regenerative role of RGLCs and the genetic molecules that facilitate the process. In a collection
of articles dating back two decades, it has been demonstrated that: (1) that adult sea cucumbers are capable of
complete regeneration after RNC transection, (2) the regeneration process has been characterized at the cellular
level, and (3) a RGLC population has been shown to mediate CNS regeneration. The aim of this project is to
identify molecular markers of the echinoderm RGLCs and their mode of action in mediating RNC regeneration.
One glial type, the RGLC, has been shown to exist in H. glaberrima. However, complete understanding of this
cell has been limited by the availability of RGLC markers. Hence, Specific aim 1 will determine the presence of
vertebrate RGLC markers in the holothurian glial population. This will determine if different types of RGLCs are
present and will test the hypothesis that echinoderm RGLC are evolutionarily related to vertebrate radial glia.
This will be achieved using an RNC transcriptome and gene presence validation via in situ hybridization. In this
way, description of the RGLC population and new tools to study the echinoderm glial population will be provided.
The initial event during H. glaberrima early-stage nervous tissue regeneration is the de-differentiation of RGLCs.
De-differentiation is a hallmark of the regeneration processes in multiple tissues of echinoderms and those
vertebrates with high regenerative potential, such as salamanders and zebrafish. Therefore, there is a need to
understand the gene activation pathways that regulate cell de-differentiation and their impact on regeneration.
Specific aim 2 will address this issue, by focusing on possible transcription factors associated with the de-
differentiation event. Initially, it will be on two TFs: Klf1/2/4 and SoxC by determining their spatial temporal
expression in the RNCs and their potential roles during RGLC de-differentiation. Preliminary data has shown
differential gene expression of both factors. Future studies will validate their presence in RGLCs, and knockdown
experiments will provide further insight regarding the association between them and RGLC de-differentiation.
This project will achieve a comprehension of the genetic elements involved in echinoderm CNS regeneration, by
underpinning knowledge that will help overcome the regenerating barrier present in mammals. The present study
anticipates holothurians RGLC as a model to understand their potential as stem cell therapeutic targets."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are among the most common nosocomial infections and are often
caused by Proteus mirabilis. CAUTIs are also often polymicrobial, and the most common and persistent co-colonizing
partners are P. mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. Polymicrobial CAUTIs are typically more severe and associated with
increased patient risk, treatment failure, and secondary bacteremia. The prevalence of co-colonization of P. mirabilis with
and E. faecalis combined with the increased severity of disease suggest that disrupting polymicrobial interactions between
these species could be beneficial for enhancing treatment efficacy. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge in current
understanding of mechanisms and clinical relevance of polymicrobial interactions with respect to CAUTI progression and
disease severity. Addressing this gap has the potential to inform development of novel therapeutics to disrupt disease-
enhancing interactions and guiding best practices for clinical interventions. Our preliminary data indicate that
polymicrobial biofilms formed by P. mirabilis and E. faecalis exhibit increased biomass and antibiotic resistance and
revealed P. mirabilis RTX proteins as the most enriched factor in the polymicrobial biofilm. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that P. mirabilis RTX proteins form an integral structural component of the polymicrobial biofilm and mediate
aggregation with other uropathogens, thereby contributing to the establishment and severity of polymicrobial CAUTI. We
will address this hypothesis by completing two specific aims: 1) Examine the expression of P. mirabilis RTX proteins
during polymicrobial biofilm formation and determine their contribution to biofilm architecture, adhesion, and mediating
bacteria-bacteria interactions. 2) Determine the contribution of P. mirabilis RTX proteins to pathogenesis of polymicrobial
CAUTI. In terms of the first aim, the role of P. mirabilis RTX proteins in polymicrobial biofilms are already underway
utilizing the clinically relevant P. mirabilis HI4320 strain. The media conditions, time-scale, and polymicrobial mixtures
in which P. mirabilis RTX proteins mediate attachment to abiotic and biotic surfaces and biofilm formation will be
determined utilizing traditional 24-well plate biofilm assay and the more physiologically-relevant glass bladder model. A
major training goal of this project is the implementation of high-resolution microscopy techniques to examine spatial
distribution of bacteria within polymicrobial catheter biofilms. Together, this aim will provide insight into the role of P.
mirabilis RTX proteins in polymicrobial biofilms as well as development of a new protocol for visualizing intact biofilms
on clinically relevant surfaces. For the second aim, the established mouse model of CAUTI will be utilized to determine
the role of P. mirabilis RTX proteins in establishment, persistence, and pathogenesis of polymicrobial CAUTI. The
proposed research is significant because it will illuminate a mechanism through which common uropathogens interact
with each other to establish persistent colonization, both on catheter surfaces and within a relevant host model. This
knowledge can be leveraged to find develop novel compounds capable of disrupting these disease-promoting interactions
to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare cost and burden of CAUTI."

Mounting evidence indicates that vascular damage and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction contribute to the
progression of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs). However, it remains challenging to study
and understand connections between BBB dysfunction and ADRDs. In vitro BBB models represent valuable
tools for investigating vascular contributions to ADRDs due to higher throughput and ease of manipulation.
Historically, in vitro BBB models were constructed from primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)—
the principal functional component of the BBB—but after removal from the brain, BMECs rapidly de-differentiate
and lose BBB-specific properties that are crucial for studying ADRDs. Strategies have been developed to
differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endothelial cells with BBB attributes, but such
approaches remain imperfect even after a decade of refinement. For example, iPSC-derived cells with a strong
BBB phenotype lack robust endothelial character, but artificial reinforcement of endothelial identity via
transcription factor overexpression completely ablates BBB properties. Conversely, efforts to imbue endothelial
progenitors or mature endothelial cells with a BBB phenotype, through transgene overexpression or small
molecule and growth factor treatments, have been largely ineffective. In vivo, BBB development is driven
specifically by Wnt7a, and this Wnt ligand can only be transduced into active β-catenin signaling when membrane
receptors GPR124 and RECK are present on the endothelium—for example, deletion of Wnt7a, GPR124, or
RECK activity yields defects in BBB and neurovascular development. Given the importance of this pathway for
BBB development, we hypothesize that specific activation of Wnt7 signaling in naïve iPSC-derived endothelial
progenitors will impart representative BBB identity more effectively than prior efforts using generic activation of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We will investigate this hypothesis using CRISPR and synthetic biology approaches to
activate Wnt7 signaling in naïve iPSC-derived endothelial progenitors in simple two-dimensional models (Aim 1)
and more complex three-dimensional neurovascular assemblies (Aim 2). Outcomes from this project are
expected to yield improved in vitro human BBB models that are better suited for studying causes and impacts of
vascular disturbance in ADRDs."

The University of Minnesota's R25 Short-Term Training Research Education Program has demonstrated
remarkable success in advancing diversity in the nation's biomedical workforce over the course of 15 years. With
a commitment to fostering inclusivity and empowering underrepresented students, the program has provided
vital support to 294 talented undergraduate individuals from diverse backgrounds, propelling them towards
successful baccalaureate degrees. 70% of former students embarked on advanced biomedical degrees,
including MD, PhD, and MD/PhD degrees. These outcomes firmly establish our R25 program as a potent catalyst
for nurturing diverse and skilled researchers. Building on its achievements, our program is steadfast in its vision
to sustain and strengthen its commitment to diversity and educational excellence in the biomedical field. We
request continued funding support to focus on sustaining participant diversity by actively recruiting a diverse and
academically qualified group of 12 R25 grant-eligible students from local community colleges and nationwide
each year (Aim 1). These promising trainees will be offered an enriching ten-week independent research
experience mentored by distinguished faculty, while also benefiting from a wide array of enrichment activities.
Workshops on responsible research conduct, scientific communication, graduate school applications, career
mentoring, and addressing issues like implicit bias and imposter syndrome will serve as empowering tools for
these aspiring researchers, helping them overcome barriers and succeed in their biomedical careers. In Aim 2,
the R25 program centers around strengthening its Pre-Medical Scientist Training Program (Pre-MSTP) module,
which has already achieved significant success with a remarkable 33% of alumni enrolled in or having graduated
from MD/PhD programs. In Aim 3, the R25 program aspires to forge new frontiers of inclusivity by developing an
innovative research training module tailored explicitly to the unique needs of community college transfer
students, known as Bio-LEAP (Biomedical Life Science Enrichment for Academic Progress). With a keen
recognition of the vast population of underrepresented students transferring from community colleges to the
University of Minnesota, the Bio-LEAP module will prioritize engaging and nurturing this dynamic group. By
providing tailored research training experience, the Bio-LEAP module seeks to facilitate a smoother transition to
UMN, positively impacting academic progress toward a bachelor's degree, fostering a passion for research, and
ultimately increasing their success in matriculating into competitive advanced biomedical degree programs. In
summary, our proposed aims will enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce, nurture a diverse
generation of well-prepared researchers, and make a lasting positive impact on the mission of the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, fostering excellence and inclusivity in the biomedical research community."
10904946,"Project Summary / Abstract
Tumorigenesis requires cells to bypass or escape two discrete and distinctive anti-proliferative barriers:
replicative senescence and crisis. Senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest, activated as a primary response
to telomere deprotection and involves stimulation of the tumor suppressor pathways p53-p21WAF1 and/or p16INK4A-
Rb. Disruption of cell-cycle checkpoints renders cells capable of bypassing senescence and continuing
proliferation, while telomeres shorten further. Eventually such cells initiate a terminal response called replicative
crisis, during which critically short telomeres become subject to end-to-end fusions, resulting in massive cell
death. On rare occasion, a small group of cells will emerge spontaneously from crisis and evolve towards
malignancy, yet the mechanisms underlying cell death in crisis and crisis escape are not defined. Dr. Joe Nassour
has recently discovered an unrecognized function for macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) in the elimination
of cells during crisis. Autophagy is therefore an essential component of the crisis response required for the
removal of cells at risk for malignant transformation. This suggests that autophagy defects can be the molecular
basis for tumorigenesis.
In his Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) proposal, Dr. Nassour, together with his Mentor Dr. Jan
Karlseder, and his Co-Mentors Dr. Reuben Shaw, Dr. Martin Hetzer, and Dr. Peter Adams, designed a dedicated
training plan and proposed a research project that sets out to dissect the molecular basis of mammalian
autophagy and its potential therapeutic role in the earliest stages of human cancer. In particular, Dr. Nassour will
focus on deciphering the mechanism of autophagy-dependent cell death in crisis (Aim 1), elucidating the
interplay between autophagy and genome stability (Aim 2), and evaluating the role of autophagy in neoplastic
transformation through crisis escape (Aim 3). The in vivo relevance of Aim 3 will be examined by employing
knockout and transgenic mouse models susceptible to telomere dysfunction-driven carcinogenesis. The
occurrence of cellular crisis in tissues and the impact of autophagy on tumor incidence will be examined. This
research will provide new insights into the function of autophagy in cancer biology, and should provide a rationale
for developing autophagy modulation approaches to ameliorate the efficacy of cancer therapy.
Dr. Nassour’s training plan will provide all the necessary professional development to direct an independent
laboratory using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based ‘omics’ approaches and transgenic mouse models to
define the mechanisms and function of autophagy in cancer. Training modules in this award include:
Computational analysis and bioinformatics for NGS data, methods for handling and restraint in the mouse,
transgenic mouse technology, and mentorship skills such as teaching and grant writing; which will all be
necessary for the success following the transition to independence."

Typhoid fever is a leading cause of invasive bacterial illness and death worldwide, with
the majority of infections occurring in low- and middle-income countries where water and
sanitation infrastructure is poor. Highly antimicrobial-resistant strains of Salmonella
Typhi have been emerging and spreading internationally and intercontinentally, posing
the risk of rising morbidity among reduced effectiveness of therapy. New typhoid
conjugate vaccines have demonstrated a high level of effectiveness and are
recommended by the WHO; however, many countries lack data on typhoid incidence, as
the only reliable tool for typhoid diagnosis—blood culture—is not widely available in
many resource-constrained settings where typhoid risk may be greatest. To address
these gaps, we propose to leverage a large, cluster-randomized trial of a typhoid
conjugate vaccine being performed in Vellore, India, to test three emerging tools to
measure community burden of typhoid: 1) seroepidemiological models, utilizing recently
characterized seroresponses to S. Typhi antigens; 2) detection of S. Typhi-specific
bacteriophages in wastewater, using low-cost assays; 3) phylodynamic methods that
track measures of transmission intensity. This project will provide rigorous testing of
multiple innovative methods amid uniquely intensive clinical surveillance in a vaccine
trial. Overall, this project will address a critical need for public health tools to make
typhoid surveillance scalable in resource-constrained settings, to inform vaccine
introductions and monitor their impact."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of the deadliest infectious disease, tuberculosis (TB).
Ten percent of immunocompetent individuals exposed to Mtb develop active TB, where others will contain the
pathogen in a latent state or clear the infection. The host factors that determine the outcome of infection are
poorly understood as a result of the complex relationship between Mtb and the host. Neutrophils have been
identified as the most abundant and the predominantly infected cell type in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, resected
necrotic lung tissue, and sputum of patients with active TB. Despite the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of
infection, there is no restriction of Mtb growth. Neutrophils quickly phagocytose and sense Mtb, leading to rapid
induction of type I interferon (IFN). Mtb-infected neutrophils also degranulate and release neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs), suggesting that following infection these responses are regulated in a way that favors the patho-
gen’s growth. One Mtb factor that has been implicated in promoting survival and growth in neutrophils is the
Type VII Secretion System (T7SS), ESX-1. ESX-1 has been well studied in macrophages where it inhibits phag-
osome maturation, causes phagosome damage, and induces production of type I IFN. This proposal will test the
hypothesis that ESX-1 activity dysregulates neutrophil responses to promote Mtb growth. In Aim 1, I will monitor
granule fusion, NADPH oxidase recruitment, and galectin recruitment to the phagosome during neutrophil infec-
tion with wildtype (WT), ΔESX-1, and the complemented strain ΔESX-1::ESX-1 to directly determine how ESX-
1 affects intracellular trafficking and phagosomal damage. I will inhibit phagosome trafficking during neutrophil
infection with ΔESX-1 and assess bacterial survival to determine if intracellular trafficking is required to control
ΔESX-1 Mtb. Additionally, I will use bulk RNA sequencing following neutrophil infection with WT, ΔESX-1, and
CS Mtb as an unbiased method to complement direct testing of phagosome trafficking and damage. In Aim 2, I
will assess NET release and the kinetics of NETosis during neutrophil infection with WT, ΔESX-1, and ΔESX-
1::ESX-1 Mtb to determine the role of ESX-1 in NETosis. We have discovered that type I IFN signaling is required
to release NETs. Therefore, this aim will also investigate the role of ESX-1 in type I IFN signaling to determine
the relationship between the T7SS and NET release. To determine if NET release is sufficient for Mtb growth, I
will induce NETosis during ΔESX-1 infection and measure bacterial survival. The proposed aims will elucidate
the mechanism by which ESX-1 promotes Mtb survival and growth in the neutrophil, ultimately providing insight
into the contributions of neutrophils to TB pathogenesis."

 Intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae represents an urgent public
health threat, promoting the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and leading to severe and
often lethal infections. Multiple avenues of protection exist in the gut to defend against potentially pathogenic
organisms, with bacteriophages constituting a crucial node of control over bacterial invasion and expansion.
However, given that bacteria encode a variety of defense pathways to ward off phage predation, the activity of
phage defense systems may serve an essential role in modulating the colonization potential and pathogenicity
of intestinal microbes. The investigation of phage defense mechanisms and their roles in bacterial pathogenesis
is therefore critical for understanding the proliferation of MDR Enterobacteriaceae in the context of the intestinal
microbiome. Additionally, detailed study of phage defense systems has the potential to guide the engineering of
phages as alternatives to antibiotic treatment, an emerging strategy that is already showing considerable promise
in the treatment of MDR infections.
 A group of reverse transcriptase (RT) genes that is broadly represented in Enterobacteriaceae has
recently been discovered to function in phage defense. However, the mechanistic link between their RNA-
templated DNA synthesis activity and antiphage immunity remains puzzling. This proposal aims to investigate
the functions of defense-associated RTs (DRTs) in phage defense, and evaluate their contributions to the
pathogenicity of intestinal microbes. Aim 1 will focus on the development of an unbiased experimental approach
for discovering the in vivo RNA substrates and cDNA products of RTs, and will apply this approach to study
diverse DRT systems. Aim 2 will utilize biochemical and genetics assays to determine the minimal components
underlying DRT activity. Aim 3 will leverage a combination of genetic screening and in vivo bacterial pathogenesis
modeling to investigate how dynamic interactions between phages and DRTs modulate the pathogenicity of
Enterobacteriaceae. In addition to illuminating mechanistic features of a compelling new group of phage defense
systems, and linking the activity of these systems to colonization and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, this
work has the potential to guide future strategies for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections.
 This fellowship will support the candidate’s training in the MD/PhD program at Columbia University, which
includes thesis work in the laboratory of Dr. Samuel Sternberg and the remainder of medical training in the
Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. The combination of rigorous scientific training, clinical exposure,
and career development guidance outlined in the proposal will prepare the candidate for a successful career as
an independent investigator and physician-scientist."

Nonribosomal peptides are an important class of natural products which display great structural and functional
diversity. As many nonribosomal peptides act as antimicrobials, the identification of novel bioactive NRPs can
lead to the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms.
Dehydrated nonribosomal peptides, peptides derived from or containing one or more α,β-dehydroamino acids
(dhAAs), are key targets for further therapeutic development due to their structural rigidity, resistance to
proteolytic degradation, and enhanced chemical reactivity. The Li Lab has focused on a specific class of
dehydrated nonribosomal peptides whose biosynthesis stems from biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) containing
nonribosomal-peptide synthetases (NRPSs) with C domains which modify amino acids (CmodAA). We have
recently characterized a class of these CmodAA domains which dehydrates β-hydroxy amino acids to dhAAs in
nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, and work from our lab and others has demonstrated that these CmodAAderived
nonribosomal peptides display a diverse array of bioactivities. However, the identity of many CmodAA derived
nonribosomal peptides is undiscovered, and their biosynthetic pathways and biological roles remain
uncharacterized. Through genome mining we have identified nearly 4,500 nonidentical CmodAA domains, many of
which are distributed among soil bacteria including Streptomyces. The research described herein is aimed to
elucidate the unknown products of several of these BGCs from Streptomyces and characterize the role of the
CmodAA domain in their biosynthesis. I will use a combination of in silico analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters,
comparative metabolomics, genetic manipulation, and NMR analysis to elucidate the cryptic products of these
BGCs. Once the nonribosomal peptide structure has been determined, I will perform a battery of in vitro enzyme
assays to elucidate the core enzymes involved in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, and the biosynthetic role
of the CmodAA domains within each BGC. Completion of the proposed research will lead to the discovery of novel
CmodAA derived dhAA nonribosomal peptides with potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, the findings of
this research will provide a base of knowledge that will extend to the discovery of other CmodAA containing BGCs
and characterization of their dhAA containing products."

 Worldwide, 52% of adults infected with HIV are women. Though access to effective antiretroviral therapy
(ART) has increased, women living with HIV (WLWH) have higher rates of non-AIDS comorbidities, faster
progression to AIDS, and mortality than men living with HIV(MLWH). One reason for this difference is HIV-
induced immune activation, which persists despite viral suppression with ART. HIV-induced immune activation
is critical to viral pathogenesis, a strong predictor of disease progression, and discordant by sex, even after viral
suppression with ART. Prior studies suggest that WLWH experience less of an ART-associated reduction
in immune activation and inflammation than men with HIV. The immunological basis for sex differences in
HIV-induced immune activation likely account for the discordant morbidity and mortality in WLWH, however, sex-
specific differences in HIV pathogenesis are poorly understood. Therefore, it is imperative to explore if HIV-
associated cellular markers contribute to HIV pathogenesis and if they are targets for therapeutic intervention in
WLWH.
 A hallmark of HIV infection is increased expression of CD38 on T cells. CD38 activates inflammatory
cytokine production and is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzing intracellular nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+). Ours and other published data show that increased CD38 expression on CD4+ and CD8+
T cells is not reversed with ART and viral suppression. In addition, in our lab, we have shown that CD38+CD8+
T cells in WLWH produce more inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ) than CD38+CD8+ T cells of MLWH.
 Blocking CD38 may mitigate inflammatory cytokine production, however, counteracting CD38 has been
shown to cause immunodeficiency. Since CD38+ is largely responsible for intracellular NAD+ decline, we
developed a strategy to counteract CD38’s effects without directly targeting it. In vitro, we added the NAD+
precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and found that NR
increased intracellular NAD+ levels in PBMCs and decreased cytokine production from CD38+ CD4+ and CD8+
T cells, without directly blocking CD38. Therefore, increasing intracellular NAD+ levels may be a therapeutic
option to mitigate CD38-induced immune activation and inflammation in WLWH.
 It is well-established that CD38 expression increases on T cells after HIV infection. However, it is
unknown if sex-based differences in CD38 expression account for increased inflammation in WLWH. Our central
hypothesis is that CD38 expression is increased and intensifies immune activation and inflammatory
cytokine in WLWH compared to MLWH. The overall goal of this project is to establish that increasing NAD+
levels can reduce CD38-induced immune activation and inflammation, leading to randomized-control trials using
NR in WLWH."

The menopausal transition is a time of extensive hormonal and physiological changes for women in midlife.
Unfortunately, it is often accompanied by a worsening of cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk factors, such
as increases in plasma cholesterol levels, central adiposity, and blood pressure, and women have greater
coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality risk after menopause. To date, scientists only have a limited
understanding of the molecular level changes that are set into motion as ovarian follicle supplies dwindle and
estradiol levels fall with menopause, especially in non-reproductive tissues. We hypothesize that extensive,
tissue-specific transcriptomic changes occur during and after the menopausal transition, leading to metabolic
reprogramming in cardiometabolic tissues. Here, our first aim will be to use a chemically-induced, ovarian follicle
depletion mouse model of the menopausal transition to identify menopause-induced changes in chromatin
accessibility and gene expression in mouse liver, adipose, and aorta tissues. In addition to “menopausal” female
and control-treated male and female (estrous cycling) mice, there will also be groups of “menopausal” mice
implanted with estradiol versus placebo tubing. This experiment will allow comparisons between female follicle-
depleted (“menopausal”) and cycling mice, between follicle-depleted mice implanted with E2 and control tubing,
between female cycling mice at distinct stages of the estrous cycle (high E2 vs. low E2), and between male and
female mice. Our second aim is to identify elements of women’s omics profiles associated with menopause
status and time since menopause. To do this, we will compare transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic
profiles between premenopausal and postmenopausal women in studies with enough premenopausal and
postmenopausal samples. Completion and integration of these aims will help to identify factors driving the
increase in cardiovascular disease risk during the menopausal transition, their downstream targets, and the
impact of estradiol hormone therapy on reversal of the changes. Clinically, this could help to optimize the timing
and type of interventions that could be used in the future to control cardiovascular disease risk in midlife women."
10873404,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Over 1.25 million emergency department visits occur annually due to the abuse of illicit
drugs and prescription opioids resulting in an estimated cost to the United States of $37 billion/year in healthcare
costs and $271.5 billion/year overall when crime and lost productivity are included. The majority of these cases
were due to cocaine (40%), heroin (21%), (meth)amphetamines (13%), and PCP (6%) with numbers rising in
recent years for fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and drugs (e.g. cocaine) laced with fentanyl. For this reason, the
federal government considers the drug abuse (opioid) epidemic to be a national emergency. Currently, opioid
overdose can be treated with Naloxone which binds to / blocks the opioid receptor in the brain. However, with
the rising abuse of fentanyl, Naloxone is becoming much less effective and multiple doses are often required.
Furthermore, there are no current specific antidotes for intoxication with stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine,
cocaine, or mephedrone) or for hallucinogens (e.g. ketamine or PCP) and ER doctors deliver treatments that
only target the patient’s symptoms. Accordingly, the development of new antidotes that treat intoxication with
the full range of drugs of abuse (opioids, stimulants, hallucinogens) is urgently needed. In contrast to small
molecule strategies that antagonize the opioid receptor, the molecular container strategy sequesters the drug
itself in the bloodstream of the animal and promotes its clearance. Macrocyclic arenes are molecular container
compounds that can possess tight binding (Ka ≥ 107 M-1; Kd ≤ 100 nM) toward hydrophobic cations in PBS which
renders them a prime platform to create new in vivo sequestration agents for drugs of abuse. We propose to
systematically vary the structure of the macrocyclic arene hosts to optimize the binding affinity toward specific
drugs of abuse. For example, we will optimize the location of the anionic groups to maximize ion-ion electrostatic
interactions and deepen / widen the macrocyclic arene cavity to enhance the hydrophobic driving force toward
host•drug complexation. New sequestration agents will be subjected to a series of in vitro toxicology and in vivo
maximum tolerated dose studies to establish their biocompatibility. Finally, hyperlocomotion assays will be used
to determine the in vivo efficacy of the most promising sequestration agent / drug pairs. Upon completion of the
proposed project we expect at least one sequestration agent will be nominated to continue toward US FDA
investigational new drug status."

program evaluation and sustainability planning, including planning and execution of an annual retreat. These
activities feed into well-defined short- and long-term goals guided by our strategic vision and logic model. Our
goals will be achieved under the collaborative leadership of an Executive Committee (EC) comprised of senior
scientists with EM, behavioral intervention, and implementation science expertise across the 5 stages of the
NIH model. To ensure meaningful and lasting impact on the field, the Administrative Core will also be guided
by an External Advisory Committee (EAC) for strategic decision-making, including funding of pilots and center
activities, and assessment of progress towards goals. We propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Provide

 The scientific premise underlying this proposed Roybal Center is as follows: most known modifiable
intervention targets for, and outcomes of, EM have robust established evidence-based guiding behavioral
interventions in related fields. But there remains a need to adapt, refine, and implement these interventions to fit
the context of EM, in terms of behavioral interventions for its prevention (e.g., targeting caregiver risk factors)
and sequelae (e.g., targeting depression after EM) rapidly and effectively. We will initially focus on pilots
addressing stage 0-2 of behavioral intervention development. We will provide robust services and support
through the cores designed to ensure translation and progression of pilots through the NIH stage model by
targeting known barriers (e.g., regulatory and recruitment) to research progression for EM. By addressing these
known barriers in EM research up front at the pilot stage, we hypothesize that investigators can build sustainable
and impactful long-term research programs that will pave the way for developing and evaluating future
mechanism-focused EM interventions. The overall goal of the BIDC is to support NIH Stage 0-2 research to
generate interventions that (1) reduce risk of elder mistreatment (EM) by intervening at the level of known or
posited mechanism factors; and (2) reduce impact of EM once it occurs by leveraging evidence-based treatments
for known EM sequelae that specifically measure and target hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change. The
BIDC has two objectives. Objective 1. Each year, select and support 2 to 3 high-quality EM research pilot
projects, representing stages 0-2 of the NIH Model of Behavioral Intervention Development. Objective 2.
Systematically implement a training and mentorship process for all selected pilot projects, to overcome common
regulatory, recruitment, and technical barriers to completing translational EM research. The goal is to ensure
that each pilot project clearly identifies and assesses hypothesized mechanisms of behavioral change, and
subsequently progresses through the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. Year 1 Pilots
include: (1) Ecological

10892791,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportionately impact lower income individuals and racial minorities.
These groups are also significantly less likely to have health insurance coverage in the United States. There is
growing evidence that expansion of health insurance coverage in low-income populations can lead to
improvements in health outcomes. In a recently published analysis by Dr. Khatana and colleagues, that serves
as the preliminary analysis for the proposed research, expansion of insurance coverage through Medicaid was
associated with fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease. A possible mechanism by which this occurred is
improved access to cardiovascular care, however, this has not been previously studied. This proposed
research plan aims to understand whether expansion of insurance coverage impacts access to inpatient and
outpatient care for cardiovascular disease, and whether it narrows disparities in care access for racial
minorities. Aim 1 seeks to examine whether expansion of insurance coverage through Medicaid under the
Affordable Care Act led to an increase in access to inpatient care in the setting of acute myocardial infarction
or stroke, and whether this varied between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White individuals. Aim 2 will
investigate whether access to outpatient care for chronic cardiovascular disease is associated with changes in
insurance coverage and whether insurance expansion narrows racial disparities in outpatient access. These
two aims will utilize different large administrative claims databases. Aim 3 will augment these analyses by
employing qualitative research methods to interview low-income patients discharged after a cardiovascular
hospitalization. Patients in the post-discharge period are especially vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as
readmission or death. Therefore, uninsured and insured patients will be interviewed to understand whether
insurance status is associated with differences in health seeking behaviors, adherence to medical advice and
therapies, health status and outcomes. These aims will lead to a future multi-site cohort study of low-income
individuals with cardiovascular disease, which will be used to prospectively investigate how changes in health
insurance coverage impact cardiovascular outcomes. Dr. Khatana, an early career investigator and a fellow in
cardiovascular medicine, has a long-term goal of becoming an independently funded cardiovascular health
policy and outcomes researcher with a focus on how health policies impact the cardiovascular health of low-
income individuals using both large administrative databases as well as qualitative methods at the individual
level. These research aims are part of a comprehensive training plan and will be supervised by a mentorship
and advisory team consisting of national leaders in health outcomes and policy research, and advanced
statistical and qualitative methodologies, and will guide his transition to an independently funded research
career."
10892894,"Chronic cholestasis results from bile secretory defects or impairment of bile flow, and there are few effective
medical therapies available. During the past funding period, we have made significant progress in determining
the multifactorial role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cholestatic liver disease (CLD). We show β-catenin
inhibition decreases bile acid (BA) synthesis, limiting CLD and fibrosis after bile duct ligation. However,
inhibition of β-catenin in the Mdr2 knockout (KO) mice, a model mimicking Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
(PSC), aggravated rather than alleviated injury. In fact, Mdr2-β-catenin-KO (DKO1) mice more closely
resembled PSC cases than Mdr2 KO, suggesting this might be a clinically relevant model to study biology and
therapeutics for PSC. β-catenin is also a critical component of adherens junctions (AJs), where its loss is
compensated by spontaneous increase in β-catenin. We show that deletion of both β- & γ-catenin from
hepatocytes (HCs) & cholangiocytes (CCs) in DKO2 mice resulted in CLD, failure to thrive, increased BA,
fibrosis, and mortality, and resembled progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), a pediatric CLD.
Although DKO1 and DKO2 had a disparate underlying basis, they share phenotypic commonalities including
loss of hepatocyte differentiation & acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics; loss of cell polarity; and
pertubations in cell-cell junctions. Intriguingly, none of these events have been studied in great depth in CLD
and cholangiopathies, making our study innovative and significant. Based on these findings, we hypothesize
that our DKO models represent a subset of PSC and PFIC cases which will be validated by transcriptomic
analyses. Regardless of the disease subtype, these mice serve as powerful pre-clinical models for in-depth
mechanistic studies of processes such as cell maturation/differentiation, cell polarity and/or cell-cell
junctions, that are less well investigated and understood in disease pathogenesis. We further posit that
modulating the determinants of key processes such as TGFβ signaling & β-catenin in both HCs & CCs, will not
only provide novel insights into the role of β-catenin in cell polarity and cholangiocyte biology, but might also
have major therapeutic implications in the general context of cholangiopathies. We are proposing 3
independent yet cohesive aims to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will validate the relevance of the DKO1 and
DKO2 models to human CLD subclasses. In Aim2, we will investigate the role of TGFβ in progressive CLD
models associated with β-catenin loss, since both our preclinical models are characterized by increased TGFβ
signaling and ensuing loss of cell polarity with enhanced expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) markers. In aim 3, we will determine the role of CC β-catenin in Mdr2 KO mice by its deletion from this
cell type. We will also study the impact of dual deletion of β-γ-catenin in CC. Thus our proposed studies will
comprehensively address the 3 poorly understood processes of epithelial to mesenchymal reprogramming, loss
of cell polarity, and perturbations in cell-cell junctions, in the pathogenesis of CLD."
10893022,"Project Summary
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are irreversible and currently incurable
neurodegenerative diseases with more than 65,000 new cases in the USA each year. Their core motor symptoms
are respectively caused by dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra and motor
neurons in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. However, non-cell-autonomous contributions to disease
progression are widely recognized and include cerebrovascular (CV) dysfunction. The CV is formed by several
highly specialized cell populations, including brain endothelial cells (BECs), mural cells, fibroblasts, and glia.
Given the CV’s critical role in regulating biomolecule transport into and out of the brain, blood flow, and responses
to physical or chemical stress, understanding the molecular underpinnings of early CV changes during PD and
ALS may be critical to develop disease-modifying treatments.
 Prior work indicates that CV changes can occur during the progression of PD and ALS, including leakage of
the blood-brain barrier (BBB), angiogenesis, dysfunctional efflux activity, dysregulated blood flow, and increased
immune cell trafficking. However, findings from brain imaging (MRI) and histological analysis are not inclusive of
all CV functions nor able to identify transcriptional regulators, while studies using animal models are not
representative of sporadic human disease which accounts for ~90% of PD and ALS cases. In this proposal, I
will characterize cerebrovascular dysfunction during sporadic PD and ALS with cell type-specificity and
whole genome-resolution from post-mortem tissue, and will benchmark the degree to which this
dysfunction is recapitulated by iPSC-derived in vitro models. This work is grounded in recent application of
blood-vessel enrichment (BVE) and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) approaches to profile gene
expression of CV cells, and the development of transcription factor overexpression-based differentiation of BECs
from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In Aim 1A, I will conduct snRNA-seq on blood vessel enriched
substantia nigra from post-mortem PD patients and age-matched healthy controls, and will then validate cell
type-specific dysfunction using immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies. In Aim 1B, I will
differentiate BECs from PD patient iPSCs and age-matched healthy controls and then conduct snRNA-seq to
determine how post-mortem hallmarks of dysfunction are reflected in vitro. In Aim 2, I will take a similar approach
by conducting snRNA-seq on ALS patients blood vessel enriched motor cortex and iPSC-derived BECs
compared to healthy age-matched post-mortem tissue and iPSC controls.
 By characterizing CV gene expression using cutting-edge single nucleus profiling of PD and ALS post-
mortem tissue and iPSC-derived models, this proposal will identity previously unrecognized mechanisms of CV
dysfunction and serve as a critical launchpad for future studies to test causality in disease processes and validate
therapeutic targets across in vivo and in vitro models."
10893025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Few evidence-based programs exist to support children and families affected by sociopolitical conflict, despite
documented evidence of their heightened risk for emotional and behavioral adjustment problems associated
with exposure to conflict and violence at multiple levels of the social ecology (e.g., political, community, and
family). Thus, a critical need exists for an evidence-based program to ameliorate the impact of political violence
on the overall well-being of children and families. The current study will conduct a rigorous evaluation of a
theoretically-driven, family-based intervention program in Palestine, including both the West Bank and Gaza.
Firmly grounded in the cultural context of Palestine but with broad implications for individuals exposed to
sociopolitical violence, the long-term goal of this project is to provide a family-focused intervention program
(Promoting Positive Family Futures; PPFF) that may facilitate individuals’ sense of safety and support in the
context of chronic adversity. The objective is to evaluate this intervention program in the context of a
randomized clinical trial (RCT) in the West Bank and Gaza (N=300). The central hypothesis is that the program
will have direct positive effects on family conflict, parent psychopathology and parental security in the family as
well as on adolescent emotional security in the family, with cascading effects on adolescent adjustment.
Consistent with family systems theory, we further hypothesize that treatment effects on parents will mediate on
the effects of the treatment on adolescent adjustment. The rationale is that bolstering resilience in family
systems is a key approach to promoting positive functioning in families exposed to chronic violence. The
hypothesis will be evaluated with three specific aims: 1) evaluate the efficacy of an evidence-based family
support program; 2) examine process models of treatment change, and 3) examine interrelations between
parent and child functioning. To achieve these aims, the study will be an RCT employing a longitudinal design
(N=300) with multi-method assessments at baseline (T1), post-test (T2), 6-month follow-up (T3) and 12-month
follow-up (T4). Families included in the study will be evenly divided between the West Bank (n=150) and Gaza
Strip (n=150). Families will be randomized into the intervention condition (PPFF) or treatment as usual (TAU).
Each territory will have an implementing partner, and implementing partners and investigators will work
together to ensure the study procedures are implemented in parallel across sites. Data collection will be
conducted by trained research staff from a third-party survey and policy research organization. The proposal
seeks to shift current research and clinical paradigms in these contexts by employing novel theoretical
concepts, approaches, and methodologies. The contribution will be significant by 1) further developing new
directions for empirically-based interventions in these high-risk contexts, and 2) advancing a relatively brief,
cost-effective program that can be readily implemented to help children and families exposed to continuing
conflict in Palestine, with the potential to be brought to scale in other contexts."
10893027,"Project Summary/Abstract
Social isolation is the quantifiable measure of social interactions and relationships, whereas loneliness is the
perceived level of social isolation. These experiences are especially pronounced during life transitions. Social
isolation and loneliness have deleterious effects on cardiovascular health. The development of a culturally
sensitive, behavior change intervention that emphasizes the provision of social support, development of a
sense of belonging, and foster feelings of social connectedness has the promise to reduce the growing public
health epidemic of social isolation and loneliness while improving cardiovascular health. I have developed the
proposed core training objectives to acquire a unique and valuable skill set in the following areas: 1) gain
proficiency in community-engaged research (CEnR) for the development of effective physical activity (PA)
interventions, 2) obtain knowledge and skills related to the health implications, evaluation, and treatment of
social isolation and loneliness, 3) develop expertise in mixed methods study design to conduct behavioral
randomized control trials (RCT), and 4) acquire knowledge of the health and culture of veterans. Secondary
training objectives include professional development to increase the impact of manuscript submissions and
presentations, develop persuasive grant writing skills, and conduct ethical and responsible research. The
training aims will be accomplished through a combination of formal and informal coursework, directed readings
and webinars, behavioral and social science research trainings related to CEnR, RCTs, PA interventions,
veterans, and practical research experiences. The research objective is to develop and examine the feasibility
and acceptability of a group-based PA intervention to reduce social isolation, loneliness, and blood pressure
among an at-risk population going through a significant life transition, veterans reintegrating to civilian life. To
achieve this objective, the proposed research aims include: 1) characterizing the needs related to PA, social
isolation, loneliness, and social connectedness among veterans reintegrating to civilian life, 2) designing a
group-based PA intervention supported by digital technologies using CEnR among this population, and 3)
evaluating the feasibility and acceptability and preliminary health effects of the group-based PA intervention
supported by digital technologies developed partly in Aim 2 among a sample of veterans reintegrating to
civilian life. The environment at San Diego State University, along with my mentorship team, form a uniquely
suited setting to expand my training and research skills in pursuit of my long-term career goal of becoming a
successful independent investigator, conducting large-scale, community-based PA promotion RCTs."

The mission of the Metabolic Imaging Core (MIC) and its three Sub-Cores (Advanced Body Composition,
Positron Emission Tomography [PET], and Functional Neuroimaging) is to support nutrition and obesity
research from NORC-H members, by providing access to advanced non-invasive imaging technologies. Since
the last funding period, the MIC has enabled highly sophisticated assessments of body composition, tissue
physiology and brain function that accelerated translational research in human obesity and nutrition. The
NORC-H Metabolic Imaging Core coordinates and centralizes research imaging needs of NORC-H members
and encourages use of advanced metabolic imaging techniques, also providing support in research design and
consultation. The Advanced Body Composition Sub-Core provides services in multi-organ MRI/MR
spectroscopy, CT imaging and high-throughput image analysis used in a variety of body composition
assessments. The PET Sub-Core includes services of PET/CT, PET/MRI, and development of physiologic and
functional radiotracers. The Functional Neuroimaging Sub-Core provides services in fMRI and structural brain
imaging. The NORC-H combines the expertise of long-standing MGH imaging Cores, and over the last funding
cycle the MIC was rated very highly by NORC-H members and exceptionally productive, performing over 2,000
imaging services for members, including consultation and technical support, showing sustained demand
serving over 37 researchers, including 34 NORC-H members. The MIC also has expanded its imaging services
and technological innovations, making them available to NORC-H investigators.
The aims of the current renewal application are to:
1) Provide a variety of advanced imaging services, paired with consultation, to support studies in need of
 imaging-based endpoints, with continued innovation in imaging technologies, provision of new services,
 and expansion of user base,
2) Provide standalone imaging analysis services, including quantitative interpretation of imaging data and
 high-throughput body composition analyses of large datasets using deep learning algorithms developed in-
 house during the current funding cycle,
3) Harmonize imaging protocols used for brain, liver, muscle, and visceral fat MR studies across multiple
 NORCs, targeting high repeatability of MR-based measurements across Centers."
10893532,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nutrition- and obesity-related research is of critical importance given the tremendous impact of metabolic
conditions on human health. While nutrition and obesity related research enables investigators to generate
many disease-related hypotheses, the technology needed to create disease-relevant models and to test these
hypotheses lies outside the expertise of many individual research groups. The Metabolic Phenotyping Core
serves as a single, central access point for NORC-H investigators to enable in silico metabolic analyses, model
creation in metabolically relevant cell types, and detailed phenotypic characterization of human and model-
derived samples. The fundamental activities of the core are divided into three central activities, both supported
by expert faculty with extensive experience in all Core activities: 1) in silico metabolic analysis permitted by
computational intersection of rich genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics datasets highly relevant to nutrition
and obesity; 2) model generation, which brings genomic targeting and modern genome editing to the hands of
all NORC-H investigators, and 3) metabolic phenotyping, ranging from metabolomics to whole-animal
physiology. Metabolic computational analyses are capable of providing new insights or generating new
hypotheses through expertise in the Core with large datasets of genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in
humans and facility with their intersection. Model generation uses state-of-the-art gene targeting resources
available at MGH and the Broad Institute, permitting NORC-H members to model disease-related processes in
metabolically-relevant primary cells, immortalized cells, and patient-derived inducible pluripotent stem cells.
The Core’s battery of customizable, metabolic phenotyping assays can be employed to characterize human
tissue and blood samples provided by the investigator or samples generated by the Core’s model-generation
activities. The Core has expert capabilities for metabolic computational analyses, metabolomics (mass
spectrometry of endogenous metabolites), characterization of metabolism and respiratory activity of cells in
culture, analysis of insulin signaling and gene expression, and physiologic characterization of mouse models of
human disease. Under the Core, complex analyses and techniques that require expertise and infrastructure
that are difficult or impossible for individual laboratories to attain are made readily available to NORC-H
investigators. The innovation of the Core, is its ability to provide state-of-the-art analyses to the broad NORC-H
membership through a single access point, permitting investigators to ask an innumerable number of nutrition
and obesity related research questions with efficiency and economy. The significance of the Core’s activities lie
in its ability to encourage both detailed characterization of human samples and to enable translational,
mechanistic studies that cannot be conducted in humans. Finally, the Core will serve as a resource to NORC-H
membership to provide education on methodologies and metabolic characterization projects."

The Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at Harvard (NORC-H) provides
grants of up to $30,000 to investigators in nutrition and obesity who require pilot or feasibility data to test early
hypotheses and/or prove feasibility for larger grant applications. The goals of the program are to promote
novel, cutting-edge research, to support and retain early career investigators, to engage a wide spectrum of
nutrition/obesity researchers with the NORC-H, to promote the success of recipients, and to facilitate the
integration of recipients into the larger NORC-H community. At least four new awards are given each year, and
renewals are awarded on a competitive basis for projects that have shown particularly good progress and
potential. The P&F budget is supplemented with philanthropy and other budgetary sources whenever possible,
resulting in an average of $175,900 awarded per year between 2017-2021. The program prioritizes support of
early career investigators, who represented 84% of recipients between 2012-2021, and also supports
exemplary proposals from established investigators new to the fields of nutrition or obesity or from established
investigators within the field pursuing new research directions. The NORC-H is highly invested in P&F
recipients’ success and provides multiple resources including a dedicated mentoring program, vouchers for
use of Core services, biostatistical support from Dr. Lee (NORC-H biostatistician), and the opportunity to
network and present their work at an Annual P&F Symposium. The NORC-H Administrative Core works with
Dr. Stanley, the P&F Director, to administer the program, ensuring that applicants have appropriate animal or
human subjects approvals and tracking outcomes for awards and recipients over time to judge program
success. Over the past 2 cycles (2012-2021), P&F recipients have been highly successful in leveraging the
P&F funding into publications and further grant support. From 2012-2021, 62 awards totaling 1.5 million dollars
were given; these have been leveraged into 37.5 million dollars of subsequent NIH funding, including 5 K-level
career development grants and 13 R01s. The 62 awards have also resulted in 140 subsequent related
publications, 16 of which are in high impact journals (impact factor >10). Numerous recipients have received
academic promotions and have become successful independent investigators, and 90% of recipients from
2012-2021 are still working in the fields of nutrition and obesity. Program successes over the past grant cycle
include (1) dedicated efforts to increase applications from scientists underrepresented in medicine and to
increase the success rate of those awards, (2) increased applications per cycle to ensure a highly competitive
process funding the most promising science, and (3) development of a dedicated mentoring program for
recipients. In the upcoming cycle, the program will provide additional resources and education for applicants,
grow the successful mentorship program, and continue to further the careers of early career scientists."

Enrichment Program has the goals of (1) promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among nutrition and
obesity researchers; (2) providing interactions between trainees at all levels to further education about nutrition
and obesity; (3) providing mentorship and resources for early career investigators, and (4) fostering diversity
among the nutrition/obesity research workforce. The program provides enrichment activities that bring together
accomplished researchers, clinical providers, junior faculty, and trainees from multiple disciplines to discuss
cutting-edge research and foster collaboration and mentorship. In addition, NORC-H gives a voice to the
importance of education in nutrition and obesity for trainees at all levels within the Harvard system and greater
Boston Community. One of the primary enrichment activities of the NORC-H is an Annual Symposium on an
emerging theme in nutrition or obesity research, with relevant lectures, panel discussions, and networking
opportunities to attendees from the Boston area and beyond. The Enrichment Program also supports trainees,
junior faculty, and researchers from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine (URM). Since the last grant
renewal, we have initiated a mentoring program for Pilot & Feasibility recipients, the NORC-H Diversity
Scholars program to support outstanding early career investigators from URM backgrounds, awards to
promote junior faculty and inclusive mentoring, office hours for key NORC-H leaders to increase their
accessibility to NORC-H members, and a NORC-H Associate Member Council for early-career NORC-H
members to network, collaborate, and take advantage of NORC-H resources. The Enrichment Program has
also continued to support multiple educational efforts by NORC-H members, including the Longwood Nutrition
Seminars and the Blackburn Obesity Course. Further, multiple members of the NORC-H are faculty on NIH
training grants, and NORC-H collaborates with these faculty to provide mentorship and support to trainees who
are the younger generation of investigators in the fields of nutrition and obesity. Finally, communication with
our Research Base and the larger community is a key function of the Enrichment Program, serving to increase
cohesiveness and collaboration and to help researchers and providers stay current on the most recent
scientific advances in the field. To accomplish this, the Enrichment Program maintains the NORC-H website,
with information about NORC-H Cores, resources, links to NORC-H publications, The NORC-H disseminates a
bi-monthly newsletter to over 900 subscribers with announcements, featured publications, early career
investigator profiles, and local events related to nutrition and obesity. Through these activities, the Enrichment
Program strengthens our community through education, networking, collaboration, and mentorship."
10893503,"Central Asia (CA) represents the most rapidly growing HIV epidemic region worldwide, concentrated in
people who inject drugs (PWID) and their sexual partners. Scaling up opioid agonist therapies (OAT) in CA is
the most cost-effective strategy to prevent new HIV infections, and more effective when combined with
antiretroviral therapy (ART). CA countries have especially low OAT (and ART) coverage and are uniquely
impacted by their proximity to opioid trade routes, a myriad of patient, provider, healthcare and policy barriers
and suboptimal implementation. CA countries share a similar rigid Semashko healthcare system, which can be
especially challenging for implementing evidence-based practices (EBPs). Moreover, the HIV treatment cascade
differs in the three countries of Kazakhstan (KZ), Kyrgyzstan (KY) and Tajikistan (TJ), generally with low levels
of case detection, ART prescription and viral suppression. They also differ by OAT coverage, with all being
suboptimal and well-below international targets for the 120,500, 25,000 and 22,500 PWID, respectively. We
propose to use the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) implementation strategy to
scale-up OAT in three diverse CA countries guided by the EPIS (Exploration-Planning-Implementation-
Sustainment) framework. Using our experiences with NIATx to scale-up OAT, we will use the EPIS framework
where we will first assess the barriers and facilitators to OAT scale-up, including the inner and outer contexts as
well as bridging factors. These findings will guide preparation and implementation efforts using NIATx.
Collaborative learning is key feature of NIATx that can be used in diverse contexts and is an iterative process
that promotes change. Understanding the trajectories of implementation, a core feature of EPIS, may in this
context emerge through creating communities of practice, especially when cohesion and/or competence evolves
through this process, and may guide other healthcare delivery challenges in the region (e.g., HIV, TB). Using
NIATx to build important regional expertise and competence and understanding implementation trajectories in
this context should help support OAT program sustainability. As part of our implementation and sustainability
plan, and consistent with NIATx, we will convene stakeholder meetings to bridge inner and outer factors to guide
initial and ongoing implementation, review findings from our studies and use information to inform policies for
expanding OAT in each CA country. These meeting will inform implementation and guide policy changes to
promote sustainability. Significance is justified by the regional needs to prevent HIV in PWID and their sexual
partners and the lack of scale-up of EBPs. Innovation is enhanced not only by using NIATx in a new context, but
by more comprehensively understanding scale-up trajectories in this context. Success is likely to be high given
the experience of the US and Central Asian teams, their previous collaborative research and a common goal to
control HIV in the region. Public health benefit should be high as findings may mitigate the evolving regional HIV
epidemics where OAT has benefits for both primary and secondary HIV prevention."
10893512,"Abstract:
As the national toll from the opioid epidemic continues to worsen, West Virginia leads the nation
in overdose deaths, with 52 deaths per 100,000 population, and the economic impact of the
opioid epidemic on West Virginia is estimated at around $1 billion. The impact of the opioid
epidemic is not limited to West Virginia; nationally, more than 63,000 overdose deaths occurred
in 2016. Unfortunately, despite the growing necessity of treatment for Opioid Use Disorder
(OUD), most patients do not respond to the current standard of care. The success rate of
patients initially stabilized on the gold standard of treatment, Medication Assisted Therapy
(MAT) in conjunction with psychosocial interventions, is currently less than 50%. Those who fail
the gold standard have a high risk of overdose or other complications. Due to the growing
number of OUD patients and the limitations of current treatment, it is clear that new treatment
options are needed to confront this problem. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has been used for
many years to successfully treat movement disorders such as Parkinsons, and has shown
promise in investigations for other mental disorders. We hypothesize that implanting the DBS
device in the nucleus accumbens region of the brain will modulate the reward and behavior self-
regulation networks, which will decrease opioid cravings. This proposal aims to test safety,
feasibility, and tolerability in an initial cohort of 4 participants during the UG3 phase. This will
allow for an evaluation of safety and tolerability of DBS in participants with treatment-refractory
OUD and a history of life-threatening complications secondary to opioid use. If the UG3 phase
is successful following intensive monitoring of the 4 participants, the UH3 phase will consist of a
randomized, controlled proof-of-concept study with 16 participants. These participants again will
have treatment-refractory OUD and a history of life-threatening complications secondary to
opioid use. During the UH3 phase, the mechanism of DBS impact on OUD will be investigated
through both neuroimaging and measurement of executive function."

This is a competitive renewal of an alcohol research training program (T32) currently in its 19th year that aims to
continue an exceptional track record of training pre and postdoctoral trainees interested in alcohol research
across the lifespan. It supports four predoctoral and four postdoctoral trainees per year, each appointed for two
years. This joint endeavor of San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California San Diego
(UCSD) is led by Dr. Edward Riley (Program Director, SDSU) and Dr. Andrea Spadoni (Program Director,
UCSD). The faculty consists of researchers affiliated with the SDSU/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program (JDP) in
Clinical Psychology. The JDP provides a unique opportunity for the training of doctoral students in the
Science/Practitioner model and is consistently ranked as one of the top clinical psychology doctoral programs in
the U.S. The model is guided by the conviction that a solid foundation in the science of psychology is essential
for the modern clinical psychologist. Further, a rigorous scientific core, including the commitment to empirically-
based knowledge and the development of research skills, is regarded as fundamental in educating clinical
psychologists. Finally, this model is consistent with the NIH goal of translating research to the clinic. The
environment for this training is rich with resources, skilled mentors, ample research funding, and an extremely
collegial atmosphere that encourages collaborative studies between labs and universities. The T32 prepares
trainees for successful careers in research and academic environments with intensive mentored and specialized
training experiences in research addressing the determinants and consequences of alcoholism. Hands-on,
mentored alcohol research experience, in conjunction with workshops and seminars in addictions, research
methodologies, responsible conduct of research, data science, enhancing reproducibility, manuscript/grant
writing, and career development are the key activities of this training program. Research experiences encompass
a broad range of alcohol-related areas such as neural risk factors and consequences of alcohol exposure, fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders, adolescent substance use, and comorbidities. While pre- and postdoctoral trainees
alike receive extensive training in the behavioral sciences and in alcohol and other substance use and related
disorders, postdoctoral training is highly tailored toward the achievement of individual career goals. Since its
inception in 2002, this training program has undergone constant refinement and it will continue to do so to meet
the needs of the trainees and the evolving addictions research field. Its graduates continue their success in
primarily academic/research settings. Their achievements and feedback about their experience indicate that they
acquire the skills and scientific discipline necessary to be successful researchers and that they have the clinical
skills to apply their knowledge and ask relevant questions regarding alcohol and other substance use disorders."

logistics between Projects 1-3 and Cores A, B, and C. The interactions between the Projects
and Cores are essential to the success of the proposal as a whole. Collaboration and
coordination between the participants in this proposal will receive the highest priority during the

FUNCTIONAL STUDIES 
PROJECT 3: Genetically-engineered pig orthotopic (life-supporting) heart transplantation (Tx) in 
baboons: establishing consistent xenograft survival and overcoming rapid post-Tx organ growth (PI: 
Muhammad Mohiuddin). 
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
 The field of xenotransplantation has made significant progress in the last few years. However, successful 
life-supporting (orthotopic) pig heart transplantation (OHTx) in nonhuman primates is currently limited by two 
major problems – (i) immediate graft failure from a poorly-understood, non-immunologic cause (known as `peri- 
operative cardiac xenograft dysfunction' or `PCXD'), and (ii) rapid growth of the heart in the first few post-Tx 
months, potentially resulting in cardiac compression and dysfunction. We propose investigating and resolving 
these two problems. 
 (i) We hypothesize that PCXD is associated with impaired mitochondrial function that results from 
inadequate myocardial preservation during OHTx and low post-Tx triiodothyronine (T3) levels. We shall use a 
novel system of preservation (the `Steen' system) and combine this with T3 therapy in the immediate post-Tx 
period. Our detailed studies on mitochondrial function will throw light on the mechanisms involved in PCXD. We 
have already carried out preliminary testing of the Steen system, with encouraging results, and have confirmed 
that T3 levels remain grossly subnormal during the first few weeks after pig OHTx in baboons. 
 (ii) We hypothesize that excessive growth of the pig cardiac xenograft will be prevented by the Tx of 
hearts from pigs in which the gene for growth hormone receptors has been knocked out. Pigs in which 8 genetic 
manipulations have been carried out (all aimed at protecting the heart from the primate immune response) – 
which have not been available to any group previously - will form the basis of all our experiments but, in addition, 
growth hormone receptors will be deleted by a ninth genetic manipulation. 
 If these two problems can be resolved, control of the innate immune response (by the genetic manipulations 
in the organ-source pig) and of the adaptive immune response (by a costimulation blockade-based 
immunosuppressive regimen introduced by us with proven success) will allow a comprehensive investigation of 
the hemodynamic function of the pig heart in supporting the baboon's circulation over a follow-up period of 6 
months. We anticipate that the results of these studies will enable consideration to be given to initiating a clinical 
trial of cardiac xenotransplantation."
10893971,"Abstract 
 The Administrative Core (AC) of New Hampshire INBRE (NH-INBRE) plays a major role in 
operation of the NH-INBRE network and is responsible for implementation of all aspects of the NH- 
INBRE program. It provides administrative leadership and budgetary oversight for the network. The 
AC also provides key interfaces with NIH Program, NH-INBRE advisory and evaluative bodies: a 
network Steering Committee (SC), External Advisory Committee (EAC) and nationally-acknowledged, 
INBRE-expert evaluators, as a site visit team from the AAAS (American Association for the 
Advancement of Science). Of the advisory groups none is more important than the SC, composed of 
two faculty/leadership members per Partner and INBRE leadership. The SC has demonstrated a 
maturity of the NH-INBRE Partners in their ability to inform central leadership about programs of 
INBRE that work well for their school and are more engaged in defining and co-leading efforts for 
opportunities for INBRE collaboration. The AC is closely counseled by an External Advisory 
Committee, which provides input on topics and issues brought to its attention, and also evaluates 
the research progress of all Research, Pilot Projects and other research programs supported by 
NH-INBRE. 
 The AC is responsible for advancing the NH-INBRE goals of providing research 
opportunities for students at Partner schools and enhancing the science culture on Partner 
campuses. It does this through multiple mechanisms. The AC oversees the Developmental 
Research Projects Program, (DRPP). The DRPP provides research grants to faculty at Partner 
schools following review of their proposed projects and selection of those that combine the best 
science with a strong environment for training student researchers. The AC also oversees the 
Research and Training Core, which offers workshops in advanced techniques, supports the 
summer student research programs, nursing research program, and the mentoring program, which 
links faculty mentors from the Lead institutions with faculty holding NH-INBRE research grants at 
the Partners. 
 To ensure effectiveness and enhance improvements, through the AC, NH-INBRE supports 
a rigorous internal evaluation program that defines metrics for each NH-INBRE goal and all 
planned activities. The evaluation team develops tools so that it can periodically perform formative 
and summative evaluations of movement towards attaining NH-INBRE goals and the effectiveness 
of all its programs."
10893973,"III. Bioinformatics and Genomics Core Abstract
The overall goal of the NH-INBRE Bioinformatics and Genomics Core (BGC) is to overcome the gap in
bioinformatics expertise by direct support of ongoing and new research projects and fostering integration of
bioinformatics into the undergraduate curriculum. The need for support for research projects at Partner and
Lead institutions extends through all phases from experimental design to publication. This includes access to
state-of-the-art computational infrastructure supported by the NH-INBRE. To address the long-term goals for
broad workforce training in bioinformatics, we have developed a set of resources to support core bioinformatics
training in the context of a biology curriculum. In the next phase of our NH-INBRE BGC, we propose to expand
both the scope of bioinformatics research support and implementation of these curriculum modules both within
New Hampshire and nationally by leveraging the participation of the nationwide IDeA network. Finally, we
intend to further extend this curriculum support and integrate an important focus on rigor and transparency in
bioinformatics. To accomplish these goals, we have three specific aims:
Aim 1: Improve the biomedical research capacity of the State of New Hampshire at the eight primarily
undergraduate institutions and the two Lead universities of the NH-INBRE by: a) Supporting NH-INBRE
research projects and enhancing bioinformatics expertise across the network through training in diverse
bioinformatics applications; b) Providing sustainable, accessible, cost-effective, and well-managed
computational infrastructure for data analysis, storage, and dissemination.
Aim 2: Create a sustainable, scalable, and impactful mechanism for bioinformatics training by continuing to
support the integration of bioinformatics into the undergraduate science curriculum. . For this funding period,
we propose to extend this curricular support program to at least four additional INBRE Bioinformatics Cores in
each of the four IDeA geographical regions, with the long-term goal to extend across all 24 INBRE programs.
Aim 3: Establish workforce development training and infrastructure for advancement of Rigor and
Reproducibility in bioinformatics by a) Promoting transparency of bioinformatics analysis and b) Establishing
best practices for accurately presenting data and methods for INBRE-funded research.
Achieving these goals will support the development of key skills and rigorous practices in line with the
overarching goals as defined in the NIH strategic plan for data science. In particular, our training and support
enforces the FAIR principles where data and analysis should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable."
10894007,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
Cancer and cardiovascular disease risk factors and related morbidity and mortality in Arkansas are among the poorest
in the United States. These data provide a compelling rationale for developing a strong research ecosystem to support
the efficient and effective management, operations, and functioning of the Center for Research, Health and Social
Justice. The goal of the Administrative Core (AC) is to provide: comprehensive scientific oversight; fiscal
management; implementation of core plans through an efficient organizational and governance structure; submission
of progress reports; compliance of Center-supported research with all applicable regulations and policies; common
data elements and measures across all research projects, as appropriate; career development plans for all
investigators; implementation of a Center evaluation plan; and fulfillment of all appropriate Terms and Conditions of
an Award. Consistent with the National Institutes of Health's UNITE Initiative to end structural racism and
discrimination, the AC's transdisciplinary and diverse team seeks to advance administrative operations that steer
the culture of the Center toward equity, inclusion, and scientific excellence; administer resources to support chronic
disease health disparities research; and foster communications and practices that support a socially just research
ecosystem in Arkansas. Using a social justice framework and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health
Disparities Research Framework, the AC will address individual, interpersonal, and institutional structural factors that
influence diverse investigator access to resources for effective project management and operation. The AC will create
equity in management and allocation of resources, opportunities for Center affiliates to fully participate in its activities,
and promote activities that support the human right to health for those disproportionately impacted by chronic
disease disparities. The AC includes a Director's Office, Leadership Team, External Scientific Advisory Board,
Philanthropy Advisory Board, Administrative and Technical Support Team, and the Measures, Evaluation, and
Methods Team. Our institutional partners, the Arkansas Department of Health, Virginia Commonwealth University,
and Eastern Carolina University play a critical role in the AC's functioning. The Director of Social Justice Integration
in Research and Practice will foster social justice processes and practice. We will use innovative strategies, including
concept, geographic information system and asset mapping to inform Center planning and evaluation strategies, and
incorporate community health workers and early stage career investigators into the AC to grow leadership in the
academy and community. The AC will adopt a decision-making process that is highly participatory, leveraging the
opinions and expertise of a diverse research team. The AC builds on a strong administrative foundation established
by the Arkansas Center for Health Disparities. The AC's approach to oversight, coordination, management, and
administration for the full spectrum of Center activities will support the successful and timely achievement of the
Center's goals. We intend to build a strong model for the practice of social justice in a research ecosystem."
10894008,"PROJECT SUMMARY – INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE
Eliminating health disparities in Arkansas is particularly challenging, since rural and Black/African American
populations are disproportionately affected by the burden of chronic disease. As part of strategic plans to
address the problem, a diverse and productive workforce is needed to conduct research that mitigates health
disparities and supports health equity. Supporting early stage investigators provides an effective and productive
solution in workforce development, when structured plans are provided for investigators who come from health
disparity and underrepresented groups. The overarching goal of the Investigator Development Core is to reduce
inequities in the number of historically underrepresented researchers prepared to eliminate cancer and
cardiovascular disease health disparities by building a strong evidence-based training and mentoring
infrastructure that enhances skills and competencies of investigators to successfully compete for pilot project
funding, and subsequently secure National Institutes of Health research grants. The Core will apply social justice
principles and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework to address
individual, interpersonal, and institutional structural factors that influence the diversity in the research workforce,
underrepresented researcher access to grant awards, equity in training and mentoring, participation in research
with community partners, and ultimately, increase the number of research studies that focus on eliminating
chronic disease disparities among groups often denied the human right to health. The Investigator Development
Core will use a mixed-methods approach (concept mapping, individual assessments pre-application) to capture
relevant data to assist the team in developing relevant training and mentoring components pre/post award. The
community liaison for the Training Mentoring Advisory Board will review grants for their impact on health equity
prior to submission and work with the Community Engagement Core to link community partners and pilot study
investigators. Finally, the Investigator Development Core will build on the National Mentoring Research Network
model to increase participation in the pilot grant program by addressing inequities in readiness to submit research
grants, using one-on-one consults, providing grant coaching and writing group support, and conducting team-
oriented mentoring to guide investigators from idea conceptualization to subsequent submission of an NIH grant
application. The expected impact will be increased recruitment, retention and professional advancement of early
stage investigators in conducting chronic disease health disparities research that informs future research, health
policy, and programmatic responses to eliminate health disparities."
10894013,"PROJECT SUMMARY – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
Arkansas has persistent and profound cancer and cardiovascular disease disparities in rural low resource counties
and among Blacks/African Americans. Efforts to eliminate these place- and race-based disparities must include
residents who are most affected, in addition to caregivers, practitioners, policy makers, academicians, and other
stakeholders. The Community Engagement Core of the Center for Research, Health and Social Justice builds
on the solid researcher-community partner engagement history established by the Arkansas Center for Health
Disparities, the Office of Community-Based Public Health, and the Translational Research Institute's Community
Engagement Core at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The goal of the Community Engagement
Core is to maintain and expand a broad-based coalition of regional stakeholders who are engaged in partnerships
that result in novel chronic disease health disparities research whose results are disseminated and translated to
inform sustainable community and systems-level changes. The Community Engagement Core will create a critical
mass of community-academic partnerships that have the skills and capacity to engage in research from idea
conceptualization to translation of relevant research findings. The Core will expand its coalition of partners in
the Northwest, Highlands, and Delta rural regions of the state through its annual Community Campus Partnership
Conference, career enhancement activities and the Community Based Organization Capacity Training. The
Community and Institutional Advisory Boards will provide consultations to academic researchers to facilitate new
equitable community-academic partnerships that result in novel and cultural relevant funded research in
collaboration with the Investigator Development Core. In collaboration with the Administrative Core, the
Community Engagement Core will use concept mapping, geographic information system mapping, and
community asset mapping to inform strategic plans for dissemination and translation. Our mixed-methods are
grounded in the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, the
Knowledge to Action Framework, the Integrated Framework for Community Engagement, and social justice
principles. The Core seeks social justice by promoting fairness, equity and diversity in participation in research,
equitable access to skills building and networking opportunities, and shared decision-making that builds trust,
improves the utility of research results, and ultimately improves the human right to health. It is expected that the
Core's synergistic approaches will result in research findings that translate into changes in systems, policies,
and environments that eliminate chronic disease health disparities in our target regions and beyond."
10895677,"Altered metabolism is recognized as a common hallmark of cancer. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism
has been extensively studied; however, the role of fatty acid (FA) metabolism in tumorigenesis and disease
progression, as well as treatment resistance, remains poorly understood. Following our initial discovery of FASN,
a key enzyme of de novo lipid biosynthesis, as an important regulator or tumor progression in colorectal cancer
(CRC), studies from our group and others have firmly established an oncogenic role of FASN in multiple tumor
types. Increased fatty acid biosynthesis is needed not only to accommodate high rates of proliferation by
providing building blocks for membrane synthesis, but also to enhance cancer cells’ ability to defend against
oxidative stress- or chemotherapy-induced cell death by changing membrane lipid composition. Given the strong
rationale for targeting FASN in cancer therapy, a new class of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of
FASN (TVBs) have been developed and characterized in pre-clinical and clinical investigations. Our group has
conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled window trial with TVB-2640 in patients with resectable
colon and other cancers. Results from the interim analysis of this ongoing clinical investigation revealed that
short-term oral TVB-2640 therapy demonstrates excellent on-target inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and
manageable safety profile. However, our preclinical studies using CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)
showed that FASN inhibitors only modest reduce tumor growth despite a significant decrease in lipogenesis in
vivo. Thus, targeting FASN alone is unlikely to be sufficient to eradicate cancer cells. In exciting new findings,
we showed that FASN inhibition potentiates chemotherapy drug-induced DNA damage in colon cancer cells as
a result of altered histone acetylation. In addition, we discovered that FASN inhibition promotes the activation of
the cGAS/STING pathway and downstream type I interferon (IFN) response. The overall objective of this study
is to identify novel mechanisms that can enhance the antitumor efficacy of FASN inhibitors in CRC. The central
hypothesis driving this proposal is that a combination treatment strategy, which includes FASN inhibition, will
prevent chemoresistance by blocking DNA damage response and potentiating the activation of innate immune
signaling via epigenetic mechanisms. The following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) to define the molecular
mechanisms by which FASN inhibition blocks DNA repair pathways; 2) to delineate the functional significance
of FASN inhibition on modulating tumor immune microenvironment; and 3) to determine the impact of FASN
inhibition on enhancing the efficacy of CRC therapies in vivo. Our highly collaborative group has the requisite
expertise, innovative model systems, state-of-the-art technology, and novel inhibitors to make rapid progress
that will potentially provide novel treatment options to improve patient outcome."
10897822,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The overall goal of this project is to develop and comprehensively validate ultra-low count quantitative SPECT
(ULC-QSPECT) methods for alpha particle radiopharmaceutical therapies (αRPTs), including in a first-in-man
trial in patients with bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. αRPTs, such as those based on
Actinium-225, Thorium-227 and approved Radium-223 isotopes, are an emerging class of cytotoxic therapies
for patients with disseminated metastatic disease using internally administered alpha-particle emitting agents.
Despite the great potential of these therapies, current αRPT regimens are not personalized, with administered
activity dependent merely on mass, likely leading to non-optimal therapy. To address this challenge, there is a
crucial unmet need for methods to measure the isotope uptake, and hence the absorbed radiation dose with
these therapies, both at sites of disease and in vital dose-limiting organs. SPECT provides a clinically translatable
mechanism to achieve this goal. However, a key challenge to SPECT-based quantification is that the
administered activities in αRPTs are orders of magnitude lower than a typical SPECT scan, leading to ultra-low
detected count levels. Conventional approaches to quantification that reconstruct the isotope distribution and
estimate the regional uptake from reconstructed images are erroneous at these low count levels. To address
this issue, we put forwards a novel computational ULC-QSPECT framework for regional activity estimation from
αRPTs. These methods quantify regional uptake directly from projection data skipping the reconstruction step,
and at the same time, extract the maximal possible information from the acquired projection data. For this
purpose, we propose novel methods that accurately model the physics of imaging αRPTs, including stray-
radiation-related noise, use data from multiple-energy windows, incorporate scatter-window photons for
quantification, and process data in list-mode format. Our extensive preliminary data show that the proposed
methods result in nearly unbiased uptake and variances close to the theoretical limit. We propose to further
develop and rigorously evaluate these methods. Our proposed evaluations include studies over multiple
scanners with different detectors and different collimator configurations. Further, our goal is clinical translation
of these methods. Towards this goal, we propose to clinically evaluate these methods for measuring activity
concentrations at sites of uptake of [223Ra]RaCl2 in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer. These methods
will enable quantification of activity at disease sites in the skeleton as well as clearance through the intestine.
The approach has direct relevance to patients as it achieves noninvasive imaging of low-administered activity
therapies. Further, this proposal has substantial potential impact to improve both safety and efficacy of drug
development efforts in this rapidly evolving space. Further, the methods developed in this proposal will
strengthen the clinical utility of SPECT in managing patients with these therapies."
10897823,"Peripheral nerves spontaneously regenerate but the axon growth rate is abysmally slow, such that 
complete functional reinnervation of targets is rarely achieved in humans. Axon regeneration in 
the central nervous system is even worse, such that individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) 
almost invariably have permanent lose of sensory and motor functions below the level of the lesion. 
 There is a pressing need to accelerate axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system and 
increase axon regeneration in the central nervous system. Our research program focuses on axon 
intrinsic mechanisms of regeneration. Intra-axonally synthesized proteins support axon growth in 
developing neurons. We have shown that PNS neurons retain the capacity to synthesize proteins in 
their axons and these proteins support growth of injured axons. Axons of cultured neurons contain 
thousands of mRNAs – and several lines of evidence point to complex populations of mRNAs in CNS 
axons in vivo and spinal cord axons contain mRNAs and translational machinery when encouraged to 
regenerate with permissive substrates. Despite
remarkable advances since the early 2000’s, the molecular mechanisms that determine when and where 
a specific mRNA is translated in axons remain largely unknown. This level of regulation is 
critical for regulating axon growth capacity. We have shown that mRNAs are stored in PNS axons in 
RNA-protein aggregates that contain the stress granule protein G3BP1. G3BP1 protein can drive 
stress granule aggregation, and G3BP1 phosphorylation blocks stress granule assembly. Unlike the 
classically defined stress granule, axonal G3PB1 protein shows aggregation in uninjured/functioning 
PNS axons. These axonal G3BP1 aggregates rapidly increase after axotomy, but decrease to below 
basal levels shortly thereafter with a corresponding increase in phosphorylated G3BP1. G3BP1 binds 
to mRNAs in axons and attenuates their translation. We have discovered exogenous agents and 
endogenous signals that trigger disassembly of axonal G3BP1 aggregates. The exogenous agents 
specifically increase axonal protein synthesis and accelerate axon growth rates in vitro and in 
vivo. These observations have led us to hypothesize that physiological aggregation of stress 
granule proteins in axons attenuates axon growth in the injured PNS and CNS by blocking translation 
of an axonal mRNA cohort. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim 1 – Promotion of axon growth by inhibition of G3BP1 function.
Aim 2 – Endogenous mechanisms for axonal G3BP1 aggregate disassembly.
Aim 3 – Mechanisms driving axon growth upon disassembly of axonal G3BP1 aggregates.
Functional roles for axonal translation have now come to light and we have solid in vivo evidence 
that this mechanism can be targeted to accelerate axon growth after acute peripheral nerve injury. 
Completion of the proposed research will bring new insight into mechanisms for temporal regulation 
of axonal mRNA translation in axon injury & regeneration and uncover new therapeutic strategies for 
neural repair."

10898712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinal dystrophy-caused vision impairment severely impacts the quality of life for millions of people world-
wide. Despite advances in recent decades, current medicine still lacks safe and effective treatments for many
blinding diseases. Neuroprotective therapies aimed at delaying neuronal loss and preserving visual function
could, therefore, be a useful strategy for treating slow-progressing blinding diseases such as age-related
macular degeneration and glaucoma. The cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is known to act as a
potent neuroprotective agent in a variety of retinal degeneration models. However, chronic exposure to high
doses of CNTF results in the suppression of visual function in spite of preventing neuronal death. In order to
leverage the beneficial while avoiding the detrimental effects of CNTF, it is critical to understand CNTF signal-
induced cellular events in the retina.
To provide greater insight into ongoing CNTF clinical trials aimed at treating blinding diseases, we performed
molecular genetic analyses in mouse retinal degeneration models infected with a viral vector we engineered
to express the same human recombinant CNTF being used in clinical trials. We demonstrated that CNTF
initially targets Muller glia, which in turn activate a signaling loop between Muller glia and photoreceptors,
leading to photoreceptor survival. We also showed that CNTF signaling rapidly and extensively alters the
retinal transcriptome, which may underlie the CNTF-mediated suppression of visual function. In addition, we
have demonstrated that removal of a cytokine signaling inhibitor in rod photoreceptors is sufficient to enhance
their survival in the absence of exogenous CNTF, indicating that modulation of endogenous cytokine signaling
can promote photoreceptor viability. Moreover, our recent study has revealed that CNTF treatment profoundly
impacts retinal metabolism, resulting in enhanced aerobic glycolysis and anabolism, elevated energy
production, and restored retinal redox status.
The proposed research will combine molecular and biochemical approaches to further our understanding on
the cellular process elicited by CNTF in the retina. We will examine cell type-specific transcriptomic changes
and altered metabolic pathways to fully assess effects of CNTF treatments on various cell types. We will
evaluate the role of a key glycolytic enzyme in photoreceptor maintenance and survival. We will also
determine the distinct functions of cytokine signaling components involved in the CNTF-induced metabolic
changes. Outcomes of the proposed research will advance our knowledge of neuroprotection mechanisms,
especially the role of metabolism in sustaining neuronal survival, and thus facilitate the development of more
efficacious treatments for retinal degeneration."
10898723,"Project Summary/Abstract: Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and lethal
malignancy with few therapeutic options. Tumor transcriptional states are strongly correlated with therapeutic
responses and clinical outcomes in PDAC. However, the mechanisms that regulate PDAC cell states and their
roles in tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance are not well understood. In this proposal, I will investigate
mechanisms regulating PDAC cell state specification, characterize tumor cell plasticity as a potential mechanism
of therapeutic resistance, and identify cell state-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches. In Aim 1, I will investigate how TGF-β signaling specifies the basal cell state in
organoid models. In Aim 2, I will examine whether TGF-β-mediated cellular plasticity drives chemo-resistance in
organoid models and serially collected metastatic biopsies analyzed with single-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3,
I will perform compound testing and CRISPR screening in isogenic organoid models induced to adopt either
basal or classical states to identify state-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Together, these aims will establish
a rigorous framework for the analysis and modeling of PDAC evolution and will advance our mechanistic
understanding of how microenvironmental factors such as TGF-β regulate PDAC cell states, plasticity, and drug
resistance, thereby uncovering new avenues for therapeutic development.

10898769,"Project Summary/Abstract
The sensitive period for phonetic learning, which occurs between 6~12 months of age, is
demonstrably one of the earliest milestones for language acquisition, as infants’ speech processing
during this period can reliably predict later language skills. Most recently, my work has shown for the
first time that neural processing of speech during this period can predict not only individual grammar
skills at 6 years, but also the risk of developing speech and language disorders in typically developing
infants. This result suggests an important clinical relevance of the sensitive period and demonstrates
a crucial need to further understand the underlying neural mechanisms of the sensitive period,
particularly whether it may already be altered in infants at high-risk of developing language disorders,
such as the developmental language disorder (DLD). Elucidating the neural mechanism would not
only allow for the expansion of theories to encompass atypical language development, but more
importantly, help identify early markers for language disorders and aid in the development of targeted
early interventions. Specifically, the sensitive period is characterized by a divergence in speech
processing, whereby infants’ sensitivity for native speech contrasts improves while sensitivity for
nonnative speech contrasts declines. It is theorized to be a specialization process for the native
language, where less native language specialization is associated with slower language growth.
However, behavioral and functional neuroimaging studies have only investigated typically developing
infants (Low-Risk), but not infants with a family history of communication disorders (High-Risk). It is
possible that differences already emerge during this period that separate High-Risk infants and these
differences may underlie later language difficulties in the High-Risk population. The current Katz ESI
proposal aims to shift the focus and specifically examine High-Risk infants with a family history of
DLD and compare them with Low-Risk infants at ~6 (start), ~12 (end) and ~14 (delayed end of
sensitive period) months of ages, with the central theoretical hypothesis that High-Risk infants would
demonstrate a protracted sensitive period, or a lagged native language specialization than Low-Risk
infants. Particularly, we examine both higher and lower levels of neural processes for speech, as well
as in the link between the neural processes. The higher-level processes related to speech
discrimination is indexed by the mismatch response (MMR) while lower-level sensory encoding of
speech is indexed by the complex auditory brainstem response (cABR). Both measures will be
obtained simultaneously with Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Together, the proposed study will
help uncover neural mechanisms underlying atypical language development and perfectly aligns with
the mission of NIDCD to conduct research in disordered processes of speech and language."
10898826,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The overall objective of this proposal is to shed light on neural circuits underlying the transition from recreational
to compulsive drug use, and, in doing so, to provide the candidate with training in advanced techniques to study
the neural circuitry involved in drug use and abuse.
Substance use disorders are characterized by compulsive drug use in spite of negative consequences, which
might arise from the development of strong drug-taking “habits.” These habits consist of rigid, inflexible drug-
seeking behavior, and they stand in contrast to “goal-directed” drug-seeking, which is more flexible and driven
by pursuit of a desired outcome (e.g. a euphoric state or relief from withdrawal). Habits can arise from behavior
motivated by either natural reward (e.g. food) or drugs, and behavior that is initially goal-driven can transition to
habitual control. Studies have shown that the shift from goal-driven behavior to habit is accompanied by a shift
in behavioral control from the ventral to the dorsal striatum, and recent evidence suggests that this intra-striatal
shift is “downstream” of a shift from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), to the central amygdala (CeA). However,
direct evidence for this theory is lacking, especially in the form of a signaling mechanism. Moreover, although
there is evidence that dopaminergic input to the BLA and CeA is essential for the maintenance of cued drug-
seeking, it is unclear how dopamine receptors in the amygdala are involved in the initiation of drug-taking or the
formation of drug-seeking habits.
Therefore, the candidate will pursue three sets of experiments, each examining the transition from goal-directed
to habitual behavior in the context of both natural reward and cocaine self-administration: (1) recording neural
activity simultaneously in the BLA and CeA, (2) using an optogenetic strategy to stimulate or inhibit dopaminergic
input to the BLA or CeA, and (3) using a chemogenetic strategy (DREADDs) to inhibit specific projections from
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the BLA or CeA. In this way, the proposed experiments will elucidate the
signaling mechanism, the role of dopamine, and the role of divergent mPFC inputs in BLA/CeA control of goal-
directed vs. habitual behavior.
During the award period, the candidate will undergo rigorous training in the techniques and theory underlying
self-administration studies of substance use and addiction. The candidate will also gain training and experience
in advanced techniques for neural circuit dissection, including optogenetics and chemogenetics. This work will
take place in both the candidate’s dedicated lab space and the labs of the candidate’s unique cross-departmental

Bacteria come in many shapes, which may enhance motility, biofilm formation, nutrient uptake, and
pathogenesis. However, the functional consequences of shape have not been well studied, owing in part to a
paucity of tools to manipulate bacterial cell shape. To probe how form (cell shape) drives function (radiation to
diverse niches), we must first understand how shape is generated. Bacterial shapes, varying from spheres to
rods to helices, all arise from the same cell wall polymer: peptidoglycan (PG). The PG wall surrounds the cell
to contain turgor pressure. The major hypothesis in the field holds that diverse shapes arise from different
patterns of PG synthesis. Indeed, Caulobacter crescentus and Vibrio cholerae, curved rods, require fixed cell
spanning cytoskeletal proteins that bias PG synthesis to the opposite side of the cell to generate curvature.
Helicobacter pylori has emerged as a useful model to study of helical shape. This bacterium persistently
colonizes the human stomach causing chronic inflammation and clinical pathologies ranging from peptic ulcers
to gastric cancer, the world’s fourth leading cause of cancer mortality. We isolated mutants with stable non-
helical shapes, and our work demonstrating their defects in stomach colonization presented the first
experimental evidence for a link between cell curvature and bacterial infectivity that has now been extended to
other bacteria (Vibrio, Campylobacter). H. pylori’s strategy for maintaining helical shape differs significantly
from other studied bacteria. We showed that two distinct cytoskeletal proteins, MreB and the bactofilin CcmA,
promote higher relative rates of new cell wall incorporation at the major and minor helical axes, respectively,
and neither form cell spanning filaments. We found that CcmA requires the transmembrane protein Csd5 to
localize to the major helical axis and the Csd5-CcmA complex also contains the MurF PG precursor synthesis
enzyme, suggesting a possible mechanism for promoting PG synthesis. Our analyses of H. pylori morphology
during chronic infection revealed shape diversification (including changes in helical pitch and even loss of
helical curvature) that genetically maps to previously identified cell shape genes.
In this renewal application we propose to define mechanisms by which the Csd5-CcmA complex is localized
the major helical axis (Aim 1), define mechanisms of enhanced PG synthesis at the major and minor helical
axes and the role of spatially variation in relative PG synthesis rates and/or endopeptidase activity in
maintaining helical cell shape (Aim 2), and determine how cytoskeletal protein dynamics and natural sequence
polymorphisms modify helical pitch and stomach colonization (Aim3). A more complete understanding of the
mechanisms H. pylori uses to maintain and vary helical cell shape is needed to identify vulnerabilities that
could be targeted to augment current treatment regimens and to probe the mechanisms by which H. pylori
persists in the stomach to cause disease."

The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal is to develop fluorescent labels for single-cell
classification through imaging of intact three-dimensional tissue. We are focusing on semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs), nanocrystals that exhibit bright fluorescence and unique optical and electronic properties. We
designed new classes of QDs which we propose will allow quantitative, multispectral analysis of 30 or more
distinct molecules so that hyperspectral light sheet microscopy can be used to proteomically profile and
comprehensively map 20 or more distinct cell types throughout an intact tissue after a single staining step. This
technology addresses an outstanding bottleneck in optical microscopy of three-dimensional tissue, for which
only 3 distinct molecular markers can be easily distinguished, limiting the capacity to precisely classify cell types
and to co-localize different cell types. This proposal comes at a time when new light sheet microscopes have
recently become widely available for full-thickness imaging of optically cleared tissues at sub-cellular resolution
such that rapid advances in multiplexing could yield rapid impacts. As an example, the investigators of this project
developed workflows to optically clear, immunolabel, and image intact adipose tissues from lean and obese
rodent models, in addition to software to comprehensively identify cells based on fluorescent immunostains, and
deep learning algorithms to automate microenvironment segmentation. With these advances, we were able to
discover new classes of immune microenvironments in adipose tissue that are believed to promote comorbidities
of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However key hypotheses regarding the nature of these
microenvironments cannot be readily addressed until we can discretely categorize cells based on their molecular
expression patterns within their contextual microenvironments. In this proposal, our technological goal is to
develop fluorophores for high-content multiplexing in intact tissues. Our biological goal is to use these tools to
understand immune cell microenvironments that regulate adipose tissue in the state of obesity. Our Specific
Aims are to (1) engineer the photophysics of new classes of QD-based labels, (2) conjugate these labels to
antibody fragments and validate their target specificity as molecular probes, (3) quantitatively evaluate cell
labeling and classification accuracy in three-dimensional adipose tissue, and (4) apply probe panels to quantify
adipose immune microenvironments at the cellular level in the lean and obese states. This is a collaborative
proposal between engineers and scientists with expertise in quantum dots and molecular probes (Andrew Smith),
advanced optical microscopy (Paul Selvin), biomedical image computing (Mark Anastasio), cellular immunology
(Erik Nelson), and animal models of obesity (Kelly Swanson)."

Conventional precision oncology concentrates on applying molecularly targeted drugs based on
genomic markers from a tumor. Such a genome-informed approach has limitations, mainly
because it covers around 15% of all cancer patients. While chemotherapies remain the
backbone of oncology, their application is not personalized. In this study, we proposed to
develop an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting cancer cell sensitivity to
chemotherapies. We will apply the framework to solve a real-world clinical problem: guiding the
precision application of oxaliplatin in treating colon cancer adjuvant therapy.
Our framework consists of two phases: A representation-learning phase, which involves
developing and applying advanced AI models that can infer and represent the state of cellular
signaling systems of cancer cells by mining diverse omics data of cancers. A cell-state-
oriented drug sensitivity prediction phase, which involves using advanced classification
models to utilize the inferred cancer cell states to predict the drug response of different cancer
cells. Importantly, we will address an unmet clinical need in treating colon cancer patients as a
real-world use case.
With estimated 1.9 million incidences, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd most common cancer
and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death. Patients with resected high-risk stage II/III colon
cancer (CC) receive adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent cancer recurrence. A regimen consisting
of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard of care for CC adjuvant
therapy. It is estimated that including oxaliplatin in the regimen benefits 5% - 6% of patients but
subjects ~90% of patients to life-impairing neurotoxicity. A significant effort in oncology is to
identify the patients who would not benefit from oxaliplatin and save them from unnecessary
side effects (de-escalation).
In this study, we will collect large-scale omics data from colon cancer patients. We propose
advanced causal discovery and deep learning to infer the state of signaling systems of cancer
cells and further develop advanced individualized treatment effect prediction models to guide
oxaliplatin treatment."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States and is
projected to affect 14 million people by 2060. Accumulation of tau pathology in AD strongly correlates to
patients' cognitive decline. Current models of progressive tau pathology rely on either transgenic mice or tau
fibrils isolated from the diseased human brain in wild-type mice. Attempts to induce tau pathology in wild-type
mice using recombinant tau fibrils have failed. Recent studies have revealed structural and post-translational
differences between recombinant and human-derived tau fibrils that may drive this difference in seeding
capacity.
 The overarching goal of this fellowship is to use in vitro and in vivo methods to determine the
conformational and environmental drivers of tau pathology seeding. Recent work produced truncated tau fibrils
with various core structures, including one with a core that is structurally identical to the core region of AD
PHFs. Yet, these recombinant fibrils lack post-translational modifications associated with neurofibrillary
tangles. Proteomic work has identified post-translationally modified residues on the tau protein associated with
pathology, and many of these disease-associated post-translational modifications can be introduced by
producing tau in insect cells. The proposed research will take advantage of these recent innovations to assess
the role of tau fibril structure and post-translational modifications in seeding capacity. Aim 1 of this work will
use tau fibrils with varying core structures, including those identical to AD tau, and post-translational
modifications to evaluate the pathological seeding capacity in a primary neuron culture model. Aim 2 of this
work will utilize a quantitative pathology modeling workflow to quantify progressive pathological seeding of
selected tau fibrils in wild-type mice over the course of nine months. The data collected and training acquired
during this fellowship not only have the potential to shape future model systems in AD but will also shape and
focus my trajectory towards becoming a leader in neurodegenerative research.
 Under this training period at Van Andel Research Institute, I will develop technical skills in image
analysis, mouse neuroanatomy, and negative stain EM. I will also have ample opportunity to gain confidence in
both oral and poster presentations. My collaborations with the cryo-electron microscopy core at VAI, a
biotechnology company, and a world leader in tau fibril structure will allow me to gain expertise in running
collaborative projects in addition to receiving additional guidance on structure-based questions in the field of
neurodegenerative disease."

Development of a functional jaw requires precise shaping of the underlying skeleton and proper integration
with the musculature through tendons and ligaments. In the jaw, both the skeleton and connective tissues such
as tendons and ligaments derive from multipotent cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCCs). My project
focuses on two novel mechanisms by which skeletal and connective tissue fates are balanced in the vertebrate
jaw. In a previous study, we revealed that the nuclear hormone receptor Nr5a2 functions to promote
connective tissue at the expense of skeletal fates in both the mouse and zebrafish jaw, yet the mechanisms by
which Nr5a2 represses jaw skeleton formation were unknown. By analyzing single-cell sequencing data of
nr5a2 mutants, I have identified the bile acid synthesis enzyme Hsd3b7 and the transcription factor Foxp2 as
two potential targets of Nr5a2 that repress Hedgehog-dependent induction of lower jaw cartilage. In Aim 1, I
test that Hsd3b7 functions as a jaw-specific repressor of Hedgehog signaling by depleting the Hedgehog co-
factor cholesterol from the cell membrane of tendon-forming CNCCs. In Aim 2, I test that Foxp2 competes with
the Hedgehog target Foxc1, with Foxp2 closing cartilage enhancers in the tendon-forming region of the jaw
that would normally be opened by Foxc1. My research will therefore show novel and jaw-specific mechanisms
by which two Nr5a2 target genes function upstream and downstream of Hedgehog signaling to pattern the
region of the developing jaw generating tendons and other connective tissues. These findings will shed light on
how alterations to Hedgehog regulation and chromatin accessibility may underlie human birth defects affecting
jaw development. The research project and training plan for the fellowship period have been designed to lay
the groundwork for my long-term goal of obtaining a position as a tenure-track professor at a top-tier academic
research institution. I will receive mentorship from Dr. Gage Crump, a leading scientist in zebrafish craniofacial
development. The experiments in this proposal will take place on the Health Sciences Campus of the
University of Southern California, which hosts vibrant communities of craniofacial and stem cell scientists."
10901303,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SCN8A epileptic encephalopathy (EE) is a severe epilepsy syndrome resulting from de novo gain-of-function
mutations in the SCN8A gene, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6. Nav1.6 is expressed
in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and plays a critical role in action potential (AP) generation and
propagation in both. Multiple previous studies have indicated that a gain-of-function Nav1.6 mutant results in
hyperexcitability of excitatory cells. However, significantly less is known about how mutant Nav1.6 may impact
inhibitory interneurons. Proper function of inhibitory interneurons is essential to constrain activity of excitatory
neurons, and their dysfunction has been linked to various genetic epilepsy syndromes. The most numerous
inhibitory interneuron subtypes are parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons.
Previous work in our lab has shown deficits in SST interneurons in models of SCN8A EE. PV interneurons play
a crucial role in Dravet Syndrome, a genetic epilepsy syndrome caused by mutations in the sodium channel
Nav1.1, and they may play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite this, there have been no studies in the
SCN8A EE field examining the effect of mutant Nav1.6 expression on PV interneuron physiology and the role
that they may play in seizures. Using global (Scn8aD/+) and conditional (Scn8aW/+-PV; expression solely in PV
interneurons) mouse models of SCN8A EE, this proposal seeks to test whether PV interneuron excitability is
affected by mutant Nav1.6, and if this impacts overall network excitability and seizure susceptibility. My
preliminary data suggest that PV interneurons possessing mutant Nav1.6 have increased persistent sodium
currents and reduced excitability at high-firing frequencies via a state of action potential failure known as
depolarization block. I have also observed that conditional expression of a patient derived SCN8A mutation
solely in PV interneurons leads to spontaneous seizures in mice, further indicating the importance of this
interneuron subtype within SCN8A EE. In aim 1 of this proposal, I will record WT, Scn8aD/+, and Scn8aW/+ PV
interneurons to characterize any alterations in the intrinsic excitability, voltage-gated sodium currents, and
synaptic physiology of PV interneurons. This will clarify the impact of gain-of-function SCN8A mutations on PV
interneuron function and network excitability. In aim 2, using a Cre-dependent shRNA, I will test whether
genetic knockdown of Nav1.6 specifically in PV interneurons will rescue their aberrant excitability and if this will
impact seizure frequency in Scn8aD/+ mice. Overall, completion of these aims will allow for a comprehensive
characterization of PV interneurons in SCN8A EE and will assess whether the specific targeting of these
interneurons might provide a novel therapeutic target."
10901368,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
An organism's capacity to develop and grow is heavily dependent on its ability to organize various aspects of
structure, ranging from G-actin to F-actin, cross-linked filaments, F-actin networks, and multicellular
networks—in short, coordinate structure at multiple levels of order. Despite advances in characterizing proteins
that affect actin at different levels of the structural hierarchy, we have limited knowledge of how regulation of
actin is integrated across these hierarchical levels. Bitesize, the only Synaptotagmin-like protein in flies, is a
membrane-bound protein that has recently been demonstrated to also directly bundle filamentous actin;
preliminary data has further demonstrated that Bitesize promotes F-actin assembly. However, the mechanisms
driving these actin-organizing behaviors of Bitesize have not been determined; moreover, the manner in which
such mechanisms combine to produce a net effect in vivo is unknown. The long-term goal of this work is to
elucidate how mechanisms that control different hierarchical levels of actin organization are integrated to
facilitate morphogenesis. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying
Bitesize's organization of actin and their combined effect on Drosophila embryo development. My rationale for
the proposed work is that Bitesize demonstrates direct interaction with actin, and therefore offers a unique
opportunity to study the direct regulation of actin's structural hierarchy at multiples levels through the probing of
a single protein. My hypothesis is that Bitesize integrates the regulation of actin assembly and actin bundling
via distinct domains along its length. My aims are to: 1) determine the mechanism used by Bitesize to bundle
actin, and 2) determine whether Bitesize separately regulates assembly and nucleation of actin. This approach
is innovative in its coupling of structure-function analysis of Bitesize’s interaction partners with the in vivo
study of btsz gene function in an animal tissue using precise gene edits. My proposed research is significant
because it will determine means of coordinating hierarchical structures of actin, and because it is expected to
demonstrate new mechanisms of regulating actin, such as stimulation of Dia via formin elongation effector
domains, that have not been demonstrated in animals in vivo. This research will be accompanied by training
in biochemistry as well as Drosophila embryology and genetics, which will take place in the Martin lab and
Schwartz lab in the Department of Biology and Cryo-EM Facility at MIT, as well as in the Goode lab at
Brandeis University. Together, this research and training will prepare me to establish an independent lab to
investigate fundamental questions related to the formation of functional, hierarchical structures in cells and
tissues."

The T32 Pathophysiology of Human Blood Cells, now in its 37th year of funding, is seeking renewal to continue
a long-standing focus on training physician-scientists in pediatric Hematology/Oncology. The object of the
training program is to provide PhD and PhD-post-doctoral level research experiences and scholarly research
training in Hematology/Oncology, so as to render trainees independent investigators making substantive
contributions to biomedical research, both basic and translational. The program has continued to grow in this
last cycle with the appointments of Drs. Stuart Orkin as the Training Grant Co-Director and Scott Armstrong as
the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Fellowship Program Director. In addition
to maintaining the program's strengths in stem cell biology, platelets/ thrombosis, neutrophil biology/innate
immunity, red cell biology/hemoglobin expression and an overall emphasis in translational research, we have
expanded our efforts in areas of gene therapy and stem cell transplant. In addition, programs are in place to
target women in undergraduate science classes and MD/PhD students at Harvard Medical School/MIT to
enhance the future pipeline of trainees coming to this T32. The 60+ mentoring faculty on this training grant
include outstanding scientists many with exemplary publication and training records. In spite of pressures on
the NIH budget, research funds to the Division currently total $57.2 M in direct costs per year including 120 NIH
grants. The total support to the mentoring faculty is $78,411,173 in direct costs for the current year. The
training faculty is highly collaborative, and Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard
Stem Cell Institute, Harvard, Harvard Catalyst (CTSA) and MIT academic environments provide stellar
opportunities for formal coursework and for a myriad of scientific seminars and lectures. Of those applying for
positions on this T32, 5% are accepted. Of those accepted in the last 15 years, 15% were underrepresented
minorities (URM) and 65% were women. There are formal processes in place for regular trainee and faculty
feedback. Success of trainees as judged by success in obtaining NIH training grants and independent faculty
positions is outstanding and nearly 100% of entering fellows remain in hematology/ oncology in scientific
careers. Indeed, graduates of this training program now represent leaders in the field with significant numbers
serving in academic or pharmaceutical/ biotech leadership positions. This success continues in the latest
funded cycle. Of the 51 MD and MD/PhD trainees who have trained here within the past 15 years, 36 (71%)
have obtained career awards and/or prestigious fellowships, including 18 K awards (1 K07, 1 K23, and
16 K08's; plus 2 funded on a K12) and 19 private fellowships (11 K award holders also obtained private
fellowships). We are requesting renewal with funding to support 11 training slots in the next funding period."
10894701,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the fourth most common cancer in women. While EC occurs most commonly in older
women, the mortality rate and incidence is exponentially increasing in women under 40 years of age. EC is
estimated to increase by 1–2% yearly and more than half of EC cases are attributable to obesity, which
is recognized as an independent risk factor. Approximately 80% of EC belong to the endometrioid EC (EEC)
(type I) and the remaining 20% is comprised of serous EC (SEC), clear cell EC (CEC), mixed EC, and uterine
carcinosarcoma (UCS) (type II). Surgery is widely used to treat EC; however, patients with advanced EC often
experience disease relapse. Despite receiving adjunctive therapy, these patients are at high risk of recurrence
of cancer and death. There is an unmet need for the development of new targeted therapies that complement
existing EC-directed therapies for advanced type I (grade 2, 3) and type II EC. The global gene expression
analysis of the cancer databases revealed a negative correlation between EC survival and Leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF) and its receptor, LIFR expression. Further, obesity conditions function as potent inducers of the
LIF/LIFR signaling. Together, these findings strongly suggest that LIF/LIFR signaling in EC may be clinically
actionable, and targeting LIF/LIFR axis with a small molecule inhibitor may block EC progression. We recently
developed a small molecule inhibitor of LIFR, EC359 and preliminary studies show that EC359 reduces the
growth of EC cells with high potency and promotes apoptosis. The preclinical xenograft studies showed that
EC359 is highly efficacious in reducing EC xenograft tumor growth and block EC progression driven by obesity.
The objective of this proposal is to establish the mechanisms by which LIF/LIFR signaling contributes to EC
progression and to test the efficacy of the LIFR inhibitor EC359 in treating EC. Our overarching hypothesis is
that LIF/LIFR signaling promotes EC progression, and that the LIFR inhibitor EC359 functions as an effective
targeted therapy to block EC progression. In Aim1, we will establish the mechanisms of how LIF/LIFR signaling
contributes to EC progression, define the significance of LIF/LIFR axis using global genomic approaches, test
the efficacy of EC359 in reducing stemness and chemoresistance of EC cells, investigate the mechanisms by
which obesity promote LIF/LIFR signaling in EC. In Aim2, we will test the utility of blocking the LIF/LIFR axis with
EC359 using multiple primary and established EC model cells and test the utility of EC359 on EC progression
as a monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy using xenografts, patient-derived explants (PDE),
organoids (PDO) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also test the utility of EC359 in reducing
obesity-driven EC. This proposal is clinically significant because it will establish translatability, mechanisms of a
first-in-class LIFR inhibitor, EC359, and enable a rational design of combination therapies. The LIFR inhibitor
EC359 can be utilized as a monotherapy, or in combination therapy with the standard-of-care, creating a new
paradigm using EC359 as a novel targeted therapy for advanced type I (grade 2, 3) and type II EC."
10894843,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macrophages are central regulators of inflammation and tissue healing following injury or
infection, and during disease. While much is known about how soluble, biochemical factors in the
environment regulate macrophage function, less is known about how biophysical cues regulate
their response, despite the fact that these cells exist within solid tissues that are rich in mechanical
cues. Furthermore, many diseases in which macrophages are involved, such as cancer and
fibrosis, are characterized by changes in tissue biophysical properties. Our previous work
demonstrated that adhesion to soft extracellular matrix hydrogels inhibits macrophage
inflammatory activation. In preliminary work, we found that matrix rigidity influences the
localization of YAP, a transcriptional co-factor involved in cell proliferation, organ size control, and
cancer, but with previously undescribed role in macrophage activation. Adhesion to stiff
substrates leads to YAP nuclear localization, which appears to prime macrophages for a potent
inflammatory response. In addition, cytoskeletal polymerization and the mechanically-activated
and calcium-permeable ion channel Piezo1 appear to be involved in YAP nuclear localization and
inflammatory activation. In this study, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying YAP signaling and Piezo1 activity in the macrophage response within different stiffness
environments. In Aim 1, we will examine the effect of stiffness on cytoskeletal remodeling and
associated signaling pathways on YAP activity. In Aim 2, we will probe the role of Piezo1-mediated
calcium activity in stiffness sensing, YAP signaling, and macrophage function. Finally, in Aim 3,
we will investigate the role of YAP and Piezo1 on macrophage-mediated wound healing in vivo
using a murine subcutaneous biomaterial implant model. An improved fundamental
understanding of how macrophages sense their mechanical environment may lead to new
immunomodulatory strategies that control macrophage function during disease."
10894923,"Project Summary: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a biomarker in oncology with several
transformative clinical applications. One application may be the ability to detect clinically undetectable minimal
residual disease (MRD) following curative intent treatment. In Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC), the primary
means of cure is surgical resection, but if any tumor cells remain post-surgery, this can lead to eventual
recurrence. In Stage III CRC, adjuvant chemotherapy also reduces recurrence risk, but 30% of patients will still
recur. ctDNA detection may predict which patients have the highest recurrence risk, but a key question is whether
an effective method to detect MRD can also identify patients who may benefit from additional therapy and
increase cure rates. In Aims 1 and 2 with a 500 patient, multi-institutional Stage III CRC trial, ACT3, funded by
Stand Up 2 Cancer, we will test the ability of ctDNA to identify patients who would recur without additional therapy
and evaluate if additional treatment allows for ctDNA “clearance.” ctDNA “clearance” will be used as a rapid
read-out for adjuvant therapy efficacy and subsequently evaluate if “clearance” correlates with improved
recurrence-free survival. With ACT3, we will also evaluate emerging technologies for MRD detection and identify
the optimal timing for MRD detection. This could create a novel approach for adjuvant clinical trials, providing a
opportunity to salvage more cures. A second potentially transformative, clinical application of ctDNA is real-time
monitoring of response to systemic therapy. While radiographic imaging remains the gold standard for measuring
treatment response and disease progression, the ability to detect early evidence of treatment response or
failure—before it is evident by standard radiographic imaging—could allow clinicians to rapidly adapt therapies
to optimize patient outcomes. A patient could be switched early on from an ineffective therapy to a potentially
effective therapy to achieve more rapid benefit, while minimizing the toxicity from continuing an ineffective
therapy. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that serial ctDNA monitoring may provide a real-time, non-invasive
means to track early therapeutic response for metastatic GI cancers in a 200-patient prospective study. We will
compare ctDNA changes to changes in standard tumor markers and patient reported outcomes assessing the
ability of each modality alone or in combination to predict radiographic response. In parallel, we will evaluate
novel technologies of ctDNA for response prediction. The primary work will take place at Massachusetts General
Hospital and expands upon my established relationships with my mentorship team consisting of internationally
recognized experts in liquid biopsies and clinical trials (primary mentor: Ryan Corcoran, MD PhD and co mentors
Luis M. Diaz, MD and David B Ryan, MD). A scientific advisory committee with complementary expertise will
also provide guidance (John Iafrate, MD, PhD and Keith Flaherty MD) and biostatistics (Nora Horick, MS). K08
support will provide the time and resources to further develop and achieve my career goal of becoming an
independent investigator with an expertise in biomarker driven investigator initiated studies in GI cancers."

The critical need remains to advance our understanding of benign genitourinary (GU) diseases – their etiology,
pathophysiology, and mechanisms of progression. The phenotypic expressions of many common benign GU
diseases are yet to be defined. Clinical gaps in knowledge include objective diagnostic tests and criteria for many
symptomatic benign GU conditions and the efficacy of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to
management. The impact of these conditions on other disease processes and whole body health; productivity,
functioning, and quality of life; and public health overall is virtually unknown. The impact of disparities in
healthcare and health outcomes on patients with benign GU disease is understudied. The potential power of
prevention is unexplored. The proposed Interactions Core for the Community of NIDDK-funded benign GU
Centers and Programs known as CAIRIBU (Collaborating for the Advancement of Interdisciplinary Research in
Benign Urology) will foster and support integrated basic and translational science that answers critical questions
in benign GU disease and builds the breadth and depth of benign urologic investigators. Our mission is to provide
intellectual leadership and logistic support for the CAIRIBU Community by identifying and facilitating
opportunities for cross-CAIRIBU collaboration and promoting research findings and resources to the broader
benign GU research community. Specific Aims are to: 1) provide scientific leadership to the CAIRIBU Community
by enabling the full potential of NIDDK staff and CAIRIBU leaders to provide guidance that results in highly
meritorious convergent research and highly-trained new investigators in benign GU diseases; 2) provide
leadership in team science by identifying and fostering opportunities for transdisciplinary interaction and
collaboration within CAIRIBU and among the broader benign GU research community; 3) provide administrative
support by building the CAIRIBU infrastructure to maximize communication, collaboration, coordination, and
resource sharing; and 4) develop internal and external evaluation mechanisms to maximize the performance,
transdisciplinary nature, productivity, and effectiveness of the Interactions Core and CAIRIBU Community. Our
Interactions Core is led by a Principal Investigator who is an established benign GU disease investigator and
has functioned in a pilot capacity as Director of Interactions for CAIRIBU since July 2018. Our Co-Investigator is
an expert in the science of team science and has experience in collaboration-building and measuring
collaborative science efforts. The University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health provides the
ideal environment for supporting the Interactions Core due to its multiple resources. The Department of Urology
is the idea “home” for the Interactions Core due to its strong commitment to and track record in benign GU
research. Our Core will use innovative approaches to leverage CAIRIBU members’ common passion for
addressing critical gaps in knowledge in benign GU disease."

be accomplished by integrating established, successful programs in diverse cancer biology themes together with
clinical exposure into one cohesive program. Trainees will receive didactic and non-didactic instruction;
laboratory-based basic science research training in cancer research and cutting-edge clinical applications; and
career development as independent cancer biologists. To further growth as important members of the scientific
community, students and fellows will receive ample training to articulate their ideas and communicate them
effectively, evaluate biomedical research and mentor others in scientific excellence. This program assembles a
cohesive group of faculty from various departments at the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Medicine,
College of Arts and Sciences, and College of Pharmacy. In the past 10 years, our program faculty trained 104
doctoral students and 109 post-doctoral students; our faculty have the experience and interdisciplinary focus to
guide this group of trainees to function in research teams pursuing multidisciplinary investigations. We mentor
trainees to be proficient at utilizing hypothesis-driven approaches as well as discovery-oriented research design
to address key problems. All trainees are required to complete foundation courses in graduate-level Genetics,
Biochemistry, Immunology, Pharmacology, Physiology, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, Ethics, Biostatistics, and
Bioinformatics, as well as Biology and Therapy of Cancer, which emphasizes clinical aspects of human cancer.
Unique features of this program include interdisciplinary training emphasizing bench to bedside (and vice versa)
research topics, as well as a mandatory Clinical Perspectives in Oncology workshop that encompasses tumor
boards and clinician shadowing to provide a bridge between the fundamental biology of cancer and clinical
cancer. Training also involves mandatory participation in the weekly Markey Cancer Center (MCC) Seminars,
Cancer Biology journal club, training workshops in specialized topics, and the Fellowship Boot Camp to increase
the number of individual fellowships and grants from our trainees. The ultimate objective of this program is to
develop a cadre of future scientists who will lead integrative team approaches and understand the complex issue
of cancer as it relates to potential prevention and treatment strategies. To ensure our commitment to the clinical
translation of basic science discoveries, MCC Associate Director Kathleen O’Connor, PhD, and Director B. Mark
Evers, MD, will serve as PIs for this team-based training program. UK places a significant emphasis on training
minority students, post-doctoral researchers and physicians; this program will continue to ensure the inclusion
of individuals from underrepresented racial, ethnic and underserved background to better serve our diverse
society. Accordingly, with the enthusiastic support of the MCC and the UK Vice President for Research, this
training program will mentor the next generation of cancer researchers to better understand and treat cancers."
10894811,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and it is estimated
that one in ten Americans aged 65 and older has AD. The number of Americans with Alzheimer’s will escalate
rapidly in coming years as the size and proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 and older increases. With no
disease-altering or curative drugs available, and with more than 140 failed clinical trials, AD has become a major
public health concern. There is a consensus that a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of this
devastating illness is needed to move the field forward. The amyloid-cascade hypothesis has been the leading
theoretical construct guiding our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD for the past thirty years. However,
this construct has overlooked the multifaceted cellular mechanisms that ultimately drive neurodegeneration and
the subsequent clinical manifestations of the disease. It has been hypothesized that aberrant metabolic signaling
is a major cellular mechanism driving AD. These metabolic perturbations may arise through the dysfunction of
adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the master regulator of cellular energy
status. Despite its strong association with AD, AMPK has not been fully characterized in AD: it is unknown how
the subcellular localization, activity, and expression are changed in vulnerable regions of the human AD brain.
Pre-clinical literature implicates AMPK in the regulation of synaptic function, A metabolism, tau phosphorylation,
and pathologic proteostasis in AD. AMPK is an obligatory heterotrimer composed of catalytic () and regulatory
( and ) subunits. While the  subunit has been functionally characterized in AD models, the role of the
regulatory subunits is unknown. As such, a functional understanding of this kinase in human substrates is
missing. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that nuclear AMPK activity and localization is decreased in
AD. We will test this hypothesis by using postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from mild
cognitive impairment and AD subjects to analyze changes of AMPK as the disease progresses (Specific Aim 1).
In parallel, we will employ an omics platform to specifically complement our biochemical studies. Further, we will
use cortical neurons derived from AD-patient iPSCs to evaluate the role of the overlooked regulatory AMPK1
subunit in modulating a metabolic and synaptic phenotype (Specific Aim 2). This proposal addresses a critical
need to resolve the role of AMPK in the pathophysiology of this disorder. This research, in conjunction with the
experienced mentoring team, will provide this prospective Fellow an excellent training experience. Specifically,
this F30 Fellowship will support the applicant in gaining expertise in cell biology, bioinformatics, stem cell culture,
gene-manipulation strategies, and postmortem tissue processing, in preparation for a career as a translational
physician-scientist."

Melanoma continues to be a devastating cancer. Early stage melanomas represent the majority of melanomas
that are diagnosed and managed in the US. It is becoming clearer that metastatic dissemination and seeding
occurs very early during tumor progression while the tumor is still localized to the skin without signs of other
organ involvement. To effectively battle with this disease we must understand the molecular underpinnings of
biologically early tumors, in particular host defense mechanisms against the tumor cells. Basic research in
early melanomas has not made significant progress over the past decades mostly due to lack of murine
systems that model early disease. Genetically engineered murine models of melanoma represent many
shortcomings, and at best they mimic late aggressive tumors (murine genome) within the mice immune
system. In this proposal, we will mimic early malignant states in novel in vivo humanized murine models that
we have developed, in which highly immune deficient mice are reconstituted with human CD34+ hematopoietic
stem cells and challenged with HLA-A allele-matched human melanoma cells. By ultraviolet (UVB/A)
irradiation, we will induce additional mutations as in human skin, and study the progression of tumors as they
grow in time and space. Our preliminary studies indicate that a transcriptional switch occurs within the
tumor cells, it accompanies unique host immune responses, and this crosstalk dictates the fate of the
tumor towards progression or elimination. Stimulator of interferon – STING – signaling gets activated once
melanoma cells acquire an aggressive phenotype suggesting a role during tumor progression. Here, we
propose to establish paradigm-shifts in the concept of non-aggressive melanomas transitioning into an
aggressive phenotype that will directly impact clinical practice. We will investigate: 1) changes within the tumor
(mutations, pathways) that co-occur within the immune microenvironment (cell lineages, signals) during early
disease progression using humanized mouse models (Aim1), 2) pro- or anti-tumor responses in the presence
or absence of STING activation in early disease leveraging the humanized mouse and 3D skin models (Aim 1),
3) reversal of phenotypes and testing causality by modulating immune cell subpopulations (Aim 2), and 4)
development and validation of a prognostic assay applied to early melanomas that predicts survival (Aim 3).
Successful completion of this project promises to bring new model systems to the melanoma (and cancer) field
that enable studying human tumor and human immune system interactions. If offers a major leap in early stage
melanoma research, and deepens our understanding by revealing new tumor cell intrinsic or extrinsic
mechanisms of disease progression."

Given advances in screening and treatment, the number of people in the U.S. living with lung cancer is
expected to increase by 25% (from 571,340 to 724,610) by 2030. Nearly all (95%) patients diagnosed with
lung cancer report experiencing stigma (i.e., the perception and internalization of negative appraisal from
others attributed to one’s lung cancer), which is perhaps the most prominent psychosocial issue in this
population and contributes to poor psychological and physical health outcomes. A critical gap in the field of
cancer control science is the lack of empirically supported patient-focused interventions that target the
reduction of lung cancer stigma for this growing patient population. The goals of this K99/R00 are to adapt the
existing Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) psychosocial intervention to address anticipated delivery challenges
and target the reduction of lung cancer stigma as well as to seek preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the
adapted MSC intervention in reducing lung cancer stigma. The K99 study will involve a two-phase process of
1) conducting stakeholder focus groups to guide the iterative adaptation of MSC intervention activities and
materials and 2) conducting in-depth interviews with lung cancer patients to explore patients’ reactions to
intervention content and preferences for format and delivery. The R00 study will involve a two-phase process
of 1) conducting a pilot RCT (n=60) to test preliminary efficacy of the adapted MSC intervention on primary

objective of this K99/R00 is to provide Dr. Williamson with additional training and mentorship to become an
independent cancer control investigator translating findings from basic behavioral scientific research into the
development of tailored psychosocial interventions for cancer patients. Training aims include: 1) Psychosocial
intervention development and adaptation in cancer; 2) advanced qualitative and mixed-methods design and

10894943,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Tobacco use remains the single leading preventable cause of death and disability in the United States,
accounting for 480,000 deaths and $170 billion in medical costs each year. Although most cigarette smokers
eventually want to quit, the majority (80%) are not interested in quitting within the next month. Despite this,
smoking cessation treatment programs are traditionally predicated on smokers’ motivations to quit, with
treatments proceeding only among those willing to set a quit date. This stands in stark contrast to treatments
for other chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension)—health care providers do not assess whether or not patients
are ready to treat their high blood pressure, they simply identify the problem and initiate treatment. Tobacco
treatment programs are beginning to move toward a similar strategy through population health management
approaches; however, there is a dearth of treatment content applicable to smokers across a range of quit-
readiness, particularly for those unwilling to set a quit date. One novel potential treatment strategy is to foster
practice quitting (PQ), in which an individual attempts not to smoke for a few hours or days, without pressure or
expectation to permanently quit. Although a growing body of evidence has supported the role of practice
quitting in fostering permanent quit attempts and cessation, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms
of PQ-focused treatment. Furthermore, no studies to date have attempted to disentangle treatment effects
associated with behavioral vs. pharmacological intervention strategies to prompt practice quitting. The overall
goal of the current research is to characterize treatment mediators of PQ-focused counseling and nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) sampling. We will use a 2x2 factorial study design to test the role of PQ counseling
vs. Motivational Interviewing (MI) counseling, and NRT sampling (four-week supply of nicotine lozenges and
patches) vs. none on incidence of quit attempts at 6-months post treatment. We hypothesize that PQ treatment
components will have an additive effect, such that PQ counseling + NRT sampling will produce the highest
incidence of quit attempts at 6 months post-treatment. Participants (N=780) will be recruited through a
nationwide online recruitment strategy and all study procedures will be completed remotely. We will
purposefully recruit smokers who are not planning to quit in the next 30 days, and will examine baseline quit
motivation (i.e., motivation to quit in the next 6 months) as a potential moderator of treatment effect. Results
will advance our understanding of the behavioral process of practice quitting and the mechanisms governing
PQA-focused treatment strategies. This mechanistic evidence will address a key gap in the smoking cessation
treatment development literature, with the potential to increase intervention reach and efficacy to reduce
tobacco-related morbidity and mortality."

LaGuardia Community College’s “Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Program” has
demonstrated high graduation and high transfer rates for our students, conclusively
demonstrating that a community college can take the lead in administering a successful Bridges
program. Our program has formed a consortium with three exceptional four-year colleges—the
City College of New York, Hunter College, and Queens College—to provide challenging research
experiences in the biomedical and behavioral sciences for our underrepresented college students:
women, minorities, the disabled, and those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
LaGuardia proposes to place 10 students in hands-on, mentored research experiences each year
of the grant period. These students will choose from a list of research projects and will be engaged
in preliminary, preparatory research at LaGuardia, under the tutelage of the LaGuardia Faculty
Research Mentors. This experience gained will then be utilized during the summer, as the Bridges
students become involved in more intensive research at our three linking colleges, Brookhaven
National Laboratories, and SUNY downstate Medical Center.
The Bridges program also features a number of activities designed to support the students:
monthly research student seminars, tutoring, transfer counseling, opportunities to present their
research results at local and national conferences, instruction in the Responsible Conduct of
Research, Rigor and Reproducibility, instructional workshops on bio-statistics, leadership and
self-management skills, bioinstrumentation, research paper critique, library research, research
design, data science, introduction to Python, and poster presentation and the use of ePortfolios.
The ePortfolio will be used by Bridges students to collect their academic work, progress report
and to reflect on their learning and career goals. The program will also offer LaGuardia faculty the
opportunity to participate in effective mentoring workshop offered at the university of Wisconsin
and Bridges students will also enroll in the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN).
The monthly research seminars are notable in that they feature progress reports and formal final
reports by the students themselves, presentations by CUNY faculty and outside speakers,
information from the program’s transfer counselor, a session on developing and delivering
professional presentations using PowerPoint, and an Alumni Homecoming Day where Bridges
alumni return to share their successes and research with current Bridges students. Bridges
students will also use an adapted version of myIDP (Individual Development Plan) to explore
careers in biomedical, sciences, and bioengineering."
10894795,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic fungal infection associated with
immune deficiency, particularly in the T cell compartment. C. albicans is a commensal
fungus that is the dominant causative species of OPC, and its key virulence trait is the
ability to form invasive hyphae. This morphologic transition in the fungus triggers
‘danger’ responses in oral epithelial cells (OECs), which are the first cell types to
encounter this microbe. In 2009, we showed that an effective immune response to
mucosal candidiasis in mice requires signaling by the cytokine IL-17 (IL-17A). The
importance of IL-17 was confirmed in humans with IL-17R-deficiencies. Using mice as a
model organism, we showed that in naïve settings (i.e., innate responses), IL-17 is made
by two innate lymphocyte cell subsets: gd-T and ‘natural’ Th17 cells (nTh17). In recall
(i.e., adaptive) responses, IL-17 is additionally made by conventional CD4+Th17 cells,
which augment the innate response to accelerate fungal clearance. Collectively, IL-17+
cells comprise “Type 17” immunity. Regardless of source, IL-17 signals through a
heterodimer of IL-17RA and IL-17RC, which is highly expressed on cells of the stromal
and epithelial compartments. The initiating event in OPC is exposure of OECs to C.
albicans. However, it remains unclear how early epithelial recognition events lead to
activation of Type 17 responses, and why these responses occur only in response to
hyphae. In a landmark discovery the co-I (Dr. Naglik) showed that the danger response
in OECs is activated by a virulence factor, Candidalysin, the first pore-forming peptide
toxin identified in any human fungal pathogen. Candidalysin is secreted only by hyphae
and permeabilizes OEC membranes. Candidalysin triggers a MAPK-dependent
pathway, leading to upregulation of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides
that are essential for immunity to OPC. Our overarching goal in this continuation is to
define in depth the mechanisms by which host-and pathogen-derived factors
coordinate effective Type 17 immunity against C. albicans."
10894813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects up to 12 million Americans and accounts for healthcare expenditures
totaling $21 billion annually. Invasive procedures, one of multiple therapies available to improve PAD
symptoms, are increasingly being used, but are costly, may cause complications, and do not benefit all
patients equally. Furthermore, selecting a PAD treatment strategy requires aligning patient preferences with
the risks and benefits of therapies available to them. However, PAD care is fragmented across clinical
settings and specialties, resulting in variable approaches in eliciting patient preferences and presenting
treatment choices. These combined factors make implementation of shared decision-making in PAD care an
urgent yet challenging endeavor. This proposal seeks to address this issue using a multi-faceted approach. In
Aim 1, we will use prospective patient-level data to build and rigorously validate models that prognosticate 1-
year health status and estimate responses to different therapeutic strategies (medical therapy, supervised
exercise and vascular intervention). These tools will be used to individualize treatment with a focus on
outcomes that are meaningful to the patient. In Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured interviews and use a
formative diagnostic tool to evaluate vascular stakeholders' beliefs, concerns, and challenges related to
shared decision-making. These interviews will then be used to design practical implementation strategies. In
Aim 3, we will perform a pilot study of 50 patients with claudication to evaluate the impact of an established
PAD decision aid on measures of decision quality and knowledge. This study will provide preliminary data for
a larger, multicenter trial evaluating how the aid can be applied to improve decision-making, health status,
and long-term outcomes for patients with claudication. The overarching goal of this proposal is to promote
informed, evidence-based treatment decisions among patients with claudication in order to improve quality of
care and outcomes, and reduce healthcare utilization and costs. The first two aims of the proposal will
provide the necessary evidence and resources to introduce shared decision-making into the vascular clinic.
The third aim will evaluate the direct influence of a decision aid specific to PAD on the quality of treatment
decisions. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program
designed to provide Dr. Secemsky, an early career investigator and interventional cardiologist, with the skills
needed to become an independent physician-scientist. His long-term career goal is to ensure that
cardiovascular patients who face important medical decisions are meaningfully engaged, well informed, and
receive treatments that match their preferences and goals. Over the course of the award period, Dr.
Secemsky will be guided in his transition to independence by an outstanding mentoring team and advisory
committee of established clinical investigators with expertise in cardiovascular medicine, outcomes research,
advanced biostatistical and qualitative methods, shared decision-making, and implementation science."

Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of ischemic stroke and stroke-associated mortality worldwide. Though risk of
ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is reduced with oral anticoagulation (OAC), many are not
suitable candidates for long-term OAC due to high bleeding risk. To help treat such patients, transcatheter left
atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) with the Watchman device was developed and approved as an alternative
to OAC. However, efficient methods for evaluating clinical outcomes associated the Watchman device and
other novel cardiovascular technologies are needed for long-term surveillance after regulatory approval. In this
mentored patient-oriented career development award, Dr. Kamil Faridi will use a national registry of LAAO
procedures linked to Medicare claims data to evaluate how different data sources and innovative statistical
approaches can be utilized for evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Watchman device in
real-world practice. In Aim 1, he will use traditional and advanced statistical methods to compare ischemic
stroke and bleeding events identified with administrative claims data to site-reported events in a national
registry of patients who undergo transcatheter LAAO. In Aim 2, he will use linked pharmacy claims data to
evaluate registry-reported OAC use and compare outcomes between LAAO patients and medically managed
patients with atrial fibrillation in real-world practice. To supplement quantitative strategies for post-marketing
surveillance, in Aim 3 he will use qualitative methods to explore patient-reported perspectives and quality of life
among patients referred for transcatheter LAAO. Accomplishing these research aims will lay the groundwork
for future studies examining real-world surveillance of other cardiovascular therapies and other clinically
important outcomes. This project will be led by Dr. Kamil Faridi, an early career investigator, cardiologist, and
faculty member at the Yale School of Medicine with a track record of success in the field of cardiovascular
outcomes research. During this 5-year program, Dr. Faridi will pursue additional training in machine learning,
pharmacoepidemiology, comparative effectiveness and qualitative methods applied to patient-oriented
research. This will be accomplished with a comprehensive career development program designed to provide
Dr. Faridi with the skills needed to become a successful clinical researcher in cardiovascular medicine. His
long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with specific expertise in the areas of post-
marketing surveillance and real-world data utilization for novel cardiovascular therapies, with the ultimate aim
of improving patient care. Over the course of the research and training program, Dr. Faridi will be guided by an
exceptional mentorship team and advisory committee consisting of established clinical investigators with
expertise in cardiovascular medicine, outcomes research, and advanced biostatistical and qualitative methods.
With implementation of this research project and the resources provided for training and career development,
Dr. Faridi will be well prepared to transition to research independence by the end of the award period."

Three-dimensional genome organization has emerged as a critical component for the proper regulation of gene
expression. Recent years have seen a rapid expansion of the understanding of many of the basic features that
define how genomes are organized in space inside of cells, including the identification of features such as A/B
compartments, Topologically Associated Domains, and chromatin loops. Furthermore, there is evidence that
mutations that alter 3D genome organization can contribute to human disease. This is most evident for a class
of mutations known as structural variants, which includes translocations, inversions, tandem duplications, and
deletions. When these mutations disrupt sequence features that are critical for 3D genome structure, such as
the boundaries between Topologically Associating Domains, this can lead to enhancer-promoter rewiring,
changes in gene expression, and phenotypic consequences. Such effects have been observed both in the
context of germline structural variants that contribute to syndromic disorders of development as well as somatic
structural variants that can lead to cancer. While it has become clear that structural variants can alter 3D
genome organization and gene expression, more recent studies that comprehensively examined structural
variants and gene expression indicate their relationship is considerably more complex. Specifically, in only a
minority of instances do structural variants lead to changes in expression of neighboring genes. Therefore, why
structural variants can have dramatic consequences on 3D genome structure and gene expression in some
contexts but not others is currently unclear. This proposal will investigate the relationship between structural
variants, 3D genome organization, and gene expression in cancer genomes with the goal of understanding
where and when structural variants will actually lead to changes in gene expression that may contribute to
oncogenesis. Specific aim 1 will test whether only specific sets genes are sensitive to structural variant induced
changes in enhancer-promoter communication by examining changes in 3D genome structure and gene
expression in haplotype resolved human tumor samples. Specific aim 2 will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome
engineering to evaluate the effects of structural variant partner regions on induction of oncogene expression.
Specific aim 3 will assess the role of intra-tumor heterogeneity on the effects of structural variants on 3D
genome structure by using novel multi-omic methods for profiling DNA methylation and 3D genome structure
simultaneously within single cells derived from patient tumor samples. Successful completion of these aims will
result in a deeper understanding of the relationship between structural variation, 3D genome organization, and
gene regulation in the context of cancer genomes. In the long term, this will facilitate the use of information
derived from structural variants and 3D genome structure on determining patient prognosis and on identifying
novel therapeutic targets in cancer."

Cells respond to stress by upregulating adaptive mechanisms that promote survival or by
undergoing cell death when the stress is too severe. Cancer cells take advantage of stress
responses in order to survive within harsh cancer microenvironments, and understanding which
adaptive mechanisms are utilized to avoid cell death is critical to gaining new knowledge that may
be exploited for cancer therapy. It has also become clear that there is not one, but in fact many
different forms of cell death that can occur in response to stress, and our studies have contributed
significantly in this area. We have shown that some mechanisms have unique effects on the
dynamics of cell populations, and that some promote, while others may hinder, therapeutic
responses. Our proposed research program will focus on two major areas of discovery: (1) How
is cell death regulated in response to stress, and how do particular mechanisms contribute to
controlling population dynamics? (2) How do cells respond to nutrient starvation through adaptive
mechanisms that involve lysosomes? We will exploit recent findings and methods we have
developed to study these overarching questions through an integrated set of cell biological
approaches with a focus on imaging-based studies."
10906134,"Volatile anesthetics, such as isoflurane, produce all stages of general anesthesia including unconsciousness,
amnesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation. Despite their ubiquity, the fundamental mechanisms of action of
these drugs remains unknown. Elucidating the mechanisms by which clinical anesthesia is produced is the
foundational unanswered research question in the specialty of anesthesiology. The routine use of volatile
anesthetics is not without clinical risk. Multiple exposures to anesthetics in infancy leads to possible behavioral
problems in later life, and persistent post-operative cognitive dysfunction is seen in the elderly after anesthesia.
Historically, research in this field has proceeded along two tracks: either molecular analysis looking for specific
receptors for the volatile anesthetics (an approach that has largely foundered due to diffuse interactions with
many receptors whose effects do not combine appropriately), or the gross measurement of neuronal activity in
entire regions of the brain using EEG and fMRI (which are fundamentally limited by resolution). Clearly, there is
an enormous gap in length resolution between synaptic-scale and EEG-scale. We hypothesized that the onset
of anesthesia, and hence the loss of consciousness, is due to disruption in the communication between
neurons at the level of small neuronal networks that lie well below the resolution limit of EEG and fMRI. We
study the effect of anesthetic agents on intercommunication within intact, living neural networks, with single
neuron resolution. We use C. elegans, the creature with the simplest, most tractable neuronal architecture in
which anesthesia is known to be inducible. Using light-sheet microscopy, a combination of fixed and calcium-
sensitive fluorophores expressed under neuronal promoters, and our customized supercomputing toolchain for
image analysis and signal extraction, we track and capture the activity of essentially the entire nervous system
and examine its behavior under varying levels of anesthetic exposure normalized to comparable levels used in
human surgery. Using two-photon imaging, we are able to perform similar experiments in the mouse and
extract activity from selected regions of the somatosensory cortex in both awake and anesthetized states.
We will use a system of differential expression of fixed neuronal fluorophores in C. elegans to allow the precise
identification of individual neurons under light-sheet imaging. In combination with the C. elegans connectome,
we will determine the neuronal pathways that underlie anesthetized vs conscious states, how anesthetics alter
chemical and electrical synaptic connections to induce these states, the changes in neuronal connectivity that
permit the anesthetized state to resolve back into consciousness, and hence delineate the mechanisms of
clinical post-operative cognitive dysfunction in the old and neurodevelopmental impairment in the young. We
will extend our imaging and analysis techniques into vertebrate zebrafish, building a phylogenetic bridge in the
action of anesthetics from simple creatures to humans. We will demonstrate that these changes in neuronal
activity are consistent with the gross statistical hallmarks of anesthesia seen in the EEG in humans."

Rare cell types have been traditionally difficult to study due to their low abundance and lack of markers to
facilitate isolation and enrichment. We lack foundational knowledge about how rare cell types contribute to tissue
function and how their unique functional roles are established through differentiation from progenitors. Recently,
a rare and distinct population of cells has been identified in human small intestine and colon, marked by
Bestrophin 4 (Best4). The small intestinal population of Best4+ cells is striking, as these cells are highly enriched
for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a feature that Best4+ colon cells lack. This
CFTR High Expresser (CHE) cell population may serve an important role in the localized coordination of pH
regulation in the small intestine, and is also a compelling target cell type for the small intestinal phenotypes of
cystic fibrosis, for which there is currently no effective treatment. Despite mounting need to understand how CHE
cells contribute to intestinal homeostasis and disease, we do not know how CHE cells are made (mechanisms
controlling their differentiation) or what they do (their contribution to intestinal physiology). The goal of this
proposal is to elucidate the fate specification of CFTR High Expresser (CHE) cells in the intestine, with the long-
term goal of understanding the lineage origin of CHE cells as they arise from stem cells, and their role in
homeostasis and disease. The overall objectives are (i) to define the transcriptional network driving intestinal
CHE cell fate specification (Aim 1) and (ii) to define the role of Notch signaling in CHE cell fate specification
(Aim 2). As CHEs are found only in rats and humans and genetic tools are limited in rats, I have developed a
novel rat intestinal organoid model that allows for genetic perturbation. Aim 1 will determine the role of key
candidate transcription factors identified by single-cell RNA sequencing in promoting CHE cell fate in rat intestinal
organoids. Then, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) will be performed to identify direct
interactions between candidate transcription factors and CHE-enriched genes. Additionally, Notch signaling is
critical for determining the initial cell fate decision of whether an intestinal progenitor cell becomes absorptive,
""Notch on"", or secretory, ""Notch off."" Surprisingly, our single cell RNA-seq data suggests that active Notch
signaling may also be involved in specifying later cell fate decisions within the secretory lineage, particularly CHE
cell fate. I will investigate this in Aim 2 using genetic manipulation of Notch in the rat intestinal organoid model.
Lastly, I will use our ability to modulate CHE cell numbers by regulating Notch signaling to correlate CHE
abundance to the physiological function of CFTR-mediated fluid secretion. Completion of this project will identify
factors required for specifying CHE cells in the small intestine, informing insights into the specification of CHEs
and other rare secretory intestinal cells, building a foundation to observe how CHEs arise from stem cells, and
illuminating a potential novel target cell type in pathological conditions associated with CFTR dysregulation."

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer death. Advanced prostate cancer, whether present
at the time of diagnosis or arising after treatment of localized disease, responds to androgen deprivation, but
invariably fails and recurs as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is the main cause of prostate
cancer-associated mortality. Heavily treated tumors, particularly those treated with secondary hormone
therapies, frequently acquire a neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC), which currently accounts for 15-20% of
CRPC. NEPC is commonly characterized by expression of neuroendocrine markers, an aggressive clinical
course, and downregulation or loss of androgen receptor (AR) that diminishes responsiveness to androgen
deprivation therapies, making it the most lethal and currently incurable subset of prostate cancer. Thus, there is
an urgent unmet need to define new therapeutic strategies for adeno-CRPC and NEPC.
Our recent studies identified ATAD2 as an up-regulated druggable protein in treatment-induced NEPC.
Moreover, we demonstrated that ATAD2 inhibitors dramatically suppress NEPC cell and tumor growth. The goals
of the study are to test the therapeutic potential of ATAD2 inhibitor alone or in combination therapy settings in
pre-clinical models of adeno-CRPC and NEPC and define new mechanisms through which ATAD2 regulates
prostate tumorigenesis. The goal of this proposal is based on strong preliminary results. We propose to use cell
line models of adeno-CRPC and NEPC as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of adeno-CRPC and NEPC
to test the proposed combination therapies in pre-clinical settings.
The aims of the proposed project are:
Specific Aim 1. Test the levels of ATAD2 in a large cohort of clinical specimens.
Specific Aim 2. Investigate the functional role of ATAD2 in advanced prostate cancer and define the
molecular mechanisms through which ATAD2 contributes to prostate tumorigenesis and NEPC.
Specific Aim 3. Test the therapeutic potential of ATAD2 inhibitors alone and in combination with
therapies used as a standard of care for prostate cancer in adeno-CRPC and NEPC growth and
metastasis."

The field of regenerative medicine focuses on addressing degenerative cell behaviors arising from issues like
aging, injury, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Two main elements in regenerative medicine are cell therapies
and biomaterial scaffolds. Cell therapies have become an increasingly viable therapeutic strategy as ways to
control cellular behaviors have become ever more sophisticated. However, many current technologies to
engineer cellular behaviors rely on bulk delivery of soluble factors, which can lead to off-target effects on
surrounding tissues. Designer biomaterials provide physicochemical cues that govern migration, proliferation,
and differentiation of immune and stem cells encapsulated or in proximity to these surrogate extracellular
matrices. However, the influence of biomaterials over cell behaviors is limited, as many designs rely on activation
of native signaling pathways with responses that can be difficult to precisely engineer. Therefore, the overall goal
of this proposal is to develop a hydrogel biomaterial formulation that can control cellular behaviors in a user-
defined manner for regenerative medicine purposes. This hydrogel will interface with engineered cells to enable
artificial signaling in response to bioinert ligands that activate synthetic receptors. To achieve our goal, we will
use these methods: (1) Cells will be engineered with synthetic signaling receptors to allow for user-defined inputs
and outputs; (2) Hydrogel formulations will be designed to capture soluble ligands for dynamic activation of
engineered cells. We propose to accomplish this through three Specific Aims: (1) We will engineer a hydrogel
formulation that supports cell viability and is able to capture soluble bioinert ligands for tunable and inducible
reporter activation of engineered cells; (2) We will utilize this hydrogel formulation and engineered cells to
attenuate inflammation in a separate population of fibroblasts through production of cytokine antagonists; (3) We
will differentiate a population of multipotent cells encapsulated in our hydrogel formulation into osteogenic and
chondrogenic lineages. We hypothesize that this new hydrogel platform will allow for dynamic and user-defined
activation of encapsulated engineered cells in a spatially constrained and ligand-inducible manner. This research
will contribute a new technology for controlling cell behaviors for therapeutic functions that can be applied to a
range of disease states, such as insulin secretion for diabetes, growth factor secretion for wound healing, and
differentiation into muscle fibers for tissue regeneration. Here we also propose a multidisciplinary mentoring and
training plan in the areas of materials engineering, cell therapy, and synthetic biology that will provide high-level
training for the applicant in preparation for a career in cell therapies."

The 9th FASEB Summer Research Conference on ""Lipid Droplets"" will delve into the rapidly evolving field of
lipid droplet biology. As the primary cellular lipid storage organelles, lipid droplets serve as vital hubs of lipid
metabolism, influencing energy metabolism, lipid signaling, membrane biogenesis, and lipotoxicity. The
accumulation of lipid droplets is a pathological hallmark of metabolic diseases, including obesity, insulin
resistance, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, lipodystrophy, and cardiovascular disease. New roles for
lipid droplets have emerged in the etiology of neurodegeneration, cancer, and the host response to pathogens.
The escalating global prevalence of lipid disorders underscores the urgency to understand the molecular
underpinnings of lipid droplet biology as well as their profound impact on disease pathogenesis. A
comprehensive understanding of lipid droplets is essential for therapeutic development and is of high interest
to scientists in academic and biotechnology sectors. This conference will take place from July 21-25 2024, in
Saint Paul, MN and will include two keynote addresses from leaders in the fields of lipid metabolism and
organelle biology: Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (HHMI Janelia Farm) and Gökhan Hotamışlıgil (Harvard). As
one of the lipid metabolism community’s premiere scientific conferences, and the longest-running meeting
solely focused on lipid droplet biology, it will feature a multi-disciplinary speaker line-up focused on leading-
edge research. The conference format comprises 8 sessions with talks by 24 invited speakers, 14 short talks
selected from submitted abstracts, two poster sessions, a Career-Oriented Workshop, and several Meet the
Experts sessions. This highly inclusive environment is crafted to foster interactions between trainees, early
career investigators, and established researchers. During the scientific sessions, distinguished researchers will
deliver talks spanning the entire spectrum of lipid droplet biology from basic to clinical research, presenting
diverse approaches (biophysics, genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, physiology) and cutting-edge
technologies (chemical biology, lipidomics, imaging) in a range of model systems (cultured cells, flies, yeast, C.
elegans, mice, humans). A primary aim of this conference is to empower the next generation of scientists. To
that end, we seek funding to support the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early
career investigators, with a special emphasis on inclusivity, including women, underrepresented minorities, and
persons with disabilities. The conference's setting will provide numerous opportunities for both planned and
spontaneous informal interactions, affording young investigators the chance to present their work, obtain
valuable feedback from leaders in the field, and receive career guidance. This conference stands as the
pioneering international gathering dedicated exclusively to lipid droplet biology and its relevance to human
disease. It continues to serve as a unique platform for researchers to exchange ideas and share
groundbreaking results in this dynamic and timely field."

The epidermis is a vital tissue that protects our bodies against infection and environmental insults. Upon
wounding, epidermal basal cells undergo a transient transcriptional switch to increase proliferation and migrate
into the wounded area to re-epithelize the epidermis. Regulation of this wound-activated transcriptional switch is
unknown, but research has suggested that chromatin remodelers may be responsible. My analysis revealed that
a key chromatin repressor, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), occupies more than half of wound-related
genes during homeostasis, suggesting a potential role of PRC1 as a regulator of the transient switch in epidermal
basal cells upon wound induction. By generating and analyzing mice lacking PRC1 function in epidermal basal
cells, I observed arrested wound repair as PRC1-null epidermal basal cells failed to migrate during the re-
epithelialization stage of wound healing. Cell migration during wound repair is mediated by epithelial-
mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), a biological process in which cells undergo molecular and functional changes to
interconvert between an epithelial phenotype to a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. The regulation of EMP
processes during wound healing is unknown. E-cadherin is an epithelial protein that is transcriptionally
downregulated in migrating epidermal basal cells and a key marker of the EMP process. Interestingly, E-cadherin
expression was retained in PRC1-null epidermal basal cells upon wound induction. Given these data, I
hypothesize that PRC1 mediates the ability of epidermal basal cells to migrate by repressing E-cadherin and
reprogramming the transcriptional landscape upon wound induction to undergo EMP processes. To test this
hypothesis, in Aim 1, I will investigate the significance of E-cadherin repression in migrating epidermal basal
cells by overexpressing E-cadherin in cultured primary epidermal basal cells and ex vivo wound explants.
Additionally, I will perform CUT&Tag to investigate if E-cadherin is a direct target of PRC1 regulation, as well as
use genetically engineered mice and shRNA technology to repress or ablate E-cadherin expression in PRC1-
null mice and PRC1-null epidermal basal cell lines, respectively. In Aim 2, I will determine EMP genes that are
most affected by the loss of PRC1 in epidermal basal cells during wound repair and examine the functionality of
the identified genes for epidermal basal cell migration. I will also perform immunostaining to assess if PRC1-
regulated EMP genes are misexpressed in samples of human chronic wounds. Altogether, these data will
uncover a novel role for PRC1 regulation in reprogramming the transcriptional landscape needed for epidermal
basal cell migration during wound healing, as well as define the role of PRC1 in controlling EMP during wound
healing."

The ENIGMA consortium was established to investigate brain structure, function, and disease by combining
genomic and neuroimaging datasets from multiple sites. Its cost-effective goal is to maximize statistical power
and the yield from existing datasets through very large data pooling efforts. This goal has considerable
importance in light of growing concerns over the rigor and reproducibility of many neuroimaging and genomic
findings. ENIGMA has had many successes (including a genome wide association study on cortical thickness
with over 51,556 participants, Grasby et al., 2021 Science), and a number of working groups have been
established which leverage the standardized multi-site ENIGMA preprocessing pipelines and analytic methods
to focus on the neurobiology of specific diseases. This application’s PI co-created the ENIGMA Addiction working
group which now has access to datasets representing over 24,000 participants contributed by 103 PI members
from 71 different institutions in 16 countries spanning 6 continents. There have been 27 peer reviewed
publications since the start of the initial R01 with another 8 papers currently under review. Building on our initial
funding (R01 DA047119), we propose to further expand the Addiction working group to support the largest
international resource of its kind for the scientific community. Dataset users are encouraged to propose and lead
their own projects. Curation of the shared database by the ENIGMA Addiction team according to standardized
protocols for harmonization and quality control is a cost-effective means of maximizing heavy investments in
data collection and overcomes an insurmountable obstacle for younger investigators and investigators from low
or middle income countries. ENIGMA Addiction has approved 43 projects, 16 of which are completed and 27 are
ongoing, including a full 30 projects led by investigators from outside of the central research team at the
University of Vermont. These projects investigate topics ranging from sex differences to early markers of
addiction risk to machine learning classification. Research projects can be performed via guest access to a high
performance supercomputer hosted at the University of Vermont or through COINSTAC, a federated cloud-
based meta-analytic pipeline. Analyses have been completed on thousands of pooled participants with structural
MRI, DTI, resting state fMRI or genetic data and we have now expanded to include task-based fMRI. During the
next phase of funding, the team at UVM will engage in two main analytic efforts whose success is favored by the
large database afforded by this working group, namely comprehensive interrogation of psychiatric comorbidity
by joining efforts with other large ENIGMA working groups and, second, identification of biologically meaningful
sub-groups within the population of problematic substance users with distinct etiology."

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a persistent public health concern in the United States, exacerbated by the
coronavirus-19 pandemic. Moreover, the only treatment for CUD is behavioral therapy, as there are currently
no FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapeutics for CUD. This poses a concern, as individuals experiencing
CUD are at substantial risk for relapse across abstinence. A deeper understanding of the cellular and
molecular underpinnings of CUD is essential for developing therapeutics and relapse prevention for
sustainable abstinence. Although extensive research to date has focused primarily on neuronal mechanisms of
cocaine action in the brain, available evidence indicates that neuroglia may significantly contribute to
mechanisms of dependence and relapse. The Reissner Lab focuses heavily on understanding the role of
astrocytes and microglia in the maintenance of cocaine use disorder and relapse-like behaviors. Published
research from the Reissner lab illustrates substantial morphological decreases in the nucleus accumbens core
astrocytes following long-access (LgA, 6 h/day, 10 days) cocaine self-administration and a 45-day abstinence
period. Preliminary data for this proposal show a significant effect of cocaine and abstinence on the
colocalization of astrocyte membranes within microglia, suggesting that microglia may be mediating the effect
of cocaine on astrocytes and raising the possibility that microglia phagocytosis is a long-lasting consequence
of cocaine use. Thus, this proposal aims to investigate how structural and functional microglial responses in
the nucleus accumbens contribute to cocaine dependence and relapse behaviors. In Aim 1, I will explore
morphological responses of accumbens microglial, in addition to evidence of engulfment of astrocyte
membranes, across abstinence in males and females. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that pharmacological
inhibition of microglial phagocytosis will protect against the effects of cocaine on astrocyte structure, microglial
engulfment of astrocytes, and cocaine-seeking behavior. A neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) peptide which
inhibits the protein interaction between complement protein C3 and the microglial C3 receptors will be directly
microinjected into the nucleus accumbens, inhibiting phagocytosis. Additionally, this aim will explore the source
of phagocytosis signaling by examining “eat me”/“don’t eat me” signals such as C3 colocalization with
astrocytes and synapses. The experiments proposed in Aim 3 will characterize the genetic profiles of microglial
cells following long-access cocaine self-administration. Through the use of magnetic bead sorting and RT-
qPCR, I will be able to identify expression changes of microglia-specific genes. Overall, the findings of this
study will provide a foundation for understanding how microglial morphological and functional responses
contribute to cocaine dependence in both male and female rats. Further, insights into the role microglia play in
cocaine effects and cocaine seeking may inform prospective avenues for therapeutic intervention."

Portland State University (PSU) currently does not have a functional ultracentrifuge. Researchers and students
from the Biology, Physics and Chemistry departments used aging Beckman L8-80M ultracentrifuges and old
rotors (> 20 years old) until recently when the cooling system on the last functional ultracentrifuge failed and
was determined not to be reparable. This failure has constrained research in multiple laboratories. Moreover,
the age and fragility of previous ultracentrifuges meant that they were not able to be used for educational
purposes. We have selected a Beckman-Coulter Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge and rotors (SW41Ti, Vti-50.1
and Type 70Ti) that are optimal for the 7 activities proposed by 4 Major Users PI, Dr. K. Stedman and Drs. J.
Nadeau, A. Thompson and J. Courcelle:
Educational Activities:
 BI431: Advanced Molecular and Cell Biology Research Laboratory,
 PH490/590: Biophysics.
 BI338: Microbiology Techniques.
Research Activities:
Characterization of mutant forms of the hyperthermophilic virus SSV1 and characterization of virus-like
particles formed by recombinantly expressed crucivirus capsid proteins,
Proteomics of membrane proteins of bacteria exposed to microgravity,
Isopycnic centrifugation of DNA after DNA repair.
Stable isotope probing of RNA.
In addition to these proposed activities, a new ultracentrifuge will enable multiple other users to perform
biomedical research at PSU. A new, user-friendly, ultracentrifuge will allow PSU students to use this
instrument, which will prepare them for future careers in biomedical research as well as stimulate the
biomedical research of current researchers at Portland State University. For undergraduates, research is one
of the main high-impact practices used to help promote academic excellence and improve retention and

The coordination of cellular function to developmental and environmental cues is essential for organismal
growth and adaptation. Cells have a remarkable ability to sense diverse stimuli and make regulatory decisions
to elicit an appropriate response. Our laboratory is interested in the molecular underpinnings of this cellular
decision-making. Seminal “receptor-switch” experiments demonstrated that the cell’s sensing apparatus does
not alone promote a specific cell fate. Rather, the cell’s sensing mechanism triggers a pre-existing nuclear
program that was poised during development. How is this pre-existing program established? At what stage in
development does it occur? What are the determinants that establish and maintain this potential for lineage-
specific effector responses? The long-term goal of the laboratory is to define the biological processes that
provide answers to these fundamental questions. Our model system is T cells, an ideal framework because
the stages of development are highly characterized and the cells are widely available. Our approach focuses
on the regulation of chromatin, i.e. the 6 billion bases of human DNA wrapped around nucleosomes that can
take on different conformations to define gene activity and cellular identity. One of the modes by which
chromatin is regulated is through the actions of chromatin remodeling complexes that use energy from ATP to
modify which regions of the genome are accessible to transcription factors and signaling pathways. We have
recently identified a novel chromatin remodeling complex that promotes the accessibility of genes encoding
specialized T cell function. This ATPase motor acts early in development to poise cells even prior to the
expression of the T cell receptor. In the next 5 years, we aim to identify the subunit composition of this novel
chromatin remodeling complex and the direct mechanistic modes that mediate complex targeting and function
at T cell effector loci. Achievement of our research goals will also provide a foundation for advances in clinical
applications of T cell biology, e.g modulation of T cell effector programming to enhance the efficacy of
vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, or tolerance induction for autoimmunity."

10883682,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated signaling
cascades in human cancers, regulating virtually all aspects of tumorigenesis in humans, including initiation,
progression and metastatic dissemination. The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT transduces PI3K signals to
a plethora of cellular responses that are associated with malignancy, including cell proliferation and growth,
survival, cell motility and metabolism. In spite of extensive efforts aimed at decoding the function of PI3K/AKT
signaling in cancer, and a multitude of small molecule inhibitors developed and aimed at interrupting one or
more enzymes in this pathway, robust therapeutic responses to PI3K or AKT inhibition have to date remained
elusive. There is therefore an urgent need to identify previously unappreciated vulnerabilities associated with
PI3K/AKT pathway addiction. Over the past two decades, our laboratory has been at the forefront of
discoveries on the regulation of AKT downstream of PI3K, as well as identifying mechanisms by which AKT
mediates signal relay to cellular phenotypes associated with malignancy. This application builds on our
collective experience at deciphering the contribution of PI3K and AKT in cancer with emphasis at discovering,
identifying and characterizing vulnerabilities associated with PI3K/AKT pathway addiction. In the proposed
projects, we will focus our vision in three major areas of work: 1) targets of PI3K/AKT defined by genetic
approaches: we will define targets of AKT that modulate cellular phenotypes using defined CRISPR screens
that combine gene targeting with mass spectrometry and functional validation. We will also use new genetic
mouse models that recapitulate AKT hyperactivation and evaluate sensitivity to targeted therapies; 2) novel
chemical probes and screens targeting AKT: we have generated the first in-class degrader or PROTAC that
potently and specifically degrades AKT, and out-performs all current AKT inhibitors. We will use this novel
probe to target the AKT pathway in cancer. We will perform synthetic lethal CRISPR screens to uncover
targets that when combined with PI3K and AKT inhibitors transform cytostatic responses to cytotoxic ones; 3)
regulation of protein glycosylation by PI3K/AKT: we have uncovered an entirely new mechanism by which
growth factor and oncogenic signaling through PI3K/AKT/mTOR modulates the N-glycosylation pathway,
necessary for proper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deregulation of this mechanism leads
to induction of ER stress. This is the first identification linking oncogene addition to anabolic carbohydrate
metabolism, which we will explore with functional glycomics. The proposed studies not only build on our
expertise, they also emphasize the urgent need to obtain detailed new insights into the pleiotropic mechanisms
that govern PI3K and AKT signaling in cancer. Our findings will provide an integrated, mechanistic
understanding of how oncogenic signaling interfaces with cellular reprogramming and expose cancer-specific
vulnerabilities that would ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic opportunities for cancer."
10884174,"The cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a common hemorrhagic vascular anomaly, caused by germ line
and/or endothelial somatic mutations in three known genes. It affects more than a million Americans,
predisposing them to a lifetime risk of stroke and epilepsy. A lesion is alarmingly more likely to rebleed after a
prior symptomatic hemorrhage, and there is currently no therapy to prevent the genesis or clinical progression
of lesions. In the past 5 years, our program project has clarified key mechanisms of CCM pathogenesis through
exceptional collaboration and synergy among four laboratories. These included the identification of
MEKK3/KLF2/4 signaling as a primary trigger of lesion development in the setting of Ccm loss, downstream
activation of RhoA kinase (ROCK), and roles of microbiome driven TLR4/CD14 signaling, intestinal mucin loss,
hypoxia, dietary supplements, thrombospondin-1, thrombomodulin and clonal expansion of mutated
endothelium. The Scientific Core at U Chicago optimized the high throughput assessment of lesion burden using
micro-CT, and the quantification of chronic hemorrhage using densitometry of non-heme iron Perls staining. We
developed familiarity with data structure for optimal sample sizes and statistics, and a discipline of prospective
articulation of outcomes and blinding in the various experiments. Protocols were harmonized, and models,
specimens and data were shared across projects and sites. The Core produced transcriptomic libraries of
mutated cells, C. elegans, and neurovascular units from human and murine lesions with various genotypes and
at different stages of development. We streamlined the collection and distribution of genotyped human CCM
lesions from excised surgical specimens to the project sites. And we assessed the peripheral blood of human
subjects for protein levels and microRNAs related to the signaling aberrations. Yet critical knowledge gaps
remain, as pilot data has motivated hypotheses about the roles of Ccm deficient endothelium in lesion genesis
versus maturation, PIK3 signaling, ADAMTS proteolysis of versican, and activated protein C anticoagulant and
cytoprotective pathways. Core services shall continue, further enhanced by new techniques aimed at facilitating
single-cell RNA and DNA analyses from lesions, morphometric assessment of acute hemorrhage (as a clinically
relevant phenotypic feature distinct from chronic bleeding), and micro-sampling and processing for plasma
biomarker discovery in mice. Each of the projects will be assisted by and take advantage of the proposed
Phenotyping, Human Tissue and Biomarkers Core, aimed at (1) phenotype assessment and human lesion
dissection, and (2) biomarker discovery and validation. The new hypotheses being probed will identify novel
therapies, and the resulting biomarkers will facilitate risk stratification and disease monitoring in patients. In a
strategic sense, the proposed Core will continue to enhance collaboration and synergy among the project sites,
ensure rigor, and facilitate innovation. The Core shall allow cross-validation between mouse and human
samples, further leveraging the translation of discoveries to human subjects."
10884177,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
Based on discoveries made in the previous cycle of our program project, Project 1 will probe deeply into
the cellular and molecular events of CCM pathogenesis. Using lineage tracing of murine CCM lesions
we showed that the initial event of lesion genesis is somatic loss of the remaining wild-type copy of the
Ccm gene, followed by a clonal expansion of endothelial cells harboring the same somatic mutation, and
what appears to be recruitment of additional ECs into the growing lesion – cells that do not harbor the
somatic mutation. Secondly, based on discoveries in the Kahn lab for a role for activated PI3 kinase in
lesion development in mouse CCM models, we identified activating PIK3CA mutations in more than 50%
of human CCM lesions. These collaborative discoveries suggest we have not yet fully understood the
molecular and cellular events that contribute to CCM lesion genesis, growth and maturation. In the first
Aim, we will deeply sequence bulk human CCMs to determine whether somatic mutation of any other
oncogenes contribute to the development of lesions. In a second Aim we will use single-cell genomic
DNA sequencing to determine whether individual endothelial cells require both the somatic CCM mutation
and the PIK3CA mutation (and/or mutation of other genes discovered in Aim 1), or instead whether these
genes are mutated in separate endothelial cell compartments of the lesion. In Aim 3, due to growing
evidence that the somatically mutated cells poison the non-mutant cells to recruit them into the growing
CCM, we will employ single-cell RNA sequencing to determine how the somatic mutation profile of the
lesional cell influences the cell’s gene expression profile. In addition to increasing fundamental
understanding of CCM pathogenesis, this work has therapeutic implications. The PI3K-AKT signaling
pathway is a target of existing drugs with others under development. Thus as part of this project we will
continue our quest for a highly effective therapy by testing compounds nominated in this or any of the
three projects, using our more clinically-relevant CCM mouse models developed in the past funding cycle.
With a more complete knowledge of the molecular and mutational signature of CCM lesional cells, we
hope to identify new targets for drug repurposing for CCM patients."
10884178,"ABSTRACT
Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM) are subject to acute and chronic bleeding that is a
major source of morbidity and mortality in this disease. We have found that endothelial cells
within murine and human CCM express markedly increased levels of thrombomodulin (TM) and
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which lead to activation of endogenous anti-coagulant
protein C. We hypothesize that CCM form an anti-coagulant vascular domain and that activated
Protein C (APC) contributes to bleeding in CCM. APC can also exert a cytoprotective effect on
endothelium by signaling via PAR1 resulting in, among other effects, stabilization of endothelial
cell-cell junctions. Indeed, this cytoprotective effect of APC has been exploited by creation of
APC loss of function mutants that selectively maintain cytoprotective activity. We thus
hypothesize that APC cytoprotective activity may limit morbidity from CCM as it does in
experimental stroke. To genetically test this hypothesis, we will examine the bleeding in the acute
murine CCM models in Factor V Leiden (F5R504Q/wt) mice, which are resistant to the anti-coagulant
effect of APC. As a second approach we will test the effect of MAPC1591, a monoclonal antibody
that blocks the anti-coagulant activity of APC in acute models of CCM. To test the effects of
cytoprotective activity, we will examine acute CCM lesion development and bleeding in
F2rR46Q/R46Q mice bearing PAR1 that is selectively resistant to APC cleavage. Conversely, we will
examine the effect of 3K3A-APC, a loss of function APC mutant that is selectively impaired in
anti-coagulant function in acute and chronic CCM models. We will exploit our observation that a
brief period of hypoxia or pharmacological stabilization of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1A markedly
exacerbates acute CCM formation in perinatal mice and enables a robust subacute model that
manifests in adult mice. This subacute model which manifests both bleeding and hemosiderin
deposition, will be used to test the interventions described in aims 1 and 2. Completion of these
Aims will provide mechanistic insight into the role of the marked increase of TM and EPCR that
is observed in CCM and provide important preclinical tests of the idea that hemorrhage or disease
progression can be influenced by manipulating pathways that are already being therapeutically
targeted in diseases such as stroke, sepsis, and hemophilia."
10889754,"Project Summary
The pathways regulating the development of early-onset glaucoma are not well understood. Despite
evidence suggesting that a large proportion of early-onset glaucoma cases may have a genetic basis,
known genes only account for about 20% of cases. In fact, only 12 genes have been described so far,
for primary forms of this disease, compared to hundreds for retinal dystrophies. In this complex biological
system, a Forward Genetics approach is an ideal strategy to ask, without preconceptions, which
genes/molecules are important in regulating early-onset glaucoma. Our short-term goal is to identify
and characterize gene/protein defects and molecular pathways that lead to early-onset glaucoma. The
long-term goal is to leverage our research discoveries to understand this blinding disease, improve
screening strategies, and identify novel therapeutic opportunities.
 We propose that a high-throughput and unbiased strategy provides an ideal approach to discovery
of gene/phenotype associations for early-onset glaucoma. In collaboration with Nobel laureate Bruce
Beutler, we have been employing a robust state-of-the-science and unbiased Forward Genetics pipeline
in which random mutations are generated and mice can be screened for signs of glaucoma. We have
already collected retinal images from 6000 mutagenized mice and proposing to use this extensive
database to screen for genes that lead to inner retinal thinning.
 Our approach has significant advantages compared to other existing protocols. Most importantly,
ours is the first and only protocol in which all mice have been pre-genotyped at all mutant loci. In addition,
the large scale of our system and the large pedigree size will also add to the discovery power. Together,
these advantages will allow us to identify and pursue novel gene/phenotype associations related to
glaucoma. In our retinal studies we have identified over 45 gene-phenotype associations after covering
just 5%-8% of the mouse genome. Of these, 20 genes have not been reported to be associated with the
retina. These results attest to the strength of our pipeline. Having an excellent continuous variable
parameter to monitor for early-onset glaucoma (ganglion cell complex OCT measurements) also supports
the feasibility of our proposal.
 We will harness the power of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, single cell RNA sequencing, and co-
immunoprecipitation experiments with highly sensitive mass spectrometry and proteomics analysis, and
other techniques to explore the mechanisms of these associations. This proposed research will advance
our knowledge of the genetic basis in early-onset glaucoma. We also anticipate that our results will lead
to the identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues."
10889827,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death
worldwide. The current failure in AD therapeutic development demands the discovery of new therapeutically
actionable mechanisms underlying the disease. To address this unmet medical need, we propose to define the
protein-protein interaction between p38 and MK2 as a highly promising target to control neuroinflammation, one
of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. The protein-protein interaction between mitogen-activated protein
kinase p38 and its main substrate MK2 plays a central role in pro-inflammatory signaling. Both proteins are well-
defined targets for therapeutic discovery, and multiple inhibitors have been proposed to control
neuroinflammation by inhibiting p38 or MK2 kinase activity. However, none of the proposed inhibitors have
reached the approval as a drug. The commonly recognized reasons for such failure include multiple adverse
side effects associated with i) network effects of p38 inhibition on multiple p38-regulated proteins besides MK2
and ii) limited compound selectivity against other kinases. Thus, targeting p38 and MK2 individually cannot
provide an efficient strategy to control neuroinflammation in AD. We propose to overcome this critical barrier
by discovering small molecules to disrupt the protein-protein interaction between p38 and MK2 proteins
rather than inhibit their kinase activity. The unique physical and chemical properties of the protein-protein
interaction interface allow us to design highly specific compounds to precisely regulate the p38/MK2 complex
avoiding the undesired interference with other axes of p38 signaling or other kinases. Toward this goal, we have
established a robust high-throughput screening assay and a computational platform that already revealed the
first small molecule and peptide-based disruptors of the p38/MK2 complex. Previously, we successfully applied
our approach to discover small molecule inhibitors and stabilizers of disease-associated protein complexes of
different types. We hypothesize that the inhibition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) between p38 and MK2
represents a novel promising strategy to control p38/MK2-dependent neuroinflammation in AD. To test this
hypothesis, we will combine experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) with computational modeling to
discover the first small molecule inhibitors of the p38/MK2 complex and demonstrate that p38/MK2 PPI inhibition
can suppress pro-inflammatory signals and rescue AD phenotypes in cortical organoids. The completion of this
study will establish the p38/MK2 interaction as a novel druggable target to control neuroinflammation, provide
the first small molecules to regulate this pathogenic complex, and may enable new clinical strategies in
Alzheimer's disease."
10899536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High-altitude animals have evolved the ability to survive and function under conditions of oxygen deprivation
(hypoxia) that mimic disease states in humans. Identifying evolved mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in
mammals that are long-term high-altitude natives can therefore yield discoveries of biomedical relevance while
also providing general insights into the evolution of complex traits. A number of wild rodent species inhabit far
more extreme altitudes than Tibetan and Andean humans and also represent far more tractable subjects for
experimental approaches that involve genetic crosses and invasive physiological manipulations. This project
integrates genomics and experimental physiology to dissect the mechanistic basis of adaptive enhancements of
whole-animal performance in hypoxia in extreme high-altitude rodents. The experiments compare high- and low-
altitude populations of two species: the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), which has the broadest
altitudinal range of any North American mammal (sea level to 4350 m), and the Andean leaf-eared mouse
(Phyllotis vaccarum), an extremophile species that holds the record as the world’s highest dwelling mammal and
that also has the broadest altitudinal range (sea level to >6700 m [>22,000’]). To test hypotheses about adaptive
regulatory responses to hypoxia, we will use a common-garden experimental design to integrate measures of
whole-animal physiological performance (aerobic exercise capacity in hypoxia) and various subordinate traits
(respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic) with tissue-specific transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles.
Experiments will involve highly invasive manipulations (e.g., surgical instrumentation of arterial and venous
catheters to measure blood gases during exercise trials and terminal sampling of vital organs) that are not
feasible in human subjects. In both species, mechanistic experiments will be complemented by population
genomic experiments to generate hypotheses about the specific genes and pathways that may have contributed
to hypoxia adaptation. Such hypotheses will then be tested using follow-up experiments to measure phenotypic
effects of changes in gene function and/or gene expression, as illustrated by our ongoing work on deer mice.
The specific aims of the research are (1) to elucidate the mechanistic basis of adaptive enhancements of aerobic
performance capacity in hypoxia; (2) to determine how regulatory changes in gene expression translate into
changes in phenotype at different hierarchical levels of biological organization; and (3) to identify and
experimentally test new candidate genes and pathways for hypoxia adaptation. The integration of population
genomics, functional genomics, and experimental physiology will advance the field by elucidating the
mechanistic basis of adaptive evolutionary change in complex performance traits."
10899538,"Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics
Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional
genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully
interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene
transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot
of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a
pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in
persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes
in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains
that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely
identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions.
The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example,
information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be
captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative
analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi-
dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to
extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the
host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the
full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen
data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies.
My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate
them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large
numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel
viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected
to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights
from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in
several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational
landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and
cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA
binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to
identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology."
10899541,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to
improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment
initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous
cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these
breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still
vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a
few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the
weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial
measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic
or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and
resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in
population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions.
The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the
way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and
biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome-
based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and
poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment
patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep
short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong
preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read
sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including
resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The
proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and
resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and
diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC
prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims
promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the
response to treatment."

10899940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Examining the complex drivers of health disparities requires a diverse research workforce trained in the
transdisciplinary frameworks designed to address multiple domains and levels of influence and adept at
employing health equity research methods. In 2020, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS)
created the Institute for Health Equity Research (IHER) to lead health disparities research across the institution
and beyond. IHER faculty have extensive expertise in promoting inclusive excellence, providing training in health
equity science methodology, and fostering academic-community partnerships with key stakeholders to ensure
that community-informed disparities research is conducted and can lead to sustainable change. The overarching
goal of the Catalyst Center Investigator Development Core (IDC) is to integrate faculty enhancement activities
across the institution with the development and implementation of a pilot project program for early-stage
investigators focused on health disparities research. The IDC will provide transdisciplinary educational programs
and health equity research consultation services for investigators at all levels, and from all demographic and
scientific backgrounds. The Catalyst Pilot Project Program will combine individualized mentoring; a curriculum
of MH/HD research skills development; community engagement training; support for producing competitive
future grant applications; and formal and informal opportunities for networking across the institution, and with
local communities and policy makers. The IDC will achieve three aims: (1) Catalyze efforts to conduct health
disparities research by faculty at all levels at Mount Sinai. We will provide methodology workshops and health
equity topics seminars; sponsor a determinants of health journal club; provide opportunities to engage with
community; and create a repository of resources. (2) Develop and implement a Pilot Project Program awarding
3 grants annually. Proposed pilot projects must: a) focus on our priority populations (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities,
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and/or sexual and gender minorities); b) address domains and
levels of influence in the NIMHD framework; c) use principles of community engaged research; and d) aim to
generate preliminary data for a mentored K or R01 submission. With support from a Catalyst faculty health equity
mentor, Catalyst Scholars will develop an individual development plan (IDP), present their proposal to the
Catalyst Community Board (CCB), participate in professional development activities (e.g., research project
management, etc.), and work with the CCB on dissemination strategies. (3) Collaborate with the AC and CEDC
to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all IDC programs/activities, including faculty confidence and interest
in conducting MH/HD research. The IDC’s cohesive program of educational offerings and resources will increase
the capacity of faculty at our institution to conduct rigorous, community-informed MH/HD research and support
career development of ESIs pursuing careers in health equity science. These programs can serve as models for
other institutions committed to inclusive excellence and advancing health equity research."
10899959,"PROJECT SUMMARY– COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORE (CEDC)
The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core of University of Kentucky (UK) ASCEND (Achieving
Success in Community-Engaged research to elimiNate Disparities) provides a critical and integral component
of UK ASCEND’s objective, to advance health equity by promoting community-engaged research (CER)
success among early-stage investigators (ESIs) from diverse backgrounds through the ASCEND Scholars
Program (ASP), a novel and comprehensive CER Training Program followed by a rigorous CER Pilot Program;
and bi-directional engagement with community stakeholders through a Community Advisory Board (CAB).
Fostering such research success through community engagement is critical everywhere, and particularly in
Kentucky, recently ranked as #50 in national health standing, with the nation’s highest cancer mortality and
among the highest rates of other diseases that commonly affect health disparities populations. The mission of
the CEDC is to ensure that these ESIs, “ASCEND Scholars,” form and sustain productive research
collaborations and engage in impactful dissemination activities with diverse community stakeholders. The
CEDC is led by experienced, NIH-funded community-engaged health equity researchers and supported by
strong and enduring community and institutional partnerships. The CEDC has the following aims: (1) Cultivate
bidirectional interactions between ESIs and community stakeholders to stimulate research collaborations and
participatory planning processes and (2) Disseminate research findings to a broad range of audiences to
ensure translation of research results into sustainable community-level and system-level changes that advance
health equity. These aims will be achieved by leveraging existing and developing new institution-wide
resources, coordinating interactions with a CAB to facilitate equitable and sustainable relationships with
community stakeholders, and collaborating with the other UK ASCEND Cores. The CEDC will achieve bi-
directional interaction between ESIs and community stakeholders by managing a central Resource Catalog
that supports CER infrastructure, developing a Research Dissemination Toolkit and Individualized CER Plans,
and hosting an annual community-researcher summit. The dissemination and translation aim will be achieved
by the provision and exchange of evidence-based health information and ESI research findings through UK’s
Community Health Worker Program and the creation of a Sustainability Planning Guide. The CEDC constitutes
a critical resource interwoven throughout UK ASCEND. Such bi-directional collaboration enhances the
likelihood of achieving UK ASCEND’s outcomes, ESI CER career development, community engagement, and
ESI research success. The CEDC will promote the integration and authentic engagement of community
perspectives into ESIs’ CER training and pilot projects, critical to overcoming significant health disparities and
advancing health equity."

In the clinical world of diagnosis and treatment options for the spectrum of gastroparesis (GP) symptoms, there
are still numerous and challenging needs to understand, while at the same time further investigating the
pathophysiology of this entity, which affects > 10 million of patients in the US. GP patients exhibit a range of
symptoms which do not always correlate with the objective tests we rely on for diagnosis, as well as for assessing
their clinical reactions to pharmacological agents.
Our response to the NIDDK Gastroparesis Consortium (U01) under RFA-DK-20-504 has the following aims:
1) A) Continue and complete already approved studies initiated by the GpCRC, which specifically entails
 enrolling qualified patients to Gastroparesis Registry 3, with all relevant clinical and bio-samples, including
 also PBMC isolation (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), as well as completing the Buspirone (BESST)
 clinical trial; B) Continue obtaining gastric antral and pyloric smooth muscle tissue samples at the time of
 surgeries to further advance our knowledge of pathological basis of gastroparesis (PBG) protocol. C)
 Investigate Pyloric Sphincter Abnormalities in Patients with Gastroparesis Symptoms (PSAGS) per the
 EndoFlip assessment protocol.
 B) Our additional proposals for the GP Registry 4 (GpR4) are: 1) During the routine EGD for GpR4 and
 possible PSAGS studies, we would like to collect samples of duodenal and gastric microbiota by obtaining
 brushings of gastric and duodenal mucosa; 2) biopsy antral muscularis propria tissue using Endoscopic
 Submucosal Dissection (ESD) methodology during upper GI endoscopy .
2) As a new research strategy, we propose to investigate whether microbiota obtained at the time of endoscopy
 by brushing the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum, will differ in their composition in idiopathic and
 diabetic GP and control patients. We hypothesize that dysbiosis of the upper GI microbiota may contribute
 to the delayed gastric emptying and symptoms in GP patients, particularly in the idiopathic subgroup of our
cohort.
3) Our clinical trial proposal is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of a new selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist,
 Pruclalopride, to improve the symptoms and gastric emptying in idiopathic and diabetic GP patients while at
 the same time having an excellent safety profile. A multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo-

Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United
States. Despite being commonly comorbid, there is a striking lack of integrated treatments accessible to people
in need. This is particularly true for Black and Hispanic individuals living and seeking care in under-resourced
settings like The Bronx, NY, one of the poorest and most racially diverse counties in the U.S. Submitted in
response to the HEAL Initiative: Integrative Management of Chronic Pain and OUD for Whole Recovery
(IMPOWR) RFA-DA-21-030, the overall goal of this proposal is to create the IMPOWR Research Center at
Montefiore/Einstein (“IMPOWR-ME”), in the high-impact county of The Bronx NY. IMPOWR-ME is a synergistic
multidisciplinary research center that leverages exceptional research infrastructure in CP and OUD and
existing relationships with people living with CP and OUD, advocates, policymakers and payers, and health
system stakeholders. The aims of IMPOWR-ME are to: 1) create a robust and sustainable research
infrastructure to rigorously test and disseminate integrated and cost-effective evidence-based
practices for people with CP and OUD; 2) partner with people with lived experience with CP, OUD, or
both, and diverse stakeholders in all stages of the research; and 3) provide opportunities for
multidisciplinary early stage investigators to become independent researchers focusing on CP and
OUD. Three innovative hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trials are proposed to rigorously examine
multi-modal evidence-based practices in diverse health care settings and populations of people with comorbid
CP and OUD. Specifically, we propose: 1) a three-arm trial of yoga and physical therapy onsite at methadone
opioid treatment programs, 2) a 2x2 factorial trial to test Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and a care
management smartphone app for individuals in primary-care based buprenorphine treatment, and 3) a two-arm
trial to test microdosing vs. standard induction of buprenorphine for hospitalized patients. Participants in all
projects have both CP and OUD or opioid misuse, and specific aims for each project will examine CP, OUD,
implementation, and cost-effectiveness outcomes; additional patient-centered outcomes will be driven by
people with lived experience. All three projects improve access to care for Black and Hispanic individuals in
under-resourced settings by bringing integrated treatment of CP and OUD to them, and the interventions have
high potential for dissemination and sustainability. An innovative program for pilot studies achieves a dual aim
of catalyzing stakeholder-driven research and training early stage and new investigators. An exceptional team
of investigators and clinical experts focused on CP and OUD, a longstanding history of collaboration with
stakeholders and people with lived experience, and a high-impact population make Montefiore-Einstein an
ideal site for an IMPOWR research center."

Challenging auditory environments, e.g., classrooms, school cafeterias, playgrounds, comprise a significant
portion of a child's day. Binaural hearing facilitates speech understanding in these environments where sounds
and speech overlap, originate from multiple sources, and vary in level. Binaural auditory cues are necessary to
understand speech and locate talkers in acoustically complex settings; however, binaural cues are degraded or
eliminated for children with asymmetric hearing loss (AHL, defined as severe to profound hearing loss in one ear
and mild to moderate hearing loss in the other) or single-sided deafness (SSD, defined as severe to profound
hearing loss in one ear and normal or near normal hearing in the other). A cochlear implant (CI) is the only
treatment that can provide hearing to an ear with severe to profound hearing loss and thus, the only opportunity
for binaural hearing. Yet, children with AHL/SSD are not routinely implanted in the poor ear because the better
ear benefits from amplification (AHL) or has normal hearing (SSD). Recently, the FDA granted approval to
implant a subset of children with AHL/SSD; however, the approval is restrictive as it is limited to children with
profound hearing loss and ≤ 5% word recognition in the poor ear. Furthermore, there is no consensus regarding
CI candidacy criteria, assessment tools, or performance outcomes over time for these children. A longitudinal,
prospective, multi-center clinical trial employing an FDA-approved protocol is critically needed to address deficits
of children with AHL/SSD and explore treatment with a CI. Our proposed sequential, two-phase study allows for
comparison of performance growth pre-implant with current hearing aid (HA) technology versus post-implant
with a CI. Aim 1 obtains preliminary efficacy data in children with AHL/SSD who receive a CI in the poor ear.
Post-implant performance with a CI alone is compared with pre-implant performance with a HA. Measures
include word recognition and sound field detection levels. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of bimodal hearing
defined as a CI in the poor ear and a HA in the better ear (AHL) or a CI in the poor ear and normal hearing in
the better ear (SSD). Bimodal efficacy is measured by comparing: 1) post-implant bimodal scores to pre-implant
best-aided scores, 2) post-implant, bimodal scores to better ear alone scores, and 3) change in bimodal
performance across time (CI phase) to change in best-aided performance over time (HA phase). Measures
encompass speech recognition in noise and at soft levels, localization, and Quality of Life metrics. Essential
information related to patient selection, test measures, and methodology will inform clinical management of these
underserved populations. In summary, study outcomes will provide crucial evidence-based data regarding the
development of binaural hearing abilities in children with AHL or SSD who receive a CI in the poor hearing ear,
which is integral to the establishment of standardized treatment."

While current augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices present a variety of access
methods for message generation to benefit people with complex communication needs, there still exists a
group of literate adults with severe speech and motor impairments (SSMI) who cannot identify a functional
means for typing, which is an important tool for computer-based communication. In prior NIDCD-
supported research, our research team developed a high performance intracortical brain-computer
interface (iBCI) that decodes movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed
people to control a cursor on a computer screen for communication simply by imagining movements of
their own arm. The proposed R01 clinical research will extend this prior work on improving the
performance of iBCI systems, as part of the multi-site BrainGate consortium, and utilizing a new fully-
implantable, wireless system being developed under separate NIH BRAIN Initiative funded project. The
goals of the project are to leverage the discovery of new motor and cognitive signals in human motor
cortex to implement and evaluate three new methods for iBCI typing and general purpose computer use:
(1) an automatic Error Detect and Undo (EDU) system that uses error-related signals from motor cortex,
(2) decoding techniques that create continuous high degree-of-freedom control signals from motor cortex
to increase rates of point-and-click iBCI typing in 3D and 4D as compared with 2D, and (3) decoding
techniques that classify multiple different “click” signals from motor cortex. A rigorous uniform
experimental procedure with clear evaluation metrics will be utilized across all three Specific Aims, in all
three research participants, and at each clinical site using a standardized suite of iBCI tasks, assuring
consistency across sessions and participants. Upon completion, this project will advance both the
capabilities of iBCIs for communication and our understanding of the function of human motor cortex."
10900727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Various CV risk factors like insulin resistance,
dyslipidemia, and inflammation are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Weight loss is the main
recommendation to reduce cardiometabolic risk for people with obesity, but the protection is proportional to the
magnitude of weight lost, and fades over time during weight maintenance with the reversal or worsened risk in
those who regain weight. This proposal aims to investigate mitochondrial adaptations with weight loss that
might lessen its capacity to protect against CV disease. We will do this by studying adaptation in the plateau
phase, a time period when further weight loss becomes minimal despite efforts to continue losing weight, and
weight regain often follows. The plateau phase is currently understudied and links the occurrence of a weight
loss plateau with diminished protection against cardiometabolic risk.
In AIM 1, I will determine functional differences in mitochondria at the weight loss plateau in immune cells
isolated from people with obesity undergoing weight loss. In AIM 2, I will develop paradigms of the plateau-
state in mice with diet-induced obesity to test whether reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity in liver
muscle and immune cells is an underlying mechanism for adaptation in energy expenditure (metabolic
adaptation) at the plateau that promote weight regain. For AIM 3, I will determine in a mouse model of
accelerated atherosclerosis whether mice the plateau state develop more severe diet-induced CMR,
atherosclerosis, and immune cell redox stress.
This proposal will be carried out in an institution with strong research programs in metabolism, obesity, and
cardiovascular disease. I will receive state-of-the-art training in techniques and analytical tools necessary for
completion of all aims, including clinical samples from NIH-funded obesity studies, indirect calorimetry in
rodents, and assessment of atherogenic risk in mice. This proposal will generate data laying the foundation for
my independent research career focused on mitochondrial mechanisms that influence cardiometabolic risk in
obesity."

10900007,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is
underdeveloped, with structural malformations to the ascending aorta, aortic/mitral valves, and a
characteristically small left ventricle. These anatomical abnormalities restrict proper blood circulation in infants
and can be lethal if left untreated. While palliative procedures have improved the prognosis of HLHS patients,
many still suffer downstream morbidities and a diminished quality of life. Unfortunately, the etiology of HLHS
remains elusive to scientists and clinicians. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the
development of the disease; however, the exact cellular processes that modulate HLHS pathogenesis still need
to be elucidated. An inadequate understanding of the syndrome is exacerbated by limited experimental models
that can recapitulate and manipulate key features of HLHS. Restricted ethical access to human embryos, and
fundamental differences between animals and humans have failed to produce models that mimic clinical
phenotypes. Furthermore, standard 2D in-vitro cell culture spatially restricts tissue growth, which does not fully
recap three-dimensional development in nature. When compared to 2D culture, cardiomyocytes grown in 3D
have shown enhanced sarcomeric structure, contractility, mitochondrial respiration, cellular alignment, and
electrophysiological characteristics. Therefore, there exists a need to develop alternative strategies to study
abnormal cardiac development in-vitro. Tissue engineering techniques such as 3D bioprinting offer a unique
platform to deposit cells and biomaterials that mimic the extracellular matrix of tissues in an architecturally
controlled fashion. In addition to geometric control, the properties of these cell-laden hydrogels, such as stiffness,
can be controlled. Moreover, advances in iPSC technology offer an in-vitro biological system that retains genetic-
and disease-specific information from donors which provides a tool to probe genetically inheritable and
developmental diseases. Leveraging these technological advances, our proposed study aims to utilize a 3D-
bioprinted heart tube patterned into an endocardial layer (with iPSC-derived endothelial cells) and myocardial
layer (with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) to interrogate how dysregulated fluid-induced biomechanics and
microenvironmental stiffness impedes cardiac proliferation in-vitro. In this regard, we hypothesize aberrant
biomechanical forces induce stress-related endocardial-myocardial signaling that ultimately impedes
cardiomyocyte proliferation. We will test our hypothesis by (1) selectively varying endocardial stiffness within our
disease-specific 3D model and assessing intercellular signaling that dysregulates cardiomyocyte proliferation,
and (2) by applying varying degrees of flow-induced shear stress to the endocardial layer and studying
transcriptional shifts that occur in response to these perturbations at the single-cell level. Successful completion
of these aims will give novel etiological insights into how dysregulated biomechanical cues in HLHS impedes
cardiac growth and could shed light into alternative approaches to treat ventricular hypoplasia."
10899915,"Project Summary:
Proper development of the human cortex is essential for brain function and depends on the synchronization of
complex molecular and cellular processes. Malformations of cortical development may occur in the setting of
genetic mutations altering the activity of genes essential for this synchrony. Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a
malformation of cortical development characterized by abnormal folding of the cerebral cortex and is often
associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Our lab has performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of
over 200 families affected with PMG and no previously identified diagnosis, establishing the genetic landscape
of PMG pathogenesis. From our cohort, nearly 20% of mutations found in solved cases occur in ion channels
with high in utero expression, implicating developmental channelopathies as a key pathway in PMG
pathogenesis. However, the role of ion channels in cortical histogenesis—and their contribution to disease—
remains poorly understood. Through our exome analysis, we identified three affected individuals with de novo
missense variants in the gene PANX1, encoding Pannexin 1. PANX1 forms a heptameric ion channel of seven
PANX1 subunits and is expressed in early development in neurons and glia. Opening of the heptameric ion
channel releases small anions and ATP into the extracellular milieu, participating in purinergic signaling. The
channel is further speculated to contribute to the propagation of calcium waves—a form of developmental
electrical signaling that drives cell proliferation and migration—yet its definitive contribution in the fetal cortex is
unknown. Thus, in this proposal, I aim to 1) characterize our novel missense PANX1 variants and their
impact on channel activity and 2) channel structure, and 3) leverage the gyrencephalic ferret as an
animal model to study PANX1’s role in cortical development. In Aim 1, I will investigate how our newly
identified PMG-associated PANX1 variants alter protein function. By overexpressing mutant constructs in
heterologous cells, I will assess expression and localization using western blotting. Furthermore, using both
heterologous cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPSC)-derived neurons, I will determine alterations to ATP
release and channel conductance with patch clamping. In Aim 2, I will perform cryo-electron microscopy on
purified wildtype and mutant channels, assessing how mutations alter structural properties and gap junction
formation. These two aims will provide a molecular, cellular, and structural level mechanism for PANX1
perturbation in disease. In Aim 3, I will provide functional evidence for the association between PANX1 activity
and cortical histogenesis in ferrets. While mice are lissencephalic, ferrets develop gyri, enabling investigation
of disordered gyrification. I will also use calcium imaging to characterize the circuit level impact of PANX1
disruption on developmental calcium signaling. Functional investigation of human PANX1 variants will provide
key insight into how genes associated with PMG influence foundational mechanisms of cortical organization
and will further elucidate our understanding of how electrical activity shapes fetal cortex development."

Access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is not equitable. Black and Hispanic individuals are
substantially less likely to receive MOUD and other overdose prevention services. The overdose death rate
has risen nearly twice as fast for Black individuals as for White individuals in recent years, a disparity that
appears to have widened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Racial/ethnic inequities in receipt of MOUD are
rooted in the structural racism ingrained in policies governing healthcare, housing, social services, criminal
justice and other systems. As the largest single payer for MOUD and a key source of coverage for racial/ethnic
minority groups, Medicaid is well-positioned to address inequities in MOUD. Although they have not done so to
date, Medicaid agencies can adopt policies to alter (a) financial incentives for MOUD providers, and (b)
contracts with managed care plans to improve equity in MOUD. Medicaid programs could institute
requirements for provider networks; invest in building capacity for minority-serving Medicaid providers to
deliver MOUD; include equity measures in provider performance measurement; and alter managed care
contracts to incentivize plans to address inequities in MOUD. There is, however, little evidence on which of
these levers is most likely to be effective. To inform Medicaid policy development, we harness the Medicaid
Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN), which is made up of university partnerships with Medicaid
agencies in 11 states representing 22% of all US Medicaid enrollees. MODRN is currently funded by NIDA to
study the quality of opioid use disorder treatment in Medicaid and has developed analytic infrastructure to
conduct multi-state analyses of treatment with MOUD in Medicaid. We propose analyses that examine the role
of place, providers, plans and policies in driving racial/ethnic inequities in MOUD. First, we examine
racial/ethnic inequities in geographic access to MOUD providers among Medicaid enrollees. Second, we
examine the contribution of provider- and plan-level factors to racial/ethnic equity in MOUD. Third, we estimate
the association between state policies aimed at (a) changing delivery system reforms, and (b) managed care
contracts, and equity in MOUD. Study outcomes are any use of MOUD and continuity of MOUD, both of which
are associated with reduced mortality. We will use geospatial analyses, multi-level modeling, and difference-in
difference analyses to accomplish our specific aims. Long-standing relationships with state Medicaid officials
allow us to share findings directly with policymakers who can act on them. MODRN facilitates rapid knowledge
transfer from researchers to policymakers, allows state Medicaid agencies to benchmark their performance on
racial/ethnic equity in MOUD against other states, and supports state agencies learning from one another
about the most effective policy levers for improving equity in MOUD."

This is a renewal application requesting continued funding for a Neurobiology of CNS Injury and Repair T32
Training Program to support 4 predoctoral fellows per year for a 2-year training period, working toward their
PhD degrees in the fields of traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), or stroke. The overall goal
continues to be to prepare highly motivated graduate students for careers in neurotrauma research-related
fields by providing broad-based training in the pathophysiology of TBI, SCI, and stroke and the identification of
potential disease-modifying molecular targets that can drive the discovery of pharmacological or gene-based
therapeutic strategies. An Executive Committee will select trainees from a pool of qualified applicants,
generally in their third year of PhD training. Trainees will receive intensive hands-on research mentoring, with
an emphasis on understanding and applying quantitative assessment tools in laboratories of Training Faculty
appointed in the Depts. of Neuroscience, Physiology, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, and Pharmaceutical
Sciences who regularly interact and collaborate through their affiliation with the University of Kentucky's (UK)
Spinal Cord & Brain Injury Research Center and Center for Advanced Translational Stroke Science (CATSS).
In addition to coursework, trainees will engage in journal clubs, responsible conduct of research training,
Center and Departmental seminar series, and a customized set of program-wide meetings in Professional
Skills, and Quantitative Literacy-Experimental Design and Statistics (PSQL-EDS). The monthly PSQL-EDS will
facilitate active learning of concepts such as quantitative literacy, statistical analysis, and scientific rigor, as
well as scientific writing and professional development. Of the students appointed to the T32 Program in the
previous 9 years, 13 have completed their PhDs, 2 will complete their PhDs in year 10, and 6 will continue their
PhD training. All those that completed their PhDs continued into science-related positions. Several are
continuing their education (3 postdocs, 1 resident), one is an AAAS science policy fellow at the NIH, and the
majority are pursuing careers in academia (3 Assistant Professors, 1 instructor, 1 researcher) and biomedical
industry (2). The PhD completion and career placement success of the T32 Program is further highlighted by
an outstanding record of recruiting and retaining diverse trainees: a large proportion of appointees are of
underrepresented race or ethnicity, have a disability, or come from disadvantaged backgrounds. The
program's success and continued evolution will be guided by two groups: an Executive Committee comprised
of the Program Directors, Training Faculty, and senior UK faculty who bring expertise in administration,
mentoring, and inclusion research initiatives, and an External Advisory Board of national leaders in TBI, SCI,
and stroke research. Through the pairing of comprehensive, research-intensive training with didactic and
interactive educational/career development activities delivered from diverse perspectives, this T32 Program is
uniquely positioned to fill a growing need for rigorously trained scientists who desire careers in neurotrauma."

supports predoctoral students in human genetics. We request funding for 8 predoctoral students,
funded for two years. The mission of this program is to prepare these students for a successful
career in human genetics in an academic, industrial, or public service capacity. We prepare our
students beginning with skills-focused classroom instruction and transitioning to experienced-
based learning through research and active collaboration with more experienced mentors.
Students are regularly exposed to leaders in human genetics research through their
collaborations, research seminars, and attendance at national and international meetings. This
training program has enjoyed broad success, with our students achieving excellent productivity
(mean 5.1, range 2-11, publications during graduate school by recently funded students). Student
excitement for human genetics training has rapidly increased, demonstrated by a 3-fold increase
in the number of students entering the Vanderbilt Human Genetics (HGEN) PhD program over
the past 5 years. Much of that increased excitement has grown from the unprecedented data
available now to students. Previously, it could take years of career advancement to assemble
even a single large-scale cohort of a single phenotype. However, with the advent of large biobanks
with clinical data, cohorts can now be assembled relatively quickly by graduate students with the
proper training, which our program provides. The Vanderbilt HGEN program has been at the
forefront of training graduate students in this new type of research. With Vanderbilt’s own large-
scale biobank (BioVU), and now the Data and Research Center for the NIH “All of Us” program
located in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, our graduate students have been getting both
hands-on and formal didactic training in this new and groundbreaking type of research. With the
establishment in 2015 of the Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt has committed substantial
resources for recruitment of faculty in genetics and genomics and additional investment in
genotyping of biobank subjects. Our graduate students are well-rounded biologists, with most
matriculating through the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP) at Vanderbilt and the rest from
the Quantitative & Chemical Biology Program (QCB). They conduct research in an amazing
variety of topics and publish as graduate students in the top scientific journals. Their education is
clearly empowering them, as the students themselves are major designers of their own
collaborative research within Vanderbilt, and they rightly feel that they are not just benefitting from
the excitement in the field of human genetics today but are also driving it."

INSTITUTIONAL CAREER DEVELOPMENT CORE (KL2) ABSTRACT. The University of Wisconsin (UW)
Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) KL2 Program, launched in 2007, has recruited and
trained 82 scholars (55% women, 14% underrepresented race/ethnicity) varied in their identities, discipline,
area of study, and position along the translational spectrum. We appoint three scholars per year for four years
using a combination of internal and external funds. Graduated scholars remain committed to research (90%) in
academics or industry, have been promoted or are eligible for promotion (87%), have successfully competed
for funding as a principal investigator/multiple principal investigator ($225 million) and as a co-investigator
($288 million), and have published prolifically as first/senior author (513) and as a co-author (1,456). In order to
accelerate these and other successes, ICTR has completed an institute-wide strategic plan (Innovation
Scorecard) that serves as a roadmap to use continuous improvement to address ongoing challenges in
conducting efficient, rigorous, and engaged CTR at our Hub—with specific attention to CTR capacity building.
In concert with these continuous program improvement efforts, we engaged a comprehensive KL2 needs
assessment, which recognized key challenges to early-career scientists, including: 1) maintaining work-life
integration, 2) transitioning to independence, 3) promoting diversity in research teams and study participants,
4) designing research for dissemination, and 5) disseminating and implementing research to improve health
outcomes. In the next grant period, we propose to refine our KL2 Program to address these challenges by
achieving the following Specific Aims: 1) Enhance scholar’s vitality by building their capacity to adjust to life
and career stressors, 2) Foster scholars’ engagement of community members in research conduct and
dissemination, 3) Establish longitudinal programming to help scholars incorporate dissemination and
implementation concepts into their research programs, and 4) Disseminate the KL2 Program’s mentorship and
coaching innovations. We have developed a comprehensive plan to increase the recruitment and retention of
scholars from historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. We have also designed a rigorous
program evaluation plan to assess influence at all levels of the translational research ecosystem. Program
success will be measured at each level: 1) individual: secure grants and publish work in high-impact journals;
2) proximal: develop and maintain relationships with mentors, mentees, and research teams; 3) institutional
and inter-institutional: form inter-disciplinary scientific teams and transform clinical care and institutional
culture; and 4) societal: revolutionize clinical guidelines and improve health and health equity. The KL2
leadership team’s innovative vision of program enhancement in the areas of mentorship, team science,
leadership, dissemination and implementation, and career resilience will foster and launch a cadre of diverse,
independently funded leaders of CTR who will impact the health of our patients, families, and communities."
10877932,"Program Summary/Abstract
In recent years, new demands are being placed on biomedical researchers and clinicians
thanks to changes in the way we acquire, analyze and interact with data. Many areas of
biomedical science are transitioning from being data-poor and hypothesis-rich to extremely
data-rich and (comparatively) hypothesis-poor. Conducting rigorous research in this new
environment can be challenging, as it requires grounding not just in biology, but also in
mathematics, computation and statistics. This application requests support for a pre-doctoral
training program designed to produce Ph.D.s with sufficient skills in fundamental biology,
mathematical and computational modeling, and data science to attack these challenges head
on. The program is built upon a free-standing, interdisciplinary Ph.D. program that has been
developed and refined over the past dozen years, and offers training at the interface between
the biological sciences and mathematics, computer science, physics and engineering. Eight pre-
doctoral trainee slots are requested, for appointments intended to last two years each.
Highlights of the proposed program include an extensive didactic curriculum; a focus on critical
thinking skills; an emphasis on collaboration and collaborative learning; close mentoring,
opportunities to develop multiple career skills; and active student involvement. The 31 program
faculty members come from 14 different departments in five schools at the University of
California, Irvine, and conduct research on diverse topics within biology and medicine. The
program enjoys strong campus support, and an administrative and intellectual home within the
UCI Center for Complex Biological Systems, a National Center for Systems Biology with a long-
standing commitment to promoting interdisciplinary education at all academic levels. The
proposed program will prepare trainees for careers in biomedical research, teaching, and
communication in both academic and non-academic settings."
10877935,"Project Summary/Abstract
Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles with a diameter of 50-200 nm, actively secreted by various types of cells in
our body. As they carry biomolecules (e.g., proteins, RNAs, or metabolites) specific to their parental cells and
are easily found in biofluids (e.g., blood or urine), exosomes have emerged as a promising biomarker for the
detection and treatment monitoring of various diseases. Also, exosomes have the strong potential as a
therapeutic agent for regeneration and immune regulation; for example, exosomes from mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of brain injury. However, the fundamental
mechanisms of what makes cells secrete exosomes and how the molecular contents in exosomes are
determined remain unclear; for example, we have limited information about how to regulate MSCs to maximize
the production of their exosomes carrying therapeutic molecules. My Lab aims to address these questions by
investigating the role of metabolism in exosome biogenesis, because multiple steps of exosome biogenesis,
including vesicle formation inside a cell and fusing into the plasma membrane, are directly associated with
metabolic processes. In this Project, we will investigate how the exosome generation rate and molecular
contents are determined under different metabolic conditions, specifically with the modulation of nutrients and
NAD levels. We will also develop a single exosome sorting technology based on intravesicular proteins and
investigate the biogenesis of exosomes with mitochondrial molecules under mitochondrial stress conditions.
The research accomplishments from this Project will deepen our understanding of exosomes and help us
develop exosome-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies more effectively. Our long-term research goal is
to identify the mechanisms of the interplay between metabolism and biogenesis of extracellular vesicles (EVs).
This MIRA research focuses on exosomes, a subpopulation of EVs. Based on our research progresses, we will
expand our research scope to other EVs, including microvesicles, in the future."

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity of prematurity with over
10,000 infants diagnosed each year in the United States. Underdeveloped lungs at birth, the need
for ventilatory support, which may result in ventilator-induced lung injury, and other factors
result in significant structural and functional pulmonary abnormalities associated with short- and
long-term lung disease. Effective management includes an individualized approach to choosing
the right ventilation strategy and medications. Two important techniques include the use of a
long i-time ventilatory strategy and administration of bronchodilators. However, each of these
treatments has some associated risk, and there is currently no real-time method to assess their
effectiveness on improving ventilation and perfusion.
Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive, non-ionizing real-time functional
imaging technique with no harmful side effects, suitable for patients of any age. We hypothesize
that EIT images and derived measures can provide real-time, actionable information to guide the
clinician's treatment strategy in infants with BPD, and satisfy this unmet need. In this proposal
we will carry out the following specific aims: (1) Build a new Adaptive Current Tomography
system designed for 3D imaging of very young intubated infants including novel 3-D
reconstruction algorithms to provide real-time images of regional ventilation, pulsatile perfusion
and quantitative EIT-derived measures. (2) Assess the ability of EIT images and derived measures
to determine the effectiveness of long i-time ventilation strategies while they are being applied.
An EIT Visualization Platform will be developed to enable the clinician to visualize the images and
output measures to assess treatment effectiveness. (3) Determine what combination of EIT-
derived measures provides the best assessment of bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) in infants
with or at risk of BPD after the first administration of bronchodilator therapy. We will evaluate
the efficacy in Aims 2 and 3 in a study with infants enrolled from the Level IV NICU at Stanford
University Medical Center and the University of Colorado Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit."
10901216,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRDs) are the third leading cause of death and disability in the United States,
with a significant impact on the sociobiological and economic health of the country. Many patients with CRDs
present with dysregulation of lung healing after injury. Therefore, there is an unmet need to better understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying lung regeneration in order to develop novel treatment strategies for
these patients. Most of the gas exchange region of the lung is lined by Alveolar Epithelial Type 1 (AT1) cells.
When these cells are damaged, Alveolar Epithelial Type 2 (AT2) cells activate, proliferate, and differentiate into
new AT1 cells to replace them. Failure of AT2-to-AT1 differentiation contributes to the pathogenesis of CRDs.
However, the mechanisms underlying this transition are not completely understood. Data suggest that
expression of Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake 1 (MICU1) protein, as well as a reduction of trimethylated histone
H3 residues lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and lysine 36 (H3K36me3), are both vital for AT2-to-AT1 differentiation. We
hypothesize that alterations in MICU1-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake drive AT2 differentiation by
rewiring cellular metabolism to favor the accumulation of α-ketoglutarate at the expense of succinate, thereby
increasing the activity of α-ketoglutarate-dependent histone demethylases and promoting an AT1 pattern of
gene expression. Therefore, our specific aims are to: (1) Determine the distribution of H3K9me3 and
H3K36me3 marks across the genome, and their functional consequences, during AT2-to-AT1 cell
differentiation in AT2 wildtype and MICU1 knockout cells, and (2) Determine whether increased H3K9me3 and
H3K36me3 are responsible for the decreased AT2-to-AT1 differentiation capacity of AT2 MICU1 knockout
cells. Aim 1 will utilize CUT&RUN, ATAC-Seq, and RNA-Seq, while Aim 2 use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing both
in vitro and in vivo. The proposed experiments will take place in the Center for Translational Medicine in the
Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, an institution with a track record of excellence in both
clinical medicine and scientific research. The training plan, developed by Co-Sponsors Drs. Tian and Elrod, will
be tailored to ensure success of the applicant, Morgan Pantuck, as she progresses through Temple's MD/PhD
program. Overall, this grant will provide an excellent training vehicle for the applicant while also increasing our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lung regeneration, supporting development of novel
treatments for CRDs."
10901220,"Project Summary
My long-term career aspiration is to become a physician-scientist committed to bringing novel brain tumor
therapies from bench to bedside by leading an independent basic science research group. This proposal is a
first step in achieving this goal by providing crucial support for an integrated neuroscience/cancer biology-based
training plan in the context of brain tumor research at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of
Pennsylvania. Glioblastoma is a universally fatal brain cancer that functionally integrates into the normal neural
circuitry. It has been reported that neuronal activity drives tumor progression via glutamatergic synapses onto
tumor cells and, in parallel, glioblastoma cells alter neuronal excitability, remodel neural circuits, and impair
cognitive function. However, little is known regarding the cellular diversity and circuit architecture of neurons that
are connected with tumor cells. Understanding the anatomic and cell type distribution of these connected
neurons may reveal unique functional roles of select neuronal subsets in glioma pathogenesis. We hypothesize
that glioblastoma receives functional synapses from both local and long-range neuronal projections, consisting
of not only glutamatergic but also neuromodulatory inputs. In the normal brain, neuromodulatory inputs project
diffusely throughout the brain and play an important role in modulating neuronal excitability, and thus may also
function in regulating glioma. In this proposal, we seek to define the glioblastoma connectome using
monosynaptic rabies virus (RBV) for retrograde trans-synaptic tracing and monosynaptic herpes simplex virus
(HSV) for anterograde trans-synaptic tracing in a xenograft mouse model. In Aim 1, we will utilize an in vivo
model to map the whole-brain inputs onto glioblastoma by transplanting patient-derived glioblastoma organoids
(GBOs) to various clinically relevant brain regions in immunodeficient mice. Preliminary studies revealed labeling
of diverse neuronal subtypes in various brain regions, and, in particular, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
projecting to transplanted glioblastoma cells in both cortical and subcortical regions. We will confirm cholinergic
inputs with HSV-based anterograde trans-synaptic tracing as well as electrophysiological recordings. In Aim 2,
we will study the functional significance of these cholinergic neuromodulatory inputs onto glioblastoma by
performing calcium imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing of glioblastoma organoids treated with acetylcholine
as well as assess the impact of acetylcholine on tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. We believe that project
outcomes will elucidate the complex brain-wide interactions between tumor cells and diverse neuronal
populations and investigate the significance of cholinergic inputs in glioma disease progression, thereby
providing novel therapeutic avenues for glioblastoma."

This T32 program represents a new paradigm for training biophysical scientists and engineers to traverse
cardiovascular medicine. The convergence of engineering with medicine is transforming clinical and patient
care via advances in flexible electronics for sensing and imaging, coupled with machine learning, which has
introduced new innovations to confront the rising endemic of cardiometabolic disorders. The University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) are partnering to develop
the UCLA/Caltech integrated Cardiovascular Medicine for Bioengineers (iCMB) Program, that will be
formalized into a 2-year, structured curriculum with an emphasis on recruiting the under-represented post-
doctoral engineers or biophysical scientists into leadership roles in academia and industry. The approach
is to strengthen individualized training in 1) advanced sensing or 2) imaging coupled with machine
learning to address 3) cardiometabolic disease. The iCMB program will be built upon two successful
Caltech and UCLA joint training programs: the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) for MD-PhD
students and the unique Subspecialty Training and Advanced Research Program (STAR) for fellowship-level
physicians to obtain a PhD. The partnerships with the industry leaders from Amgen, Johnson & Johnson,
Medtronic, and Edwards Lifesciences have enriched our internship, mentorship, and leadership programs.
Both the Caltech Diversity Center and UCLA Faculty Diversity & Development Office have supported
workshops on Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) for women and under-represented
minorities. To implement this iCMB Program, we have developed a novel mentoring and self-evaluating
structure in the inclusion of 24 seasoned mentors, 4 emerging faculty, 22 Clinical Faculty (42% female), and 10
industry leaders. Each iCMB scholar will have co-mentorships: a primary mentor from cardiometabolic
medicine and a secondary from enabling technologies or industry. In Year 1, iCMB scholars will develop
fundamental knowledge in advanced imaging, sensors, or computation and didactic training for ethics in
biomedical research and publications. In Year 2, iCMB scholar will have an option 1) to participate in a
certificate in Pathways in Clinical and Translational Research from the UCLA Clinical Translational Science
Institute (CTSI) or Law and Technology for FDA regulatory science (BE188/299); and/or 2) to participate in
UCLA CTSI-sponsored professional development in preparation for an academic or industry career. Both
Caltech and UCLA Deans have committed matching funds for each iCMB scholar. Our Vice Provost for UCLA
Graduate Education has also committed supplemental trainee support to enhance the diversity of trainees.
Therefore, the complementary and synergistic strengths of the Caltech/UCLA iCMB Program provide a new
infusion of workforce prepared to solve the worldwide endemic of cardiometabolic disease."

 Survival rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer, are now
close to 90%, but survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk for long term cognitive deficits,
particularly affecting executive function (e.g., attention, planning, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility).
The chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate (MTX) is used to treat most ALL patients, and is closely
associated with executive function deficits. Thus a pressing need exists to define the mechanisms that link
MTX exposure to cognitive dysfunction, to guide development of intervention strategies to protect the
developing brain, reduce symptoms and optimize quality of life in ALL survivors, during childhood,
adolescence, young and full adulthood.
 To that end, we have developed a translationally relevant mouse model of leukemia survival that
combines cancer exposure (mouse leukemic cell line (L1210 cells) with contemporary chemotherapeutic
drugs (vincristine and MTX, with leucovorin rescue) administered during early life. PFC development
extends through adolescence, which renders this area of the brain particularly vulnerable to early life
chemotherapy. Providing a solid premise for the proposed experiments, our mouse model recapitulates
executive function deficits observed in ALL patients. Additionally, in response to early life cancer +
chemotherapy, we have found an increase in the proinflammatory molecules IL-1 and CCL2, as well as a
decrease in white matter associated genes within the PFC. In Aim 1, single cell RNA sequencing will be
used to define the effects of cancer and/or chemotherapy on the transcriptional profile of the PFC.
 MTX disrupts folate metabolism to inhibit cell growth, but this disruption also leads to increased levels
of the proinflammatory metabolite, homocysteine (HCY), in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Increased
HCY can drive inflammation, oxidative stress and is associated with both white and gray matter damage,
as well as cognitive impairment. Further executive function deficits have also been linked to altered
synaptic function, and microglia, a brain resident immune cell, can contribute to synapse elimination via
the CD11b(CR3)-C3 phagocytic pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that MTX-driven increased HCY
levels will lead to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, leading to gray and white matter damage, and
altered synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex, which underlie deficits in executive function.
 To test this hypothesis, HCY-lowering strategies (folate and B vitamin supplementation, or the
antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine amide) will be evaluated in Aim 2. Aim 3 will test the necessity of IL-1 activity
while Aim 4 will test the necessity of microglia in mediating the chemotherapy-associated cognitive
deficits, as well as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, leading to gray and white matter damage, and
altered synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex"

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in brain health, but its role in brain development and the
cellular interactions which govern its formation remain unknown. Recent studies have revealed specific time
points during which microglia-like progenitors exit the prenatal liver and migrate into the brain, suggesting a
complex development and function of the BBB throughout gestation. Furthermore, once in the brain, these
progenitors differentiate into a population of cells similar to microglia, which are traditionally thought to arise
from progenitors that exit the yolk sac and migrate directly into the brain. Understanding the developmental
changes in BBB permeability is essential to unraveling the mechanisms by which it regulates cellular trafficking
into the brain. Dr. MacKenzie's lab published these findings and is currently investigating the migration of these
prenatal liver-derived (PL-derived) immune cells into the brain using an innovative in utero prenatal liver
injection model. Additionally, Dr. Crouch's lab has developed a novel strategy to isolate endothelial and mural
cells, key vascular cell types of the developing brain vasculature, for in vitro study and single-cell RNA
sequencing analysis. With these techniques, this proposal aims to elucidate the cellular and molecular
development of the BBB and its impact on cellular trafficking into the brain. Our overall hypothesis is that
immature venous-like vasculature mediates the entry of PL-derived immune cells into the brain due to its
heightened BBB permeability during development. To address this hypothesis, we will first characterize the
spatiotemporal development of the BBB, identifying cell types and anatomical regions associated with
increased vascular permeability. Second, we will trace the entry of PL-derived immune cells into the brain and
track changes in their cell identity over time. The outcomes of this research will advance our understanding of
brain vascular development and potentially inform the development of therapeutics targeting the unique
selective permeability of the prenatal brain vasculature."

 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by an epigenetic silencing of the X-
linked FMR1 gene, which leads to loss of its protein product fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP).
Currently, FXS is the largest single-gene contributor to autism affecting about 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 7,000
females in the U.S. Despite FXS being a monogenic disorder, FMRP controls many aspects of
neurodevelopment leading FXS patients to present a wide range of symptoms that include intellectual disability,
language impairment, anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression. Many studies investigating the molecular
mechanisms affected in FXS have been performed in Fmr1 knockout (KO) rodent models and drosophila.
However, many of the treatments that proved to be successful in animal models failed in human clinical trials,
leaving a large unmet need for treatment targeting FXS. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have
been a useful model in the study of neurodevelopmental disorders and studies have shown that FXS iPSC
derived neurons have defects in neuronal maturation and differentiation. Recently, 3-dimensional cortical
organoids (3DOs) derived from iPSCs have become an increasingly promising tool for the study of human
neurodevelopment because they resemble human brain formation and can be cultured for more than one year.
However, a study examining the effect of FMRP deficiency throughout development has not been done.
Therefore, I propose to study cortical development, electrical activity, and genetic signatures using 3DOs derived
from FMR1 deficient iPSC lines at different developmental stages. My preliminary data already shows increased
cell proliferation in FXS patient-derived 3DOs, which corresponds to previous findings in FXS neural progenitor
cells (NPCs), and hyperexcitability, which is consistent with our previous studies in FXS 2D neurons. I have also
found upregulation of a putative FMRP target SPTBN1 (Spectrin Beta, Non-Erythrocytic 1) across three
developmental stages. I hypothesize that FMRP deficiency leads to dysregulation of SPTBN1, a gene important
for neuronal maturation, which results in disrupted development of FXS cortical organoids. To test this
hypothesis, in the first aim I propose to identify developmental deficits in FXS 3DOs by performing
immunohistochemistry of developmental markers in early, middle, and late developmental time-points along with
the analysis of electrical activity using calcium imaging. In the second aim, I propose to determine whether and
how FMRP regulates SPTBN1 and investigate how dysregulation of SPTBN1 may contribute to developmental
deficits that we have found in FXS 3DOs. I also plan to confirm these previous results and identify novel
differentially expressed genes through single nucelus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) at different developmental
time points. Overall, this project will further the understanding of the developmental and molecular mechanisms
disrupted in FXS patients throughout development and lead to better-targeted treatments."

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe mental disorder that develops in some victims of
trauma but not all. Notably, the mechanisms underlying the development and pathophysiology of PTSD remain
unknown, and reliable diagnostic biomarkers, as well as targeted therapeutic interventions, are still lacking. Our
research team has employed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to successfully identify PTSD risk loci
as part of the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium for PTSD. We have also used and developed methods to link
PTSD risk loci to molecular mechanisms for experimental follow-up.
 This proposal seeks to fine map the latest, robust PTSD risk loci by linking multi-omic and cell type-
specific molecular mechanisms in the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and specific PTSD-asso-
ciated phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will identify causal variants and genes in the PTSD risk loci and conduct RNA
expression, DNA methylation and protein expression analyses to identify region-specific and across-region gene
networks associated with PTSD that involve causal variants and genes. In Aim 2, we will identify causal variants
and genes in the PTSD risk loci at the brain cell type-specific level and gene molecular alterations across cell
types associated with PTSD via single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq- and Multiome-seq. We validate prioritized variants
using in vitro with SNP-sepcific CRISPR-editing of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neural cultures
exposed to glucocorticoids. In Aim 3, we will perform a phenomic characterization of the prioritized PTSD vari-
ants, genes and networks resulting from Aims 1 and 2, explore PTSD subtypes based on implicated phenotypes,
and evaluate associated polygenic risk scores to characterize the clinical significance of the fine-mapping ap-
proaches.
 This study will greatly improve our understanding of the brain multi-omic and multi-cell type mechanisms,
as well as phenomically characterize the causal risk variants, genes, and networks, and will point toward novel
targets for intervention in PTSD."

and Pain (TREETOP) clinical research center at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) is part of the NIH IMPOWR
network. TREETOP draws on the NIDA Clinical Trials Network Appalachian (Pennsylvania & West Virginia)
and Western States (Oregon) Nodes and the Community-based OUD and Pain Enhanced treatment (COPE)
collaborative (Baltimore, Maryland) to develop effective, equitable, and sustainable interventions for chronic
pain and OUD. Our overall goal is to improve treatment for comorbid chronic pain and OUD across the OUD
Treatment Cascade, prioritizing two disproportionately impacted communities for whom equitable
implementation of effective interventions can be challenging: rural and Black communities. We will achieve our
overall goal through the integrated contributions of 5 center components as follows: 1) Research Site
Overview, Management, and Operations - Our diverse multidisciplinary team has extensive experience with
multisite clinical trials as well as in TREETOP’s two emphasis areas, health equity and implementation
science. 2) Engagement and Outreach - Our TREETOP Stakeholder Consultation Board (SCB) includes
representatives with a variety of perspectives and lived experiences from each clinic and community partnering
in our studies and will serve as active participants on the research team. 3) Engagement/Retention Research
Projects - Both projects share the central premise that treating chronic pain improves pain and OUD
outcomes, tailor a pain self-management (PSM) intervention to patients with co-morbid chronic pain and OUD,
and evaluate both the intervention effectiveness and the barriers and facilitators to equitable and sustained
implementation of the intervention through the Health Equity Implementation Framework. Specifically, the
Engagement research project investigates whether PSM can improve pain and engage primary care patients
in medication treatment for OUD, while the Retention project investigates whether PSM and/or flexibly dosed
buprenorphine/naloxone can improve pain and retention in treatment among patients who have already
initiated care in office-based addiction treatment programs. 4) Data Collection, Management, and
Harmonization - The Data Core will be led by investigators with a track record of success in the measurement
and analysis of patient-reported outcomes and in leading clinical trials and data coordinating centers, and
includes national leaders in the PROMIS Health Organization. 5) Pilot Projects - Our Pilot program includes 3
initial studies on pain measurement, chronic pain/OUD treatment implementation in specialty settings, and
chronic pain and OUD stigma, and then follows a standard protocol for soliciting and reviewing future pilot
projects addressing health equity and implementation science. Overall Impact: Our TREETOP investigators
and SCB will collaborate to advance the science of sustainably and equitably managing chronic pain and OUD,
prioritizing disproportionately impacted rural and Black communities."

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the major histological subtype of lung cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortalities worldwide. For a substantial number of LUAD patients, the only treatment options
available are traditional multi-agent chemotherapy coupled with surgery and/or radiation. For these patients,
the 5-year survival remains disappointingly low. Additional molecular mechanisms driving LUAD proliferation
and tumorigenesis remain a critical knowledge gap in lung cancer research, and a major barrier for the
development of personalized therapies. Recent reports, including our own, reveal critical roles for glycogen in
lung tumor progression. Building on these foundational studies, we developed a robust and precision
technology to visualize glycogen in situ with 50 µm spatial resolution using mass spectrometry imaging that
provides 1,000x increased sensitivity compared to previous methods. Using this technology, we defined
glycogen levels in 122 NSCLC patients treated at the University of Kentucky’s NCI Designated Cancer Center.
Our preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) significantly elevated glycogen is observed in LUAD and not in
normal lung tissue. 2) Elevated glycogen is a LUAD tissue-specific hallmark and is not observed in lung
squamous cell carcinoma. 3) LUAD-glycogen is structurally unique with increased phosphorylation and
branching. 4) This LUAD phenotype correlated with marked protein decreases in the glycogen phosphatase
laforin. Strikingly, laforin knockout in model lung cell lines and the KrasG12D/p53-/- LUAD mouse model drives: 1)
glycogen hyper-phosphorylation, 2) increased affinity with the master metabolic regulator AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK), 3) decreased AMPK activity, and 4) accelerated tumor proliferation and progression.
We hypothesize that the structurally unique LUAD-glycogen is a critical component of LUAD metabolism,
proliferation, and progression. The overall objective of this study is to define the etiology of LUAD-glycogen on
both cancer metabolism and tumor progression. To achieve this, we will: Define the LUAD-glycogen clinical
course and its interaction with AMPK (Aim 1). Then, we will define the signaling role of LUAD-glycogen in
cellular metabolism through AMPK (Aim 2). Finally, we will establish the role of LUAD-glycogen in tumor
progression and early transformation in vivo (Aim3). This proposal builds on exciting and rigorous preliminary
data and presents an integrated approach to define this unique LUAD hallmark of excess glycogen utilizing
robust, complementary, and state-of-the-art methodologies such as mass spectrometry imaging, protein and
glycogen biochemistry, and targeted metabolomics. The salient findings from this proposal will significantly
advance the knowledge base regarding the roles of glycogen in LUAD biology and progression and drive the
discovery of personalized therapies that can be leveraged for the LUAD population that only qualify for
conventional chemotherapy."

Our work to date has resulted in the development of several technologies focused on improving the lives of
individuals with upper-limb loss (ULL). First, our Sense pattern recognition control system (and associated
Element low-profile surface EMG electrodes and FlexCell flexible lithium-polymer batteries) can interface with
most myoelectric hands, wrists, and elbows on the market. Second, our MyoTrain virtual-limb pre-prosthetic
training system has been demonstrated to help individuals with ULL learn to use pattern recognition. This system
is valuable in the “golden window” time period after amputation but before it is feasible to fit the patient with a
definitive prosthesis.
Based on our clinical experience, we identified three ways in which we could deepen our clinical impact,
particularly as related to the MyoTrain system. First, we noted that EMG classification accuracy could be
improved by decreasing intra-class scatter (improving repeatability) and/or increasing inter-class separation
(improving separability). How individuals incorporate these methods is user specific and they could benefit from
the incorporation of visual feedback – something that we call “Active Coaching”. Second, our business model
allows us to provide MyoTrain to the patient before reimbursement is available, which offers significant clinical
advantage. However, this currently still requires the prosthetist to fabricate a check socket for use with
each individual. We now propose to integrate a reusable wireless armband which would eliminate this issue.
Third, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of MyoTrain with a prospective trial of our technology suite and
associated clinical methodology. Specifically, we will test three hypotheses: 1) use of MyoTrain results in
skills transference to control of the final prosthesis; 2) the virtual outcome measures in MyoTrain are
correlated with real-world functional outcome measures; and 3) use of MyoTrain results in improved clinical
outcomes as measured by functional, subjective and usage metrics. The capstone of this project is the
submission of a 510(k) premarket notification application for the MyoTrain system."

The basic mechanisms underlying comprehension of spoken language are still largely unknown. Over the past
decade, we have gained new insights to how the human brain extracts the most fundamental linguistic
elements (consonants and vowels) from a complex and highly variable acoustic signal. However, the next set
of questions await pertaining to the sequencing of those auditory elements and how they are integrated with
other features, such as, the amplitude envelope of speech. Further investigation of the cortical representation
of speech sounds can likely shed light on these fundamental questions. Previous research has implicated the
superior temporal cortex in the processing of speech sounds, but little is known about how these sounds are
linked together into the perceptual experience of words and continuous speech. The recording of neural activity
directly from the cortical surface is a promising approach to study this since it can provide both high spatial and
temporal resolution. This proposal seeks to examine the mechanisms of phonetic encoding by utilizing
neurophysiological recordings obtained during neurosurgical procedures. High-density electrode arrays and
advanced signal processing will be utilized to unravel both local and population encoding of speech sounds in
the lateral temporal cortex. The overall goal is to determine how the brain extracts linguistic elements from a
complex acoustic speech signal towards better understanding and remediating human language disorders."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that severely hinders quality of life. It is
the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, and disproportionately affects women. Not only are women more
likely to be diagnosed with AD, but when they are, they show steeper rates of episodic memory decline, the
hallmark clinical symptom of AD. Studies using animals have provided strong evidence that γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) plays a critical role in episodic memory by regulating neuronal activity in the hippocampus –a
brain area that undergoes morphologic and functional changes in aging and AD. Experimentally induced
estrogen depletion, again in studies in animals, results in reductions in GABA. Furthermore, it has been shown
that apolipoprotein ε4 –the strongest common genetic risk factor for AD– is particularly detrimental in females,
and exacerbates dysfunction of the GABAergic system. This proposal extends these findings to test a sex-
specific, biologically-based GABAergic model of neural and episodic memory impairments in humans. By
capitalizing upon recent technical advancements in brain imaging and sex steroid hormone assay techniques,
this project will directly test whether hippocampal GABA concentration impacts brain activity and episodic
memory in a community-dwelling sample of middle-aged and older adults at risk for developing AD. Further,
this project will be the first of its kind to focus on the consequences of the decreases in estrogen
accompanying menopause in human females for the GABAergic cascade. The results of this project will have
important implications for our understanding of the neurobiological basis of AD and its cognitive symptoms,
and may, in turn, spark new therapeutic targets of intervention."
10914303,"This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will facilitate my transition to an independent scientist who conducts
innovative research on mechanisms and pathways of developmental and cognitive risk outcomes in Down syndrome (DS).
Down syndrome is the most common childhood genetic disorder and characterized by substantial phenotypic impairments
across several areas of development, including motor, attention, communication, and cognition. There has been virtually
no investigation, however, into the developmental pathways of early phenotypic impairments in motor or attention, or
their role as determinants for impaired cognitive or communication outcomes in DS. Motor and attention are key
developmental domains effortlessly coordinated to support communication and cognitive learning in typical development.
Delayed achievement of key motor milestones in DS – postural control in particular – has serious implications for the
development of infant attention, as well as for outcomes related to communicative and cognitive functioning through
compromised learning opportunities. Therefore, I propose to investigate the dynamic influence between postural control
and attention in infants with DS and determine their mutual or distinct role in impaired communication and cognitive
outcomes at 24-months in DS. I will characterize the behavioral and physiological features of postural control and
attention by quantifying the kinematics of postural variability and defining heart-rate phases of attention. I will examine
the dynamics of how these features influence one another during discrete learning opportunities, and also across
development to inform their role as determinants on communication and cognitive risk outcomes in DS. Examining the
biobehavioral concordance between these constructs is an innovative, precise, and multi-method approach that can yield
better insight into the developmental complexity in DS. This will be accomplished across three complementary studies
that will provide advanced training and employ cutting-edge methodology. Training initiatives will be accomplished
across two studies implemented during the mentored K99 phase, and then systematically applied to a longitudinal study
during the independent R00 phase. The specific aims across these studies are: 1) Identify differences in physiological and
behavioral facets of attention at 12-months and their role in communication and cognitive skill outcomes at 24-months as
a function of postural control in infants with DS (K99 phase); 2) Determine the concordance across biobehavioral facets
of attention and the reciprocal association between biobehavioral attention and postural control at 9, 12, and 18-months in
infants with DS (K99/R00 phase); and 3) Characterize the biobehavioral pathways and developmental dynamics of
attention and postural control across 9, 12, and 18-months and test whether these domains have a shared or unique
influence on communication or cognitive skill outcomes at 24-months in DS (R00 phase). This novel and multi-method
biobehavioral approach will shed light on the pathogenesis of impaired motor and attention in DS. Further, findings will
contribute to advanced phenotyping approaches of infant development in DS and serve as an initial step in the
development of targeted interventions. My team of incredibly strong mentors and one collaborator is uniquely poised to
assist and promote my training and research goals, and to ensure my successful transition to an independent scientist."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia (AD/ADRD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disorder. Most
current studies focus on drug interventions for AD/ADRD and currently none of pharmacological intervention (PI)
discovery research has been translated into effective treatments. However, increasing evidence demonstrates
that non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as sleep, diet, dietary supplements, aerobic exercise,
aromatherapy, light therapy, cognitive training, are potentially modifiable and thus offer alternative opportunities
for AD/ADRD prevention. Thus, the objective of this project is to develop translational informatics approaches to
aggregate, standardize and discover the effects of drug and NPI candidates on AD/ADRD using multi-modal
data resources (i.e., biomedical literature, EHR, clinical trials) followed by animal model validation. To achieve
our goal, we propose the following aims: 1) constructing a comprehensive Pharmacological And Non-
Pharmacological Interventions for Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (PANIA-KG) from biomedical literature
and other knowledge bases; 2) detecting, understanding, and visualization of drug repurposing signals of PIs,
NPIs, and their synergistical effects for AD/ADRD using the PANIA-KG; 3) re-ranking and validating individual
and synergistical drug repurposing signals using multimodal data sources and animal models. The successful
completion of this project will deliver a comprehensive NPI knowledge graph, novel informatics approaches,
ranked list of drug and NPI candidates, and validated synergistic intervention using multi-modal data sources.
The generated approaches, PANIA-KG and ranked lists can further our clinical investigations and clinical trial
design which focuses on synergistic effects of drug and NPIs for AD/ADRD."

 Locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction and degeneration occurs early in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). LC
degeneration also occurs early in other AD-related neurogenerative disorders, including Down Syndrome (DS)
and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Substantial evidence links LC degeneration in these conditions with clinically
meaningful measures of disease progression. While studies support mitochondrial and metabolic mechanisms
causing LC vulnerability in AD and related neurodegenerative disease, the mechanisms are poorly understood.
My laboratory has new, unique data demonstrating early and selective LC degeneration in a mouse mutant for
the mitochondrial enzyme Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase 2 (GPT2). While several mouse models for AD,
DS and PD show LC dysfunction and degeneration, strikingly, the Gpt2-null mouse shows the earliest LC
degeneration (by postnatal day 18) of any mouse mutant thus far described. Importantly, recent data also
support a link between GPT2-mediated metabolism and AD. Therefore, the study of GPT2-mediated
mechanisms in LC health and degeneration provides an important opportunity to understand mechanisms of
early LC vulnerability with broad significance to AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. The overriding
objective of this R01 application is to define early metabolic mechanisms of LC vulnerability in Gpt2-null mice,
and also in AD and DS mouse models, across the lifespan, including in gene-by-environment (GXE)
experiments using an extended wakefulness paradigm. Our central hypothesis is that the vulnerable LC –
across neurodegeneration mouse models – will exhibit signatures of defective metabolic mechanisms that will
be apparent early, prior to LC neuronal death. In Aim 1, we will define the transcriptomic and metabolomic
signatures of vulnerable LC neurons in the Gpt2-null mouse and in AD and DS mouse models, preceding and
during neuronal death. In Aim 2, we will determine the cell-type specific requirements for Gpt2 in LC through
conditional mutagenesis of Gpt2 in LC noradrenergic neurons or in glia. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define the
extent to which Gpt2 mutation (in the Gpt2 heterozygote, Gpt2+/-) enhances LC vulnerability in adult brain,
using provocations such as an extended wakefulness paradigm, or mating the Gpt2+/- mutation to AD mouse
models. Sleep is an important brain function regulated by LC that has been implicated in disease progression
in AD. In our preliminary data, we observe accelerated LC degeneration in adult Gpt2+/- mutant brain after
provocation using an extended-wakefulness paradigm. Overall, the research in this R01 application will have a
sustained impact because our finding of early LC neurodegeneration in the Gpt2-null mouse represents an
important opportunity to advance our understanding of the early metabolic mechanisms of vulnerability in LC
neurons. Because metabolite supplements that augment these GPT2-mediated mechanisms are available, this
research may lead to important new strategies for preventative treatments for LC degeneration in AD/ADRD."

Title project: “Mechanisms of vasomotion-mediated perivascular clearance in cerebral amyloid angiopathy”
The blood vessels in the brain play an important role in facilitating clearance of metabolic waste products.
Impaired perivascular clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cerebral
amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer’s disease. However, fundamental unknows including the
directionality and major driving forces of perivascular clearance remain, which has hampered the development
of therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting the perivascular waste clearance system. Moreover, experimental
observations in mice have remain largely unexplored in the human brain. Prior work from the applicant
uncovered a role for vasomotion – slow spontaneous oscillations of arterioles generated by vascular smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) – as a major driving force for perivascular clearance. This project will further zoom in on
vasomotion and test the novel hypothesis that targeting vascular SMCs may provide an attractive approach to
enhance vasomotion and thereby facilitate perivascular Aβ clearance. This project will use CAA as a model
disease to test this hypothesis, as CAA is characterized by the gradual deposition of vascular Aβ, impaired
perivascular clearance, SMC degeneration, and vascular dysfunction. The aims of this project are to further
unravel the physiological basis of vasomotion-mediated perivascular clearance, to determine the effect of
vascular Aβ accumulation on vasomotion and clearance, to explore the potential of enhancing low frequency
arteriolar oscillations as an intervention strategy to successfully clear Aβ from the brain, and to measure the
coupling between low frequency hemodynamics and fluid flow in the human brain. We will use a translational
approach, utilizing optical imaging techniques in awake mice coupled with direct optogenetic stimulation of
vascular SMCs, as well as fast functional MRI in human individuals with and without CAA. Successful
completion of these aims will improve our understanding of the physiological basis of vasomotion-mediated
perivascular clearance and provide much needed proof-of-concept data to support the potential of modulating
low frequency arteriolar oscillations as an early intervention strategy to promote Aβ clearance from the brain."
10893983,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Perturbations in protein quality control have been implicated in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases,
which are typically characterized by the accumulation of aggregated proteins such as a-synuclein. Recent
studies have shown that ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2), a ubiquitin-dependent protein quality control protein, co-localizes
with protein aggregates in major causes of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), including Lewy
body dementia and Parkinson’s disease, among others. The interaction between UBQLN2 and disease
aggregates implicates UBQLN2 as a potential factor in these disorders. UBQLN2 contains N-terminal ubiquitin-
like (UBL) and C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains that allow UBQLN2 to shuttle ubiquitinated
substrates to the proteasome for degradation. UBQLN2 may also target proteins for degradation by autophagy,
although this is not as well established in the literature. This proposal will build on recent models and reagents
developed in our laboratory to explore the role of UBQLN2 in synucleinopathies. Several studies have shown
that UBQLN2 co-localizes with a-synuclein aggregates in disease, but it is unknown whether UBQLN2 normally
plays a role in handling a-synuclein or the other prominent proteins underlying ADRD. Preliminary studies have
shown that UBQLN2 overexpression markedly reduces
a-synuclein levels, while UBQLN2 knockdown increases
a-synuclein levels. This proposal will define the role of UBQLN2 in clearing
a-synuclein, both normally and in
disease states. To accomplish this goal, I will use mouse models to investigate the role of UBQLN2 in clearing
a-synuclein in vivo and determine if UBQLN2-mediated clearance ameliorates a-synuclein pathology. I will also
use cellular models to investigate the mechanism by which UBQLN2 regulates a-synuclein, making use of
domain deletion mutants to investigate the role of ubiquitin, chaperone, and proteasome binding domains on
UBQLN2 in mediating the clearance of a-synuclein. The proposed studies will lead to a better understanding of
the role of protein quality control pathways in neurodegenerative disease and may reveal novel therapeutic
targets for age-related dementias. This work will also be foundational to my continued graduate and postdoctoral
training as I prepare for a career as an independent scientist."

 An estimated 15% of U.S. adults are estimated to have chronic kidney disease (CKD), with cardiovascular
disease (CVD) the greatest cause of death in this population. Metabolic acidosis is common in CKD, and has
deleterious effects on both the kidney and the heart. Complicating our understanding and limiting our ability to
prevent these effects are gaps in our knowledge of the integrated cardiorenal response to acidosis, which is
largely influenced by cellular level acid-base transporters. The Na+/HCO3- co-transporter (NBCe1-B) is one such
transporter. There is accumulating evidence that NBCe1-B is involved in the renal response to acidosis and the
pathophysiologic development of cardiac hypertrophy, but the consequence of NBCe1-B loss on these systems
has never been tested at the whole animal level. The goal of this project is to determine the role of NBCe1-B in
the kidney and heart by comparing the renal and cardiac phenotypes of wild-type (WT) and NBCe1-B knockout
(KO) mice. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that NBCe1-B is essential for renal (Aim 1) and
cardiac (Aim 2) acid-base handling. The purpose of Aim 1 is to determine the abundance, distribution, and
function of NBCe1-B in the WT mouse kidney during acid-challenged conditions. This work will include a series
of western-blot and fluorescent immunohistochemistry experiments as well as a comparison of renal acid-base
handling during acidosis in WT and NBCe1-B KO mice as assessed by blood-gas parameters, ammonia
excretion, and titratable acid excretion. The purpose of Aim 2 is to determine the exact type and mechanism of
cardiac impairment in NBCe1-B-KO mice. The mice will receive a cardiac work-up similar to patients with heart-
failure, incorporating electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and left-ventricular pressure catheterization
measurements. Cellular level investigation of cardiomyocytes will include histological analysis, molecular
assessment for evidence of pro-hypertrophic mechanisms using Western blot and RT-qPCR, and evaluation of
Ca2+ handling in isolated cardiomyocytes using Ca2+ sensitive microscopy. The experiments outlined in this
proposal will determine the role of NBCe1-B in the renal and cardiac systems, providing insights into the
cardiorenal response to acidosis. This work will take place at the University at Buffalo, Jacobs School of Medicine
and Biomedical Sciences (JSMBS), in the laboratory of Dr. Mark Parker, who is an expert in ion transport and
pH regulation. The training plan is tailored for development as a physician-scientist in the field of nephrology,
and will include clinical preceptorships in nephrology and cardiology in order to gain cross-disciplinary
experience, reflecting the research goals of this proposal. These longitudinal clinical preceptorships will be with
successful physician-scientists, who will also be directly involved in the proposed research, thereby providing
integrated mentorship over the course of the fellowship."

Overview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop new
materials, methods, and measurement devices for biomanufacturing, biotherapeutics, and biosensors. We
have active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding, enzymatic activity, and cell membrane
disruption, 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extract
and genetic template improvements), 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPS
products, interrogated by nanosensors, 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machine
learning and deep learning methods), 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuits,
and 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing, wound healing, and water quality. The overall
vision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products
(cells and proteins) for applications in therapies, advanced materials, and bio-electronics. Protein based
therapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent years,
the design, build, and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically using
techniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However, these mutagenic approaches
have a few limitations, namely: 1) they require a suitable, naturally occurring sequence as a starting point, 2)
they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature, and 3) they operate as a `black box', meaning that
generalizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of this
MIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discovery
of protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integrate
the system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis to
rapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then be
characterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors, to test for desired features such as stability,
binding affinity, selectivity, hydrolytic activity, and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeled
data set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network to
self-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network are
found, the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized, tested, etc. such that the
design loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in faster
development of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing, natural
sequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential for
reduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translate
this technology, via NIH SBIR funding, such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies."

10898725,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by visceral pain and dysmotility.
IBS causes substantial morbidity in children and adults and current therapy is inadequate. Serotonin (5-HT)
signaling plays roles in pain and motility, but the efficacy of modifying 5-HT signaling to treat IBS is limited and
fraught with adverse effects. A greater understanding of how enteric 5-HT contributes to IBS pathophysiology
may therefore provide for novel and effective treatments for the condition. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the
gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium produce most of the 5-HT in the gut, which is thought to stimulate extrinsic primary
afferent neuron (ExPAN) and intrinsic primary afferent neuron (IPAN) terminals to promote sensory and motor
signaling, respectively. The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), present throughout epithelial cells, rapidly
inactivates 5-HT. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit SERT and thus increase 5-HT availability
for IPAN and ExPAN stimulation. Despite their use for pediatric IBS, SSRIs are often ineffective and plagued by
adverse GI effects, which may be due to their effects at sites other than the GI epithelium. My prior and
preliminary data strongly suggest that epithelial-restricted 5-HT modulation may limit unwanted effects and thus
improve therapy. My data also show a novel visceral pain mechanism involving SERT regulation of mucosal 5-
HT. In the current proposal, I will investigate the effects of epithelial 5-HT on GI motility and visceral nociception
using optogenetic tools that induce or inhibit EC cell secretion, mouse lines that either lack mucosal 5-HT or
SERT, and pharmacological interventions that alter mucosal 5-HT signaling. The proposed research strategy
will allow me to test the hypotheses that 1) 5-HT released from EC cells and 2) SERT-mediated regulation of
mucosal 5-HT availability modulate visceral nociception and GI motility."

Every year, approximately 550,000 Americans are diagnosed with heart failure. Half of these
patients die within 5 years of diagnosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that a post translational
modification of proteins, O-GlcNAcylation (OGN), plays a key role in the response of the heart to
stress, regulating both health and disease. I discovered chronic exposure to increased OGN
causes heart failure, whereas decreased OGN can protect the heart. However, we lack detailed
understanding of how OGN contributes to heart health and disease. This gap in knowledge
hinders the development of O-GlcNAc-targeted therapies to prevent heart failure.
OGN occurs on thousands of proteins in the heart and is regulated by only two enzymes, OGT
(adds modification) and OGA (removes modification). Myocardial OGN is increased in failing
hearts, but it was unknown if increased OGN was a cause of heart failure. To answer this question, I
developed a novel line of transgenic mice overexpressing either OGT, or OGA, in myocardium. OGT
hearts have more OGN and these mice have myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure and die
prematurely from arrhythmias. In contrast, OGA animals had less OGN and were protected
against cardiac stress. My new findings support a role for the Yes Associated Protein (YAP) in
causing myocardial hypertrophy in response to excess OGN. The short-term goal of this
proposal is to execute complementary research and career development plans to address these
gaps in knowledge and position myself as a cardiac O-GlcNAc expert. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to use the knowledge gained to facilitate the development of O-GlcNAc targeted
therapies for heart failure. Here, I propose to test the specific hypothesis that excess OGN
activates YAP and modulates adverse cardiac remodeling through enhanced transcription of pro-
hypertrophic genes.
The 5-year career development plan proposed here will provide me formal training in four crucial
areas: (1) Advanced techniques in glycobiology; (2) advanced training in protein mass
spectrometry; (3) proficiency in protein bioinformatics; (4) enhanced grant writing and leadership
skills. At the conclusion of this award period, I will have acquired the skills and training necessary to
become a leader in the area of cardiac O-GlcNAc biology, an under-explored area of scientific
investigation that shows great promise for translation into novel therapies."

The “big picture” of this proposal is that using our newfound ability to build big synthetic DNAs (1 Mb scale) at
will and with great efficiency and precision, we propose a new paradigm for “systems genetics” of gene
regulation in the context of a unique master developmental regulator, the HoxA cluster. We use yeast to make
hundreds of mammalian gene loci variants rapidly, with high precision and cos-effective. Leveraging this
technology, we have already assembled and deliver 134kb and 170 kb long constructs containing the entire rat
HoxA cluster, as well as the mouse counterparts. We can deliver precision-engineered large HoxA constructs
to either an ectopic location at the Hprt1 locus, and working on delivering to the allelic location as well. Using
these powerful new tools, we describe how we can deliver the rat and mouse HoxA clusters to Hprt1 in mouse
ES cells. Using the heterologous rat HoxA clusters allows us to internally compare the Hox loci from both
species in the same cell using a range of chromatin “omics-based” readouts. The HoxA cluster is extremely
highly conserved at the DNA level; we will take advantage of the rat HoxA, since it is a rodent gene it is likely to
complement function in the mouse, but is densely carpeted with genomic variants (one per 10 bp on average
across HoxA). These experiments will be done in a data-rich system using in vitro differentiation of mES cells
to motor neurons. These experiments can be done in the context of already generated HoxA+/+, +/–, or –/– ES
cells. The aims include asking the question Do Hox clusters require their genomic context containing long-
distance regulatory elements for the establishment of chromatin boundaries and initial gene expression? (Aim
1), attempting functional complementation with our ectopic synthetic loci in HoA-/- knockout background (Aim
2) and asking Is it possible to establish novel regulatory domains within Hox clusters? (Aim 3)."

Where there is life, there is death. Death can occur due to a variety of factors, such as lack of resources,
disease, predation, and old age. Thus, animals may frequently encounter the dead of their own kind
(conspecifics). Although death is a common occurrence, how animals sense and respond to dead conspecifics
remains curiously unexplored. By examining how fruit flies, Drosophila, sense and respond to dead
conspecifics, this proposal seeks to elucidate fundamental questions about death. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to characterize adult Drosophila’s egg-laying (oviposition) responses to dead
conspecifics, and discern the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. While death is often viewed as an
aversive state, this proposal uniquely studies contexts in which death has a positive valence, thus
generating entirely new findings, as well as re-contextualizing previous work. Accordingly, this line of
inquiry builds on a robust foundation, in which preliminary results indicate that: (i) in a binary oviposition assay,
adult Drosophila preferentially lay eggs on the side with (versus on the side without) dead bodies and (ii)
olfaction may play a critical role in these dead body preferences. Taking advantage of our laboratory’s
expertise in and access to specialized chemosensory techniques, genetic tools, electrophysiology, and
spectroscopy, as well as technical innovations I have developed, this proposal systematically, rigorously,
and uniquely investigates how Drosophila respond to dead conspecifics."

Inflammation, dysregulated innate immune responses, and loss of barrier function underlie several skin
conditions including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pachyonychia congenita.
Compelling evidence now shows that signals regulating inflammation and innate immunity are produced and
secreted by stressed keratinocytes making up the skin epidermis. How the relevant signals are generated in
keratinocytes, their cellular targets, and the pathways involved in ensuring proper regulation of inflammation
and innate immunity in healthy skin tissue, and their dysregulation in disease, remain poorly understood.
This multi-PI proposal takes advantage of the complementary expertise of two established investigators and
is supported by a strong body of unpublished findings, obtained collaboratively, showing that (i) keratinocyte-
derived and keratin-dependent signals regulate the spatial and temporal pattern of neutrophil influx into skin
undergoing sterile inflammation; (ii) keratinocytes transiently adapt to prior exposures and are able to amplify
responses in the setting of repeated aggressions; (iii) the stress response keratin 17 (K17) acts as a positive
regulator of neutrophil infiltration by mediating the sustained activity of protein kinase C a (PKCa) in
activated keratinocytes; and (iv) keratin 16 (K16) - another stress response keratin – acts as a negative
regulator of neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. We hypothesize that stressed keratinocyte-derived
signals engage and regulate cellular effector of innate immunity in skin, and that this is highly relevant to
several inflammatory skin disorders. We further hypothesize that K16 and K17 act through unique cis-acting
determinants to differentially regulate PKCa activity, neutrophil infiltration and other aspects of innate
immunity in stressed skin tissue. The proposal tests these hypotheses through three specific aims. Aim 1
seeks to compare the spatiotemporal pattern of immune cell infiltration and PKCa activity in mouse skin null
for either keratin 16 or 17 following exposure to stressors. These animals studies will be corroborated by
studies in N-TERT human keratinocytes in culture. Aim 2 seeks to identify, in cell culture models, the cis-
acting determinants responsible for the differential impact of K16 and K17 protein on PKCa activity,
neutrophil stimulation and other cellular aspects of inflammation and innate immunity. Finally, Aim 3 will
define the contribution of other key cellular effectors of innate immunity, specifically macrophages, in
mediating the keratinocyte- and keratin-dependent amplification of neutrophil influx in stressed skin in vivo.
The mechanistic insight that we stand to gain from completing this project is predicted to lead to a deeper
understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic skin inflammatory disorders, yield novel and more reliable
biomarkers and, possibly, new strategies to treat skin diseases."

The discovery of antibiotics greatly decreased the public health burden associated with bacterial infections;
however, antibiotics also disrupt the beneficial microbiome. An added challenge is that the efficacy of
treatments is often not what is seen in the laboratory setting in part due to the fact bacteria live in mixed
microbial populations. While some mechanisms of community protection have been well studied such as
degradation or sequestration of the antibiotic, significantly less effort has gone into understanding the ways
that physiological changes protect the cells. Efforts to study mixed microbial systems often use synthetic
communities where interactions are dominated by nutrient competition and stress response pathways. To
address these issues, our laboratory uses a naturally formed community of lactic acid bacteria and Acetobacter
that is highly reproducible form natural environments and displays coevolved properties. Recently we have
shown that the beneficial microbe Lactiplantibacillus plantarum has a difference in antibiotic sensitivities when
grown in a mixed microbial community with Acetobacter species compared to when it is grown as an isolated
strain. Previous work has focused on how these microbes engage in cross feeding; however little work has
gone into understanding how non-nutritional cues might affect cellular physiology. My research aims to close
this gap by understanding how L. plantarum and Acetoabcter coordinate growth to modify physiology
and sensitivity to antibiotics. Leveraging the chemically defined media I co-created, I have recapitulated this
antibiotic sensitivity change with the addition of the small molecule acetate which is produced by Acetobacter.
Additionally, I have seen that acetate stimulates the growth of L. plantarum. This work led me to identify a
mutant of L. plantarum that can grow fast without the stimulation of acetate. Through a combination of genetic,
metabolomic, and microscopic approaches I will identify the underlying molecular mechanism of the
phenotype. This project will identify how a cross-phylum signals affect cellular physiology which may have
implications across bacterial species to understanding how antibiotic sensitives are modulated by mixed
microbial communities."

 Modernization has been accompanied by a marked rise in disorders of allergic inflammation. These
diseases are frequently borne by epithelial barrier tissues such as the skin, lung, and gut, which provide essential
protection against the inflammatory stresses of the outside world. An emerging hallmark of barrier inflammation
is the ability of these tissues to durably adapt to prior experiences, enhancing future responses against a broad
range of stressors. The Fuchs Lab and others have revealed that long-lived epithelial stem cells (EpSCs), which
replenish and repair their tissues throughout life, are key proprietors of these barrier adaptations in the context
of type 17 inflammation, generally associated with extracellular pathogen responses. Conversely, how EpSCs
adapt to allergic “type 2” inflammatory exposures remains a poorly understood and urgent unmet health need.
 To address this critical problem, I seek to use the prevalent epithelial alarmin thymic stromal
lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a driver to uncover how type 2 skin inflammation impacts the long-term functional
responsiveness and epigenetic state of EpSCs. My preliminary work reveals that transient TSLP-driven type 2
skin inflammation endows resident EpSCs with long-term increased stemness in vitro, and that inflammation-
experienced skin retains a concurrently heightened ability to heal wounds in vivo. Surprisingly, I discovered that
this lasting hyperresponsiveness extends beyond localized sites of inflammation, as even distal EpSCs and skin
maintain comparably enhanced stemness and wound repair upon resolution, despite having never seen
pathologically evident inflammation. With these data in hand, I will define the specific cell-intrinsic mechanisms
that distinguish TSLP-driven inflammatory memory in both local and systemic contexts, and will interrogate the
niche signaling that acts on EpSCs to establish cellular and tissue-level hyperresponsiveness in each. Lastly,
given that my findings thus far could help explain the puzzling frequent interlinking of atopic inflammation in the
skin and airway, I will determine whether TSLP-driven skin inflammation may have parallel cross-tissue effects,
and alter the long-term functionality and epigenetic state of airway EpSCs. If successful, my findings will reveal
important new insights into how allergic inflammation can shape long-term, organism-wide fitness beyond
antigen-specific immune sensitization and memory, and add a molecular explanation for long-standing human
pathologies that could advance treatment strategies."

The development and function of hair cell stereocilia in the cochlea are essential for our sense of hearing, as
they play a pivotal role in detecting sound through their mechanosensory capabilities. Stereocilia, organized into
rows of graded height on the hair cell surface, are susceptible to damage caused by loud sounds and the aging
process, leading to irreversible hearing loss. The architecture of stereocilia is critical for detecting sound and is
regulated by a structural protein called actin that forms a rigid scaffold of filaments within these structures. My
overarching goal is to understand the regulatory mechanisms that govern actin filament growth and ensure the
correct development of stereocilia. In this proposal, I explore the function of the molecular motor protein myosin
15 (MYO15A) that controls actin filament assembly and stereocilia size. Mutations in MYO15A cause human
hereditary hearing loss, DFNB3, underlying the essential activity of this protein in the cochlea. The central focus
of my proposal is to discover how MYO15A and its associated proteins, known as the 'elongation complex' (EC),
can control actin polymerization and stimulate stereocilia growth. My preliminary data along with the published
work of others, have revealed a unique ability of MYO15A and EC proteins to form biomolecular condensate that
are hypothesized to form the stereocilia tip density that controls actin filament elongation. The properties of these
MYO15A-EC condensates are poorly understood, but highly relevant to stereocilia biology. In this proposal, I will
conduct a comprehensive characterization of the biophysical properties of MYO15A-EC tip density condensates
and explore their potential as reaction compartments optimized for actin filament growth. In Aim 1, I will measure
the material properties and microrheology of purified MYO15A-EC tip density condensates, revealing their
structural makeup. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that MYO15A-EC tip-density condensates can potentiate
actin filament growth. This work will utilize cutting-edge experimental approaches including optical trapping force
spectroscopy and single-molecule microscopy techniques. The results from these experiments will reveal the
fundamental properties of MYO15A-EC tip density condensates and advance our understanding of how
stereocilia are built and maintained. Completion of this project will advance my long-term goal of manipulating
stereocilia biology therapeutically to treat hearing loss in patients."

Despite the critical role of sleep in brain development during infancy, little is known about the impact of early
sleep disturbance in typical and atypical development. Sleep disruption occurs in up to 80% of children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A complete understanding of sleep problems in the first year of life will aid in
both the early detection of risk and prompt intervention prior to the onset of symptoms. This project will improve
our knowledge of sleep in infancy by longitudinally examining how distinct sleep metrics, such as sleep latency,
sleep time, and sleep efficiency, relate to functional brain networks and later developmental trajectories.
The proposed study will leverage data from two NIH-funded longitudinal studies to (i) examine how sleep latency
and thalamocortical connectivity may predict diagnostic outcome in infants at varying familial likelihood for ASD
(Aim 1) and (ii) investigate normative trajectories of objectively measured sleep and thalamocortical connectivity
in an unprecedented sample of infants (Aim 2). About 20% of infant siblings of children with ASD will be
diagnosed with ASD themselves, while another 30% will show subclinical ASD symptoms. Thus, studying infant
siblings provides a unique opportunity to examine early ASD markers. Prior work has shown altered functional
networks in infants who later receive a clinical diagnosis. This provides insight into the divergence of
neurodevelopment in these infants, yet the impact of early sleep disturbance on brain networks has yet to be
elucidated. Here, resting-state fMRI and behavioral data from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) will be used
to analyze the relationship between sleep, functional connectivity, and ASD outcome. Ultimately, a greater
understanding of sleep in typical development is needed to properly delineate it in neurodevelopmental
disorders. However, there is a paucity of well-sampled, longitudinal studies characterizing typical brain
development in infancy and no study has implemented objective sleep measures in a large population of infants.
The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) study is an ongoing longitudinal project that collects
neuroimaging, behavioral, and objective sleep measures from a cohort of ~7,500 infants. In the proposed project,
resting-state fMRI data will be used to relate objective sleep metrics collected through actigraphy to functional
connectivity and clinically assessed behavioral outcomes.
Emily Chiem will conduct these studies as a UCLA graduate student in the Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative
Physiology program. She will receive guidance from her sponsor, who has vast expertise in neurodevelopment,
pediatric imaging, advanced MRI methods, and ASD research, as well as mentors with expertise in pediatric
sleep. The rich sleep and neuroimaging communities, training opportunities, and resources available at UCLA
makes it an ideal training environment. The fellowship support will allow the candidate to receive comprehensive
MRI training, learn advanced data-analytic approaches, improve her mentorship skills and, critically, it will afford
her protected time to focus on her own research thus propelling her independent research career."

The lateral septum (LS) is an inhibitory limbic brain structure long thought to be essential for threat processing
and defensive behavior. In part due to its anatomical and molecular heterogeneity, the precise means by which
the LS mediates these processes remains elusive. To this end, I have focused my graduate work on LS neurons
expressing the stress-related Corticotropin releasing hormone type II receptor (LS-Crhr2). CRH-family G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical for behavioral and physiological stress responses and are implicated in
mood and anxiety disorders, providing a direct link between this subset of LS neurons and a central stress
system. Moreover, LS-Crhr2 neurons are activated by innate threats, and its activity modulates concomitant
defensive responses, evokes physiological arousal, and elicits aversion. The overall goal of these studies is to
determine the molecular and functional organization of LS-Crhr2 neurons in threat processing. Threat
processing, however, is multifaceted and largely involves the ability to rapidly detect and evaluate sensory stimuli
as potential threats in order to respond with the appropriate behavioral defenses. To capture this complexity, I
use two-way signaled active avoidance, a behavioral paradigm in which mice learn to perform goal-directed
avoidance behaviors in response to punishment-predictive cues. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging,
optogenetics, and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, I have thus far established the following: 1) LS-Crhr2
population activity is required for executing learned avoidance; 2) LS-Crhr2 population activity dynamically codes
threat cues in a manner predicting defense decisions and upcoming action initiation; 3) LS-Crhr2 comprises of
ten functional subclasses (defined by calcium dynamics) specialized in distinct threat-related processes; and 4)
LS-Crhr2 comprises of ten molecular subclasses (defined by transcriptomics) with unique anatomical
organization. Building on these observations, the central goal of this study is to identify how these molecular LS-
Crhr2 subsets mediate specific threat-related processes and how they are dynamically recruited. In the following
aims, we will use viral-genetic strategies to monitor and manipulate the activity of these molecularly-defined
subclasses, which together comprise of roughly 84% of the total LS-Crhr2 population. Aim 1 will use
microendoscopic calcium imaging of single neurons to determine whether each molecular subclass maps to
functional LS-Crhr2 clusters whose neural activity dynamics resemble discrete threat-related processes during
active avoidance. Aim 2 will use optogenetics to directly inhibit the activity of each subset to test their role in
these distinct processes. The successful completion of these aims will capture how the molecular diversity of
LS-Crhr2 neurons maps to function, thereby providing a framework for understanding the role of LS in threat
processing and, more generally, for studying the role of discrete functional units of cells that express druggable
GPCRs of interest."
10906020,"Timbre, the quality that allows sounds to be distinguished when they are identical in pitch, level, and
duration, is a critical aspect of speech comprehension and music enjoyment. My proposal will fill a gap in neural
studies of timbre by testing the hypothesis that capture and off-CF inhibitory mechanisms lead to robust
representations of suprathreshold synthetic and natural-instrument timbre in the midbrain. To test my hypothesis,
I will record single-unit inferior colliculus (IC) responses from awake Dutch-belted rabbits. I will also develop a
new computational IC model based on these physiological responses.
 Spectral envelopes of harmonic sounds are correlated with the timbral perception of “brightness”. I
propose two mechanisms that contribute to spectral-envelope encoding: capture and off-characteristic frequency
(CF) inhibition. The first mechanism, capture, refers to the dominance of harmonics near spectral peaks over
auditory-nerve fibers tuned near the peaks. Capture is due to saturation of inner hair cells. Capture by a single
harmonic reduces the amplitude of low-frequency neural fluctuations in auditory-nerve fibers. Rates of IC
neurons are sensitive to low-frequency neural fluctuations as characterized by modulation transfer functions.
Ultimately, capture of auditory-nerve responses for fibers tuned near spectral peaks results in IC rate profiles
that encode spectral peaks. Preliminary results are partially consistent with spectral peaks of synthetic timbre
stimuli capturing peripheral responses, leading to a rate representation of salient spectral features in the
midbrain. However, another mechanism that could explain IC representations of timbre is off-CF inhibition, which
has been proposed to explain frequency-sweep sensitivity and psychophysical forward masking. A subcortical
computational model that features capture, but not off-CF inhibition, was able to predict preliminary responses
to synthetic timbre and narrowband tone-in-noise, but could not predict responses to wideband tone-in-noise or
natural timbre, indicating the need to update the model.
 I have developed experiments to test the hypothesis that timbre is robustly encoded in the midbrain via
capture and off-CF inhibition. Aim 1.1 will test the hypothesis that responses to wideband tone-in-noise are
strongly influenced by off-CF inhibition, and reducing the noise bandwidth increases the influence of capture. In
Aim 1.2 I will update a computational IC model by adding off-CF inhibition to test the hypothesis that capture and
off-CF inhibition are necessary to explain tone-in-noise stimuli. Aim 2.1 will test the hypothesis that the spectral
peak of a shaped harmonic complex, synthetic timbre, is robustly encoded in the IC over a range of
suprathreshold sound levels. Aim 2.2 bridges the gap between synthetic and natural timbre by recording
responses to real instrument sounds. Responses from Aim 2 will further test the new IC model. This project will
provide insight on the IC representation of suprathreshold timbre. This research will lead to novel strategies to
restore timbre perception in hearing aids and cochlear implants, which are not designed for timbre perception."

Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), an innate immune-driven inflammation response, is a major obstacle
limiting the success of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with end-stage liver disease and those
with tumors of hepatic origin. Although significant progress has been made in better appreciation of the liver
inflammatory cascade by IR-stress, much less is known about its resolution, which may affect not only the
severity of tissue injury itself but also, more importantly, the long-term outcomes. Recent studies document
striking cytoprotective functions of hrRLX (recombinant human relaxin-2) against IR-stress in mouse OLT models
via hepatocyte glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling; while polarizing macrophage activation via Notch1
promoted IRI-OLT resistance. These experimental findings, supported by a clinical evidence of enhanced
GR/Notch1 phenotype needed for IRI resistance in human OLT, prompted to propose that rhRLX may function
as a novel GR agonist and glucocorticoid (GC) mimetic in liver transplantation. Pilot studies also point to anti-
fibrotic functions of the cognate RXFP1 receptor, a GR-independent RLX-2 binding partner. As the conventional
murine OLT model offers a limited translational utility, this project will be dissecting GR – RXFP1 molecular
interplay in mice expressing human RXFP1 gene; as well as testing new concepts of RXFP1-driven hepatic
rejuvenation of discarded human livers during hypothermic machine preservation. A newly discovered divergent
role of GR–RXFP1 signaling axis in the “acute” and “resolution” phase of IRI-OLT inflammation, has prompted
to put forth a novel and heretofore untested overall hypothesis, that: 1/ pharmacological rhRLX-induced GR
enhancement will rescue OLT from acute IR-insult; while 2/ harnessing GR-independent rhRLX signaling via its
cognate receptor, RXFP1, will promote homeostatic/anti-fibrotic functions in the inflammation resolution phase.
Two interlocked aims explore this hypothesis:
Aim 1: Delineate molecular mechanisms of rhRLX – GR hepatocellular protection in OLT (acute IRI-inflammation
phase). Aim 1.1: Test hypothesis that hepatocellular Keap1-dependent Nrf2 signaling is indispensable for rhRLX
– GR axis to prevent DAMPs release and innate inflammation in cold-stored donor livers. Aim 1.2: Test
hypothesis that SIRT1 enhances GR-induced hepatocyte regenerative functions/autophagy in IR-stressed OLT.
Aim 2. Delineate molecular mechanisms of Notch1 / RXFP1 anti-fibrotic functions in OLT (IRI-inflammation
“resolution” phase). Aim 2.1: Test hypothesis that Notch1 (macrophage) – RXFP1 (T cell) cross-regulation is
essential in the resolution of IRI – OLT inflammation. Aim 2.2: Test hypothesis that the activation of human RLX
receptor exerts anti-fibrotic functions in the resolution of IRI-OLT inflammation in humanized RXFP1 “knockin”
mouse system. Aim 2.3: Test hypothesis that activation of RXFP1 receptor during hypothermic machine
preservation attenuates inflammation and rejuvenates discarded human donor livers."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an incurable autoimmune disease manifested through the immune destruction of islet
beta cells. This proposal describes a unique CAR T cell approach to eliminate islet-autoreactive T cells, thus
eliminating the source of the autoimmunity and providing a highly specific treatment for T1D. We will leverage
our recently developed split CAR system with a chimeric antigen ligand (CAL) adaptor consisting of a pMHC
multimer fused to a recruitment molecule. The addition of CAL will bind to the autoreactive TCR and recruit the
universal CAR T cells to kill autoreactive T1D specific T cells. The proposed experiments will test the hypoth-
eses that (1) our modular CAR/CAL systems are uniquely suited for specifically targeting multiple auto-
reactive TCRs, and (2) that we can identify novel epitopes against T1D specific TCRs to be paired with
the CAR/CAL system. Importantly, preliminary data support these hypotheses, and well-characterized clinical
specimens from T1D patients and rigorous experimental designs are established in this proposal with essential
cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise that encompass synthetic biology, large-scale epitope discovery,
T1D immunology, and humanized T1D animal modeling. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are as
follows: Aim 1 establish and optimize the CAL system against antigen-specific human TCRs, Aim 2 characterize
the autoreactivity of TCRs from T1D patients/donors and identify peptide-MHC against these TCRs, and Aim 3
evaluate the performance of the CAL system in humanized T1D animal models. Outcomes from this work will
establish the clinical potential of the CAR/CAL system as a safe, effective, and potentially curative T1D treatment."
10894845,"Cross-species transmission of pathogens is a major threat to public health worldwide and
accounts for 75% of emerging human infectious diseases. Bats act as asymptomatic reservoir
hosts for numerous zoonotic viruses, that are lethal in humans and for which no vaccines or
specific therapeutics exist, indicating that the chiropteran immune system can control these
viruses. Although there has been a recent growing interest in the peculiarities of bat innate
immunity, their humoral immune response remains unexplored at the molecular level despite its
known participation to fighting off pathogens. Previous studies revealed unusually fast bat B cell
proliferation, compared to other mammals, and an exceptional immunoglobulin combinatorial
diversity, suggesting a possible way these mammals successfully cope with an astounding
diversity of viruses. We propose that the long co-evolution of bats with viruses could have led to
the presence of highly specific immunoglobulin variable heavy chain segments playing a role in
successfully controlling pathogens and that bat antibodies represent an untapped source of viral
inhibitors. The proposed project will illuminate the role of bat humoral immunity in controlling
pathogen infections, identify novel therapeutics against zoonotic viruses and guide the
computational design of next-generation protein inhibitors of viral entry. This work will generate
tools to combat emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses, including some pathogens that have
not yet emerged or been discovered, and will be key to assist pandemic preparedness effort."

HIV remains the most consequential zoonosis of the last century, with 36 million fatalities and another 37 million
infected. Even today, almost 2,000 people per day die of HIV/AIDS globally. Medications are reducing the effects
of HIV on the human body and transmission of the virus to others. However, 40 years into the pandemic, there
are no vaccines. Effective HIV vaccines remain our only hope of ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic once and for
all. HIV vaccines are mostly developed in macaque monkeys, although this primate model of HIV infection has
many limitations. Here, we explore a new animal model for HIV infection that recapitulates all key milestones in
HIV acute infection and in the establishment of the latent viral reservoir. We develop the tools necessary to turn
this into the long-sought model for HIV vaccine development. This new animal model will provide the perfect
system to study the immune correlates of protection, the breadth of cross-protection against different HIV-1
subtypes, and to test and develop vaccine candidates."

With age and exposure to genotoxic stress, tissues throughout the body acquire somatic mutations. In the blood
and bone marrow, somatic mutations are frequently found in leukemia-associated genes in subsets of
hematopoietic cells even in the absence of hematologic cancer. This phenomenon has been termed Clonal
Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) because while many people with such mutations will have no
known clinical impact, the presence of these clonal populations is associated with increased risk or poor
outcomes in diseases ranging from hematologic malignancy and cardiovascular disease to osteoporosis and
COVID-19. While CHIP affects at least 10% of people over age 70, it impacts as many as 25% of patients with
solid tumors, likely driven by the genotoxic stress of chemotherapy and radiation. Recent studies have shown
that CHIP may result in aberrant inflammatory programming, particularly in myeloid lineages, and that immune
cells with CHIP mutations can infiltrate the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, research suggests that CHIP
may be associated with worse overall survival among solid tumor patients. Given the importance of the tumor
immune microenvironment and the increased burden of CHIP in these populations, there is a fundamental need
to examine the interplay between CHIP and solid malignancies and to explore how to clinically manage solid
tumor patients with CHIP. This proposal seeks to use clinical sequencing data, patient samples, mouse models,
and ex vivo experiments to determine the impact of CHIP on solid tumor outcomes and immune
microenvironment using triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a model system. TNBC is an aggressive
subtype of breast cancer that lacks expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2.
Importantly, TNBC often has a prominent immune cell infiltrate that is prognostic: the presence of lymphocytes
is associated with favorable outcomes, while the presence of tumor-associated macrophages is a negative
prognostic indicator. Aim 1 will leverage multiple large biobanks, prospectively collected patient specimens, and
a novel mouse model to define CHIP as a prognostic biomarker for TNBC outcomes, including overall survival
and response to therapy. Aim 2 will harness both patient-derived immune cells and mouse models to determine
how myeloid cells with CHIP mutations interact with TNBC cells. Techniques to be utilized include
histopathology, flow cytometry and immunophenotyping, gene expression analysis, and functional immune cell
assays. Completion of this work will provide a comprehensive training vehicle for this fellowship and will
simultaneously yield new insights into clinical management of solid tumor patients with CHIP, suggesting novel
therapeutic approaches for these patients. These studies will also provide a greater understanding of how
dysregulated myeloid cell signaling in CHIP clones leads to differential interaction in the tumor microenvironment."

 Hearing and speech are fundamental to human communication. Before infants are 12 months old, they
have learned the statistical regularities of speech sounds around them, which guides vocal learning throughout
early life and permanently alters auditory coding in cortical neurons. Deficits in cortical speech coding are
hallmarks of central auditory disorders such as auditory processing disorder (APD), specific language
impairment (SLI), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which together affect an estimated 7% of children.
These disorders are highly heritable and involve additive effects of multiple gene mutations. But, how genes
constrain the landscape through which auditory coding unfolds over development is entirely unknown. The
proposed aims test specific hypotheses regarding genetic constraints on auditory coding in songbirds, an
animal model of speech processing. Like humans and unlike other animals, songbirds learn to sing by learning
regularities in the vocal sounds of adults they interact with socially, and auditory cortical coding is permanently
altered by experience. The songbird secondary auditory cortex, caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) is required for
vocal learning, and contains neurons that are selectively tuned for acoustics of songs heard in early life.
Preliminary behavioral data indicate that juveniles raised by birds of a different species learn the morphologic
structure of their foster father’s song, but arrange their song with temporal structure typical of their genetic
relatives, despite never having heard those songs. In contrast, hybrid birds born of mixed-species parents copy
both the morphology and temporal structure of their father’s song, despite having only half the genetic makeup.
These data lead me to hypothesize that separate subpopulations of NCM neurons selectively code for
song morphology and temporal structure (Aim 1), and that temporal coding is constrained by genetics
(Aim 2). I propose to analyze singing behavior in songbirds with differing genetic backgrounds and specific
differences in singing behavior. I will compare electrophysiological responses of their NCM neurons to natural
songs, songs with altered temporal structure, and synthetic sounds that systematically vary in acoustics and
timing. I will use neural encoding analyses to measure which stimulus features drive responses, and decoding
analyses to measure what information neurons carry about stimuli. Expected outcomes will provide
fundamental insights into the genetic sources of limitations on cortical auditory coding capacity, and will inform
mechanism-based approaches to treating central auditory disorders such as APD, SLI, and ASD. The training
plan includes training in electrophysiology in awake animals, advanced neural data analyses, developing
expertise in behavioral genetics, and writing for journal publications, grants, and conference presentations.
Training will take place in the sponsor’s and co-sponsor’s labs, housed in Columbia University’s Zuckerman
Institute. The Institute is home to world-renowned neuroscientists and state-of-the-art facilities."
10904732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background − Maintenance of proteostasis is central to cellular fitness and is achieved through
sophisticated protein quality control (PQC) pathways that remove dysfunctional and unwanted proteins and
protein complexes that become cytotoxic if allowed to accumulate and condense. In fact, protein
aggregation encouraged by PQC defects is a hallmark of aging, cancer, and numerous human ‘aggregation-
prone’ pathologies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s
diseases, and related multisystem proteinopathies. Consequently, full understandings of PQC could offer
new strategies to mitigate protein aggregation and subsequent proteotoxic stress. Previous Work − We
discovered mechanistically conserved PQC routes that direct the autophagic elimination of inactive
proteasomes and the CDC48 segregase (p97/VCP in humans), which offer experimentally robust models
for describing defective protein clearance. Notably, turnover of both protein complexes shares features
with amyloidogenic protein removal, including sequestration, ubiquitylation, and subsequent recognition
by dedicated autophagic receptors, which for proteasomes also requires a trio of ubiquitin ligases that likely
work in concert to assemble appropriate poly-Ub chain topologies. Project Aims − This project proposes
to describe in detail the autophagic clearance of proteasomes and CDC48 in both yeast and Arabidopsis,
with the goal of discovering aspects central to autophagic PQC. For proteasomes, we will: (i) examine,
using genetics, fluorescence microscopy, interaction studies and ubiquitin linkage mapping, where, when,
and how the ligases San1, Rsp5 and Hul5 coordinately contribute to dysfunctional proteasome
ubiquitylation; (ii) identify ubiquitylation linkages needed to generate autophagy competent substrates; and
(iii) deduce how Hsp42-mediated sequestration into cytoplasmic membrane-less aggresomes, versus
condensation into proteasome storage granules, contributes to the process. Likewise, studies on CDC48
turnover will confirm that ubiquitylation is a key signal, followed by the identification of relevant ubiquitin
ligases and understanding of how CDC48 sequestration contributes to its turnover. Moreover, we will test
our hypothesis that the autophagic routes used to clear dysfunctional proteasomes and CDC48 also
eliminate amyloidogenic proteins that are at the heart of numerous aggregation-prone pathologies. Finally,
we will further define and expand upon a new class of autophagic receptors/adaptors that use a novel
interface to dock with ATG8 (LC3 in humans) lining autophagic vesicles, thus helping to increase the
known reach of selective autophagy. Outcomes − Through this cumulative research, we hope to define
autophagic routes relevant to aggregation-associated PQC, which will shed light on the roles of
ubiquitylation, biomolecular condensation, and autophagy in mitigating proteotoxic stress and ultimately
inform upon new therapeutic strategies for various amyloidogenic pathologies."

Giardia duodenalis (syn G. lamblia, G. intestinalis) is a common protozoan parasite that causes the diarrheal
disease, Giardiasis. This disease is prevalent among individuals in low and middle-income countries (~200
million cases annually). While acute symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting, Giardiasis can also be subclinical.
Long-term consequences of Giardiasis may include irritable bowel syndrome and growth stunting in children.
Studies have suggested that growth stunting occurs due to impaired absorption of nutrients in the small intestine,
and intestinal barrier dysfunction leading to nutrient malabsorption has been linked to infection with Giardia.
However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have yet to be well explored. While most research has
focused on mechanisms whereby infection leads to barrier damage, it is essential to also understand the repair
dynamics between bouts of active infection. This proposal examines how intestinal barrier repair signaling occurs
after Giardia-induced barrier damage. I will use an established mouse malnutrition model to investigate possible
mechanisms of barrier repair post-infection with Giardia. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
Giardia alters the production of metabolites by the gut microbiome leading to defective repair of the damaged
intestinal barrier. Previous research has found that metabolites of the amino acid tryptophan can mediate
intestinal barrier repair by activating the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Analysis of urinary metabolites in
Giardia-infected children indicated reduced levels of tryptophan (Trp), along with other amino acids. Also,
unpublished analyses of blood plasma metabolites in children and mice infected with Giardia yielded similar
results, leading to my hypothesis of defective barrier repair in Giardiasis. To address this hypothesis and carry
out the objectives of this proposal, I will quantify specific microbiota produced Trp metabolites in the plasma of
infected mice by mass spectrometry. Additionally, I will analyze epithelial barrier damage and repair with various
assays. To further understand the importance of AHR ligands, I will supplement the diets of infected mice with
either Trp or Trp metabolites and examine weight gain, epithelial permeability, and repair dynamics. Specific
assays include immunostaining for Ki67 to quantify proliferating IECs, qPCR to measure levels of IL-22 mRNA,
and western blotting of villin and ezrin to determine protein levels and identify post-translational modifications
related to barrier repair. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be used to determine the role of the microbiota in
converting Trp to metabolites that can activate AHR. Finally, I will utilize Ahr-deficient mouse models to identify
the involvement of AHR more precisely in facilitating barrier repair in Giardiasis. Completing this project will
significantly improve our knowledge of barrier repair in Giardia-infected individuals and help us understand
nutritional deficiencies that could exacerbate the long-term consequences of giardiasis. My findings inform the
use of dietary modifications to improve post-infection outcomes."

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the deadliest human malignancies, with the 5-year
survival rate currently at 12%. Little progress towards its treatment has been achieved over the past several
decades. While treatment of malignancies such as lung cancer and melanoma have been revolutionized by
immunotherapy, there has been little efficacy in pancreatic cancer patients. An immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) characterized by an abundance of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune-
suppressive myeloid cells (IMCs), including tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells, is known to be a major barrier to effectively treating PDA. We have recently shown that KRAS,
a major oncogenic driver in PDA, induces the expression of C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1 (CCR1) in
pancreatic myeloid cells, and CCR1 ablation in mice inhibits pancreatic tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell
antitumor immunity. Loss of CCR1 in TAMs decreased secretion of itaconate, an immune modulatory metabolite
that suppress proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells, and expression of Immune responsive gene 1
(IRG1), a myeloid-specific enzyme that produces itaconate. Our preliminary data also revealed that IRG1
ablation in orthotopic mouse model of PDA decreased tumor growth and enhanced CD8 T cell infiltration,
supporting a critical role of IRG1/itaconate in regulating anti-tumor immunity in PDA. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that CCR1-IRG1 axis-dependent metabolic programming in myeloid cells contributes
significantly to suppression of anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer. In aim 1, we will dissect the
mechanisms underlying fibroblast mediated metabolic regulation in IMCs through CCR1-IRG1 axis in PDA. Our
preliminary data showed that pancreatic CAFs promoted expression of IRG1 in bone marrow derived
macrophages. We will elucidate the fibroblast-derived CCLs and the CCR1-dependent signaling pathways in
driving IRG1 expression and the immune suppressive phenotypes of IMCs using CAFs-IMCs co-cultures. In aim
2, we will characterize the contribution of IRG1 to the early carcinogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer
using both mouse models and human pancreatic samples. In aim 3, we will explore targeting IRG1 in combination
with immune checkpoint blockade and/or KRAS G12D inhibition as a therapeutic strategy using both
pharmacological and genetic approaches. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a team of investigators
with complementary expertise in human pathology and mouse models of PDA, immunometabolism, pancreatic
surgery/immunology, and computational biology. Our study will not only provide critical insights into the immune
suppressive function of the CCR1-IRG1 axis in PDA, but also identify novel therapeutic approaches to effectively
treating PDA."
10903323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Large-scale RNA sequencing studies have provided remarkable insight into the brain molecular processes that
underlie complex neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Bulk processing of brain
tissue has linked the disruption of alternative splicing, a mechanism by which a gene’s exons and introns are
differentially processed into mRNA isoforms, to the transcriptomic changes seen in ASD. Furthermore, single-
cell and single-nucleus analyses have localized these alterations to pro-inflammatory microglia, astrocytes, and
deep excitatory neuron populations. However, prior splicing analyses were limited to well-annotated isoforms
from short-read data, which account for only a small subset of all isoforms present in the brain transcriptome.
Now, emerging third generation “long-read” sequencing technologies allow for the processing of full-length
transcripts, revealing the full profile of introns and exons for both known and novel gene isoforms. Here, we
propose single nucleus long-read sequencing of over 60 human prefrontal cortex samples, including 33
individuals with a diagnosis of ASD and 30 without such a diagnosis, to fully interrogate the biological function
of isoforms in neuropsychiatric disease. Given the existing evidence of splicing alterations in ASD, and the
growing body of evidence that isoform expression captures the brain’s transcriptomic diversity better than gene
expression, we hypothesize that long-read sequencing will reveal broader transcriptional dysregulation than
previously captured, and that we will localize these changes to highly refined cell subpopulations. Leveraging
long-read technology on our dataset, we will assess the cellular distribution of isoforms in the postnatal human
brain (Aim 1). Next, we will perform case-control differential expression analysis, paired with genomic
enrichment, to identify isoform-level drivers of ASD pathophysiology (Aim 2). Finally, we will examine
correlations between isoforms and identify systems-level regulators of expression, across both control samples
and ASD samples (Aim 3). Altogether, these aims serve to systematically characterize the role of isoform
diversity in the postnatal human brain across both control and ASD populations, aligning with the NIMH’s mission
to uncover the neurobiological basis of brain-related disorders. This proposal will be carried out by Michael
Margolis, an MD/PhD student at UCLA, who will receive comprehensive training in human genetics and
genomics. Mentorship will be provided by Dr. Daniel H. Geschwind as the primary mentor, with additional
mentorship from Dr. Michael J. Gandal, both of whom are experts in the fields of functional genomics and
neurobehavioral genetics."
10889591,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in the U.S. and affects ~1% of all live births.
Over 85% live well into adulthood, and over 50% of those with moderate or complex CHD suffer from
neurodevelopmental disabilities - most commonly impaired being executive function (EF). As EF is important for
independent living and mental health, predicting who will have greater EF impairment and needs intervention is
important as EF is particularly amenable to treatment. However, current routinely measured patient and medical
factors do not reliably predict EF in CHD - better predictors are needed to appropriately allocate services and
improve outcomes. In utero and postnatal factors may lead to impaired EF in CHD. Lack of substrate in utero or
abnormal gene expression may impact early neurodevelopmental (ND) processes. This includes formation of
the white matter “backbone”, the structural “rich club” of the brain that is critical for EF. Additional environmental
factors, including surgery, parenting style and life experiences, further alter brain structure through secondary
adaptive processes which include development of cortico-cortical connections, axonal pruning and myelination.
Differentiating between early in utero factors from later adaptive changes is key to understanding the potential
and optimal timing of interventions and the relative importance of developing novel in utero therapies. We
propose to employ our advanced connectome measures of “information transport” to understand early and later
environmental effects on white matter connectivity, by determining the impact of CHD on rich club versus
secondary, non-rich club connections. We leverage two cohorts with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-
TGA) CHD – infants with pre-operative MRI and 22-month ND outcomes, and adults aged 26-34 years old with
MRI and cognitive testing. d-TGA is the more common severe CHD that is corrected soon after birth and
additional surgery is rare. Thus d-TGA patients have the most uniform postnatal course of all CHDs but, like
other CHDs, have significant yet variable impairment in EF. The overarching goal is to understand how brain
structure in d-TGA patients differ to controls, and the impact of pre- and post-natal factors on outcome measures.
This will help us to identify when to intervene, and therefore better manage the appropriate factors that can
improve longer-term ND and EF outcomes. To address this, Aim 1 is to determine how the connectome is altered
in pre-operative infants, and whether an altered prenatally established rich club is associated with outcomes at
22-months. Postnatal measures on surgery, socioeconomic status and upbringing will be modelled to study their
influence on this association. In Aim 2, we investigate alterations in rich club/non-rich club connectivity in the d-
TGA adults and their association with EF. We include similar clinical and environmental factors to this model to
ascertain whether they play a role in the above relationship. Successful completion will determine the effect of
pre- and post-natal factors on brain structure during two stages of life, and the relative roles of the rich club and
secondary adaptive pathways on cognitive outcomes in d-TGA CHD."
10889642,"We lack a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the development of the lens fibrotic
disease, Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) in response to cataract surgery wounding. Our preliminary data
indicate a role for mitochondrial remodeling in driving lens fibrosis. Importantly, whether mitochondria play an
integral role in the development of PCO is not known. Mitochondria are recognized as central coordinators of
cell processes, as not only a major source of ATP for cells, but also through production of metabolites and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can impact cell signaling. The arrangement of mitochondria within a cell is
coordinated by fusion events and by fission to fragment mitochondria into transportable units that can travel
along microtubules, an efficient mechanism to provide energy and metabolic needs in a highly localized and
specific manner. Our unbiased transcriptome findings with a clinically relevant PCO model, provide strong
evidence that fibrosis is associated with gene reprogramming around remodeling mitochondrial function, and
metabolic rewiring that favors glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Our findings also support that acquisition to a lens
fibrotic phenotype is associated with an increase in mtROS, mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial trafficking
along microtubule cytoskeletal elements. Whether PCO development depends on this remodeling of
mitochondrial function, including elevated mtROS is not known nor do we know whether PCO development
depends on the repositioning of mitochondria within the cell to support the pro-fibrotic phenotype. The objective
of this proposal is to deliver new molecular insight into the role of mitochondrial remodeling in driving lens fibrotic
disease. The central hypothesis is that mitochondria become remodeled through changes in fission/fusion
dynamics and substrate metabolism to drive the acquisition of a pro-fibrotic lens phenotype. The central
hypothesis will be evaluated – in a clinically relevant model of PCO, as well as human lens cells and explants
derived from human cataract surgery patients - by the following two specific aims: 1) To determine how
mitochondrial substrate oxidation impacts mitochondrial ROS production and fibrosis development and 2) To
investigate whether modulating mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics can prevent acquisition to a lens fibrotic
phenotype. These aims will be pursued utilizing cutting-edge techniques to investigate mitochondrial
bioenergetics and glycolytic flux, a combination of high-resolution confocal microscopy, time-lapse microscopy,
and a toolkit of small molecules that specifically target different mechanisms to effect changes in mitochondrial
form and function and thus enable mechanistic insights. The proposed research is significant as these studies
will provide a new comprehensive understanding about the role of mitochondrial form and function in driving lens
fibrosis. The long-term goal is to use this new understanding about mitochondrial remodeling as a foundational
resource to create new mitochondrial-targeted treatment strategies for preventing PCO."

Sensory symptoms are a core diagnostic feature of autism and cause substantial functional impairment.
Auditory processing is one of the most affected domains and is hypothesized to play a role in the socio-
communicative and restricted/repetitive behavior symptoms in autism. Measurement of real-time auditory
processing using electroencephalography (EEG) has shown that latency delays and reduced gamma
synchrony are potential powerful biomarkers in autism. Using EEG, we have shown that auditory processing is
dependent on attention abilities among autistic adults. Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adults showed
delayed auditory latencies and reduced gamma synchrony during a passive listening task. However, autistic
adults showed more efficient neural processing (typical latencies and gamma synchrony) when they were
actively engaged with the auditory stimuli. Additionally, we showed a strong association between longer
latencies and greater sensory and social symptoms on behavioral self-report measures. Using innovative
structural equation modeling, we validated a model of brain-behavior relationships, wherein attention mediated
the relationship between delayed latencies (EEG) and behavioral sensory symptoms, that together predicted
social behaviors in autistic adults. Given these compelling findings in autistic adults, it is crucial that we validate
these findings in children on the autism spectrum. In aim 1, we will determine the role of attention (top-down)
on neural auditory processing in autistic children. We hypothesize that compared to age-matched typically
developing peers, autistic children will show delayed latencies and reduced gamma synchrony during a
passive auditory paired-click paradigm and show more typical latencies and gamma synchrony during an
active paired-click paradigm involving a motor response. In aim 2, we will validate a novel brain-behavior
model of attention, sensory processing, and social behaviors. We hypothesize that attention will mediate the
relationship between auditory EEG measures and behavioral parent-report measures of sensory symptoms
and social responsiveness in children on the autism spectrum. We will use structural equation modeling to
assess this model. In aim 3, we will determine the reliability of brain-behavior relationships of auditory EEG
measures. We hypothesize that auditory latencies and gamma synchrony will show strong test-retest reliability
when tested one-week and 6-months apart with maintained brain-behavior relationships to clinical correlates of
autism. Results generated here will systematically validate a novel model that determines the role of top-down
attention on sensory symptoms in autism using a multi-model approach. These results will provide a framework
to measure pharmacological and behavioral therapies for attention in autism. Validation of auditory EEG
biomarkers of latency and gamma synchrony will provide an innovative, objective, and reliable method of
measuring how therapy impacts the brain in future clinical trials. Upon completion of this R03, we will have the
preliminary data for an R01 proposal to determine the effectiveness of attention interventions in autism."
10899777,"In autoimmune endocrine disease, self-reactive T cells inappropriately target hormone-producing cells, leading
to tissue damage and obliteration of hormone production. One of the most common autoimmune diseases,
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, offers an ideal model to decipher how hormone production is lost in autoimmune
endocrine disease. Surprisingly, only 20-40% of patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis exhibit loss of hormone
production (hypothyroid). The remainder of patients retain hormone production despite immune infiltration of the
thyroid (euthyroid). Understanding how hormone production is preserved requires dissection of interactions
between infiltrating T cells and hormone-producing epithelial cells, such as thyrocytes. To address this challenge,
I have performed single-cell RNA sequencing in human thyroid from patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,
Graves’ disease (an autoantibody-driven form of thyroid autoimmunity) and those without autoimmune thyroid
disease. We have identified a transcriptionally unique population of thyrocytes that is significantly expanded in
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and ectopically expresses class II MHC. In addition, our preliminary data indicate several
thyroid-infiltrating CD4+ T cell populations that appear to distinguish Graves’ disease from Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. Epithelial cells are known to express MHCII in inflamed tissue, however it is not known whether these
cells present antigen to CD4+ T cells in vivo. We hypothesize that MHCII+ thyrocytes present antigen to and
modulate the phenotype of CD4+ T cells, leading to global changes in the inflammatory environment. We further
hypothesize that the transcriptional phenotype of MHCII+ thyrocytes differs in euthyroid and hypothyroid
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. To test these hypotheses, I will compare the transcriptional and functional phenotype of
MHCII+ thyrocytes in euthyroid and hypothyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease (Aim 1). I will then
determine how thyroid-infiltrating self-reactive T cells differ among these conditions (Aim 2). This project may
define how tissue function can be preserved in autoimmune disease more broadly.
This proposal presents a five-year plan for Dr. Michelle Rengarajan to train in immunology to decipher how
epithelial-immune interactions underly endocrine autoimmunity. Dr. Rengarajan will be an Instructor in Medicine
at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). She will perform the proposed
work under mentorship from Drs. Andrew Luster and Alexandra-Chloe Villani. Dr. Rengarajan has outlined a
career development plan focused on single-cell genomics, epithelial-immune interactions, antigen-specific T

10900451,"An exploratory research project will develop deep-UV Raman microscopic hyperspectral imaging for molecular
and/or cellular analysis of biological tissues with a goal of the early detection, improved screening, and clinical
diagnostics of cancer. Raman microscopy is often used in cancer biology to identify occurring chemical changes;
however, the sensitivity and specificity of detection remain to be a challenge. This gap of fundamental knowledge
on how to improve the information context of such images will be addressed by utilizing deep UV excitation,
which, through resonance excitation of specific molecules will enhance specificity of molecular detection and
improve the sensitivity by enhancing the signal against the background. To further improve the image-based
analysis and screening, a novel hyperspectral image analysis platform will be developed. The proposed research
program fills the technology gaps by developing an instrument, capable of performing Raman imaging at least
100 times faster, acquire new information through assessing low-frequency Raman modes, while reducing the
cost and the footprint to accelerate the wide-spread availability of the instrument. The new imaging system
augmented with novel hyperspectral imaging algorithms to handle multidimensional imaging data will be applied
to advance a challenging biopsy of bone tumors, one of the most devastating consequences of many cancers
with the goal to achieve 95% specificity. In Aim 1, a novel, patent-pending, wide-field deep UV hyperspectral
Raman imaging platform will be optimized for cancer tissue samples. A working prototype will be built, and its
performance will be experimentally characterized. In Aim 2, a data analysis platform with machine and deep
learning algorithms for pathology of bone tissue will be developed. Advanced imaging algorithms that take into
account many small changes in addition to a traditional analysis of Raman spectra will be used. Machine learning
and deep learning techniques will be developed to automatically determine abnormalities beyond current yes/no
tumor paradigm. In Aim 3, the developed platform will be validated as a novel analysis strategy. Research will
focus on distinguishing tumors in the animal model of metastatic bone cancer and developing a set of optical
markers to enable rapid identification of tumors. The proposed strategy offers a novel enabling technology to
elucidate basic mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression and will facilitate early cancer detection,
screening, and/or cancer risk assessment, by differentiating, evaluating and/or observing cancer stages and
progression. The overall approach targets the wide spread of the technology, its relatively low-cost and seamless
transition to clinical setting. The R33 phase will improve the sensitivity of detection and identify the pathways
toward commercialization. The research study will also provide a roadmap to develop a new advanced approach
for studying a variety of bone-related tumors and identify novel preclinical and clinical assays."
10898135,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit, often arising from dysfunction of cochlear hair cells. Hair cells
express unique protein complexes vital for auditory function, including the mechanotransduction (MET) channel,
a heteromeric protein complex which converts mechanical sound waves into electrical signals. Proper
expression, assembly, trafficking, and localization of MET proteins to stereocilia are critical for auditory function,
yet there is a significant knowledge gap in the molecules and mechanisms that participate in these processes.
Numerous forms of hereditary hearing loss are associated with deficits in MET protein localization, making the
study of the underlying mechanisms highly significant. The overall goal of the project is to investigate the
molecules and mechanisms that regulate processing and localization of MET channel proteins, and the effects
of genetic mutations on these processes. TMC1 and TMC2 are pore-forming subunits of the MET channel, with
TMC1 predominating throughout most of life. Recently, we discovered that Transmembrane-O-methyltransferase (TOMT) is critical for regulating TMC1 localization, MET channel activity, and auditory
function. TOMT is the first molecule known to participate in MET protein localization that is not part of the MET
complex. The precise mechanism by which TOMT regulates TMC1 remains unknown, but our preliminary results
provide important insights. Specifically, although TOMT localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hair cells
and is excluded from stereocilia, it interacts with and stabilizes TMC1. Critically, outside hair cells, TOMT is not
sufficient for TMC1 ER exit, suggesting the involvement of unknown partners expressed in hair cells. Importantly,
our preliminary studies have uncovered novel molecular chaperones (PEX3, 16, 19, referred to as PEX proteins)
that are expressed in hair cells, and that interact with TOMT to enhance TMC1 expression and stability. Notably,
mutations in PEX proteins cause hearing loss in peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. Based on our preliminary
data, our central hypothesis is that TMC1 processing and localization is regulated by complex hair-cell-specific
machinery, involving TOMT and PEX proteins, that is affected by deafness-linked mutations. Using multifaceted
approaches that incorporate cutting-edge technologies, we will: 1) define mechanisms by which TOMT facilitates
TMC1 ER exit by investigating how TOMT-TMC1 binding domains and deafness-linked mutations contribute to
TMC1 stability, localization, and auditory function; and 2) characterize expression patterns and manipulate inner
ear gene function of PEX proteins to interrogate the individual and synergistic roles of PEX proteins with TOMT
in TMC1 processing and auditory function. Our findings will contribute to a new paradigm of auditory protein
complex expression, assembly, trafficking, and localization. We will gain critical insights into the processing and
localization of TMC1, a key auditory protein and the pore-forming subunit of the MET channel. By doing so, we
anticipate uncovering novel molecules and mechanistic checkpoints to serve as therapeutic targets addressing
hearing loss associated with defects in protein processing and/or localization."

More than 34 million individuals in the U.S. are living with Type 2 Diabetes (DM). Adult females who belong to
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are most negatively impacted by risks and complications associated
with DM, including functional impairment in cognitive and sensorimotor actions. Prior work in understanding the
cortical complications in persons with DM (including the development of vascular dementia (VD)) has focused
on independent risk factors such as insufficient sleep and inflammation. DM complications have also been
linked to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sex-hormone changes during the transition to menopause;
however, most studies have included only white non-Hispanic persons. Due to this, we have limited insight into
the multifactorial causes of poor cortical health including DM, sex-hormone influences, inflammation, and OSA
in the most dramatically impacted population living with DM—underrepresented women. In this project, we
seek to fill this critical gap by clarifying how sex-hormones (estrogen and testosterone), inflammation, and OSA
contribute together to the pathogenesis of cortical complications in underrepresented women living with DM.
This proposed project is a logical extension of our recent work that provides mechanistic insight into the
compound contributions of menopause and inflammation to cortical complications and functional impairment in
underrepresented women with DM. Findings from this study will advance understanding of poor cortical health
as a combined function of sex-hormone changes, inflammation, and OSA in underrepresented middle-aged
women with DM. This information pushes forward beyond the knowledge of DM, insufficient sleep,
inflammation, and underrepresented minority status as independent risk factors for VD development. This
project aligns with NHLBI objectives of prevention of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and priorities in in
women’s health, sleep disorders, health disparities, and VD."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with hallmarks of extracellular beta amyloid
(Aβ) plaques (A), intraneuronal tau tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N), known as the A/T/N framework, a
descriptive classification for AD biomarkers. Accumulating evidence shows that a severely imbalanced
microbial community, or dysbiosis, is associated with A/T/N and neuroinflammation in AD patients compared
with healthy controls (HC). However, it remains unknown how individual microbiota correlates with regional
A/T/N neuroimaging markers in AD and HC. It is also unknown if dysbiosis directly promotes and accelerates
A/T/N at early stage and whether there are effective interventions available to mitigate the dysbiosis and thus
AD risk. Therefore, the goal of the project is to design a translational study, employing parallel human and
preclinical animal experiments to understand mechanism and identify interventions for filling these knowledge
gaps. The central hypothesis is that severity of dysbiosis between AD and HC individuals will correlate with
their regional A/T/N imaging markers and cognitive status; young healthy triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice
received fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from AD patients (FMT-AD) will have reproduced dysbiosis as
the donors, which will accelerate A/T/N, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment of the mice. Interventions
with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibition will mitigate A/T/N and neuroinflammation, and prebiotic
diet (inulin) supplementation can further restore microbiome balance to protect brain physiology and cognition.
The central hypothesis will be tested by the following three Specific Aims: (1) Identify correlation of dysbiosis,
A/T/N imaging markers and cognition in humans; (2) Reveal impact of iNOS on mitigating A/T/N in the
presence of dysbiosis; (3) Determine ability of inulin, with and without functional iNOS, to rescue FMT-AD-
induced A/T/N and cognitive impairment. Participants who had PET scans for “A/T” will be recruited for the
study, and ultrahigh resolution 7T MRI will be used to determine “N”. Translational 7T MRI, gut microbiome
sequencing and cognitive assessments will be applied to both humans and mice to determine longitudinal
effects of gut-brain interactions. A novel iNOS knockout triple transgenic AD (iNOS-KO/3xTg-AD) mouse
model has been created for the project to study the iNOS effects on mitigating A/T/N despite of gut dysbiosis.
Biochemical assays and brain staining will be used to determine “A/T” in the mice. Inflammatory gene
expression will be identified by transcriptomics. It is anticipated that the findings from this study will have
tremendous positive impact as they will enhance the understanding of gut-brain interactions underlying A/T/N
in AD and pave the way for future disease-modifying interventions for AD via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. As
iNOS inhibitors, inulin diet, 7T MRI and microbiome analyses are available for humans, the success of animal
interventional outcomes and the human study pipeline established in the study may pave a way for future
clinical trials to mitigate AD risk by gut microbiome modulation."

Hospital and Brown University, is an ideal clinical center for the ECHO ISPCTN. We will build on our successes
in the initial award period, in which we were a top enrolling site, developed a new network neonatal opioid
withdrawal trial protocol, and provided leadership to the network through our committee work. Our state's
demographic includes many underserved, minority and immigrant children, who have high rates of infant
mortality, asthma, obesity, prematurity, mental health problems and special health care needs. This high risk
population has not been previously included in many clinical studies, and thus is benefitting both directly and
indirectly from the RI-CCTC's work. Rhode Island is uniquely organized for population-based clinical research:
it has one major obstetric hospital (80% of all deliveries in the state), one children's hospital (90% of all pediatric
admissions in the state) and one health department, as well as an engaged community. These factors allow for
effective enrollment, retention and follow-up of study participants in clinical trials, giving the RI-CCTC the
potential to make a strong impact. We have leveraged our rich network of collaborations with many existing
research, education and public health programs, as well as affiliations with national research networks. These
partners share our commitment to children's health and child health research. The Brown University School of
Public Health and the Alpert Medical School, recently received a large gift to create the Hassenfeld Child Health
Innovation Institute (HCHII), which is focused on understanding the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors that
lead to childhood asthma, obesity and autism. The RI-CCTC will leverage the resources of the HCHII to create
a much broader and more powerful research network to serve children in the state of RI. Investigators in the
Schools of Public Health and Medicine have considerable expertise in the study of environmental exposures and
their impact on children. The contact PI, Thomas Chun MD, MPH, has extensive experience with multi-center
networks and their leadership, through his experience with the ECHO ISPCTN and the Pediatric Emergency
Care Applied Research Network. Co-PI Abbot Laptook similarly is a leader in both the ISPCTN and the NIH
funded Neonatal Research Network. Senior Faculty Development Leader and co-PI Phyllis Dennery MD, has
had consistent NIH funding for her basic/translational research, has participated in many training grants and
multicenter clinical trials, and has won mentoring awards. This team will ensure the continued success of the RI-
CCTC in fulfilling the goals and mission of the ECHO Program. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Continue to provide
new opportunities for underserved patient enrollment in ECHO ISPCTN studies by building on our current
collaborations between our academic research centers and institutions; 2) Continue to provide leadership to
the ECHO ISPCTN and ECHO Program by developing new clinical trials and serving on network committees;
3) Develop and expand programs to educate and mentor clinicians to become independent investigators."
10900731,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite growing urgency to transition many chronic pain patients off prescription opioids, there is limited
evidentiary support and mixed success rates for alternative treatment approaches that aim to facilitate
discontinuation. Few patients who initiate opioid tapers succeed, and a subset of patients react adversely to
dose reductions, experiencing significantly worsened pain and psychological destabilization. This is particularly
true with patients on prolonged opioid therapy, in which the effects of physiological dependence alter
functioning within the neural pain matrix towards a dysregulated and hypersensitized state. Neuromodulation
approaches are particularly well suited for this clinical challenge, offering safe and effective analgesia as well
as mitigation of opioid withdrawal syndrome. In particular, the Sparrow Therapy System is an FDA-cleared
device that delivers transcutaneous auricular neurostimulation (tAN) to the vagal and trigeminal nerves and is
therapeutically indicated for pain during opioid withdrawal. Yet, the mechanisms of action remain poorly
understood. The absence of an accepted mechanistic model poses limits on tAN clinical application, as an
understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms supporting analgesia would enable parameter
optimization leading to precision implementation and maximized therapeutic benefit. We hypothesize that the
effects of our tAN approach are 1) dependent on endogenous opioid neurotransmission, 2) are maximally
engaged by simultaneous vagal and trigeminal stimulation, and 3) confer analgesic benefits associated with
increased neural activity in brainstem vagal afferents but decreased activation in cortical and subcortical pain
network regions. To elucidate these proposed mechanisms, we offer a synergistic series of studies in healthy
adults and chronic pain patients. Aim 1 will use an experimental µ-opioid blockade paradigm and a novel
concurrent pain and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to assess brain activation and
pain thresholds following auricular vagal and trigeminal stimulation presented alone and in combination. Aim 2
will likewise entail a concurrent neurostimulation and fMRI paradigm to observe the direct brain effects of
auricular vagus stimulation, auricular trigeminal stimulation, combination stimulation, or sham stimulation.
Using a double-blind, sham-controlled clinical mechanistic trial of tAN in pain patients undergoing acute opioid
tapering, Aim 3 will establish the specific neurophysiological signature of tAN-based analgesia and differentiate
this activation profile from secondary outcomes. Our interdisciplinary approach and diverse scientific team of
bioengineers, neuroscientists, and clinical pain and opioid specialists is well suited for accomplishing these
goals. Results of this project will deliver specific therapeutic mechanisms of action of an emerging treatment
that will expand benefits for a high-need clinical population and lead directly to optimized clinical approaches."
10900736,"There is an urgent clinical need to develop new therapeutics to promote bone regeneration. A
critical aspect of the bone healing process begins with the expansion of periosteal progenitors
that occurs immediately after injury and then the differentiation of these progenitors to bone
forming osteoblasts and chondrocytes, yet mechanisms that control skeletal progenitor/stem cell
activation, expansion, and differentiation in response to injury are poorly described. Our project
will study the role of the R-spondin (ligand) – Lgr (receptor) signaling axis in regulating these
progenitors and bone regeneration. R-spondins (roof plate specific spondin) are a family of four
secreted matricellular proteins (Rspo1-4) that bind to Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein
coupled receptors 4/5/6 (Lgrs). Rspo-Lgr interaction potentiate canonical Wnt pathway by
preventing the turnover of Wnt Frizzled receptors, and hence determines canonical Wnt
signaling levels. While canonical Wnt signaling is known to play an important role in bone
regeneration, very little research has explored positive modulators of Wnt signaling. In
particular, the requirement of Rspo-Lgr in the context of fracture healing has never been
examined due to lack of appropriate models. Our primary goal is to define the requirement of
Rspo2/3 and Lgr6 in mesenchymal progenitors in response to bone injury. We have defined
three specific aims to address this goal. In Aim1, we will use single and compound Rspo2 and
Rspo3 floxed mice crossed with an alphaSMACreERT2 mouse to disrupt the Rspo2/3 genes in
mesenchymal progenitors at the time of fracture. Bone healing will be assessed using microCT,
histology, molecular analysis, and mechanical testing. Alterations in canonical Wnt signaling
and osteogenic potential of Rspo2/3 deficient progenitors will be assessed. In Aim 2, Lgr6
knockout mice will be investigated for their bone healing properties using parameters similar to
Aim 1. In Aim 3, Rspo2 will be delivered to bone injury sites and the impact on BMP and Wnt
signaling, progenitor activation and differentiation, and bone healing assessed. Completion of
this project will identify the requirement of Rspo2/3-Lgr6 interaction in fracture healing and will
provide new therapeutic directions for enhancing bone healing."

Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) commonly prescribed for balance disorders, weakness, and neurological deficits
have limited functionality due to their static nature. They restrict the joint’s range of motion and hamper energy
transfer, despite their success in mitigating foot drop. Foot drop is a condition that increases the risk of gait
abnormalities and falls. To address the limitations of AFOs, this project seeks to improve the upon a Variable
Stiffness Orthosis (VSO) design by incorporating a unique cam-based transmission that allows for decoupled
energy storage and return. The Decoupled Energy Storage and Return Variable Stiffness Orthosis (DESR-VSO)
transmission has two cams which can be engaged during different phases of walking to provide both variable
stiffness and energy recycling. Energy recycling is the phenomenon where energy is captured upon heel strike
and returned during the push-off phase of gait. This proposal includes designing multiple versions of the cam-
based transmission to optimize the balance between foot drop prevention (dorsiflexion assistance) and energy
recycling. The transmission designs will be tested on the bench top and evaluated on patients with foot drop
from peroneal nerve damage. The testing and evaluation stage will guide the selection of the most promising
transmission design for a future clinical trial. This project aligns with the Neurobionics Lab’s goal to enhance
mobility for individuals with disabilities through device design and evaluation. Led by candidate Emily Bywater
and Prof. Elliott Rouse at the University of Michigan, the research will benefit from the expertise of additional
assistive device specialists and clinical advisors who have volunteered to collaborate. The outcomes will offer
insights into the impact of design decisions on energy recycling and foot drop mechanics, facilitating the selection
of an optimal cam-based transmission. Feedback from clinicians and patients will contribute to future design
improvements, while subsequent clinical trials will assess the effects of dorsiflexion assistance on patient gait
and explore metrics for assessing how the device can be individualized. Emily’s training plan includes training in
design, control theory, software engineering, biomechanics, professional development, diversity, equity, and
inclusion, and scientific communication. The project will be conducted in the state-of-the-art Rehabilitation Lab
in the Ford Motor Company Robotics Building at the University of Michigan, where all of the necessary equipment
for human subject studies, benchtop testing, and device fabrication is already established."

We know little about the mechanisms underlying a critical subset of heterogeneous obesity: Severe Obesity
(SevO; BMI≥40kg/m2; ~>100 lbs overweight), a risk factor for a host of chronic cardiometabolic and other
diseases, disproportionately impacting Hispanic/Latino (HL) populations. Given the rapidly growing US HL
population, deepening the genomic translational pipeline, and identifying regulatory mechanisms of SevO in HL
populations are imperative. Yet, because SevO is an exclusion criterion in many clinical research studies and
HL are profoundly underrepresented in genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic research, we know little about
its underlying mechanistic pathways or the clinical significance of SevO susceptibility in HL individuals. As a
result, studies attempting to fine map GWAS loci, estimate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and
metabolomics quantitative trait loci (metaboQTL) have been uninformed by HL populations and effects of
ancestral heterogeneity within and across HL populations have also been historically under-investigated. These
fundamental gaps in data and in ancestry-informed analyses necessitate integrative studies of multi-omics to
propel mechanistic understanding and establish clinical significance of SevO susceptibility in HL. Thus, we
propose to leverage transcriptomics, metabolomics, and SevO GWAS data from extant epidemiologic and
clinical studies in the US, Central, and South America, to discover, identify causal relationships, and reveal
molecular mechanisms of SevO in HL populations. We propose to examine: (Aim 1) whole blood RNAseq data
from >15,000 HL individuals (892 SevO cases, 3,342 controls) and (Aim 2) metabolomic data from >46,000
HL individuals (1,588 SevO cases, 9,827 controls) to identify transcriptomic and metabolomic signals
underlying SevO using ancestry-informed models to derive the first ever, ancestry-informed HL-specific eQTL
and metaboQTL maps. We have developed a rigorous plan of discovery, internal replication, external validation,
and generalization across diverse populations and cell types to ensure a high level of scientific rigor. In Aim 3,
we propose to identify mechanisms and infer causal pathways underlying SevO by integrating these measures
with SevO GWAS data from ~240,000 HL to perform ancestry-informed colocalization, pathway, and causal
inference modeling, and establish broad clinical significance using GWAS-, transcript-, and metabolite-informed
polygenic risk scores of SevO in HL individuals in large, electronic health record-linked biobanks. These studies,
unprecedented in size and ancestral diversity in HL populations will increase knowledge of the metabolic
pathways and gene expression profiles of SevO, filling critical gaps. Using our deep expertise in cutting-edge
methods in ancestry-informative analyses, we propose novel methodological approaches including integration
of local ancestry eQTL and metaboQTL mapping studies and multi-omics informed polygenic risk scores for use
in clinical biobank data. We will broaden the representativeness of the genomics literature and fundamentally
alter understanding of mechanisms underlying SevO in an understudied and disproportionately impacted group."

Unintended drug block of cardiac ion channels remains a major problem in drug development. The voltage-gated
potassium channel KV11.1 also known as the hERG channel is a major drug anti-target that binds a diverse set
of small molecule drugs. Drug-induced inhibition of the hERG channel reduces the critical repolarizing current IKr
and thereby prolongs the cardiac action potential. Many drugs that bind the hERG channel promote deadly
arrythmias like Torsades de Pointes while some hERG blockers present significantly lower proarrhythmic risk.
Two hypotheses were proposed to elucidate this discrepancy: (1) preferential drug binding to the inactivated
state of the hERG channel confers greater proarrhythmic risk and (2) simultaneous drug binding to other cardiac
ion channels can ameliorate the risk associated with hERG channel block. Here, we present a state-specific
molecular modeling assessment of drug binding to different conformations of the hERG and voltage-gated
sodium hNaV1.5 and calcium hCaV1.2 channels. We have developed structural models of these cardiac ion
channels in open and inactivated conformations and will perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to
validate structural stabilities and assess ion conduction. Ligand docking was then performed using Site
Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), a pre-compute ensemble molecular docking technique.
SILCS allows us to perform a high-throughput assessment of ligand binding affinities using molecular fragment
energy maps derived from molecular dynamics simulations of state-specific ion channel models. Bayesian
machine learning was used to provide improved correlation of SILCS-computed affinities with experimental data.
Using SILCS multi-ligand docking we also estimated interactions of drugs with sex hormones in the hERG
channel pore to assess a potential molecular mechanism for an increased proarrhythmia risk in females. We aim
to use SILCS computed state-specific drug affinity data to inform multi-scale functional kinetic models of cardiac
electrophysiology to estimate emergent drug effects on the cardiac action potential and heart rhythm. These
modeling results will be validated by performing voltage-clamp electrophysiology measurements in vitro and
compared to other published work. Upon completion of this project, the applicant will have refined expertise in
computational modeling of ion channel-drug interactions and will have received training in experimental
electrophysiology for the first time. Throughout the project, the sponsors will implement a training plan to
strengthen the applicant’s knowledge of cardiac physiology and pharmacology while also broadening their
scientific network, and improving the applicant’s scientific communication skills. This plan is tailored such that
the applicant is prepared for a career as an academic scientist, investigating drug interactions with ion channels."

 The Administrative Core of the HD2A Research Adoption Support Center (RASC) will host an efficient centralized home for the HD2A Program. It will provide the necessary infrastructure, operational and logistical support, and foster welcoming, productive and positive relationships within and across the RASC Cores and throughout the HD2A. With strong administrative and scientific leadership, RASC’s Administrative Core will design, develop, maintain and update user-friendly accessible platforms for HD2A grantees and the public. Robust online tools and resources will provide the field with the best of dissemination and implementation (D&I) methods and measures to maximize adoption of evidence-based substance use and pain interventions. Moreover, as the heart of the RASC, the Administrative Core will strive to foster a culture of HD2A community. The Administrative Core is the organizing hub of all RASC logistics and resources. It provides a coordination and collaboration infrastructure for the entire HEAL D2A Program. It is engineered to: ASSESS, adapt and respond to the needs of the Innovation Projects, the RASC Substance Use Disorder Implementation Support (SUD-IS), Pain Implementation Support (Pain-IS), and Research & Evaluation (R&E) cores, as well as the broader HEAL D2A Program; ASSIST with project management, coordination, and collaboration; ADVANCE practical, meaningful, widespread and long-range impact, by leveraging innovative, high-quality and accessible D&I resource materials. As the “grease and glue” for the RASC, the Administrative Core is the structural foundation for day-to-day work, technical support, research synergy, and efficiency--always striving toward the goal of high-profile impact. We aim to ignite expansive impacts throughout the fields of substance use disorder and pain intervention research. Leadership of the Administration Core has extensive experience managing a national implementation support network (the SAMHSA Technology Transfer Centers [ATTC; MHTTC]), an established resource upon which the RASC elaborates, expands and advances with state-of-the science D&I methods, measures, and a deep roster of individuals with translational research and practice expertise. As with the other cores and the overall RASC, the Administrative Core will be dedicated to at the very least meeting the needs and advancing the D&I impact of the HD2A program, but our ultimate goal is to change the field in order make evidence-based interventions for pain and substance use disorders readily and equitably available. This project is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."

The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and to develop concrete strategies capable of providing rapid and durable solutions to the opioid crisis. SUD IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Drug overdose fatalities have continued to rise despite massive federal investment in developing and disseminating evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral interventions for substance use disorders (SUDs). Attempts to move the needle on overdose deaths have stalled because of challenges translating research knowledge and evidence-based SUD interventions into public health practice. Access to evidence- based SUD interventions remains woefully limited throughout the U.S. health care system, particularly for historically marginalized populations such as Black/African-Americans, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, Asian Americans, and the uninsured. Equitable translation of research findings into practice is the domain of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science. A core component of the HD2A Research Adoption Support Center (RASC), the SUD Implementation Support (SUD-IS) Core will bring the best of D&I science to the Innovation Projects to guide the selection, implementation, and sustainment of evidence-based, locally appropriate SUD interventions to reduce overdose risk in hard hit communities. Core leadership will unify implementation scientists and SUD researchers - with the proximal goal of enhancing the impact of the Innovation Projects and the ultimate goal of improving public health - by leveraging cutting-edge D&I measures and methods, and capitalizing on our team’s commitment to team science. Thematically and operationally in tandem with the RASC and other cores, the SUD-IS Core will elevate the Innovation Projects through dynamic and iterative phases of ASSESS, ASSIST, and ADVANCE. We will first ASSESS the current state of evidence for SUD interventions in order to: a) develop a systematic catalog of evidence-based and emerging practices; and b) develop an SUD Intervention D&I Resource Guide for the Innovation Projects and any SUD intervention implementation project based on five key D&I constructs (e.g., contextual determinants, evidentiary support for the intervention, stakeholder engagement, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes including equity and stigma). We will then ASSIST the Innovation Projects using information gathered in the ASSESS phase in order to: a) enhance motivation to enhance their studies with tailored D&I approaches that draw upon Core expertise; b) provide a D&I Implementation Support Plan and use a shared decision-making approach to determine how best to offer technical assistance; and c) co-lead the RASC Learning Collaborative. Finally, we will ADVANCE the Innovation Projects’ activities with respect to sustainment, equity, and stigma reduction: linking projects with the field at large, promoting impacts on policy/financing and facilitating ongoing stakeholder engagement towards advocacy. Perfectly aligned with the RASC, together we take a major step toward closing the persistent and inequitable gap of access to proven pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments for SUD."
10904713,"PAIN IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ongoing opioid overdose crisis – the leading cause of accidental deaths among Americans – has at its
roots inadequately treated opioid use disorder (OUD) and pain. This reality has been recognized by the
National Academy of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among other major
organizations charged with protecting the public health, sparking an unprecedented influx of funding and policy
changes to stem the tide of overdose deaths. The nationwide attention and funding increase have driven a
marked rise in the development of evidence-based, high-quality pain treatments and treatment guidelines
addressing the full spectrum of public health need: from prevention to harm reduction to treatment to recovery
support. However, there has been woefully inadequate uptake of these treatments in real-world practice. For
example, primary care providers--the most frequent prescribers of long-term opioid therapy for pain--often lack
skills and/or time to fully implement evidence-based guidelines, putting already vulnerable patients at even
higher risk for opioid-related harms, including overdose, and poorly-controlled chronic pain. Effectively
translating research findings into practice and ameliorating these real-world quality of care deficits are the
domains of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science. As a key RASC core, the overarching goal of the
Pain Implementation Support (Pain-IS) Core is to support HD2A Innovation Projects in successful
implementation of effective pain interventions through the coordinated efforts of a highly expert collaborative
team, deploying and advancing cutting edge D&I methods. We will bring the best of D&I science to the pain
treatment quality gap, unifying implementation scientists and pain researchers—with the proximal goal of
enhancing research in the Innovation Projects and the ultimate goal of impacting the public health. Specifically,
in alignment with the other Cores, we will ASSESS the current status of key components of the Innovation
Projects on D&I capability in 5 key dimensions: a) evidentiary basis for the intervention; b) stakeholder
engagement c) contextual determinants; d) selection of implementation strategies; and, e) implementation
outcomes including the critically important but often overlooked domain of equity. We will ASSIST the
Innovation Projects using the information gathered in the ASSESS phase in order to: a) enhance motivation to
enhance their studies with tailored D&I approaches that draw upon the Core’s expertise; b) provide a D&I
Implementation Support Plan on the components above and using a shared decision-making approach to
determine how best to offer technical assistance (implementation support); and, c) to co-lead the RASC
Learning Collaborative. In concert with the RASC and other cores, we will ADVANCE the innovation projects
activities with respect to sustainment and equity: linking projects with the field at large, promoting projects’
impacts on policy/financing, and facilitating ongoing stakeholder engagement towards advocacy."
10904715,"RESEARCH AND EVALUATION CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although effective primary prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support interventions for
substance use disorders and pain exist, they are not widely available. Crosscutting dissemination and
implementation (D&I) scientific methods are required to select and deliver effective and efficient
implementation strategies under variable contexts. The Research Adoption Support Center’s Research and
Evaluation (R&E) Core, in concert with the Administrative, Substance Use Disorder Implementation Support
(SUD-IS) and Pain Implementation Support (Pain-IS) cores, utilizes an integrated, multidisciplinary, iterative
approach to provide rapid assessment, expert technical assistance, and advance the long-term adoption and
sustainment of evidence-based interventions. The overarching goal of the R&E Core is to elevate the D&I
capability and translational long-term impact of the HD2A Innovation Projects. We achieve this via
standardized baseline information and on-demand support for data, analytic, and research translation needs,
all toward leveraging sustainable change through science-based financing and policies. We will provide state-
of-the art methodological support in D&I measurement, frameworks, modeling, and testing/evaluation, guided
by R&E Core experts who have conducted extensive work across the four HHS pillars. Aligned with other
RASC cores, we are guided by 3 dynamic phases: 1) ASSESS Innovation Projects’ baseline D&I capacity via 3
methods; 2) ASSIST the Innovation Projects in increasing D&I capability, while supporting harmonized data
collection and reporting across projects; and, 3) ADVANCE Innovation Projects’ potential for sustainment and
scale-up, and serve as the D&I research methodology resource to the HD2A Modeling and Economic
Resource Center (MERC) and Data Infrastructure Support Center (DISC). A key function of the R&E core is
the formative evaluation, a phased evaluation that will incorporate lessons learned within and across HD2A
grantees, with formative evaluation reports (Years 1, 3) focused on providing insight to support timely decision-
making and course corrections by grantees and NIH, and a final report (Year 5) focused on informing future
initiatives of this kind. We also will conduct 5 Rapid Turnaround Research Projects designed to produce
knowledge to address persistent or emerging barriers to implementation or sustainment identified by HD2A
grantees. The Year 1 project will focus on the role of insurance coverage and other financing
and reimbursement barriers to the widespread adoption of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
Within and beyond the HD2A program, we boldly seek to contribute knowledge and methods to the addiction
and pain intervention fields with the ultimate goal of transformational and equitable public health benefit."
10904719,"PROJECT SUMMARY COORDINATION CORE
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Center for Precision Genetics (JCPG) brings together a multi-disciplinary team
including geneticists, genetics technology experts, quantitative and computational biologists, clinical experts
and experienced resource managers. The purpose of the Coordination Core (hereafter, Core) is to ensure
productive interactions among all participants and to oversee and facilitate all administrative and scientific
functions of the JCPG. This function is carried out under the direction of the JCPG Director and the Program
Manager in consultation with a Steering Committee (SC) and an External Advisory Board (EAB).
Effective coordination of the JCPG will be achieved by accomplishing four Specific Aims:
AIM 1. Optimize integration and function of JCPG activities through strong administrative and
technical oversight. This includes: i) facilitating the process of nominating disease modeling projects, ii)
ensuring integrated operation of the Bioinformatics core, the Disease Modeling Unit and the Pre/Co Clinical
core, iii) facilitation of all internal and external JCPG communications, iv) coordination of activities of the SC
and EAB and, v) coordinating production and submission of all JCPG records to meet internal and external
reporting requirements.
AIM 2. Promote center productivity and scientific synergy through effective communication. In this role
the Core is responsible for organizing all formal meetings between and among JCPG leadership, advisors and
external stakeholders. The purpose of all meetings is to track progress toward aims and milestones and will
follow a regular schedule that will be supplemented with ad hoc gatherings as needed.
AIM 3. Implement and refine a decision framework for evaluating and prioritizing variant nominations.
A central function of the JCPG is to provide a public-facing process for nomination of human genetic variants
that either have no existing mammalian research model or for which existing models are inadequate. The
JCPG will establish a process that allows nominees to submit variant candidates through a JCPG web portal
located on the JAX website (www.jax.org). These nominations will undergo a review process to evaluate
feasibility, scientific and community need, and then prioritize the nomination for entry into the pipeline for model
production. The JCPG Program Manager will communicate directly with the nominee throughout the process.
AIM 4. Outreach and External Communication. The impact of the JCPG is directly related to the number of
projects that are nominated and complete development. To maximize awareness for all potential entities that
might need new mouse models for research and testing we will: i) leverage an existing extensive network of
disease foundations and clinical partners to promote contacts with similar entities that might need mouse
models and, ii) employ the extensive marketing and outreach infrastructure of JAX Mice, Clinical and Research
Services (JMCRS) to bring worldwide awareness to JCPG activities, models, tools and services."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease (NTM-LD) is a silent and emerging epidemic in the U.S. and many
parts of the world.1-3 The incidence and prevalence of NTM-LD is increasing yearly and now far exceeds that of
tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in the U.S.4 Two of the greatest known risk
factors for NTM-LD are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pre-existing bronchiectasis.3 In the
U.S., approximately 12 million individuals have COPD, the third leading cause of death in the U.S.5 In addition,
the co-occurrence of bronchiectasis in patients with known COPD is up to ~70%.6 Like TB, the requirement for
prolonged combination drug therapy is a central tenet of NTM-LD treatment. Consequently, it is essential that
several drugs be administered concurrently to maximize sterilizing activity. While TB has benefited from the
development of rapid molecular diagnostic tests to simultaneously detect infection and antimicrobial resistance
and from recently approved new drugs, the diagnosis and treatment of NTM-LD have not experienced similar
advances.7,8 The diagnosis of NTM-LD is complicated by the fact that clinical manifestations and radiographic
findings for pulmonary TB and NTM-LD may be virtually indistinguishable. Thus, it is important when
diagnosing NTM-LD to “rule out” TB even in regions of lower prevalence of the disease, such as the U.S.,
because treatment for TB and NTM-LD are substantially different. To differentiate TB from NTM-LD, clinicians
must rely on a combination of phenotypic assays and molecular tests to identify the etiological agent and to
detect resistance to key antibiotics. Hence, the algorithm for contemporary NTM diagnostic testing is complex,
requiring varied testing methodologies, which are either insensitive (acid-fast bacilli smear), inherently slow to
obtain the results (culture; up to 6 weeks), or insufficiently comprehensive (lack of molecular tests).
Molecular detection of NTM and its antimicrobial resistance from respiratory samples is challenging. The
specimen type (sputum) is viscous and highly heterogeneous; bacterial burden is often low but significant;
mycobacteria are difficult to lyse; the number of clinically relevant NTM species is considerable; and the
polymorphisms that confer drug resistance are numerous. To address these challenges, we propose to
automate and integrate the following into a one user-step test: chaotic mixing of glass beads using a rotating
magnetic disc to homogenize sputa and lyse bacilli, a porous disc in a pipette tip to purify and concentrate
nucleic acid, and a Lab-on-a-Film test to speciate and detect polymorphisms that confer drug resistance. For
Phase 2, we propose to develop a test that can rule in/out TB, speciate clinically-relevant NTM, and detect
NTM-LD drug resistance markers. To evaluate this test, we propose to perform clinical studies at Mayo Clinic,
National Jewish Health, and Wadsworth Center in collaboration with clinical NTM-LD experts, which includes
members of: the Journal of Clinical Microbiology Editorial Board, Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
Working Group, fellows of the American Academy of Microbiology and Board of Governors of the Academy."

This is the renewal of an international collaboration that addressed key issues regarding pathophysiological
mechanisms and therapeutic potentials for neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD; i.e., afferent sensitization) and
detrusor overactivity (DO; i.e., micromotion). We have identified clinically relevant effects of phosphodiesterase
type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, sildenafil and tadalafil, on lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction in mice with acrolein-
induced cystitis or T8-T9 spinal cord transection (SCT). We now demonstrate improved physiological parameters
including decreased non-voiding contractions, afferent sensitization, micromotion and neuronal and stretch-
induced ATP release; there are also increased intercontractile intervals and compliance. Moreover, we achieved
these results whilst overcoming reliance on nitric oxide (NO•), by using the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
activator, BAY 58-2667 (cinaciguat), which counteracts key limitations of PDE5 inhibitors which render them
clinically ineffective when there is nitrergic nerve damage or oxidative stress causing decreased NO• production
and inactivation of sGC, respectively, both events commonly occur with NBD/DO.
Sildenafil/tadalafil inhibit PDE5 as they are structural analogs of cGMP but are ineffective if NO• is not produced
or the sGC heme is oxidized (Fe3+) as NO• can only bind to reduced heme (Fe2+). Cinaciguat, which is not an
analog of cGMP, directly activates sGC and the conversion of GTP to cGMP in the absence of NO• or with an
oxidized heme due to inhibition of CyB5R3 which keeps heme in the reduced state. Thus, cinaciguat may be
effective in patients refractory to PDE5 inhibitors due to decreased NO• production or sGC inactivation.
Clinical responses to PDE5 inhibitors used to treat LUT symptoms and now cinaciguat, involve increased protein
kinase G (PKG) signaling which alters the behavior of several cell types. In afferent nerves it reduces firing, in
efferent nerves it decreases ATP release, in urothelial cells it reduces stretch-induced ATP release, and in
detrusor there appears to be an indirect relaxing effect on smooth muscle via interstitial cells (ICs).
We propose to evaluate LUT sensory, motor and reflex behavior in C57BL/6 mice of both sexes in response to
cinaciguat. For NBD, we will again use intravesical instillation of acrolein, a transient receptor potential ankyrin-
1 (TRPA1) receptor agonist and for DO, SCT. The University of Pittsburgh team will use in vivo and in vitro
approaches to study peripheral LUT functions and the University of Bristol group, the in situ decerebrate arterially
perfused mouse (DAPM) to study centrally mediated LUT reflexes, as they relate to the NO•-sGC-PKG pathway.
We will also employ NADPH cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CyB5R3) knockout mice, with selective deletions in
smooth muscle and nerves rendering these relevant tissues unresponsive to NO• (and PDE5 inhibitors) but not
sGC activators. Cinaciguat has passed phase 1 safety trials for non-urological pathologies so the proposed
studies have considerable clinical relevance and translational potential."
10905199,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Surgical outcomes for patients with intractable epilepsy are modest, in large part due to mis-localization
of seizure generators. Currently, epileptologists localize seizure generators by manually identifying the seizure
onset zone on intracranial EEG. There is also abundant interictal EEG data (between seizures) that is largely
ignored because, until now, clinicians lacked rigorous approaches to interpret this data. Recent work by Dr.
Conrad, her co-authors, and others, validated two quantitative methods to analyze interictal EEG: interictal
epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and functional connectivity (FC). This work demonstrates that quantitative
analysis of IEDs and FC reveals regions — referred to here as hubs — that help identify seizure generators
(Conrad et al., Brain, 2020; Conrad et al., Network Neuroscience, 2020). This proposed project will evaluate
IED and FC hubs in order to elucidate their mechanisms and their potential utility in surgical planning.
 The central hypothesis of this proposal is that epilepsy measurably alters the interictal network, allowing
us to probe seizure generators with interictal data. The objectives of the proposal are: to determine the
temporal stability and spatial correspondence between IED and FC hubs (Aim 1), to determine if these hubs
localize seizure generators (Aim 2), and to actively probe the interictal network with cortical stimulation to verify
hypothesized FC hubs (Aim 3). These studies will expand our understanding of epileptic networks. If
successful, quantitative analysis of interictal EEG will enhance localization of seizure generators and improve
surgical outcomes.
 This proposed project will also provide critical career development training to Dr. Conrad, an Epilepsy
Instructor at University of Pennsylvania. The proposal builds on Dr. Conrad's background in quantitative EEG
analysis and clinical epilepsy. Dr. Conrad will be mentored by Brian Litt, a world-renowned expert in
computational epilepsy; Danielle Bassett, a leading expert in network theory; and Eric Marsh, a leading expert
in quantitative IED analysis. The training plan in this proposal includes mentored completion of the proposed
research, as well as a rigorous program of didactics, workshops, lab meetings, and directly relevant clinical
work. Together, these experiences will provide essential training in time-series statistics, machine learning,
subject enrollment, cortical stimulation, and EEG data acquisition. This proposed project and training plan will
launch Dr. Conrad on an independent research career focused on using a multimodal approach to evaluating
interictal data in order to improve our understanding and treatment of epilepsy."
10901509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane domain receptors that make up the largest
class of proteins in the mammalian genome. When activated by an appropriate ligand, these receptors elicit
specific and coordinated cellular responses that dictate a wide variety of physiological processes. One such
receptor that I have begun to investigate is GPR39. While initial studies reported that zinc is the endogenous
ligand, more recent reports demonstrated that zinc acts as an allosteric potentiator of GPR39 signaling. Although
the endogenous ligand for GPR39 is still unclear, synthetic ligands have been key in understanding GPR39
signaling and have implicated functions for GPR39 in the heart, bone, skin, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract.
However, despite its well-recorded abundance in the kidney, there have been no published studies into its role
in renal physiology. In preliminary data, I find that GPR39 localizes to principal cells (AQP2-positive) in the inner
medullary collecting duct, and data from our collaborators indicates that GPR39 activation influences renal water
handling. I therefore hypothesize that GPR39 activation inhibits water reabsorption by sequestering
AQP2 in sub-cellular compartments. In agreement with this hypothesis, I find that treatment of collecting duct
cells in vitro with a GPR39-specific agonist, cpd1324, altered dDAVP-induced AQP2 localization. Here, I propose
two Specific Aims to uncover the mechanistic role that GPR39 plays in renal water handling. In Aim 1, I will
examine three potential mechanisms by which GPR39 activation influences AQP2 trafficking in vitro. Aim 1A will
test whether GPR39 activation inhibits AVPR2 expression and activity, and Aims 1B/C will test whether GPR39
activation inhibits forward trafficking (Aim 1B) or promotes reverse trafficking of AQP2 (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, I will
determine the physiologic function of GPR39 in wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) animals under conditions of
water restriction and rehydration after water restriction. To do this, I will quantify changes in parameters including
drinking volume, plasma sodium, urinary osmolality, and urinary output in WT and KO animals at baseline and
after intervention. In addition, I will perform molecular analyses on renal tissues to monitor changes in AQP2
expression, phosphorylation status, and localization. Together, the experiments in this proposal will provide key
insight into both the mechanism (Aim 1) and the physiological role (Aim 2) that GPR39 plays in kidney physiology."
10901017,"Approved medications and available treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) do not adequately address long-
term changes in cravings, motivation, and mood; thus, while tragic, it is not surprising that between 60-90% of
individuals with OUD experience relapse, even following inpatient rehabilitation. Currently available treatments
for OUD target the µ opioid receptor (MOR) – the primary target responsible for opioids’ reinforcing properties.
Changes in MOR expression and signaling contribute to dysphoria and gastrointestinal disruptions that plague
dependent individuals during acute opioid withdrawal (Christie, 2008), and MOR agonist medications are
available to sate aberrant MOR function to attenuate withdrawal symptoms (Blanco and Volkow, 2019). While
these medications are critical tools for promoting public health, they have a limited ability to ameliorate
persistent opioid cravings that can last long into abstinence (Volkow and Blanco, 2020). To combat this dire
problem with breakthrough treatments, we desperately need to identify new molecular targets that can be
harnessed to remediate long-term opioid craving and vulnerability to relapse.
Prefrontal cortex (PFC) somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SST-INs) regulate the top-down control of
motivated and affective behaviors. Because SST-INs arise from genetically-distinct progenitors and display
specialized signaling pathways relative to other cell types, precise efforts to identify molecules selectively
expressed by SST-INs are likely to yield druggable targets with minimized risk of adverse effects.
Pharmacologically modulating SST-INs therefore represents a promising avenue towards developing
breakthrough treatments for OUD. To that end, the goal of this proposal is to identify and validate G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed by SST-INs that could be targeted in OUD. GPCR signaling pathways
regulate nearly every aspect of cellular physiology, including synaptic plasticity, membrane physiology, protein
translation, and gene expression. Through their profound abilities to regulate cell biology and brain function,
GPCRs transmit the effects of hormones, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, and nearly every major
neurotransmitter. In this proposal, we will take an unbiased transcriptomics approach to identify GPCR
transcripts expressed in SST-INs whose expression changes following long-access fentanyl self-
administration. We will then use electrophysiology, behavioral techniques, pharmacology, and genetic
engineering to define how candidate GPCRs regulate PFC activity and to begin determining whether such
receptors comprise promising targets for OUD medications."
10900895,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Spatial disorientation (SD) or wandering is a key feature of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), affecting up to 93% of
people living with AD. SD is characterized by inability to navigate even familiar environments, and brain
regions involved in spatial navigation and memory are compromised in AD. One such brain region is the
retrosplenial cortex, a vital node for integration of orientation-relevant inputs for spatial navigation and memory.
Lesion studies revealed that retrosplenial damage results in SD and anterograde amnesia, mirroring some
navigational and memory deficits seen in AD. Retrosplenial hypometabolism is a well-known AD feature,
suggesting that dysfunction of the retrosplenial cortex is an important factor in AD pathophysiology.
We identified a unique, region-defining cell-type that is the key recipient of elemental orientation information in
the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG): the low-rheobase (LR). LR cells comprise ~80% of all pyramidal
neurons in RSG L2/3. Unlike neighboring excitatory cell types, LR cells are non-adapting, have high input
resistance, narrower spike width, and distinctly low rheobase. We showed that LR cells selectively receive
inputs from the anterior thalamus (ATh) (which contains head direction cells). These orientation-relevant inputs
largely avoid the neighboring regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells, highlighting the importance of LR cells in
supporting RSG spatial orientation functions and the potential importance of understanding how LR neurons
and their inputs are altered in AD. To date, no studies have explored cell-type-specific alterations in RSG
circuits in AD models, representing an important gap in knowledge. Thus, there is a critical need to pinpoint
components of the RSG circuit that are impaired in AD models.
In this project, we will systematically dissect RSG circuitry in AD murine genetic models. Our central
hypothesis is that RSG circuits will be impaired in a cell-type specific way in preclinical AD, depending on the
precise circuit connectivity of the neuron. In Aim 1, we will study the biophysical changes in each cell type at
two age points in two distinct mouse models of AD that both show deficits in spatial orientation-related
behaviors. We will do so in both male and female mice. This will help to generate a cell-type specific
physiological map of RSG dysfunction in AD. RSG dysfunction in AD may not be entirely due to changes to
neurons within the RSG. In Aim 2, using optogenetics and pharmacology, we will dissect how cholinergic
inputs control RSG neurons themselves (Aim 2A) and the ATh synapses onto RSG neurons (Aim 2B) in AD+
versus null littermates. This will again be studied across both male and female mice at two age points in two
preclinical models of AD. The completion of these Aims will help to identify precise, cell-type-specific
components of the RSG circuit that are impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. This will in turn help to develop more
precise circuit-specific therapeutics aimed at rescuing wandering symptoms in people living with AD."
10901543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell division is a complex process that is tightly regulated by the activation and inactivation of a series of proteins
that ensure the proper segregation of genetic material into two daughter cells. Misregulation of key mitotic events,
including chromosome alignment and segregation, can lead to genetic mutation that promotes abnormal cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis. To better understand cell division and its misregulation in human disease, we
performed a genetic RNAi screen for novel mitotic regulators and identified the phosphatase DUSP12. While
DUSP12 has been shown to possess pro-survival attributes, it is unclear if this is related to its potential role in
cell division. Preliminary proteomic analyses of DUSP12 using affinity- and proximity-based approaches coupled
to mass spectrometry identified ZPR9 as a potential interactor of DUSP12 which has been validated by in-cell
and in-vitro IP assays. Previous studies have shown that ZPR9 may play a role in apoptosis, but it is unclear if
and how ZPR9 participates in cell division and, more so, how it promotes cell death. The central hypothesis of
this project is that DUSP12 is a novel mitotic regulator and it influences cell fate by de-phosphorylating
its target substrates, including ZPR9, which plays a critical role in the processes of cell death and
proliferation. Aim 1 will characterize how DUSP12 modulation influences mitotic progression. Using cancer cell
lines as a model system and leveraging advanced imaging techniques, we will explore the temporal and spatial
activity of DUSP12 and its impact on key mitotic events and machinery. Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular
mechanisms through which DUSP12 influences cell death and survival and if and how this applies to its role in
cell division. These studies will bring new insights to our understanding of the importance of protein
phosphatases for cell division, advancing our understanding of the full complement of proteins required for mitotic
regulation and their relevance to human health and disease. Collectively, this work will provide insights into the
mechanism and regulatory role of the phosphatase DUSP12 during cell division as well as form the basis for
designing novel therapeutic approaches to address diseases associated with abnormal proliferation."

 Malaria and growth faltering continue to be major causes of child morbidity and mortality in sub-
Saharan Africa where over 400,000 children under the age of 5 die from malaria1 and 57 million children are
stunted2 each year. Given the high co-prevalence of these conditions in the region, interventions that
synergistically address both malaria and growth failure may have a larger impact on child health than individual
efforts to prevent either condition.3 There is increasing evidence that malaria infections in pregnancy and
childhood may contribute to poor growth outcomes through increased risks of low birthweights4–9, systemic
inflammation10–15, and gut microbiome dysbiosis16–19. Maternal and neonatal factors are the most influential for
child growth20–22, so there is a critical need to identify interventions that prevent these malaria-associated risks
in pregnancy and early childhood to reduce long-term growth faltering. Intermittent preventative treatments in
pregnancy (IPTp) and childhood (IPTc), where pregnant women and young children are regularly given anti-
malarial drugs, have emerged as key strategies to control malaria in high-transmission settings. These
treatments have been shown to effectively lower malaria infections and could subsequently improve child
growth outcomes, but no prior studies have systematically assessed the impact of IPTp and IPTc on growth
faltering. Here, we propose a study that aims to (1) evaluate the effect of IPTp and IPTc on child growth and
(2) investigate the causal pathways through which IPTp and IPTc affect child growth. We will leverage rich,
longitudinal data from two ongoing randomized trials of IPTp and IPTc in Uganda, allowing us to measure child
height and weight, inflammatory biomarkers, and gut microbiome composition over several years. Our findings
will improve our understanding of how malaria chemoprevention impacts child growth and may guide the
implementation of future interventions that target both malaria and growth faltering. This award will also
support the career development of Anna Nguyen, a doctoral student in the Department of Epidemiology and
Population Health at the Stanford School of Medicine. Through completing the proposed research, the
applicant will pursue training in (1) the epidemiology of maternal and child malaria, (2) causal inference
methods for longitudinal data, (3) gut microbiome data analysis for population health research, and (4)
responsible conduct of global health research. The applicant will be supported by a mentorship team
comprising of experts in casual inference methods, malaria intervention trials, gut microbiome analyses, and
global health research. Through this fellowship, the applicant will develop strong methodological skills, gain
subject expertise, and become a more independent epidemiologic researcher. The proposed study will provide
a strong foundation for the applicant’s future academic research career and position her to become a leader in

trypanosomes (Trypanosoma sp.), the causative agents of human and animal African
trypanosomiases, which impart a significant health and socioeconomic burden in sub-Saharan
Africa. While only a small percentage of tsetse are infected with trypanosomes, they all house a
mixed population of indigenous endosymbiotic bacteria, including Sodalis glossinidius. S.
glossinidius resides in tsetse’s midgut, which is exposed to large amounts of imbibed blood.
The central hypothesis underlying the work proposed in this application is that S. glossinidius
colonization of the tsetse gut requires expression of a suite of genes that enables the bacterium
to access nutrients from and survive within this blood-rich environment. The scientific goals of
this project are to examine these hypotheses. In specific aim 1, S. glossinidius transposon
libraries will be screened for candidate genes that contribute to fitness in blood. In specific aim
2, clean mutations in the candidate blood fitness genes will be generated and the mutants will
be characterized for in vitro growth and survival phenotypes in blood components. In specific
aim 3, the S. glossinidius strains with null mutations in blood fitness genes will be tested for their
ability to colonize the tsetse flies. Because a positive correlation exists between the density of S.
glossinidius and the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse’s midgut, a more complete

10874390,"Veterans that experience traumatic brain injury often exhibit profound and debilitating sleep, impairments in their
brain wave activity, and dysregulated brain vascular functions. Disturbed sleep can impair mood, the ability to
work, cognition, relationships, and overall quality of life. Traumatic brain injury results in localized damage to the
brain inducing long-term increased inflammation and impairments in cerebral blood flow. Evidence indicates that
traumatic brain injury damage increases oxidative stress in the brain—a process known to induce inflammatory
molecules in brain cells, such as glia and neurons, that alters brain vascular functions. Interestingly, growing
evidence suggests that inflammation affects brain vascular functions and that vascular functions change during
sleep, although the exact mechanism responsible for these effects are not well understood. The goal of this
proposal is to determine how traumatic brain injury induces a major sleep regulatory inflammatory pathway
affected by oxidative stress in dysregulating sleep, brain wave activity, and brain vascular functions. We
hypothesize that traumatic brain injury drives oxidative stress to induce chronic brain inflammation impairing
brain vascular functions to impair sleep and brain wave activity. We use molecular and cellular techniques,
polysomnography, and vascular measurements in animal models for the aims of this project. Aim 1 determines
how components of a major sleep regulatory inflammatory pathway that is induced by oxidative stress is
activated in the brain by traumatic brain injury resulting in dysregulated sleep, brain wave activity and vascular
functions. Aim 2 examines how this major sleep regulatory inflammatory pathway is activated by traumatic brain
injury to induce both local and regional changes in brain vascular functioning and brain wave activity during
sleep. Data obtained from this project will provide critical information to understand the relationship between
inflammation and brain vascular functions on sleep and brain wave activity occurring from traumatic brain injury.
Thus, the findings from this project will provide information about novel targets involved in sleep dysregulation
which will lead to the future development of novel treatments for veterans with traumatic brain injury."

Deficits in cognitive control are at the core of much cognitive decline experienced by many older adults, often
leading to functional decline and eventually dementia. The rapidly growing segment of the population facing
such cognitive decline has the potential to negatively impact society broadly and it has been estimated that
maintaining or improving cognition in older adults (OA) could potentially prevent or delay the onset of an
estimated 10 million new cases of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Given the lack of success in
discovering effective pharmacological or preventative therapies to prevent dementias, developing targeted
interventions to remediate cognitive deficits is vital. To this end, we developed a novel closed-loop, digital
meditation intervention (MediTrain) that was designed to improve regulation of focused attention in healthy OA.
In a mechanistic RCT, we recently showed that MediTrain lead to broad improvements in cognitive control, with
the greatest gains seen in a subgroup of OA with cognitive deficits (i.e., MCI-like). In addition, this intervention
led to reduced stress reactivity and improvements in cellular markers of aging. A goal of this proposal will be to
extend the scope of our intervention by conducting a mobile RCT (mRCT) in a large sample, recruited nationally,
who will complete the study entirely on mobile devices, providing the statistical power to perform planned
moderator and subgroup analyses to understand the sources of variability in treatment response. Another
important question that emerged from our initial RCT of MediTrain in OA was: what is the minimal and/or optimal
dose of the intervention required to achieve the benefits we observed? Thus, this proposed research will tackle
two specific aims: First, we will conduct in a large, mRCT of MediTrain in OA at varying doses of treatment to
determine the minimum effective dose required for cognitive improvement and stress reduction. Second, we will
examine the moderating effect of cognitive decline on treatment effects. We will also include an exploratory aim
to examine the impact of potential genetic (Alzheimer’s polygenic hazard scores), physiological (cardiovascular
risk), and social (race/ethnicity) moderators on the treatment effects. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct
a large-scale mRCT of MediTrain deployed on mobile devices in a diverse, nation-wide sample of OA (N = 3240),
who will complete the study entirely on mobile devices. This large, national cohort will provide the sample size
necessary to examine individual and subgroup differences in treatment response across a diverse swath of the
general population. All participants will complete baseline, immediate follow-up, and 6-month follow-up
assessments of cognitive and functional outcomes. We anticipate that this unique methodological approach and

The Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) is an ongoing multicenter program designed to study clinical and
health aspects of female pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island (WIH) is a
women’s hospital, uniquely focused on advancing women’s health and research and its mission is directly in
line with the PFDN. In Cycles #3-4, the Brown/WIH site demonstrated that we have the scientific expertise,
high clinical volume, research infrastructure, administrative commitment, and translational collaborators
needed to be successful in this Network. We have made substantive contributions at all levels: scientifically our
site initiated 2 primary protocols: ESTEEM (completed), BioLIFT (ongoing) and 2 supplementary studies: AIM
(completed) and PPAR (ongoing). We were in the top tier for recruitment with outstanding retention, we made
major administrative contributions, and we developed successful advocacy initiatives promoting PFDN studies
in southern New England to help ensure a diverse study population. The objective of this application is for
Brown/WIH to continue as a major contributor to the PFDN in Cycle #5 through the following aims: 1) ensure
leadership in protocol development and implementation, data quality, dissemination, and active support of all
PFDN administrative functions; 2) maintain and continuously maximize our position as a top site in recruitment
and retention; 3) develop innovative and translational concepts to scientifically advance the field by working
with multi-disciplinary experts enthusiastic about collaboration with the PFDN; and 4) ensure the highest quality
of care and research for women with PFDs in New England through wider-reaching advocacy efforts. We also
have a long-standing, formal relationship with clinical collaborators committed to advancing the care of women
with PFDs led by Urogynecology (including Urology, Colorectal Surgery, Women’s Gastroenterology, Women’s
Physical Therapy, and Women’s Radiology). Thus far in 2021 YTD, the Division of Urogynecology saw 2,119
new PFD patients and performed surgery on 710 patients; vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopic, robotic
approaches all represented. New components in this application that will further increase our productivity as a
PFDN site in Cycle #5 include: addition of outreach clinics and surgical block time dedicated to our division due
to anticipated higher clinical volumes; expanded advocacy and community outreach through engagement of
minority community leaders and New England colleagues, improved infrastructure to increase PFDN access
for underrepresented populations, and collaboration and commitment of experts in tissue regenerative
techniques, biomarkers, microbiome, and memory and aging research that can lead to new discoveries in
PFDs. Brown/WIH has a multi-faceted application and is uniquely qualified for the opportunity to continue as a

10874576,"It is estimated that fibrosis contributes to 45 percent of all deaths in the developed world. Inflammatory fibrosis
is the histological manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The critical unresolved question in the field is
the actual trigger and mechanism for the persistent low-grade inflammation in fibrosis. We propose that cytosolic
nucleotide (RNA and DNA) sensing pathways plays key role in inflammatory fibrosis in CKD. Cytosolic DNA and
double stranded, modified RNA is associated with infections is rapidly recognized by cytosolic pattern recognition
receptors (cPRR) including the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–
stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Activation of RLR and STING, usually via the TBK1 (TANK-binding)
kinase, NFkB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and IRF3/7 transcription factors
will trigger the production cytokines, chemokines, activate dendritic cells, and promote T cell expansion, creating
a fibroinflammatory milleu in the kidney.
In this project; We will explore the cause of excessive activation of cytosolic DNA and RNA sensors in
inflammatory fibrosis. Systematically map cytosolic DNA and RNA: A) expression of TEs and ERVs B) cytosolic
mitochondrial DNA in kidneys of patients and mouse models of CKD and fibrosis and their correlation with
cytosolic DNA and RNA sensors. We will define the contribution of myeloid and epithelial, DNA (cGAS/STING)
and RNA (RIG-I, MDA5) sensing pathways to inflammatory fibrosis in mouse models. We will examine whether
genetic variants observed in cytosolic RNA and DNA sensing pathway associated genes (TREX1, TRIM6 and
IRF5) contribute to kidney disease development in patients."

Central nervous system (CNS) control of metabolism plays a pivotal role in maintaining energy homeostasis.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1, encoded by Gcg), secreted by a distinct population of neurons located within
the
Nucleus Tractus Solitarius, suppresses feeding. Central and peripheral GLP-1 work independently to
suppress feeding
. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms mediating endogenous GLP-1 action in the CNS
are still poorly understood. This is mainly due to the presence of diverse neuronal subtypes, complex central
neuronal connectivity, and the lack of molecular tools that can directly detect GLP-1 release in the brain.
Addressing the CNS mechanism of GLP-1 will help develop more tailored treatment for intervention of obesity.
Our overarching goal is to gain a mechanistic understanding of endogenous GLP-1 release and its functions in
the CNS in a cell type- and circuit-defined manner. In a previous study,
we found that NTS GLP-1 projection to
the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission, which is
sufficient to suppress food intake, and ablation of PVN GLP-1R causes overeating and obesity. These results
highlight the potential role of central GLP-1 in regulating energy homeostasis. However, GLP-1 signaling is
complex due to the heterogeneity of PVN region GLP-1R neurons which form synapses with the dorsal motor
nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) neurons and release glutamate, while also releasing g-aminobutyric-acid in
the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST). DMV and BNST may mediate food intake behavior differentially, i.e.
homeostatic vs. hedonic feedings, but the roles that the PVN GLP-1R neurons-to-DMV and BNST projections
play remains unexplored. Moreover, using our recently developed optical sensors for GLP-1, termed Reporter
for Transmission mediated by G protein-coupled Receptor, we found the timing of GLP-1 release into the PVN
is inversely related to eating bouts. We thus hypothesize that circuit and neuronal subtype-dependent
endogenous GLP-1 signaling in the PVN regulates eating patterns (e.g. meal timing and sizes), energy
expenditure, and food rewards. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the temporal dynamics of GLP-1
release and neuronal activity in the PVN during feeding episodes; and we will test the hypothesis that GLP-1
signaling regulates homeostatic and motivational feeding via different neuronal pathways. The results of this
study will advance our conceptual understanding of the regulatory effects of endogenous GLP-1, facilitating the
development of neuropeptide-targeting clinical interventions for eating disorders and obesity."

Populations must be able to adapt in environmental conditions that may change either suddenly
(within one generation) or gradually (over multiple generations). Theoretical models predict that
these differences in the rate of environmental change will fundamentally influence the number
and effect sizes of mutations that fix, but few studies have mechanistically examined the genetics
of adaptation in environments that become more stressful over time. Moreover, the theoretical
models do not always account for well-known phenomena that introduce evolutionary constraints,
such as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions and pleiotropy. The goal of this research is
to compare patterns of genome evolution and effects of mutations in RNA viruses under sudden
or gradual environmental change, and to use these data to evaluate theoretical models of
adaptation in environments that change at different rates. The project uses temperature-resistant
populations of the model bacteriophage ɸ6 Cystovirus that were previously generated through an
evolution experiment in which viral populations were exposed to a heat shock temperature that
was increased either gradually (Gradual populations) or suddenly (Sudden populations). Here,
we propose to use these populations to examine patterns of mutation fixation and to characterize
the role of GxE interactions and pleiotropy in environments that change at different rates.
Specifically, we will 1) evaluate the number of mutations, their times to fixation, and haplotype
diversity of Sudden and Gradual populations; and 2) measure the effects of sequential mutations
from select lineages on both viral thermostability and growth rate, and correlate those effects with
the rate of environmental change experienced by the lineage. Our study will address the central
question in evolutionary biology of how changes to the strength and tempo of selection influence
adaptation, and will illuminate the mechanistic underpinnings of adaptation in different rates of
environmental change. Establishing the selective pressures and constraints at play in changing
environments will give us tools to predict or control viral evolution."

 Even with recent improvements in the early identification of hearing loss, children with mild bilateral
hearing loss (MBHL) continue to experience significant delays in communication, social, and academic
outcomes due to uncertainty about the benefits of hearing aids for this population. The lack of clinical protocols
and tools that are sensitive to the listening needs of children with MBHL contribute to this uncertainty. Children
with MBHL often perform like children with normal hearing on current clinical outcome measures. The goal of
this proposal is to develop novel clinical protocols and tools that are sensitive to the challenges faced by
children with MBHL. Current hearing-aid candidacy criteria based on the audiogram do not adequately quantify
the effects of the child’s ear-canal acoustics and self-generated noise on their thresholds. Aim 1 of the
proposal will be to develop audibility-based hearing-aid candidacy tools for children with MBHL that account for
ear-canal acoustics and self-generated noise. Novel audiological assessment methods will allow for
quantification of these factors and for the development of hearing-aid candidacy criteria based speech
audibility that are not possible with current methods. Aim 2 of the proposal will be to validate clinical measures
of speech recognition with speech maskers, reverberation, and overhearing that reflect real-world difficulties of
children with MBHL. The reduction in audibility for low-intensity sounds is the main consequence of MBHL,
which leads to difficulty segregating a target talker from a background talker, understanding speech in noise
with reverberation, and problems with overhearing distant talkers. Clinical speech recognition tasks that reflect
these specific listening challenges will be developed and validated. Aim 3 of the proposal will be to perform a
clinical validation of a new test battery for hearing assessment, hearing-aid candidacy, and outcomes for
children with MBHL. In collaboration with leading pediatric audiology centers around the U.S., the novel
assessment and speech recognition measures will be used to validate these measures with a large clinical
population of children with MBHL. The knowledge generated from this research will fundamentally improve the
diagnosis and management of MBHL during childhood."

Environmental nutrient availability and metabolism profoundly affects an individual’s health, while deregulation
of nutrient signaling contributes to many diseases, including cancer. Nutrient signaling and metabolism
regulate the epigenome to affect cellular phenotype and function, yet mechanisms explaining how nutrients
signal to the epigenome are lacking. Defining these mechanisms constitutes a critical scientific problem that is
essential to address. By defining these mechanisms, we will understand how nutrient exposures affect health,
and how aberrant nutrient signaling causes disease. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved nutrient activated signaling pathway. MTORC1 responds to diverse
nutrient and metabolic inputs to promote cell growth and proliferation, and it is deregulated in cancer and other
diseases. While mTORC1 is an emerging epigenetic regulator, how it signals to the epigenome is unknown. In
this project, we will use a yeast model to build on our previous successes to define these mechanisms. Herein,
we will test the overarching hypothesis that TORC1 signaling controls the chromatin binding of architectural
proteins and histone reader proteins that maintain viability during nutrient stress and regulate metabolic gene
expression. In Aim I, we will identify specific epigenetic pathways acting on histone H3 that promote binding of
high mobility group box (HMGB) proteins to chromatin to prevent cell death under nutrient stress conditions.
We then will define biochemically and genetically how non-chromatin bound HMGB proteins cause cell death
during TORC1 stress. Stressed human cells evict HMGB1 from chromatin to affect cytoplasmic metabolic
activities, initiate innate immune signaling and inflammation, and promote tumorigenesis. These yeast studies
will identify conserved epigenetic pathways that are critical for retaining HMGB1 on chromatin during mTORC1
stress to prevent such HMGB1-induced pathological effects. Aim II will use proteomic and genomic
approaches to define how yeast TORC1 represses conserved sirtuin histone deacetylase activity to regulate
histone reader chromatin binding and control mitochondrial metabolic transcription. We then will perform
mechanistic studies to assess how these histone reader proteins transcriptionally regulate metabolic gene
expression. By the project’s conclusion, we will have defined novel and conserved mechanisms used by
TORC1 to modify the epigenome, which prevent cell death during nutrient stress and regulate metabolic gene
transcription. These mechanisms will be directly relevant for understanding how human mTORC1 deregulation
alters the epigenome to cause disease."

Despite major gains in smoking cessation treatment, over half of recently quit smokers will relapse within the
first year. Two systematic reviews of relapse prevention studies came to different conclusions on effectiveness
of behavioral interventions. Existing evidence in relapse prevention is limited by study designs, methodology,
and conceptual approaches to behavioral interventions. Different approaches to relapse prevention studies,
and to the interventions themselves are needed to advance the long-term understanding and outcomes of
smoking relapse prevention. To date, relapse prevention interventions have focused on the newly abstinent
smoker (“abstainer”), and not attempted to directly or indirectly influence the abstainer’s personal network
(PN), e.g. by helping the abstainer influence others in their PN to quit. Personal networks exert powerful
effects on initiating and maintaining smoking behavior, and can facilitate maintaining abstinence or trigger
relapse. A “help others” intervention that seeks to increase the abstainer’s ability to influence smokers in their
PN to quit – thereby creating a PN social environment more supportive of long-term abstinence - may have a
beneficial effect on relapse. The Helpers SQ intervention encourages abstainers to reinforce their own
abstinence through helping others quit, and to proactively influence their PN to be more conducive to long-term
smoking abstinence. Framing relapse as a dynamic and complex process, the Helpers Stay Quit (Helpers SQ)
intervention is a conceptually novel approach to relapse prevention that integrates different behavioral theories
into a multifaceted intervention model presented as an on-line tobacco cessation brief intervention training.
Helpers SQ teaches abstainers how to encourage other tobacco users to quit and avoid relapse through a non-
confrontational “helping conversation” (HC) that encourages quitting and use of evidence-based cessation aids
(e.g. quitlines, cessation medications) without confrontation and nagging. Our pilot feasibility study of Helpers
SQ (N=104) with abstainers from Arizona’s state quitline compared 30-day abstinence at 7-months with a
propensity score matched sample from quitline clients not exposed to Helpers SQ. Preliminary results: Helpers
SQ participants reported higher 30-day abstinence than non-participants (82% vs. 36%, Difference = 46%
[95% CI: 37%, 56%, p<0.0001]). Encouraged by these results, we hypothesize that quitline abstainers exposed
to Helpers SQ will have higher 30-day and 7-day point prevalence abstinence than those receiving quitline
follow-up usual care, and that the effect of Helpers SQ may be mediated by PN characteristics. To test this
hypothesis, we propose a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (N=940) with embedded mixed-methods PN
study to assess the effect of Helpers SQ training on proportion and duration of abstainers’ abstinence over
time, and on abstainer’s PN interactions related to smoking and smoking cessation. Metrics derived from the
PN study will be used for mediational analyses of overall, and gender-based effects of Helpers SQ on smoking
relapse."

program that embeds foundational socio-emotional competencies in creative, artistic self-expression and
community engagement activities and fosters meaningful connections to peers and caring adults (key
ingredients of resilience). The proposed project uses a longitudinal design to determine whether a)
participation in the POPS program encourages growth in key developmental assets and socio-emotional
competencies that promote healthy development; b) compares relative change over six time points in
hypothesized protective factors (e.g., social connectedness, socioemotional competencies) across POPS,
matched comparison, and general population students; and c) assesses whether participating in the POPS
program curtails substance use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and promotes positive school outcomes
(GPA, standardized test scores, disciplinary events). In year 1, the proposed project will collect baseline data
and conduct a process evaluation of POPS program delivered in 3 high schools in AK, 8 in CA, and 8 in GA. In
years 2-3 the study will assess change in risk behavior, mental health, and school outcome trajectories of
POPS participants, matched comparison group, and general population students. The study will also explore
the role of sociocultural factors (e.g., perceived discrimination and ethnic identity) in developmental trajectories
and program outcomes and assess potential program moderators (e.g., gender, ethnicity, SES). Promoting
healthy behaviors and school achievement among youth impacted by household incarceration and associated

examining pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) in women. Our second goal is to bring innovative research proposals to
this Network with emphasis on translational aims that explore the pathophysiology and prevention of PFDs in
well-defined clinical study populations. A final goal is to lead as primary site a multicenter trial studying prevention
of urinary and fecal incontinence. To accomplish these aims, we describe the qualifications and experience of
the Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) faculty and research teams at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Hospital, the facilities and patient population available to
carry out clinical protocols, and our state-of-the-art scientific approaches to the study of PFDs. Our clinical and
research clinics serve both medically indigent patients (Parkland Hospital) and private, insured patients
(university practice) in the southern US. These clinics provide a diverse patient population which has allowed us
to continually be the lead recruiter of Latina women in the PFDN. Throughout Cycles III and IV, even when not
a full clinical site (Cycle III), we have remained committed to the successful retention and long-term follow-up of
our PFDN study participants. In Cycle IV, we actively partnered in all aspects of the PFDN including concept
proposal, committee participation, and manuscript preparation. Unique to our research team are urogynecology
basic and translational scientists whereby our site has led the effort to manage and direct the Biorepository for
the PFDN, which has remained housed at UT Southwestern for 15 years and has become integral to multiple
recent translational research endeavors. Further, the scientific resources and infrastructure within our Ob/Gyn
department are centrally focused on the role of proteomics, genomics, epigenetics and gene regulation in various
aspects of women’s health. Moreover, we continue to contribute scientifically with multiple publications and
ongoing writing team participation. Since 2015, when new hospitals opened for both UT Southwestern and
Parkland, the FPMRS clinic population base has been surging. The FPMRS physicians at UT Southwestern
remain dedicated to rigorous controlled trials intended to objectively evaluate principles of non-surgical and
surgical care consistent with the mission of the PFDN. With a growing, diverse clinical patient population, a
committed and seasoned research team with a pedigree of successful internal and external collaborations, and

10874492,"The maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a hallmark of the transition between adolescence to adulthood.
Because the PFC matures around 25 years of age, it is safe to say that most frontline soldiers are still during
adolescence. The Center of Disease Control and Prevention reports that service members have the highest
alcohol use of all queried professions. Moreover, alcohol use increases following combat deployment.
Therefore, most service members are exposed to large amounts of alcohol during a period that the PFC is still
immature. The PFC acts through top-down control to regulate the activity of many subcortical regions; and
doing so regulates and integrates emotional and stress responses, as well as motivation and reward seeking.
Taking the aforementioned facts together we hypothesize that “consumption of constant and high levels of
alcohol by service members, affects PFC development and makes these subjects more prone to develop
conditions that afflict our Veterans such as: altered stress response, addiction, depression, mood swings and
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Testing this hypothesis and its underlying mechanisms in an
appropriate animal model would make a great contribution to the field.
Unfortunately, current animal models have limitations in studying consequences of chronic alcohol use
restricted to late adolescence. For instance, rodents have a very short-late adolescence, making it difficult to
mimic a chronic and heavy alcohol consumption. In non-human primates, “late adolescence” is too long
making experiments very time consuming and costly. In this 3-year BLRD application, we propose to develop a
novel animal model that can mimic prolonged heavy alcohol consumption restricted to late adolescence.
Developing this model would pave the way to test how alcohol exposure during late adolescence can alter
dopaminergic neurotransmission and stress responses - making the prefrontal cortex vulnerable to “second
hits” such as high stress and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This information could help us understand why
Veterans are much vulnerable to mental health disorders and potentially devise therapeutic interventions."
10874639,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In recent decades, climate change has contributed to more frequent and extreme weather-related disasters
(EWRD), such as heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, storms and power outage (PO). The impact of these EWRDs
on human health has become a top public health priority. Research suggests that older adults, especially those
with low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority populations, are disproportionately vulnerable to disaster
hazards due to lack of access to the necessary resources for hazard mitigation or adaptation. What is now
needed is a much more comprehensive way to effectively address these disparities, by considering social and
contextual influences on both exposure and health responses to EWRDs. Currently, significant gaps remain in
our understanding of how all meteorological factors jointly affect health, and how health effects may differ during
transitional seasons. Major limitations on exposure assessment capacity, based on existing limited monitoring
sites in each state (particularly in rural areas), are also apparent. In addition, few large studies have attempted
to assess how the EWRDs-health may be modified by community and social contexts (e.g., greenness) in ways
that produce health disparities. To fill these gaps, the proposed study will test a central hypothesis that
vulnerable aging populations are particularly susceptible to the adverse health effects of extreme weather or
EWRDs. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Improve exposure assessment by generating high-resolution gridded
weather data; 2) Evaluate joint effects of multiple weather factors and disasters on cardio-respiratory diseases,
Alzheimer/dementia, injuries, and renal diseases in vulnerable older adults, as well as the modifying effects of
regional greenness and pandemic; and 3) Assess the impact of multiple community contextual factors in affecting
health during EWRDs by developing predictive models and vulnerability/resilience indices. Results will
serve as the basis for the development of effective communication strategies. HrGWD and weather simulations
will be created using a state-of-the-art, two-stage downscaling models based on unique Mesonet data. In addition
to utilizing NYS hospitalization and ED data, we will retrospectively follow-up readmission and other critical care
indicators in a unique 18-year dynamic cohort in NYS, while also evaluating US COVID-19 infection/death
rates after major EWRDs. We will use distributed lag non-linear models and interrupted time-series analysis to
evaluate the impacts of emergent EWRDs on the most common and fatal diseases among the aging population.
While causal influence analysis will be used to estimate the mediation effects from greenness and community
factors, a predictive model selected from over 300 factors at the community level will be developed to identify
vulnerability/resilience factors using machine-learning algorithms. Our multi-disciplinary and experienced

10893166,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tissue engineering provides a strategy for developing improved prosthetic biomaterials for use in congenital
heart surgery. The overriding premise of our work is that tissue engineering can be used to regenerate
autologous neotissue to repair or replace cardiovascular tissues that are congenitally malformed and that the
tissue engineered constructs will perform better than prosthetic biomaterials. We developed a tissue engineered
vascular graft (TEVG) specifically for use in congenital heart surgery and are currently performing a clinical trial
evaluating its safety as an extracardiac conduit in the Fontan operation in which a vascular graft is used to
connect the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary artery. The broad, long term objective of this study is to
translate this technology to the clinic for use in children with congenital heart disease. In order to obtain FDA
approval, we must demonstrate the efficacy of the TEVG in a relevant preclinical animal model. The goal of this
proposal is to evaluate the late term efficacy of TEVGs compared to PTFE grafts (the current clinical standard
of care) using the ovine IVC vascular interposition graft model which we previously developed and validated for
this purpose. To this end we propose three specific aims: In the first aim we will evaluate the physiological
properties of the TEVG implanted in the ovine model between 9-10 years including compliance and
vasoreactivity in addition to growth capacity. We will use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and invasive pressure
monitoring to measure and compare the compliance of the TEVG and native IVC in age- and sex-matched sheep
at various loading conditions. Next we will also use the IVUS and invasive pressure monitoring coupled with
pharmacological testing to evaluate and compare the response of the TEVG and the native IVC to various
pharmacological reagents at physiologically relevant doses. Finally, we will measure the change in size and
geometry of the TEVG using serial 3D angiography to rule out aneurismal dilation and determine the functional
growth capacity of the TEVG over the natural life span of the animals in our study. In our second aim we will use
computed tomography to evaluate and compare the degree of ectopic calcification between TEVGs and PTFE
grafts implanted in the ovine model. In the third aim we will evaluate and compare the hemodynamic performance
of TEVGs to PTFE grafts implanted in the ovine model using 4D MRI and invasive hemodynamic monitoring.
We will evaluate graft performance both at rest and during simulated stress using dobutamine stress testing then
use the 4D flow and invasive hemodynamic pressure data to analyze the degree of disordered flow and
associated energy loss within the grafts over cardiac and respiratory cycles at different hemodynamic states
using computational fluid dynamics. The development of an improved TEVG with growth capacity has the
potential to improve outcomes for children born with congenital heart disease."

IMMUNOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL STUDIES
PROJECT 1: Genetically-engineered pig kidney transplantation in baboons: reducing the
adaptive immune response and monitoring graft function (Project Lead: David K.C
Cooper)
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Considerable advances have been made in the results of life-supporting genetically-
engineered (GE) pig kidney transplantation (Tx) in nonhuman primates (NHPs), with graft and
recipient survival in months or even years. Since the barrier of the innate immune response has
largely been overcome, we will direct most of our attention to (i) reducing the adaptive immune
response, and (ii) investigating the potential physiological incompatibilities between pigs and
NHPs.
 We will first test kidney transplants from pigs with the most advanced genetic-
engineering to date, i.e., pigs with 8 genetic manipulations (8GE pigs), all aimed towards
protecting the kidney from the primate immune response. We will compare two
immunosuppressive regimens, in one using a novel costimulation blockade agent that has not
been tested in a xenotransplantation model previously. Using the preferred regimen, we will
then transplant kidneys from 8GE pigs additionally transgenic for expression of programmed
death ligand 1 (PG-L1), which should allow successful organ Tx with a reduced exogenous
immunosuppressive therapy. We predict that kidneys from these pigs, using the preferred
immunosuppressive regimen, will function for 6 months in the absence of immune-related injury,
thus allowing a comprehensive study of renal function to determine whether there are
physiological incompatibilities that might require attention.
 Offering patients with end-stage renal disease a timely pig kidney transplant without
excessive exogenous immunosuppressive therapy would allow many more patients to receive
kidney transplants, and reduce the need for chronic dialysis.

Parasitic nematodes impose a massive health and economic burden across much of the developing world,
infecting over one billion people worldwide. The morbidity and mortality inflicted by these devastating
pathogens is partly curtailed by mass drug administration (MDA) programs that depend on the continued
efficacy of a limited portfolio of anthelmintic drugs. Benzimidazole (BZ) compounds are a widely used class of
broad-spectrum anthelmintics that are an indispensable component of this limited chemotherapeutic arsenal.
The prospects of BZ resistance pose a serious threat to the future success of nematode control programs.
These prospects have been realized in the veterinary domain following intensive BZ use and are predicted to
materialize in human medicine with increased selection caused by expanded MDA. Early detection of
resistance-associated alleles in nematode parasite populations is essential to the goal of slowing anthelmintic
resistance and extending the lifespan of this critical drug class. Based on research in the free-living nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans from thirty years ago, parasitic nematode researchers focus on one BZ target, a
nematode-specific beta-tubulin. Despite this knowledge, it is still a complete mystery (1) whether any alleles
cause resistance (i.e. go beyond correlation), (2) the nematode tissues that are sensitive to BZ poisoning,
and (3) the drug-target interactions that cause resistance. In Haemonchus contortus, we have collected both
validated sensitive and resistance samples, and longitudinal samples where resistance has developed over
time. These samples are not available in any human parasitic nematode species. Using quantitative
resistance assays on these resources, we have shown that BZ resistance goes well beyond this single beta-
tubulin target. However, we do not know these independent resistance mechanisms in C. elegans or parasite
species. In Aim 1, we will test explicitly whether alleles correlated with resistance in parasites actually cause
resistance, test the fitness effects of these alleles, identify the tissues targeted by BZ, and characterize the
molecular mechanism for how beta-tubulin in affected by benzimidazoles. In Aim 2, we will discover beta-
tubulin independent mechanisms of resistance using the tractable C. elegans model nematode. In Aim 3, we
will expand our results to H. contortus where genomic and validated strain resources enable discoveries of
conserved resistance mechanisms. It is not possible in any parasitic nematode species to accomplish these
goals. New discoveries are possible only through this interplay between the model nematode C. elegans and
the tractable veterinary parasitic nematode H. contortus. Our results will have direct impacts on how
treatments are administered and resistance is monitored in human parasitic nematodes."

10898753,"Abstract
Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have transformed the once deadly HIV/AIDS disease into a manageable,
chronic infection. Yet, there are still a number of pressing problems associated with current ARTs, including
the necessity of daily administration of HIV-1 medications, suboptimal treatment adherence, and the
emergence of drug-resistant viral phenotypes. Therefore, there is a need for developing long-acting
antiretroviral agents targeting clinically unexploited viral proteins to mitigate the above problems. HIV-1
capsid protein is a novel, attractive target as its plays multiple essential roles during the virus life cycle.
GS-6207 (Lenacapavir, Gilead Sciences) is a recently discovered, first-in-class, long-acting, and ultra-
potent HIV-1 capsid inhibitor. Recently completed phase 1 clinical trials (NCT03739866) have suggested
advancement of GS-6207 into phase 2/3 clinical trials (NCT04143594/NCT04150068) with a six-month
dosing interval. Our research objective is to elucidate structural and mechanistic bases for a highly potent
antiviral activity of GS-6207 and exploit the knowledge obtained to develop second-generation inhibitors.
For this, we have synthesized and examined the antiviral activities of GS-6207. Consistent with the
multifaceted role of capsid in HIV-1 biology, the inhibitor potently (EC50 of ~55 pM) impaired incoming virus
and exhibited a second, slightly reduced (EC50 of ~314 pM) antiviral activity during virus egress. Mode-of-
action studies of GS-6207 revealed that the inhibitor blocks post-entry steps of infection by stabilizing and
thereby preventing functional disassembly of the capsid shell in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In addition,
GS-6207 interfered with capsid binding to the cellular HIV-1 cofactors Nup153 and CPSF6 that mediate
viral nuclear import and direct integration into gene-rich regions of chromatin. Our x-ray crystallography,
cryo-electron microscopy, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments have revealed that GS-6207
tightly binds two adjoining capsid subunits and promotes distal intra- and inter-hexamer interactions that
strikingly stabilize the curved capsid lattice. Furthermore, our high-resolution x-ray structure of GS-6207
bound to a capsid hexamer enabled us to map drug-resistant variants in close proximity to the GS-6207
binding site. This information will be critical for rational design of second-generation inhibitors. We propose
to extend these studies to better understand the multimodal, exceptionally potent antiviral activity of GS-
6207 during both early and late steps of HIV-1 replication. For this, we will pursue the following three
specific aims: Aim 1 will elucidate structural and mechanistic bases for inhibition of post-entry steps of HIV-
1 infection by GS-6207; Aim 2 will dissect underlying mechanisms of inhibition of virus production and
maturation by GS-6207; and Aim 3 will investigate the structural basis for viral drug-resistance to GS-6207
and rationally develop second-generation inhibitors with an enhanced barrier to resistance. Taken together,
the proposed studies will dissect the multimodal antiviral mechanism of action of GS-6207, provide new
insights into the viral biology of capsid, identify key inhibitor-capsid interactions and facilitate optimization
of this class of compounds for their clinical use."
10898760,"Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays an important role in mitochondria function by mediating
bioenergetics, biomass production, and redox balance, all essential processes for tumor progression,
metastasis, and survival. Thus, targeting OXPHOS holds great promise to treat PDAC. Metformin, a clinically
used OXPHOS inhibitor, has demonstrated increased survival in PDAC patients, suggesting that OXPHOS
inhibitors can safely be used to treat PDAC. A clearer picture is now emerging on the essential role of OXPHOS
in PDAC progression. For example, overexpression of OXPHOS genes correlates with poor prognosis in PDAC
patients, and suppression of mitochondrial oxygen consumption significantly retards PDAC progression. Drug
resistant PDAC cells ablated in KRAS are heavily dependent on OXPHOS and are sensitive to OXPHOS
inhibition. Pancreatic-tumor-initiating cells also show strong reliance on OXPHOS. Importantly, OXPHOS
inhibitors are synergistic with gemcitabine specifically in cells with high levels of OXPHOS-related genes.
Unfortunately, metformin has low potency and poor selectivity. Other classic OXPHOS inhibitors including
rotenone, antimycin A, and oligomycin, lack selectivity. We recently designed a series of highly potent OXPHOS
inhibitors (DX2-201 to DX3-236). Our ADMET-guided lead optimization campaign generated over 200 novel
analogues that led to the discovery of orally active OXPHOS inhibitors with nanomolar potency, acceptable
toxicity, and reasonable organ distributions to advance into clinical development. We profiled a set of 105 cancer
cell lines for their anti-proliferative response to DX analogues and found that our compounds profoundly inhibit
the proliferation of 5 out of 7 PDAC cell lines. Through the generation of drug resistance clones, followed by
whole exome sequencing, we identified NDUFS7 as the direct target of our lead compound DX2-201 in 6/6
clones. Our integrated multi-omics (RNA-seq, Bru-seq and mass spectrometry-based proteomics) studies
revealed down-regulation of DNA repair genes upon DX treatment. Our DX compounds also show significant
synergism with standard-of-care chemotherapy and several FDA-approved drugs. We hypothesize that
OXPHOS inhibitors will provide therapeutic benefit to PDAC patients, overcome drug resistance, and could be
safely and efficaciously combined with various drugs including immune checkpoint inhibitors. We will test this
hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To assess cytotoxicity of top 5 compounds as single agent
and in combination with standard chemotherapy as well as several early-stage clinical candidates in a large
panel of mouse and human PDAC cell lines. Aim 2. To perform MTD, full PK/PD studies, and to determine tissue
distribution and accumulation of top 5 compounds in mice. Aim 3. To determine the in vivo efficacy of top 5
compounds as single agents and in combination with standard-of-care drug(s) from Aim 1 in orthotopic and
GEMM models of KRAS driven pancreatic cancer."
10898761,"Abstract
 A major concern in cochlear implantation is the loss of residual hearing associated with surgery. Hence,
many candidates are faced with the decision to relinquish their remaining acoustic hearing in exchange for
electric hearing via the cochlear implant (CI). A potential solution is a stimulation strategy termed Electric acoustic
stimulation (EAS), which has been used to describe the ipsilateral combination of electric hearing via a CI and
acoustic hearing via a hearing aid. This, however, requires preservation of residual hearing, which has been
possible but inconsistent. A new technology to potentially improve hearing preservation, intraoperative
electrocochleography (ECochG), has been introduced and it was recently implemented into commercially
available CI systems.
 Studies comparing EAS with conventional CI have were able to demonstrate a performance benefit of EAS.
However, these studies have compared conventional CI candidates to EAS candidates with more residual
hearing. Thus, the clinical importance of residual acoustic hearing in cochlear implantation (CI) remains unclear.
 Therefore, the present protocol seeks to answer two critical clinical questions in cochlear implantation:
(Specific Aim 1) Are cochlear implant electrode insertions using Electrocochleography (ECochG) feedback better
for achieving hearing preservation (HP) and (Specific Aim 2) is combined ipsilateral EAS better than non-HP
(conventional) cochlear implantation among CI candidates with substantial residual hearing (EAS candidates).
 We plan to enroll and randomize EAS candidates in seven large US centers. Patients will be assigned to
either intraoperative ECochG monitoring or conventional CI electrode insertions. Hearing preservation and other
performance outcomes will be recorded and analyzed between the groups to assess the clinical value of
intraoperative monitoring. Further, subjects from both groups will have either useable or no useable residual
hearing as the result of surgery. Audiometric and patient reported performance outcomes will be obtained and
evaluated for 24 months following initial stimulation.
 In summary, the present proposal aims to answer two critical clinical questions: Is CI electrode insertion
based on ECochG better for achieving HP? and Is EAS better than conventional cochlear implantation among
EAS candidates? A positive answer to these questions will inform an evidence-based clinical practice for EAS
candidates that uses longer electrodes, broadens the candidate pool by including patients with greater levels of
residual hearing, and potentially improves outcomes following CI."
10898762,"The goal of this project is to discover fundamental epigenomic regulatory mechanisms that commit cells to
defined fates during early stages of embryogenesis. Early in development, commitment of the epiblast to germ
layers is followed by activation of key regulatory genes that drive lineage fate. These genes control normal
development and underlie the genetic basis for a broad range of human structural birth defects. We have studied
members of the TET family of hydroxylation enzymes, which regulate the demethylation of DNA, or block active
methylation of DNA, to control gene expression. We discovered requirements for TET enzymes during early
development in the zebrafish model, and for progenitor specification from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).
Major gaps in understanding include: i) whether common or distinct mechanisms control demethylation for
progenitors from different germ layers, ii) whether different TET family members distinguish developmental
programs, and iii) how TETs are targeted to regulatory regions such as bivalent promoters. Suspecting that
additional proteins beyond TETs are needed to target DNA demethylation, we carried out a genome-wide
CRISPR screen and discovered QSER1, a previously uncharacterized chromatin-binding protein. We showed
that QSER1 is a key guardian of bivalent promoters and poised enhancers of developmental genes, especially
those residing in DNA methylation valleys, broadly across different cell fates. We found biochemical and genetic
interactions between QSER1 and TETs, suggesting that they cooperate to safeguard transcriptional and
developmental programs from methylation. QSER1 variant alleles were recently linked to coronary artery
disease, while haploinsufficiency of a QSER1 paralog, PRR12, is associated with multi-organ developmental
birth defect syndromes. We propose to fully explore the genetic relationships and downstream networks of
TET/QSER1 (TQ) family members, including how they function to control methylation and impact chromatin
structure in the context of two complementary model systems, zebrafish and hESCs. The zebrafish model allows
full genetic analysis of potentially compensatory or cooperating family members (including tet1, tet2, tet3, qser1,
and prr12), in an animal model with highly conserved developmental programs. The hESC model provides
outstanding biochemical and “omics” capacity, and validation in developing human progenitor and differentiated
cells. The multi-PI project represents a continued collaboration among investigators with complementary and
overlapping expertise, with a strong record of productivity. Specific Aims are proposed to determine the relative
contribution of these genes for directing early progenitor fate, discover the regulatory networks in which they
function, and to test interacting factors as candidates for linking TQ methylation control to chromatin modification.
Because regulation of methylation is a fundamental step of progenitor fate determination, our results will be
broadly relevant to organogenesis and structural birth defects."
10898818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The central process of female reproduction is the formation of oocytes within the developing ovary, known as
oogenesis. This process is crucial for the formation of healthy oocytes and proper transmission of genetic and
epigenetic information to begin embryonic development. Abnormalities in ovarian development and oogenesis
are a leading cause of female infertility and disorders of sexual development, and furthermore are the cause of
many developmental disorders in the subsequent generation, such as Down syndrome and Angelman syndrome.
However, relatively little is known about the genetic regulation of human ovarian development. This is in
contrast to other organisms such as the mouse, where transgenic and knockout lines, and a short
reproductive cycle, have allowed much research in this area. An in vitro organoid model of human ovarian
development would help fill this gap, and enable an improved understanding of human ovarian
development that could lead to treatments for infertility and prevention of developmental disorders.
Ovarian development involves interactions between primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells (granulosa
cells). The granulosa cells enclose the PGCs within ovarian follicles, and support their differentiation into
oogonia, progression through meiosis, and development as oocytes. Therefore, both lineages will be required
to model this process in vitro. Existing methods allow differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
into PGC-like cells, but these cells are in an immature state, retaining epigenetic characteristics of iPSCs. For
an in vitro model of oogenesis to be successful, improved methods must be developed to generate mature
germline cells and granulosa cells from iPSCs.
Reprogramming of cellular identity by expression of transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful technique that can
allow both reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs, and directed differentiation of iPSCs to specific cell
types. The Church lab has recently developed computational tools to predict TFs that specify cell identity, as
well as screening methods for combinatorial TF expression to find sets that can differentiate iPSCs to a cell
type of interest. The currently proposed research will identify TFs that can promote maturation of PGC-
like cells and produce granulosa cells from iPSCs. Results will be evaluated by single-cell
transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling, and by functional validation of key phenotypes. This research will
provide an improved understanding of the genetic regulation of ovarian development, leading to an in vitro
model of human oogenesis."

 With a rapidly increasing population of aging Americans, cognitive impairment associated with
normative aging, or neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease and other related dementias
(ADOD), will place increasing burden on our public health infrastructure. Unfortunately, few effective
screening tools or therapeutic strategies exist, and many patients are refractory to treatment. Recent studies
suggest that altered neuroinflammatory signaling may play an important early role in normative aging, and
in ADOD, but the mechanisms by which the complex interaction of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways
change over the lifespan, or modulate cognition, are unclear. For this reason, studies using animal models
that closely recapitulate normative human aging, but on a shorter timescale, are desperately needed to test
the overall hypothesis that rising levels neuroinflammation occurs prior to neurodegeneration and age-
related cognitive impairment, and represent a potential early marker. To address this need, the central goal
of my project will be to query the relationship between markers of neuroinflammation with brain morphology
and microstructure, and cognition, in naturally-occurring rhesus macaque model of age-related cognitive
impairment. I will use a combination of ultra-sensitive cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarker assays,
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of activated astrocytes and microglia, high-resolution
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain morphology and microstructure, and cognitive assessment for
spatial working memory. The strength of these studies lies in their potential to characterize novel biomarkers
of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways that are associated with memory impairment, and
to identify new potential biomarkers that can serve as screening tools and future therapeutic targets."
10903496,"SUMMARY
African American (AA) men have twice the risk of aggressive lethal prostate cancer (PCa) and are diagnosed
younger than white men. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate an increased risk of aggressive PCa with vitamin
D deficiency. AA men tend to be deficient in vitamin D because melanin absorbs UV radiation, reducing sunlight-
induced cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. Mounting evidence from my lab demonstrates that vitamin D deficiency
alters the hormone levels of the prostate, which may contribute to the disparity of PCa observed in AA men. Our
recent publications and preliminary data show that vitamin D status regulates prostate dihydrotestosterone
levels, which connects these two disparities and provides a mechanism by which vitamin D affects PCa
aggressiveness. We further implicate megalin as mediating the effect of vitamin D on prostate androgens.
Our long-term goal is to thoroughly examine the relationship between vitamin D and androgen hormones
systemically and how that may vary by ancestry. Here, we propose to examine megalin as a critical protein
involved in prostate hormone regulation. The project includes three complementary, yet independent aims and
the approach combines analysis of patient-derived models and mouse studies with clinical samples from AA and
white men for megalin. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency leads to increased
prostatic androgens in African American men via megalin, resulting in an increased risk of aggressive PCa.
In contrast to serum levels, there is a paucity of information regarding regulation of intra-tissue levels of
hormones. Given that megalin regulates prostate T levels AND that megalin is regulated by vitamin D, further
understanding this mechanism will provide crucial new insight into the consequences of vitamin D deficiency
which may underpin PCa disparities in African American men. New insight that directly links vitamin D status to
prostate androgens has the potential to move the needle for general practitioners who would then take vitamin
D deficiency seriously for African American patients. Our findings may lead to increased screening for and
treatment of vitamin D deficiency, ultimately decreasing the burden of aggressive and lethal PCa in African
American men."
10904317,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumor responsible for > 30,000 deaths
annually in the US. SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% with no approved targeted therapies beyond
recently-approved immunotherapy. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidly develops
resistance leading to mortality in ~12 months. A major unmet need for SCLC treatment is the identification of
new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. SCLC has historically been treated as a single disease without
patient stratification based on molecular information. We and others recently identified distinct SCLC molecular
subtypes based on expression of lineage-related oncogenic transcription factors: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3
and more controversially, YAP1. MYCL oncogene is associated with the most common ASCL1 group (~70% of
SCLC), while MYC is overexpressed in the NEUROD1/POU2F3/YAP1 subtypes (~30% of SCLC). Importantly,
we and others found that MYC-driven SCLC has unique therapeutic vulnerabilities compared to MYCL-driven
SCLC. MYC has the capacity to drive SCLC subtype plasticity, promoting ASCL1+ tumors to a NEUROD1+ and
then a YAP1+ state. MYC-induced Notch pathway activation is critical for SCLC subtype plasticity. While ASCL1
has been frequently studied, much less is known about the 2nd-most common NEUROD1+-subtype. We
hypothesize that NEUROD1 expression denotes a neuronal transcriptional state of SCLC, that NEUROD1-
mediated repression of Notch signaling is critical for this tumor cell state, and that the NEUROD1+ state has
unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. We further predict that NEUROD1 inhibition will shift tumors to
developmentally predictable non-neuroendocrine cell fates. Our objective is to determine the function of
NEUROD1 in the NEUROD1+ subtype of SCLC, to identify mechanisms that regulate subtype plasticity, and
uncover the relationship between NEUROD1 and Notch signaling. Toward this end, we created the first mouse
model of NEUROD1+ SCLC and generated mice with conditional Neurod1 loss to study its function in vivo.
Preliminary data have identified highly conserved NEUROD1 target genes. Large-scale CRISPR-based genetic
screens have identified predicted dependencies that have the potential for therapeutic targeting. Our hypotheses
will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Determine the function of NEUROD1 in MYC-driven SCLC cell fate. 2)
Determine the mechanistic relationship between NEUROD1 and Notch signaling in SCLC subtype plasticity. Our
approach is innovative because we will employ novel immune-competent GEMMs of MYC-driven SCLC, ~17
new human PDX, and single cell data from primary human SCLC. We will use state-of-the-art technologies in
single cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing in new organoid models coupled with our ChIP-seq data to
comprehensively determine the role of NEUROD1 in SCLC. This research is significant because these findings
will lead to a better understanding of SCLC molecular subtypes and ultimately facilitate tailored SCLC treatment."

(1) to improve the quality and scope of his mentoring by engaging in didactic and peer-led workshops; (2) to
expand his research program to include `-omic' science; and (3) to develop expertise in analysis of high-

will enable Dr Shah to pursue didactic and peer-led training in mentoring, to expand his mentoring activities,
and to engage in coursework and `hands-on' training in `-omic' science. Funds from the K24 will support
expansion of his research program into translational proteomics and genomics, including computational
biology support. HFpEF is common, morbid, and increasing in prevalence, but no efficacious disease-specific
therapy currently exists. While LV dysfunction underlying HFpEF is an intense focus of investigation, little is
known regarding biological pathways promoting the preservation of cardiac function in the face of detrimental
co-morbidities (cardiac resilience). This is a critical missed opportunity to develop interventions promoting
normal cardiac function to prevent HF. The specific scientific aims of this proposal are to define circulating
individual proteins and protein networks that (1) positively and negatively correlate with exercise-
hemodynamic perturbations characteristic of HFpEF; (2) associate with cardiac resilience in late life; and (3)
are most likely to be mediators of cardiac resilience based on studies using genomic data. Aim 1 will occur in
patients prospectively enrolled at BWH to undergo invasive exercise testing. Aims 2 and 3 will be performed in
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, with replication in the Jackson Heart Study. Synthesizing
these `-omic' approaches with his existing research program will uniquely position Dr Shah to vertically
advance understanding of HFpEF pathobiology, while enriching training opportunities in POR for his mentees."
10903318,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common presenile dementia after Alzheimer’s disease and
shares many pathological and genetic overlaps with ALS. The most common genetic cause of FTD and ALS is
a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene. Although RNA toxicity
and C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may also contribute to disease pathogenesis in C9ORF72-related FTD/ALS,
much efforts has focused on investigating the toxicity of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that can be translated
from both sense and antisense repeat RNAs. How these DPR proteins, especially poly(GR), cause
neurodegeneration at the molecular mechanistic level remains largely unknown. In this exploratory R21 grant
application, based on our recent findings that several antimicrobial peptide genes, such as metchnikowin (Mtk),
are upregulated with poly(GR) toxicity in Drosophila and that Mtk knockdown in the eye or in all neurons
suppresses poly(GR) neurotoxicity, we propose to further investigate this understudied pathway in
neurodegeneration. In particular, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Mtk on
poly(GR) toxicity, explore the non-cell autonomous neurodegenerative activity of Mtk, and finally attempt to
identify mammalian AMP(s) that may function in a similar fashion as Drosophila Mtk in the molecular
pathogenesis of FTD/ALS. These studiers will shed new light on pathogenic mechanisms of FTD/ALS and may

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has been rising in incidence
in the US and worldwide over the last four decades, particularly among young men. People with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased HPV-OPSCC risk as compared to HIV-negative individuals.
However, we have a very poor understanding of the mechanisms of persistent oral HPV infections and their
synergy with HIV co-infection, as well as the role of HIV in HPV-OPSCC induction and pathogenesis. The inability
to histologically characterize the early stages of HPV-induced OP tumorigenesis continues to hinder efforts to
diagnose OP precancerous lesions and assess cancer risk. Currently, there is no animal model for HPV-induced
oral infections and malignancies in the context of HIV-induced immunosuppression. In previous collaborative
efforts, the Ozbun and Traina-Dorge labs have successfully modeled cervical HPV infections and neoplasia in
female rhesus macaques (RMs) using Macca mulatta papillomavirus type 1 (MmPV1), a close relative of HPV16,
which causes 90-97% of HPV-OPSCC. In this R21 proposal, we will build on our prior work and collective
expertise with MmPV1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and non-human primate immunology to establish
a Rhesus macaque model of persistent oral HPV and HIV co-infection with which to study oral MmPV1 infections,
persistence, precancer, and OPSCC induction. This model is innovative and advantageous because both
MmPV1 and SIV recapitulate their respective infections and pathogenesis in RMs like their human counterparts:
MmPV1 is carcinogenic in its natural RM host, and these animals develop immunosuppression following SIV
infection. As HPV-OPSCCs are more common in males, we will expose immunosuppressed SIV-infected male
RMs to high-titer infectious MmPV1 virions in the tongue base, the palatine tonsil, and the soft palate. In AIM 1,
we will determine the oral infectivity and persistence of MmPV1 virions in SIV-infected and immunosuppressed
RMs. At timed intervals and in post-mortem tissues, we will assess MmPV1 viral loads and DNA persistence at
the sites of infection, and we will screen for localized viral shedding, preneoplastic oropharyngeal MmPV1
lesions, and disease progression. We will also measure circulating tumor MmPV1 DNA over time as a potential
biomarker of the onset of preneoplasia and/or OPSCC. In AIM 2, we will evaluate SIV- and MmPV1-induced
changes in RM biospecimens. At timed intervals, we will quantify plasma and saliva cytokine/chemokine levels
by Mesoscale immunoassays and assess HPV-disease-associated markers in cytobrush exfoliated OP cells and
endpoint post-mortem tissues by immunohistochemistry. These assays will identify biological pathways altered
by both viruses and determine potential disease correlates. Establishing a non-human primate model for OP PV
infections and precancers will facilitate expanded follow-up studies aimed at revealing mechanisms of MmPV1
infection, persistence, and progression from precancer to malignancy in the context of SIV-induced
immunosuppression; it will also promote efforts to diagnose and treat OP precancers."

10894794,"During the first 3.5 years of this R37 cycle, Novel Methods to Inform HIV/TB Clinical Trial Development
 has used decision science methodologies, focusing on value of information, and demonstrated
 outstanding productivity, methods expansion, trainee development, policy impact, and international
 collaboration. As we complete this cycle and look forward to the subsequent one, we will continue to
 develop and utilize novel VOI methods, applying them to ongoing and new international trial activities with
 the following specific aims:
1) To calculate the expected value of sample information (ESVI) using generalized additive models
(GAMs) within the Monte Carlo simulation of the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications
(CEPAC) model.
2) To expand upon the methods developed in Aim 1 to inform new clinical trial design, post-trial
evaluation, and priority setting in the areas of HIV and TB in South Africa, focusing on newly reported and
potential high-impact trials. We will focus on three areas:
i. Antiretroviral Treatment Strategies
ii. Vaccines and Antibody-Mediated Prevention
iii. Novel Tuberculosis Diagnostic, Treatment, and Vaccination Strategies
We anticipate continued major productivity in the next R37 cycle, informing decision makers on efficient
use of resources both in the implementation of trial results once already performed and in the conduct of
those being designed.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 HIV and TB remain high among the top ten causes of death in low-income countries. Given the budgetary
 constraints to conduct the array of ongoing and potential clinical trials, we have developed a Value of
 Information (VOI) framework to assess a priori which trials might provide the best value, formally
 comparing courses of action with and without new information – as might be obtained from a trial – to
 quantify the value of information acquisition, accounting for both the trial benefits and costs."

This proposal seeks support for the 25th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Bacterial Cell Surfaces, which
will be held on June 23-28, 2024, at Mount Snow Resort (West Dover, VT) and will have an associated Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS). The GRS, which is organized by and for graduate students and postdocs, will be on
June 22-23, 2024, at Mount Snow. The GRC on Bacterial Cell Surfaces is unique among envelope-related
conferences because it connects cutting-edge research on bacterial envelope biology to the medically important
downstream consequences of the bacterial surface including infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and
microbiome-host interactions. The conference will feature the latest, largely unpublished, and most impactful
research highlighting how the bacterial surface influences and can be targeted to promote human health. It will
include a diversity of topics, model systems, and approaches combining biochemistry, genetics, structural
biology, cell biology, biophysics, imaging, and modeling. The oral program will contain 9 sessions: (1) Envelope
Macromolecular Machines; (2) Cell Division and Morphogenesis; (3) Sensing through the Cell Envelope; (4)
Coordinating and Balancing Cell Envelope Biogenesis; (5) Modification and Evolution of the Bacterial Envelope;
(6) Maintenance of the Cell Envelope; (7) Targeting the Cell Envelope with Antimicrobials; (8) Interplay between
the Bacterial Envelope and Communities; and (9) Envelope-dependent Behaviors. These topics will provide a
platform for the development of antibacterial strategies, vaccine development, and studies of host-microbe
interactions. They are of great interest to researchers conducting basic and translational research and to the
mission of the NIH. In addition, the conference will include 4 poster sessions. We have selected a group of
leading expert scientists, including several rising junior researchers, as speakers and discussion leaders. This
group was selected by considering expertise and demographics. To provide a collegial atmosphere and foment
interactions between junior and established scientists and inclusivity, we will also feature many short talks from
junior scientists, facilitate roundtable discussions for junior scientists to engage with leaders of academia and
pharmaceutical industries, and host a GRC Power Hour to examine issues of inclusion and diversity. To integrate
the GRS and GRC, the GRS co-chairs will present a summary of their meeting at the GRC opening session and
two of the short talks featured in the GRC will be selected by GRS participants through voting. Furthermore, the
format of GRC meetings, with programmed discussion sessions and opportunities for informal gatherings in the
afternoons and evenings, conveys a collegial atmosphere that facilitates interactions between attendees of all
career stages and promotes networking and future collaborations. By bringing together researchers investigating
both basic science and its downstream impact on human health, this GRC will facilitate the generation of the
knowledge, new ideas and approaches, and interactions that are essential to fight infectious diseases and
antimicrobial resistance, and to understand the interdependence of host and its microbiota."

Apicomplexan parasites contribute significantly to the human disease burden, including Plasmodium spp.
infection causing ~400,000 deaths per year, and Toxoplasma gondii permanently infecting about ~1/3 of the
human populations. Existing treatments are limited, which fuels studies that aim to uncover new vulnerable
processes to control such infections. Our project investigates the core survival mechanism that controls parasite
division taking place in its host, the cell cycle. Apicomplexan cell division differs vastly from that of their host
cells, and represent a remarkably versatile, novel, and poorly understood biological process. Some
apicomplexan species replicate their genome once per division cycle (binary division) and produce two progeny,
while the majority of species instead replicate their genome multiple times (multinuclear division) and produce
thousands of daughter cells in a single round of division. The variety of replication modes, dearth of conserved
conventional regulators, and the complexity of internal structures have hindered the progress of apicomplexan
cell cycle studies. Our project is built on an innovative concept of apicomplexan cell cycle organization, where
instead of following the traditional G1-S-G2-M/C sequence, the G1 phase of T. gondii cell cycle is followed by a
composite S/G2/M/C cell cycle phase that lacks clear phase transitions. The new view of apicomplexan cell cycle
may explain why, until now, the apicomplexan G2 phase was considered missing, why tachyzoites require
multiple cell cycle Cdk-related kinases (Crks) and why the complete sequence of cell cycle events had never
been established. Our main hypothesis is that parasite-specific Crk-Cyclin complexes engage novel protein
networks to coordinate spatially segregated, but concurrent events during an overlap of G2 phase, mitosis, and
budding. We will examine how T. gondii controls progression throughout this composite cell cycle phase while
maintaining the overall order of cell cycle events. To elevate the studies of apicomplexan cell cycles, we have
designed new tools: a ToxoFUCCISC cell cycle probe, and two checkpoint synchronization models. To test our
hypothesis, we will characterize the protein networks acting in G2 (Aim 1) and at the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC) (Aim 2) and explore each checkpoint mechanism in detail. Using our new checkpoint-based
synchronization approach, we will perform global profiling of the entry (TgCrk4-Cyc4-regulated G2/M) and exit
from mitosis (TgCrk6-Cyc1-regulated SAC) to generate the landscape of the composite S/G2/M/C cell cycle
period (Aim 3). Our study will address outstanding questions of apicomplexan parasite biology regarding how
parasites regulate their amplification in host cells. Our results will have an impact on studies across the
Apicomplexa phylum and lay the groundwork to uncover the cell cycle strategies that produce multiple progenies
per cycle (e.g., Plasmodium spp. and Cryptosporidium spp.)."
10903637,"Project Summary/Abstract
Male infertility is a highly prevalent condition, impacting ~7% of men. However, clinical management is complex,
as roughly half of male infertility cases are idiopathic. Furthermore, a diagnosis of male infertility has health
ramifications even beyond an affected individual’s reproductive health. Epidemiologic studies associate infertile
men and their families with poor somatic health, including increased risks for testicular cancer, prostate cancer,
cardiovascular disease, congenital abnormalities, and reduced lifespans.
To explain these associations, my Co-Sponsor, Dr. Aston, found significant overlap in DNA repair genes involved
in male infertility and human cancers. Additionally, our lab found that fertile men in the top quartile of age-adjusted
germline mutation rates died five years earlier than men in the lowest quartile. When translating these findings
to infertile men, mutation accumulation in the germline may be connected to deleterious somatic mutagenesis in
the same infertile male, potentially resulting in reduced fertility and poor somatic health, respectively.
Currently, the exact mechanisms underlying impaired spermatogenesis in infertile men are poorly understood.
For example, while DNA fragmentation and aneuploidy rates have extensively been studied in the sperm of fertile
and infertile men, the relationship between male infertility and germline de novo mutagenesis, or the
accumulation of spontaneous single nucleotide alterations in a male’s spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) lineage,
has been ignored. Additionally, it is unknown whether reduced sperm production in infertile men is related to an
abnormal SSC composition or distribution of SSC states. Given these knowledge gaps, there exists a critical
need to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape directly in the sperm of fertile and infertile men,
as such analyses may illuminate key biological and mutagenic processes involved in male infertility.
This project will use duplex sequencing to explore connections between genome hypermutation, male infertility,
and poor health. Specifically, I will investigate whether infertile, oligozoospermic men harbor elevated degrees
of germline and somatic mutagenesis relative to fertile, normozoospermic men. Aim 1 will examine germline
mutation rates from the bulk sperm of normozoospermic men, including samples collected from the same
individual spanning multiple decades. Aim 2 will determine if infertile men exhibit increased rates of germline
mutagenesis compared to age-matched normozoospermic men. Finally, Aim 3 will test whether oligozoospermic
men harbor elevated somatic mutation rates compared to fertile controls. Completing these aims will establish
germline and somatic mutagenesis as hallmark genetic features of male infertility. Furthermore, novel insights
gained from this analysis will inform future investigations into upstream biological and cellular processes
contributing to genome hypermutation, impaired spermatogenesis, and associated somatic comorbidities."

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer death in the United
States. One of the primary pathological features of PDA is the dense network of fibrillar collagens
(COLs), including COL1 and COL11, both of which have been shown to be associated with PDA
progression. Collagens signal via specific receptors on the surface of PDA cells, of which the Discoidin
Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) is a unique collagen receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). We have found that
ablation of DDR1 inhibits disease progression and metastasis whereas overexpression enhances these
processes in mouse models of PDA, suggesting that DDR1 is a major promoter of malignancy. The
signaling networks activated by DDR in response to COLs remain elusive. Using an innovative
approach to simultaneously map the phospho-catalytic profile of multiple kinases in cells or tissues we
discovered that tumor xenografts of PDA cells expressing DDR1 embedded within in a COL1 scaffold
display a unique profile of activated kinases, which represent new DDR1-initiated signaling pathways
revealing potentially druggable vulnerabilities to target these highly fibrotic tumors. We have also found
that COL5 and COL11, fibrillar collagens associated with poor outcome in PDA, actives DDR1 to an
almost 20-fold greater level that COL1, its most commonly examine ligand. In this proposal, we will
focus on how 1) the COL11/DDR1 signaling axis promotes PDA metastasis in vitro and in vivo 2) how
distinct COLs differentially activate DDR1 3) identify druggable vulnerabilities associated with COL5/11-
DDR1 signaling to develop for future treatments of these highly fibrotic tumors."

The goal of this renewal of our successful R25 program is to continue to increase the numbers of
underrepresented minorities (URMs) pursuing careers in cardiovascular medical research by providing URM
undergraduate students with a short-term mentored research experience in the laboratories of members of
Stanford School of Medicine’s Cardiovascular Institute (CVI). We propose continuing the success of our existing
R25 program, which was already extremely effective in its first cycle. Our program recruited 65 students from
underrepresented backgrounds, all of whom intend pursue careers in cardiovascular research and medicine.
Additionally, pre- and post-program evaluations showed that our R25 trainees experienced significant gains in
their skills and confidence in performing research.
Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of death and disability in the US, However, these diseases do not
affect all US subpopulations equally. Underrepresented minorities such as African Americans and
Latino/Hispanic Americans experience a significantly higher risk of death or disability from heart disease or
stroke. These groups, which constitute a growing fraction of the total US population, have historically been
medically underserved by both medical clinics and medical research. Due to problems with both the recruitment
and retention, African Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans and Native Americans are significantly
underrepresented in the cardiovascular research workforce. In terms of cardiovascular research, minority
researchers are more likely to focus on and be aware of environmental, genetic, and behavioral variations
between groups that can affect diagnosis and treatment. It has been shown that participation in mentored
research increases the degree to which URM students identify as scientists and persist in academic and medical
research career. However, because there are more undergraduates seeking research experiences than there
are available positions, many undergraduate students, particularly URM students, lack the opportunity to perform
independent research in an academic lab. This R25 will continue to: 1) provide undergraduate URM
students with technical training and experience in cardiovascular research; 2) provide URM students
with cardiovascular researcher mentors and role models; and 3) build relationships between Stanford
Medicine and minority-serving institutions. Stanford Medicine in general and the Cardiovascular Institute in
particular are known for excellence in cardiovascular research. The Program Directors and Program Faculty
involved in this R25, many of whom are themselves URMs, have ongoing state-of-the-art research programs
spanning population outcome, clinical and translational, and basic cardiovascular research, and welcome the
opportunity to continue to mentor URM R25 trainees. Together they have the mentoring expertise and the
available resources to continue to support R25 trainees though our successful summer research program."
10904492,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Astrocytes, like neurons, display regional and intra-regional heterogeneity in both function and transcriptional
state. This heterogeneity impacts neighboring neurons, making it imperative to identify on a molecular level what
drives regional specialization of astrocytes. This question is addressed in the cortex, where astrocytes in distinct
cortical layers have distinct transcriptional profiles. The hypothesis that members of the BMP family of secreted
morphogens are responsible for driving layer-specific gene expression is tested. This is based on BMP target
genes such as ID3 being enriched in astrocytes in deep and superficial layers, and the secreted BMP inhibitor
CHRDL1 being enriched in astrocytes in mid to upper layers. This proposal investigates the consequences of
manipulating BMP signaling in astrocytes on establishment of cortical astrocyte heterogeneity and effects on
neurons. Preliminary experiments show that genetic removal of the BMP-transcriptional mediator SMAD4 from
cortical astrocytes throughout development alters their transcriptional profile, assessed through bulk RNA
sequencing. This includes downregulation of BMP-target genes, as well as genes enriched in astrocytes in
specific cortical layers. The goals of Aim 1 are to ask on a single-cell level how BMP signaling impacts astrocyte
state and heterogeneity. To give insight into the spatial impact of removing BMP signaling from astrocytes, single
nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical astrocytes and MERFISH spatial transcriptomics in SMAD4 cKO mice will
be performed, with a prediction that effects will be greatest in deep and superficial layer astrocytes where BMP
signaling is highest. SMAD4 is a downstream mediator of other members of the TGF beta superfamily, so to
determine if effects are specific to the BMP pathway single nucleus RNA sequencing will be performed from
astrocytes lacking the BMP receptor. To ask if production of the secreted BMP antagonist CHRDL1 by astrocytes
in mid to upper layers is responsible for reducing BMP signaling in these cells, single nucleus RNA sequencing
of astrocytes from CHRDL1 cKO mice will be performed. These experiments will determine how BMP signaling
regulates heterogeneous astrocyte transcriptional state, and in Aim 2 the functional impact of these alterations
will be investigated. Preliminary experiments using in vivo TurboID proximity labeling identified a downregulation
of proteins that induce synapse maturation in astrocytes in SMAD4 cKO mice, suggesting removing BMP
signaling makes astrocytes functionally immature. This will be assessed by analyzing astrocyte morphology and
complexity, which is predicted to reflect an immature state. Impact on neurons will be determined by assaying
excitatory and inhibitory neuron synapse number, function and maturation state using electrophysiology and
immunohistochemistry. The prediction is that synapses will be immature in SMAD4 cKO mice, which will be
rescued by delivery of synaptogenic cues that are downregulated in SMAD4 cKO. Determining what drives the
heterogeneity of astrocytes within the cortex is an important unanswered question. This proposal will determine
if BMP signaling is responsible for driving diversity, and the impact this has on the function of cortical circuits."

Over the past decade, dual use of combustible cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has risen
substantially. The evidence is mixed as to whether this use pattern helps dual users quit using combustible
cigarettes. However, there is a clear need to help dual users quit smoking, given that use of combustible
cigarettes is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the US, causing one-third of all cancer
deaths and exacting an enormous financial and personal toll. To date, no published studies have identified
effective pharmacotherapy or counseling interventions to help dual users quit smoking. The goal of the
proposed research is to identify the most effective pharmacotherapy and counseling approaches to help dual
users quit smoking. Specifically, using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), dual users of
combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes (N=500) who are motivated to quit smoking and willing to quit their e-
cigarette use, if asked, will be enrolled in a randomized efficient 2x2x2 factorial clinical trial. Participants will be
randomized to one of two levels of each factor: Pharmacotherapy (Varenicline vs. Nicotine Patch), Counseling
Approach (a Dual Focused Cessation approach in which participants are encouraged to quit their e-cigarette
use as part of their quit attempt vs. a Smoking Focused Cessation approach in which participants are
encouraged to quit smoking and to use their e-cigarettes strategically to replace their cigarettes in service of
harm reduction), and Counseling Intensity (4 vs. 1 session). All participants will complete baseline measures of
demographics, tobacco use history, combustible and e-cigarette dependence, and potential mechanisms.
Participants will use smartphones to complete ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for 2 weeks pre-
target quit date (TQD) and 2 weeks post-TQD; participants will record smoking, vaping, and medication use in
real-time and complete EMAs of potential mechanisms (e.g., craving reduction, self-efficacy) every evening.
Follow-up assessments of combustible and e-cigarette use, as well as potential mechanisms, will occur 4, 8,
12, 18, 26, 39, and 52 weeks post-TQD. Participants will also complete biochemical assays of combustible
tobacco use (carbon monoxide [CO]) and nicotine exposure (urine cotinine) at baseline, one-week pre-TQD,
and 3 months post-TQD. Participants who report 7-day point-prevalence abstinence from smoking at Weeks
26 or 52 will be invited to the laboratory to provide biochemical verification of abstinence (CO<6 ppm) and
provide a urine sample to assay nicotine exposure (cotinine). These data will allow us to identify the best
medication approach as well as the best counseling approach and intensity to help dual users quit smoking."

The neurovasculature plays a key role in homeostasis of the central nervous system. Blood vessels prevent
unwanted molecules from entering the brain while supplying essential nutrients and signaling molecules to meet
the demand of neurons. Specialized brain endothelial cells are the central component of the neurovasculature.
Brain endothelial cells must maintain their own functions while exposed to acute and chronic fluctuations in
circulating molecules from both the brain interstitial fluid and plasma in physiological and pathological states.
Evidence supports that brain endothelial cell dysfunction is a significant pathology in neurodegenerative
disorders and is exacerbated by genetic risk factors. One such factor is APOE genotype, which has long been
linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 is associated with greater cognitive decline
in aging, poorer outcomes following stroke and traumatic brain injury, and is a major genetic risk factor for
Alzheimer's disease. Several studies, including our own, have identified that one-way APOE4 disrupts neurons
via neurovasculature dysfunction. Therefore, fundamental research identifying cellular mechanisms of how
APOE regulates brain endothelial cell function is important. We have recently identified a new concept that brain
endothelial cell APOE plays a key role in regulating neurovascular function. Supported by our published and
preliminary data, our central hypothesis is brain endothelial cell APOE3 protects the neurovasculature to a
greater extent than APOE4 to maintain behavioral function. Successful data will be significant by identifying a
novel cellular mechanism of how APOE impacts brain function."

The meniscus plays a vital role in knee function, but injury is common and healing is limited in adults.
Development of effective regenerative solutions is challenged by our limited understanding of the cellular
mechanisms that regulate meniscus formation, maturation, and maintenance. In the previous funding cycle, we
queried the origins of cell fate and biosynthetic function in the developing meniscus. We found that the
embryonic-to-early postnatal growth period is the most active time frame of meniscus cell specification,
patterning, and regional specialization. We also demonstrated a central role of external mechanical loading and
internal cell mechanosensing in regulating meniscus patterning, growth and matrix organization during this early
developmental phase. Despite these findings, the timing and mechano-epigenetic mechanisms controlling the
early development of meniscus remain unresolved. To address this, in this renewal, we aim to elucidate the roles
of cellular force generation and mechanosensing machinery in the formation of the meniscus during early
development, as well as its maintenance in the adult. Our central hypothesis is that cell generated tension is
essential for meniscus cell inner-to-outer specification and maintenance across the meniscus lifecycle. To test
this hypothesis, we will induce timed ablation of cellular force generating machinery, the non-muscle myosin
(NMII) genes Myh9 and Myh10 (Myh9/10) in meniscus progenitors at key developmental time points, as well as
in the adult meniscus. We will test if this ablation results in aberrant patterning and matrix formation during early
development and if it results in loss of cell phenotype and matrix degeneration in adults. Specifically, Aim 1 will
determine the role of acto-myosin contractility in the specification and development of the embryonic meniscus.
We will test if early ablation of Myh9/10 in the murine embryonic meniscus results in aberrant patterning, and if
later ablation leads to insufficient matrix elaboration and impaired maturation. Aim 2 will establish the mechano-
epigenetic basis of contractility-mediated regional specification within the embryonic meniscus. Single cell RNA-
seq will be applied to evaluate phenotypic heterogeneity at key time points. We will also apply ATAC-seq to
determine if ablation of contractility and/or Myh9/10 decreases the accessibility at fibrous matrix genomic loci
and increases the accessibility at chondrogenic/remodeling loci in porcine meniscus progenitors cultured in vitro.
Aim 3 will determine if loss of cellular force generation and mechanosensing machinery in the adult instigates
meniscus degeneration. We will test the effect of Myh9/10 ablation in adult mice by evaluating meniscus cell
mechanosensing, fate, matrix production and mechanical properties, and assess how adult porcine and human
meniscus cells shift their phenotype upon the loss of tension in vitro. We expect the outcomes to generate novel
data defining the mechanobiologic basis of cell fate determination, matrix specialization in the developing
meniscus, and postnatal maintenance, providing new insight to direct regenerative strategies in adults."

Relapsed pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is often refractory to conventional therapy and
is associated with a dismal survival rate of less than 25%. Thus, the development of novel therapies for relapsed
T-ALL represents an urgent unmet medical need in children. Relapsed/refractory T-ALL is often enriched with
leukemia initiating cells (LICs), which exhibit enhanced survival and self-renewal capacity. Our long-term goal is
to identify new targets for development of less toxic and more effective therapies by eliminating this cell
population. We discovered that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) activation is required LIC
maintenance by directing cell-type-specific gene programs to prevent interferon activation and aberrant double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing. Approximately 70% of T-ALL patients exhibit high expression of ADAR1, and
this is associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome. Strikingly, we found that inhibiting ADAR1 impairs
malignant T-ALL progenitor prorogation. These data suggest that ADAR1 has a fundamental role in LIC self-
renewal and therapeutic resistance in T-ALL. The overall objective of this study is to dissect the mechanism
through which ADAR1 and RNA editing promote LIC self-renewal in T-ALL patients. Our central hypothesis is
that activation of ADAR1 supports T-ALL LIC maintenance by suppressing aberrant dsRNA sensing in an
isoform-specific manner. We will test this hypothesis in three independent aims: 1) Examine if ADAR1 promotes
LIC self-renewal in relapsed T-ALL by increasing RNA editing, 2) elucidate the molecular mechanism by which
ADAR1 promotes LIC activity, and 3) investigate if NOTCH1 signaling induces ADAR1 activation in T-ALL LIC.
We will directly evaluate the isoform-specific function of ADAR1 p150 and p110 isoforms in LICs within human
thymic organoids and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of T-ALL. We will use single cell RNA-sequencing
to investigate the mechanisms by which p150 and p110 isoforms regulate cellular function and gene expression
in T-ALL LICs. In Aim 2, we will perform concurrent knockdown of dsRNA sensors in combination with ADAR1
isoform knockout in LICs to determine if aberrant dsRNA sensing disrupts LIC activities in patient-derived
xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, we will map dsRNA-containing genes suppressed by either RNA
editing or dsRNA activity of ADAR1. In Aim 3, we will use g-secretase inhibitor (GSI) and DDL1-expressing thymic
co-culture system to examine if NOTCH signaling contributes to ADAR1 activation, and if ectopic expression of
ADAR1 can bypass the need for NOTCH signaling and induces resistance to GSI inhibition. Lastly, we will
investigate if ADAR1 is a direct transcriptional target of NOTCH1. These studies will improve our understanding
of how dysregulation of ADAR1 contributes to LIC self-renewal and T-ALL progression. Furthermore, these
studies will expand our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying LICs-driven malignancies and
may be broadly applicable to other cancer stem cell-driven malignancies."

Mast cells are essential cellular effectors of a number of allergic and non-allergic diseases and conditions,
ranging from anaphylaxis to pseudoallergic drug responses and chronic spontaneous urticaria to systemic
mastocytosis. Therapeutic options for human mast cell-driven diseases and conditions generally focus on
ameliorating symptoms rather than disease modification or cure, and many remain incompletely effective. In
addition, because a number of different receptors may induce deleterious mast cell activation, a broadly
applicable inhibitory strategy would offer far-reaching clinical benefits.
Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-6, a member of a receptor family characterized by binding
to glycan chains that terminate with sialic acid, is highly, uniformly, and selectively present on human mast cell
populations. Many Siglecs, including Siglec-6, possess cytoplasmic ITIMs and ITIM-like motifs and exhibit
inhibitory activity when engaged. Indeed, we have shown that Siglec-6 can reduce mast cell activation through
the IgE receptor, Mrgprx2, and C5aR upon ligation, presumably through the recruitment of inhibitory signaling
proteins like protein tyrosine phosphatases to its cytoplasmic ITIM. Generally, however, ITIM-bearing receptors
usually do not prevent cellular activation without co-associating with the relevant activating receptor. In addition,
the abundant and selective expression of the receptor on human mast cells makes it an ideal target through
which to deliver therapeutic cargo into mast cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to exploit the biology of
Siglec-6 to prevent or treat mast cell-driven diseases or conditions. This concept will be explored in studies
dedicated to understanding the signaling pathways initiated by ligation or co-ligation of Siglec-6 as well as the
functional consequences of Siglec-6 upregulation on mast cells (Aim 1), understanding the endocytic pathway
utilized by Siglec-6 and exploiting this pathway to deliver toxic cargo to malignant or disease-promoting mast
cells (Aim 2), and exploiting Siglec-6 antibody engagement or co-engagement with activating receptors to
prevent or treat harmful mast cell responses (Aim 3). A unique toolkit has been amassed to complete this study,
including primary skin-derived human mast cells, human CD34+ cell-derived mast cells, human mast cell lines
(HMC-1.2, LAD2, and ROSA KITD816V), cell lines transfected with Siglec-6 or mutants lacking an intact ITIM
and/or ITSM, mice engineered to express human Siglec-6 in the mast cell compartment (driven by the Mcpt5 or
Cpa3 promoters), liposomes bearing a neoglycolipid ligand of Siglec-6, and streptavidin complexes bearing anti-
Siglec-6 mAb as well as agents targeted to various activating receptors found on mast cells. Experiments
deploying these unique assets will provide mechanistic insight into the biology, signaling, pharmacology and
immunology of the Siglec-6 receptor as a selective human mast cell target."

Antisynthetase syndrome (ASSD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by myositis and interstitial
lung disease (ILD). A key feature of ASSD is the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthe-
tases (aaRSs), among which histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS or HisRS) causing anti-Jo-1 antibodies is the most
common. aaRSs are the enzymes that attach amino acids to their appropriate tRNA and are thus essential
components of the intracellular translation machinery. Interestingly, some aaRSs are also secreted and function
extracellularly to regulate inflammation and immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which aaRSs are
released from cells, become targets of autoimmunity, and cause symptoms are not well understood. Importantly,
tRNA, a key partner of aaRS, has not been considered at all in the context of ASSD. There is growing evidence
suggesting the involvement of endosomal Toll-like receptor TLR7 and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in sus-
taining and spreading inflammation in the autoimmune disease. The ligands that activate TLR7 are single strand
RNAs (ssRNAs). Therefore, we hypothesize that tRNAs or tRNA fragments bound to aaRSs play critical roles in
the pathogenesis of ASSD. We propose a two-year project to explore the hypothesis using ASSD-relevant cells
and to generate a novel and clinically relevant animal model for mechanistic study and future therapeutic devel-
opment. The results obtained from this study would uncover a previously unrecognized involvement of tRNAs in
the pathogenesis of ASSD and suggest new targets for therapeutic development of the disease."

Few structures in the brain are as prominent, yet poorly understood, as the pulvinar. The pulvinar is both large
and complex, having undergone more expansion with primate evolution than any other thalamic nucleus. Based
on its reciprocal connections with the full extent of the visual hierarchy, from primary visual cortex through
inferotemporal cortex, the pulvinar is strategically positioned to facilitate/mediate the communication of visual
signals between cortical areas. These transthalamic pathways operate in parallel to the direct corticocortical
pathways. The main goal of this research is to understand the functional organization of the separate direct and
transthalamic pathways that cortical areas use to communicate with one another. For this, we use the mouse and
monkey visual systems and study the connections between the primary and secondary visual cortical areas (V1
and V2) in each species. We use optogenetic tools to selectively inhibit one or the other pathway from V1 to V2.
We study the effects of such inhibition on the animals’ ability to perform various visual tasks as well as on
responses to visual stimulation among V2 neurons. A major goal is not only to identify functions for the direct
and transthalamic pathways, but also to compare these among such disparate mammalian models as mice and
monkeys with the hope of generating insights into the functioning of these cortical processes that are common
to mammals. Given the severe financial and quality-of-life consequences that follow from disruption in the ability
of cortical areas to communicate properly with each other, such as occurs with many forms of epilepsy, stroke,
and illnesses affecting vision and thalamocortical function, it is important that we understand how the thalamus
and cortex interact to meet the processing needs of the brain. The proposed study will have a major impact on
our understanding of higher order thalamus, cortical communication, and substrates for disease and
dysfunction."
10899719,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
N-terminal (Nt) acetylation is an understudied aspect of bacteriology. Nt-acetylation is the addition of an acetyl
group to the amino group on the α-carbon of the first amino acid of a protein. The fundamental mechanisms
promoting and regulating Nt-acetylation, and the consequences of this modification in bacteria remain undefined.
The objective of this renewal application is to define the fundamental mechanisms underlying Nt-acetylation in
mycobacteria. The central hypothesis is that protein Nt-acetylation is a dynamic, regulated process that directly
impacts mycobacterial virulence. The central hypothesis will be tested by following these specific aims: 1) Define
the enzymes promoting Nt-acetylation in mycobacteria. 2) Establish the mechanisms and consequences of vir-
ulence factor Nt-acetylation in mycobacteria. 3) Determine the link between Nt-acetylation and mycobacterial
metabolism. Under the first aim, the applicant proposes to use enrichment strategies combined with quantitative
proteomics to determine the function and substrate specificity of conserved mycobacterial NATs. Under the sec-
ond aim, in vitro biochemical assays will be combined with targeted and quantitative proteomics to identify the
NATs that modify essential mycobacterial virulence factors. Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to
define functional relationships between predicted NATs in mycobacteria. Under the third aim, the applicant will
combine enrichment and proteomics approaches to investigate differential Nt-acetylation following growth of
mycobacteria on host-relevant carbon sources. The applicant will use proximity-dependent labeling to identify
potential regulators of NAT activity. The successful completion of this proposal will contribute a fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms promoting Nt-acetylation and establish a link between NATs, Nt-acetylation
and essential mycobacterial virulence pathways. These contributions will be significant because they will ad-
vance our understanding of an understudied protein modification important for mycobacterial virulence, which
may be applicable to other bacterial species. The topic of this proposal is conceptually innovative because Nt
acetylation is an under-investigated protein modification in both areas of tuberculosis research and bacteriology.
Furthermore, studying the regulation of Nt-acetylation by metabolism to identify Nt-acetylation events essential
for mycobacterial virulence is an innovative idea. The proposal is technically innovative because the applicant
combines biochemical screens, enrichment protocols with bioanalytical chemistry, and expertise in molecular
and genetic manipulation of pathogenic mycobacteria. The applicant leverages both M. tuberculosis and M.
marinum strains to optimize productivity. These studies in bacteria will lay a foundation for focused and informed
studies in animal virulence models in the future. By rigorously studying the mechanisms and regulation of Nt-
acetylation in mycobacteria, the applicant may establish new therapeutic targets for treating mycobacterial dis-
ease."
10899978,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL
COEQUaL, the COllaboration for EQuity in Uterine Leiomyomas, builds on longstanding collaborations among
women with uterine fibroids (UF) and multidisciplinary researchers at Mayo Clinic, Fibroid Foundation,
University of Mississippi Medical Center and University of Florida, Jacksonville to place the woman with UF
at the center of this project with the overarching goals to improve outcomes for all women with UF and
eliminate health disparities for Black/African American (BAA) women. Our prior research demonstrates
that most women and significantly more BAA women prioritize uterine sparing treatments, yet hysterectomy
continues to dominate UF care. Thus, this proposal aims to identify affected women earlier, understand and
meet their needs, delineate internal and external barriers to care, optimize communication between women
and a variety of health care providers, and use innovative tools to eliminate barriers to individualized care. Our
longstanding collaboration has pioneered the study of health disparities and UF for over two decades. Our
collaboration with the Fibroid Foundation, the leading UF patient advocacy organization, began at its founding
in 2012 and has been present in the conception and design of this proposal. Three projects are proposed: 1)
Targeted Awareness and Education on Options in Uterine Fibroids 2) Articulating provider and insurer factors
that limit outcomes for all women and disparities for BAA women. 3) Developing Innovative Tools to Overcome
Factors that Limit Outcomes for All Women and Disparities for BAA women. The Community Partnership,
Education and Outreach Core, led by the Founder of the Fibroid Foundation, will represent woman with UF at
every stage and be the authoritative educational source of information about ethical, psychological, scientific,
legislative, and advocacy issues related to uterine fibroids via a weekly briefing summary, alerts, podcasts and
multiple modalities of dissemination and will mentor and train the next generation of policy leaders through a
student internship program. The Administrative Core will provide logistic, communication and scientific support
to all work and train the next generation of academic and lay leaders through selection of pilot projects to bring
diverse early-stage investigators into the field and via succession planning within the collaboration. The
findings of COEQUaL will impact every facet of UF care and will improve experience for all women but
especially focus on the health disparities experienced by BAA women. This work will also change the clinical
paradigm for clinical care by creating tools for women, healthcare providers, and healthcare systems to
empower personalized and evidence-based decision making.

The Yale Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Training Program—directed by Profs. Cynthia Brandt and
Mark Gerstein— with 33 core faculty from 12 departments and five schools, is based in the Yale Center for
Medical Informatics (YCMI) and the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) Program at Yale. The
program and faculty reflect the diversity and depth of Yale’s collaborative Biomedical Informatics research
environment. We continue our training focus on the following informatics and data science areas: 1) health
care/clinical informatics, 2) translational bioinformatics, and 3) clinical research informatics.
This renewal features key enhancements to our training program including (1) an updated curriculum based on
the evaluation and feedback of trainees and faculty, with many new data science, computer science, and
informatics courses; (2) faculty leadership and integration with university science initiatives such as a new
Institute of Data Science with an associated Center for Biomedical Data Science (CBDS) and a new Master of
Science in Health Informatics, all of which have resulted in hiring many additional faculty and provided
opportunities for research collaborations. Predoctoral training is carried out primarily in Yale’s interdepartmental
PhD program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB). This program was inaugurated in 2002 and
has graduated over 56 PhDs many of whom are now leaders in their respective fields. Postdoctoral fellows with
a doctoral degree in the health professions or in an area of science other than informatics will enroll in one of
three research-oriented graduate programs: CBB (study for an MS or PhD), the Clinical Informatics track in the
Master of Health Science (MHS) degree, and the MS in Health Informatics at the Yale School of Public Health.
Postdoctoral trainees who already have a doctoral degree in informatics or a closely related field, may not
require additional training in informatics or data science. The focus of our postdoctoral training involves defining
one or two research projects which can be carried out independently (under faculty supervision) and that will
result in publications and grant applications. The overall goal of our program is to provide all trainees with the
necessary background and experience to pursue productive academic and research careers in Biomedical
Informatics and Data Science. Each year the number and quality of applicants to our programs have grown and
we actively work to increase diversity in Pre and Postdoc trainees and core faculty with growing success. We are
requesting support for 9 predoctoral trainees and 8 postdoctoral trainees (including 2 with HIV focus). We have a
core group of faculty who are well-funded, highly skilled and experienced as mentors and educators. The
Biomedical Informatics and Data Science activities at Yale provide many opportunities for trainees to work on
interdisciplinary projects that use large biomedical data sets and tackle key research questions."
10900741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The molecular basis of gastric cancer (GC) health disparities that Hispanic/Latino (Hs/L) patients face is an
understudied and unmet public health issue. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Hs/L patients with GC are
younger, have twice the disease incidence, and are more likely to develop the more aggressive form of the
disease called diffuse GC. The molecular causes for these disparities are unknown since Hs/L patients have not
been included in previous GC studies. The investigators recently completed the first integrated genomic analysis
of Hs/L GC patients and found that 7 of 43 (16%) Hs/L patients with diffuse GC carried germline CDH1 variants.
Germline CDH1 variants that are pathogenic cause hereditary diffuse GC syndrome (HDGC), which confers up
to an 80% lifetime risk of developing diffuse GC, often at a young age. Thus, Hs/L patients may have a higher
rate of HDGC, which would help explain the unique clinicopathologic characteristics seen in these patients since
HDGC is thought to cause <1% of GC. There is a critical need to define HDGC prevalence in Hs/L patients as
the syndrome may be a cause of GC health disparities. However, determination of the true rate of HDGC is
hampered by two obstacles: 1) current tools are unable to determine if most CDH1 variants are pathogenic or
benign (3 of 7 variants identified in Hs/L patients had uncertain function), and 2) the penetrance of CDH1 variants
is unpredictable. While obesity is associated with being diagnosed with GC, preliminary work by the investigators
shows that obesity may also influence disease penetrance by inducing earlier disease onset. The objective of
this proposal is to identify molecular mechanisms for GC health disparities. The hypothesis is that a higher
prevalence of HDGC and effect modification by obesity contribute to worse outcomes in Hs/L patients with GC
compared to White patients. An innovative translational project that blends clinical epidemiology and
experimental biology will be performed to pursue the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the prevalence of
CDH1 variants and how they associate with genetic ancestry and lifestyle/environmental exposures in Hs/L and
White patients with diffuse GC. Hs/L patients will be enrolled from around the world. Aim 2 will functionally assess
whether discovered CDH1 variants confer pathogenic behavior using both in vitro and in vivo systems. Aim 3
will ascertain the effect of obesity on CDH1 variant penetrance. The project's innovations are: 1) accounting for
the heterogeneity of the Hs/L population, 2) using novel functional methods to ascertain the pathogenicity of
CDH1 variants, and 3) studying obesity as a modifier of GC penetrance. The impact of the expected results
would be the identification of the first known molecular mechanism for GC health disparities. Determining that
obesity augments CDH1 penetrance would open novel lines of inquiry into gene-environment interactions that
drive GC formation. The results could be clinically actionable by informing genetic testing criteria and lifestyle
recommendations that enable the prevention or early detection of diffuse GC in Hs/Ls. Finally, 60% of HDGC
cases have no known cause; the proposed methods can be applied to test other potential HDGC causes."

This is a multi-PI application for an R01 award under PAR-18-513. The proposed project titled
“Combination Anti-Amyloid Therapy in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease” is a multicenter randomized
placebo-controlled two arm clinical trial of a combination anti-amyloid therapy: an anti-fibrillar amyloid
antibody for the initial 18 months combined with BACE inhibition therapy for 4 years, in preclinical AD,
defined as asymptomatic individuals with elevated brain amyloid as determined by florbetapir PET
scanning. The primary outcome will be a cognitive composite (a modified version of the Preclinical
Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite, PACC5), with functional and clinical assessments along with
volumetric MR and tau PET as secondary outcomes (and, in a subset, CSF biomarkers). The specific
Aims of the proposed study are; 1. to evaluate the impact of a combination anti-amyloid regimen on
fibrillar amyloid in brain as indicated by amyloid PET SUVr, 2. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a
combination anti-amyloid regimen in individuals with preclinical AD, and 3. to evaluate the impact of the
combination anti-amyloid regimen on AD biomarkers. Drs. Sperling and Aisen will share responsibility
for scientific oversight of the clinical design and execution of the study and Imaging oversight will be
provided by Dr. Johnson. The ACTC will provide the administrative and operational support, data
capture and data management, clinical monitoring and site management, safety oversight, biostatistical
support, and biomarker sample processing storage and support. Final selection of therapeutic agents
for this trial will be made by a compound selection committee composed of field experts. Committee
membership will include external experts in AD drug development and AD neurobiology, appointed in
concert with NIA. The study team will work collaboratively with the pharmaceutical company
researchers who have clinical experience with these therapeutics in development.
This will be the first study of its kind: a potentially synergistic combination approach to dramatically
reducing amyloid from asymptomatic individuals on the AD spectrum. Combination therapy trials are
increasingly proposed by investigators and regulators to improve the likelihood of success in trials
aiming for disease-modification. This approach could ultimately prevent the onset of AD symptoms"
